Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">We recite the facts as stated in the trial court\u2019s order on the motion to suppress or as supported by the record. On January 14, 2010, Detective Michael Bernard of the Salem Police Department called the defendant and requested that he come to the police station to talk about allegations of sexual abuse that had been made against him. The defendant complied. Once at the police station, the defendant was taken into an interview room where he was joined by Salem Police Detective Mark Donohue and Bernard. Bernard informed the defendant that the interview was being recorded and began reading him his <em>Miranda </em>rights from a standard form. After reading all of the rights provisions, the detective neglected to read the final provision regarding waiver of those rights. That provision stated: \u201cHOWEVER You may waive the right to advice of counsel and your right to remain silent and answer questions or make a statement without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>consulting a lawyer if you so desire.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) Instead, Bernard stated: \u201c[BJasically what this is a waiver that I need you to sign in order for me to talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The defendant asked if he was being arrested, and Donahue replied that he was. The defendant inquired about the charges against him and claimed that he did not know what was going on. He also expressed concern about losing his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Donahue told the defendant that he would have to sign the waiver form if he wished to speak with the detectives. After informing the defendant he was charged with aggravated felonious sexual assault, Bernard stated that he and Donahue wanted to discuss the charges with him \u201cto get [his] side of the story.\u201d Donahue then advised the defendant that if he \u201cwere going to try to help [him]self, this is probably the right time to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The defendant again said he had no idea what the allegations against him were. Bernard stated that the detectives could not \u201creally get into that,\u201d at which point Donahue added \u201cunless you want to talk about it.\u201d Donahue also reminded the defendant, however, that he could \u201cstop at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">After an inquiry about bail, the defendant commented on the gravity of the charge against him. Donahue again stated that it would be a good time for the defendant to \u201chelp [him]self.\u201d The defendant stated he would sign the waiver \u201cfor now\u201d and did so. Bernard asked the defendant if he understood everything that had been read to him, to which the defendant responded, \u2018Yeah.\u201d Bernard also offered that the form could be reread, which the defendant declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because \u201cthe manifest weight of the evidence reflected a reasonable doubt as to whether [he] knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d The defendant invokes his state and federal constitutional rights against self-incrimination. <em>See </em>N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15; U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">Before a statement can be admitted into evidence, the State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was apprised of his or her constitutional rights and that the subsequent waiver was voluntary, knowing and intelligent. On appeal, we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s finding on the issue of waiver unless the manifest weight of the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, is to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>State v. Chrisicos, </em>148 N.H. 546, 548 (2002) (quotations, citation, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The defendant first argues that \u201cit was both coercive and deceptive for the police to tell [him] that they could not provide information about the accusation unless he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d He concedes that the police could have refused to provide information about the allegations against him \u201cwithout regard to whether he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>See Colorado v. Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 576 (1987) (noting that the Supreme Court has never held, and declined to hold in that case, \u201cthat mere silence by law enforcement officials as to the subject matter of an interrogation is \u2018trickery\u2019 sufficient to invalidate a suspect\u2019s waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights\u201d); <em>State v. Jones, </em>125 N.H. 490, 493 (1984) (noting that <em>Miranda </em>\u201cstates no requirement to warn about the specific charges that prompt the questioning\u201d). He argues, however, that what the police could not do was make provision of the information contingent upon his waiver of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The defendant likens his case to <em>State v. Jones, </em>2009 WL 17934 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2009), in which, during a custodial interrogation, the defendant \u201casked numerous times why he was arrested without receiving an answer from the detectives.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>2009 WL 17934, at *1. As one of the detectives began reading the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant invoked his right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>The detective then stated, \u201c \u2018Okay, now, I can\u2019t answer you,\u2019 \u201d and he and the other detective present left the room. <em>Id. </em>They returned shortly and one detective \u201ctold defendant he was being charged with attempted murder, but stated they could not talk to him since he had asked for an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In upholding the suppression of the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements, the <em>Jones </em>court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">It seems clear to us that the strategy employed by the investigators was designed to provoke the response that actually occurred, i.e., defendant became agitated and asked what the case was about. The officers dangled the specter of defendant\u2019s prior invocation of his rights as an impediment to any further information, and recited for a second time the <em>Miranda </em>rights from the form card, this time securing defendant\u2019s answers and signature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\"><em>Id. </em>at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">We do not find <em>Jones </em>as similar as the defendant contends. First, this case does not present the issue of the detectives\u2019 failure to \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d the defendant\u2019s invocation of his rights by reinitiating a conversation with him. <em>Id. </em>at *5. In addition, here, the defendant was informed of the charges against him. The trial court found that the defendant was asked, in Bernard\u2019s initial call to him, to come to the police station to discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>allegations against him of sexual abuse. The court found that he also was told, prior to waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that he was being charged with aggravated felonious sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">What the detectives declined to do, however, was to discuss the allegations any further without first having obtained a signed <em>Miranda </em>waiver. The defendant paints this as coercive, arguing that the detectives \u201ctold [him] that they would provide information about the accusation if and only if he agreed to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights,\u201d despite his repeated expressions of \u201cfrustration that he did not know why he had been arrested.\u201d The record, however, does not bear out this characterization. The videotaped recording of the interview shows that the defendant asked what the charges against him were and Bernard\u2019s response \u2014 though interrupted briefly by the defendant himself \u2014 was that he was charged with aggravated felonious sexual assault. Subsequently, while the detectives were encouraging the defendant to tell his side of the story, he commented \u201cyeah, \u2019cause I have no idea what the allegations are, or what they\u2019re for, or anything like that.\u201d He was not agitated and did not appear to be asking for a response. Bernard deflected the comment, stating they could not \u201creally get into that,\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201c[N]o, I understand.\u201d Donahue then interjected \u201cunless you want to talk about it,\u201d but that was followed by statements from both detectives that the defendant did not have to answer if he did not want to do so and could stop at any time. At no time during the interview was the provision of information about the charges conditioned, in any way that could be characterized as coercive, upon the defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The defendant also argues that it was deceptive for the detectives to tell him that they could not \u201creally get into\u201d the allegations against him \u201cunless [he] want[ed] to talk about it,\u201d because that was a misstatement of the law. He contends that \u201ccontrary to [the detectives\u2019] representation, nothing prohibited the police, even without a <em>Miranda </em>waiver, from providing basic information about the charge, such as the identity of the accuser, in response to [his] requests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We note again that the only request the defendant made \u2014 to be advised of the charges against him \u2014 was satisfied. The defendant did not specifically ask for the name of the accuser or any other information about the charges. Thus, the defendant\u2019s observation that \u201c[c]ourts have held that a police officer\u2019s response to certain inquiries by the defendant does not constitute interrogation,\u201d <em>State v. Spencer, </em>149 N.H. 622, 625 (2003), is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The State contends that it was \u201conly prudent\u201d for the detectives to decline to provide details about the allegations because \u201can officer who reveals details of the accusations against the defendant may be deemed to have effectively interrogated him.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">Interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes occurs where a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent. The functional equivalent of interrogation includes any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em>Spencer, </em>149 N.H. at 625 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In <em>Spencer, </em>we held that it was not the functional equivalent of interrogation for a police officer to show a defendant bank surveillance photographs and tell her \u201c[t]his is your picture,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 623, where the photographs \u201cwere shown in response to the defendant\u2019s apparent confusion over being arrested\u201d and we could not say that the officer \u201cshould have known that showing the defendant the photographs was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626. Notably, however, two members of the court dissented, concluding that showing the photographs to the defendant did constitute interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 629 (Duggan, J., joined by Nadeau, J., dissenting); <em>cf. Com. v. Gaul, </em>912 A.2d 252, 254, 256 (Pa. 2006) (police investigator engaged in functional equivalent of interrogation where, prior to giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a defendant in custody, he read the criminal complaint and affidavit of probable cause to him, prompting an incriminating response). Accordingly, we cannot discount the risks attendant upon officers divulging details of allegations to a defendant without first obtaining a <em>Miranda </em>waiver. Thus, we cannot conclude that it was deceptive for the detectives to say that they could not \u201cget into\u201d the allegations further until a waiver was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The defendant further argues that his waiver was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because the detectives falsely implied leniency. He argues that by repeatedly exhorting him to \u201chelp [him]self,\u201d the detectives \u201cfalsely implied that, by waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights and making a statement, [he] would secure a more lenient resolution.\u201d We disagree. \u201cAn interrogator\u2019s statement to an arrestee to \u2018help yourself out\u2019 is an encouragement to tell the truth and does not constitute an impermissible hope of benefit.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>675 S.E.2d 11, 16 (Ga. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">The defendant also contends that his waiver was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because the detectives \u201crepeatedly spoke of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Miranda </em>waiver as a matter of necessity, as opposed to choice.\u201d He points to statements by the detectives that they \u201cneed[ed]\u201d him to sign the waiver before they could talk to him, or he to them. Such statements, however, were interspersed with those informing the defendant that it was \u201centirely up to [him]\u201d whether to talk, that he did not have to answer if he did not want to, and that he had the \u201cright to stop at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The defendant points to two additional events that he contends cast doubt upon the validity of his waiver. First, he cites Bernard\u2019s statement that \u201c[w]e just need you to acknowledge the right,\u201d and argues that that statement implied that by signing the <em>Miranda </em>form, the defendant was not waiving those rights, but merely acknowledging them. He also contends that the misleading and coercive quality of that statement was exacerbated by Bernard\u2019s failure to read the waiver provision at the end of the <em>Miranda </em>form.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We first note that \u201cthe police need not echo the exact warnings described in <em>Miranda, </em>but must, prior to interrogation, fully apprise a suspect of his rights to remain silent and to have counsel present, and of the State\u2019s intention to use his statements to secure a conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Fecteau, </em>132 N.H. 646, 648-49 (1990). Accordingly, we hold that Bernard\u2019s failure to read the waiver portion of the standard <em>Miranda </em>form does not invalidate the defendant\u2019s waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We are also not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s attempt to analogize his case to <em>State v. Gullick, </em>118 N.H. 912 (1978), in which we observed that the record failed to \u201cdemonstrate that the defendant <em>waived </em>his <em>Miranda </em>rights,\u201d but, rather, \u201conly suggested] that the defendant <em>understood </em>his rights.\u201d <em>Gullick, </em>118 N.H. at 915. In <em>Gullick, </em>the defendant started to sign the <em>Miranda </em>waiver, but stopped and stated he wasn\u2019t sure he should sign it. <em>Id. </em>at 914. He nevertheless talked to the police and the State argued on appeal that his \u201cconduct and willingness to talk to the police after the warning was tantamount to a waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 915. We disagreed. <em>Id. </em>Here, by contrast, the defendant signed the waiver form. Before he did so, Bernard asked if he understood everything that had been read to him. The defendant answered \u201cyeah,\u201d and declined the offer to reread the form. When asked if he had any questions, the defendant responded, \u201c[N]o.\u201d Perhaps most telling, the defendant referred to the form as a \u201cwaiver\u201d and said he would sign it \u201cfor now,\u201d indicating that he understood not only that he was waiving his rights, but that he could reassert them at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Finally, the defendant argues that \u201c[w]hile each of these aspects, standing alone, may not have rendered the waiver invalid, . . . the cumulative effect of the conduct of the police in obtaining the <em>Miranda </em>waiver is that a reasonable doubt exists that the waiver was knowing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>intelligent and voluntary.\u201d Having found each of the defendant\u2019s specific arguments unpersuasive, we also find his cumulative effect argument unpersuasive. <em>Cf. State v. Ellsworth, </em>142 N.H. 710, 721 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">We conclude that the manifest weight of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, is not contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding that the State established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Chrisicos, </em>148 N.H. at 548. Because the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does the State Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see id.; Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 168 (1986) (holding that \u201cthe State need prove <em>[Miranda] </em>waiver only by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d), we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, LYNN and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
