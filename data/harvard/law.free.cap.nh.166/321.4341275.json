Eby and Leonard Willey, appeal orders of the Superior Court <em>(McNamara, </em>J.): (1) granting summary judgment in favor of the State; (2) denying the petitioners\u2019 motions for summary judgment; and (3) dismissing the petitioners\u2019 remaining claims in their putative class action challenge to the constitutionality of the state\u2019s tax on gambling winnings, RSA 77:38-:50 (Supp. 2009) (amended 2010; repealed 2011). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Most of the relevant facts are not in dispute. Effective July 1, 2009, the Legislature imposed a ten percent tax on gambling winnings (Gambling Winnings Tax). Laws 2009,144:249 (codified at RSA 77:38-:50 (Supp. 2009) (repealed 2011)). The legislation defined \u201cgambling winnings\u201d as \u201cwinnings from lotteries and games of chance including, but not limited to bingo, slot machines, keno, poker tournaments, and any other gambling winnings subject to federal income tax withholding.\u201d RSA 77:38, III (Supp. 2010) (repealed 2011). The tax applied to gambling winnings of New Hampshire residents \u201cfrom anywhere derived,\u201d and those of nonresidents \u201cderived from New Hampshire entities.\u201d RSA 77:39,1 (Supp. 2010) (repealed 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">The Gambling Winnings Tax was repealed effective May 23, 2011. Laws 2011, ch. 47. The repeal was not retroactive, meaning that the tax was assessed on gambling winnings between July 1,2009, and May 22,2011. <em>See </em>Laws 2011, 47:3, :4. .</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Willey is a New Hampshire resident who, for the three years preceding the filing of this action, derived almost all of his earned income from gambling. For the 2009 tax year, he owed no federal income tax because his gambling losses exceeded his winnings. Under the Gambling Winnings Tax, he reported gambling winnings of $184,700 for that part of 2009 during which the tax was in effect and paid $18,470 in tax under the statute. All of his winnings during this period were from out-of-state casinos.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">Eby was not an original party to this action, but was added as a substitute party later in the case. He is a New Hampshire resident who, in May 2011, purchased a scratch ticket offered by the New Hampshire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Lottery Commission. Eby won ten dollars on the ticket, and was required to pay one dollar under the Gambling Winnings Tax as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">This class action was filed on May 20, 2010, by putative class representatives Dean T. Leighton and Leighton Family Enterprises, LLC (the Leighton Petitioners),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Willey. The petitioners sought a declaratory judgment that the Gambling Winnings Tax was illegal and unconstitutional on its face, as applied to pre-enactment lottery winners receiving their winnings through annuities, and as applied to professional gamblers, as well as a refund of all such taxes collected or withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The parties agreed that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the case could be decided on the legal issues. They also agreed to postpone class certification until after all legal issues had been resolved. The parties requested, and the trial court approved, an interlocutory transfer without ruling so that the legal issues could be decided by this court. However, we declined to accept the interlocutory transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">On May 19, 2011, the Leighton Petitioners and Willey moved for summary judgment. Before the State\u2019s response and cross-motion for summary judgment was filed, the Leighton Petitioners resolved their claims against the State, after which Eby was added as a party. The trial court denied the petitioners\u2019 motion and granted the State\u2019s cross-motion in part. The court ruled that the Gambling Winnings Tax neither lacked uniformity nor was disproportional, unjust, or unreasonable in violation of the New Hampshire Constitution, and that it did not violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. It also found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Willey was a professional gambler. The trial court set forth factors, including those that the Internal Revenue Service considers when determining whether a taxpayer\u2019s activity constitutes a trade or business for federal tax purposes, <em>see </em>Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(b) (1972), that it intended to consider in deciding whether Willey was a professional gambler.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Thereafter, the petitioners conceded that Willey would not qualify as a professional gambler under the test adopted by the court. They reserved their right to appeal the use of that test and disputed the court\u2019s ruling that only a professional gambler could raise as-applied constitutional arguments on behalf of other professional gamblers as a class representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">In 2012, the declaratory judgment statute was amended so as to provide for expanded \u201ctaxpayer standing\u201d to challenge governmental actions. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Laws 2012, ch. 262; RSA 491:22 (Supp. 2013). Thereafter, the petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the amendment gave them standing to raise all constitutional issues, including those related to professional gamblers. The State objected and moved to dismiss the petitioners\u2019 remaining claims. On December 4, 2012, the court denied the petitioners\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On appeal, the petitioners contend that the trial court erred by granting the State\u2019s motions for summary judgment and to dismiss their claims, and by denying their motions for summary judgment. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings on cross-motions for summary judgment, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party. <em>City of Concord v. State of </em>N.H., 164 N.H. 130, 133 (2012). Where, as here, the parties agree that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute, our task in reviewing the trial court\u2019s summary judgment rulings is to determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>In such circumstances, the analysis for summary judgment purposes is not meaningfully different from that employed in ruling on a motion to dismiss. <em>See Belcher v. Paine, </em>136 N.H. 137, 142-43 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">We review the constitutionality of statutes <em>de novo. N.H. Assoc. of Counties v. State of N.H., </em>158 N.H. 284, 288 (2009). \u201cIn reviewing a constitutional challenge to a legislative act, we presume the act to be constitutional and will not declare it invalid except on inescapable grounds; that is, unless a clear and substantial conflict exists between the act and the constitution.\u201d <em>City of Concord, </em>164 N.H. at 134. \u201cA party may challenge the constitutionality of a statute by asserting a facial challenge, an as-applied challenge, or both.\u201d <em>Huckins v. McSweeney, </em>166 N.H. 176, 179 (2014) (quotation omitted). \u201cA facial challenge is a head-on attack of a legislative judgment, an assertion that the challenged statute violates the Constitution in all, or virtually all, of its applications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cTo prevail on a facial challenge to a statute, the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cAn as-applied challenge, on the other hand, concedes that the statute may be constitutional in many of its applications, but contends that it is not so under the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">We first address the petitioners\u2019 facial challenges to the constitutionality of the Gambling Winnings Tax under the New Hampshire Constitution. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>petitioners allege that: (1) the tax violates the uniformity requirement of the State Constitution; and (2) the tax is disproportional and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The petitioners argue that the Gambling Winnings Tax violated the uniformity requirement of the State Constitution because it taxed gambling winnings at a ten percent rate while interest and dividends are taxed at a five percent rate. They argue that \u201cgambling winnings\u201d and \u201cinterest and dividends\u201d are both part of the broader class of \u201cgross income,\u201d and that in order to achieve constitutional uniformity throughout that class, the taxes had to be assessed at an equal rate. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N.H. 537, 539 (1949) (\u201c[GJross income ... constitutes a class of property taxable under . . . our Constitution . . . subject, however, to the constitutional requirement of proportionality or equality of rate within [that] class.\u201d). They base this assertion on the premise that our previous decisions and advice require that taxes within the separate classes of \u201cgross income\u201d and \u201cnet income\u201d be uniform within each class. We disagree with this premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In general, \u201cthere is no other state in the union with a structure of taxing powers and limits comparable to New Hampshire\u2019s.\u201d Hurn, State <em>Constitutional Limits on New Hampshire\u2019s Taxing Power: Historical Development and Modem State, </em>7 Pierce L. Rev. 251, 252 (2009). We, therefore, begin with a review of this unique constitutional structure, which frames our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u201cThree provisions of the New Hampshire Constitution work in conjunction to ensure the fairness of any scheme of taxation enacted by our legislature.\u201d <em>First Berkshire Bus. Trust v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Dep\u2019t of Revenue Admin., </em>161 N.H. 176, 183 (2010). \u201cThese three constitutional provisions require that taxation be just, uniform, equal, and proportional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184. \u201cA tax must be in proportion to the actual value of the property subject to tax, and it must operate in a reasonable manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">First, Part I, Article 12 establishes that \u201c[e]very member of the community has a right to be protected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property; he is therefore bound to contribute his share in the expense of such protection.\u201d N.H. CONST, pt. 1, art. 12. \u201cThis article requires that a given class of taxable property be taxed at a uniform rate and that taxes must be not merely proportional, but in due proportion, so that each individual\u2019s just share, and no more, shall fall upon him.\u201d <em>First Berkshire, </em>161 N.H. at 183-84 (quotation omitted). Second, Part II, Article 5 authorizes the General Court \u201cto impose and levy proportional and reasonable assessments, rates and taxes, upon all the inhabitants of, and residents within, the . . . state.\u201d N.H. CONST, pt. II, art. 5. \u201cThis section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>requires that all taxes be proportionate and reasonable, equal in valuation and uniform in rate, and just.\u201d <em>First Berkshire, </em>161 N.H. at 184 (quotation omitted). Third, \u201cPart II, Article 6 grants the legislature broad power to declare property to be taxable or non-taxable based upon a classification of the property\u2019s land or use, but not based upon a classification of the property\u2019s owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTogether, Part II, Articles 5 and 6 permit the disproportionality inherent in taxes levied upon classes of property, so long as there is uniformity and proportionality within each class.\u201d <em>N. Country Envtl. Servs. v. State of N.H., </em>157 N.H. 15, 19 (2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> We have previously advised that \u201cgross income\u201d and \u201cnet income\u201d are classes of property that may be taxed at separate rates in conformity with our constitution. <em>See, e.g., Opinion of the Justices, </em>110 N.H. 117, 122 (1970) (\u201cThe Constitution does not require the rate of a tax upon net income to be uniform with that of the existing interest and dividends tax, which is a tax upon certain gross income . . ..\u201d); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>101 N.H. 549, 558 (1958) (stating that \u201cshould the tax contemplated... be levied upon net income, it would be distinguished from [a] tax . . . the essential characteristics of which are those of a gross income tax\u201d); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N.H. at 539 (\u201cA gross income tax does not differ from a net income tax with respect to the constitutional requirements. Either form of income constitutes a class of property taxable under... our Constitution.\u201d). But contrary to the petitioners\u2019 argument, we have not interpreted the Legislature\u2019s \u201cbroad discretionary powers to classify subjects of taxation\u201d to be so limited as to prevent further classification of income for the purposes of taxation. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>117 N.H. 512, 515 (1977). Rather, the question in determining whether a tax classification violates our constitution is whether the classes of property at issue are \u201csufficiently distinguishable\u201d so as to \u201cmake it apparent that there is just reason\u201d to tax them at different rates. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">For example, in 1977 we were asked to determine whether income derived from the sale or exchange of capital assets could constitutionally be taxed at a rate different from the rate of tax imposed on gross income derived from the receipt of certain interest and dividends. <em>Id. </em>at 514. We advised that income from capital gains was sufficiently distinguishable from income from interest and dividends to justify their separate classification and assessment at different rates. <em>Id. </em>at 516. The proposed tax analyzed in that advisory opinion happened to be assessed on <em>net </em>income derived from capital gains, as opposed to the existing tax on <em>gross </em>income derived from interest and dividends. <em>Id. </em>But we based our conclusion that there was a rational basis for the separate classification of these two forms of income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>upon their \u201cvery different characteristics,\u201d not upon the fact that one tax was assessed on net income while the other was assessed on gross income. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The petitioners assert that the trial court misinterpreted that 1977 advisory opinion, and that we later \u201cconfirmed that gross/net income classifications had endured the proliferation of classifications from the 1950s to the 1970s.\u201d In support of this argument, they cite a later advisory opinion in which we wrote that \u201c[g]ross income is a class of property taxable under part two, article six of the New Hampshire Constitution.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>123 N.H. 296, 300 (1983). But as we clarified less than two weeks later, in that 1983 <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>we had advised only that \u201calternate business profits\u201d as taxed in the proposed bill and \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d as taxed under existing law were \u201cboth essentially classifications of one class of property; namely, business income,\u201d and, for that reason, taxing them at different rates violated the uniformity requirement. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>123 N.H. 344, 346 (1983). Our analysis of the proposed bill in our earlier advisory opinion had not focused upon whether it taxed a class of <em>gross </em>income or a class of <em>net </em>income, but rather upon whether it taxed a class of business income at a different rate than another tax on essentially the same class of business income.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The petitioners argue that even if the Legislature can constitutionally classify different kinds of gross income, gambling winnings are not sufficiently distinct from interest and dividends income to justify their separate classification. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u201cStrictly speaking, the rule of equality and proportionality does not apply to the selection of the subjects of taxation, provided just reasons exist for the selection made.\u201d <em>N. Country Envtl. Servs., </em>157 N.H. at 19 (quotation omitted). \u201cIn this context, just reasons are the equivalent of a reasonable or rational basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the trial court found that the Legislature had just reasons to tax gambling winnings at a different rate because gambling \u201cpresents a social problem properly coming under the exercise and jurisdiction of the police power of the State and which requires strict regulation and supervision.\u201d <em>Ratti v. Hinsdale Raceway, </em>109 N.H. 270, 272 (1969). The petitioners argue that this does not constitute a just reason for the separate classification because no indicia exist in the Gambling Winnings Tax\u2019s legislative history to suggest that this was the reason the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>was enacted. Further, they argue, income from gambling winnings is not sufficiently distinct from interest and dividends income so as to justify its separate classification for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The petitioners are correct that the legislative history of the Gambling Winnings Tax does not contain enumerated reasons for its enactment. However, the New Hampshire Constitution requires only that \u201cjust reasons <em>exist\u201d </em>in selecting a certain class of property for taxation. <em>N. Country Envtl. Servs., </em>157 N.H. at 19 (emphasis added; quotation omitted). Under our rational basis test, the \u201clegitimate governmental interests\u201d served by the statute need not be the Legislature\u2019s actual interests in adopting it nor need they be based upon articulated facts. <em>See Cmty. Res. for Justice v. City of Manchester, </em>154 N.H. 748, 757 (2007). Accordingly, the Legislature need not declare its reasons for passing the tax; it is sufficient that there <em>are </em>just reasons for the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u201c[T]he constitutionality of a taxation classification depends upon the physical and functional characteristics of the property itself.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>142 N.H. 102, 107 (1997). The inherent differences between the subjects of taxation and similar property or sources of income justify differing tax treatment. <em>See Smith v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Revenue Admin., </em>141 N.H. 681, 690 (1997) (holding that the inherent differences between banks and other financial institutions constituted just reasons for differing tax treatment); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>117 N.H. at 515 (\u201cThe question is therefore whether capital gains are sufficiently distinguishable from interest and dividends as to make it apparent that there is just reason to tax capital gains at a rate different from the rate imposed... on income derived from certain interests and dividends.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The inherent differences between \u201cwinnings from lotteries and games of chance\u201d and other forms of income justify their separate treatment for tax purposes. Few other legitimate forms of income result from activity that may be referred to as a \u201csocial problem,\u201d as explained by the trial court. Gambling winnings are also unique because they result from \u201clotteries and games of chance,\u201d making their receipt dependent, at least in part, upon events that are largely fortuitous, and they result from activity that is recreational for at least most participants. In comparison, \u201c[i]nterest... is a form of compensation for the use, or forbearance, or detention of money,\u201d while \u201c[d]ividends, such as are taxed pursuant to RSA 77:4,... represent a distribution of the earnings and profits of a corporation, partnership, or other association.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>117 N.H. at 516 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Given the \u201cvery considerable latitude of discretion\u201d left to the Legislature \u201cas to the selection of proper subjects of taxation and the proportion of the tax that shall be laid on each subject,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>141 N.H. at 687, we hold that there were just reasons to classify gambling winnings as a distinct class of income for tax purposes under our constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The petitioners next argue that the Gambling Winnings Tax violated the constitutional requirements of fairness, reasonableness, and proportionality because the tax did not allow taxpayers to offset gambling losses against their winnings. N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 12, pt. II, arts. 5,6. Here, we address this argument to the extent that the petitioners raise it as a facial challenge to the Gambling Winnings Tax.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The federal tax code allows taxpayers to offset gambling losses to the extent of their gambling winnings. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(d) (2012). Several states also allow for setoff of gambling losses against winnings. <em>See, e.g., </em>Minn. Stat. \u00a7 290.01, subd. 19 (2007 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2012). But contrary to the petitioners\u2019 claims, there are states that, at least to some degree, do not allow for the deduction of gambling losses while taxing gambling winnings. <em>See Byrd v. Hamer, </em>943 N.E.2d 115, 121 (Ill. App. Ct. 2011) (describing Illinois tax law, which carries over deduction from federal tax return for gambling losses incurred only by professional gamblers, not casual gamblers); <em>Dettwiler v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, </em>731 N.W.2d 663, 666 (Wis. Ct. App. 2007) (\u201cEffective January 1, 2000, gambling losses were no longer offset against gambling winnings under the Wisconsin tax code . . . .\u201d). Moreover, the petitioners cite no authority suggesting that other jurisdictions would consider it unconstitutional to tax gambling winnings without allowing the deduction of gambling losses. Indeed, considering that \u201cthere is no other state in the union with a structure of taxing powers and limits comparable to New Hampshire\u2019s,\u201d Hurn, <em>supra, </em>comparing a New Hampshire tax provision to similar provisions of states that, for example, implement a broad-based personal income tax is of minimal guidance in showing a constitutional deficiency in the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u201cGross income\u201d is, by definition, simply \u201c[t]otal income . . . before deductions, exemptions, or other tax reductions.\u201d BLACK\u2019S Law DICTIONARY 831 (9th ed. 2009). Thus, in essence, the petitioners\u2019 argument boils down to the question of whether the Legislature may tax gross income, or whether doing so is unconstitutionally unfair, unreasonable, and disproportionate. We have stated on a number of occasions that taxes on gross income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>are proper under the New Hampshire Constitution. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>123 N.H. at 300 (\u201cGross income is a class of property taxable under part two, article six of the New Hampshire Constitution.\u201d); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>110 N.H. at 117 (\u201cNo constitutional barrier stands in the way of the levy of a general income tax ... upon the gross ... income of a taxpayer . . ..\u201d); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N.H. at 539 (\u201c[Gross income] constitutes a class of property taxable under the 1903 amendment to our Constitution.\u201d). By taxing gambling winnings with no deduction for gambling losses, the Legislature simply exercised its discretion to tax the gross gambling income of taxpayers rather than their net gambling income.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The petitioners cite no New Hampshire authority for the specific proposition that a tax on gross income is unfair, unreasonable, and disproportional. They say only that the Gambling Winnings Tax was unconstitutional because it had \u201cno reference to the ability of the taxpayer to make payment,\u201d <em>Thompson v. Kidder, </em>74 N.H. 89, 96 (1906), and because it was not set at an appropriate level to treat \u201cone\u2019s income, to a reasonable amount, ... as necessarily consumed for the support of [oneself] or of [one\u2019s] family, so that only the excess above such amount should be regarded as property increasing [one\u2019s] ability to pay taxes,\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>82 N.H. 561, 572 (1927) (quotation omitted). However, neither premise is applicable here, as both quotations are cited out of context. The quotation from <em>Thompson </em>described poll taxes, which have no relationship at all to the taxpayer\u2019s income. The tax here, assessed as a percentage of the taxpayer\u2019s gambling <em>winnings, </em>by definition was proportional to the amount of winnings, and thus the taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay the tax. <em>Thompson, </em>74 N.H. at 96. The quotation from the 1927 <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>itself quoting a Massachusetts advisory opinion, referred to a proposed income tax exemption of up to $2,000, which would have set aside, in a literal sense, a discrete \u201camount . . . necessarily consumed for the support of\u2019 the taxpayer and his or her family. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>82 N.H. at 572. This description, made in reference to an income tax exemption, is not applicable to the question of whether an income tax assessed on gross rather than net income is unfair, unreasonable, or disproportionate. Certainly nothing in that opinion suggested that such an exemption was <em>necessary </em>in order to render that tax constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Where we have found that a tax was unfair, unreasonable, or disproportionate, the constitutional deficiency has been of a much different character than the one the petitioners allege here. <em>See Claremont School Dist. v. Governor, </em>142 N.H. 462, 470-71 (1997) (holding that property tax was a state tax and was thus disproportionate, unreasonable, and unfair because of discrepancies in tax rates of up to 400% between school districts); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>132 N.H. 777, 783-84 (1990) (stating that proposed statute providing tax credits to business organizations based on number of employees was unreasonable because it provided credits without regard to income or aggregate reasonable compensation expenses, resulting in differing tax rates on the taxation of a single category of property). In sum, we disagree with the petitioners that a tax on gross gambling winnings is inherently \u201cunfair, unreasonable, and disproportional\u201d under our constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We next turn to the petitioners\u2019 argument that the Gambling Winnings Tax violated the Federal Commerce Clause. In particular, they argue that the tax violated the \u201cnegative aspect\u201d of the Commerce Clause \u2014 also referred to as the \u201cdormant Commerce Clause\u201d \u2014 because it applied to gambling winnings won by New Hampshire residents both inside and outside the state, as well as to in-state winnings by out-of-state residents. They assert that the trial court erred in failing to apply what is commonly known as the <em>Complete Auto </em>test, <em>see Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274 (1977), when it ruled that the Gambling Winnings Tax did not offend the Commerce Clause and granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We do not reach this argument because we conclude that the petitioners lack standing to bring this challenge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u201cFor a court to hear a party\u2019s complaint, the party must have standing to assert the claim.\u201d <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Dep\u2019t of Revenue Admin., </em>154 N.H. 457, 461 (2006). \u201cThe general rule in New Hampshire is that a party has standing to raise a constitutional issue only when the party\u2019s own rights have been or will be directly affected.\u201d <em>Id.; see Montenegro v. City of Dover, </em>162 N.H. 641, 651 (2011). Although the State does not challenge the petitioners\u2019 standing to bring their Commerce Clause claim, \u201ca party\u2019s standing to bring suit is a question of subject matter jurisdiction, which may be addressed at any time.\u201d <em>Hughes v. N.H. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>Div. of Aeronautics, </em>152 N.H. 30, 35 (2005). We may raise the issue of a party\u2019s standing <em>sua sponte. See In re Guardianship of Williams, </em>159 N.H. 318, 322-23 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Commerce Clause reserves to Congress the right to \u201cregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. The Commerce Clause also has a \u201cnegative aspect\u201d that \u201cprohibits states from unjustifiably discriminating against or burdening interstate and foreign commerce.\u201d <em>Gen. Elec., </em>154 N.H. at 466. This construction supports the Commerce Clause\u2019s purpose of \u201cpreventing a State from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole,\u201d the likely result if it were \u201cfree to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>141 N.H. at 691 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe core purpose of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prohibit economic protectionism \u2014 that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\u201d <em>Smith v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Revenue Admin., </em>148 N.H. 536, 538 (2002) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In <em>Wine and Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island, </em>481 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2007), the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge a Rhode Island in-state residency requirement for liquor licensees under the dormant Commerce Clause. The court held that none of the plaintiffs, as Rhode Island residents, \u201ccould conceivably have suffered any cognizable harm as a result of\u2019 the residency restriction, and thus they lacked standing to challenge it under the dormant Commerce Clause. <em>Wine and Spirits, </em>481 F.3d at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Although the court in <em>Wine and Spirits </em>went on to fully address the plaintiffs\u2019 dormant Commerce Clause argument against the state restrictions on franchise and chain-store arrangements, <em>id. </em>at 12-16, the argument presented in this appeal is more akin to the one the <em>Wine and Spirits </em>plaintiffs made against the residency requirement. The plaintiffs in <em>Wine and Spirits </em>brought the action in that case because they sought to avoid the nullification of their franchise agreements while retaining their liquor licenses. <em>Id. </em>at 5. They did not suffer, nor did they claim to suffer, any harm under the residency requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The same is true in this case. We recognize that the petitioners paid the Gambling Winnings Tax, and in this sense could claim to have suffered injury in the same way that the plaintiffs in <em>Wine and Spirits </em>would have once the State of Rhode Island had enforced its amended restrictions and either nullified their franchise agreements or revoked their liquor licenses. <em>See Wine and Spirits v. Rhode Island, </em>418 F.3d 36, 43-44 (1st Cir. 2005). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>But also like the plaintiffs in <em>Wine and Spirits, </em>neither petitioner here claims to have suffered an injury that has a causal nexus to a dormant Commerce Clause violation. Neither petitioner claims to have suffered harm under the Gambling Winnings Tax due to an unjustifiable discrimination against or burdening of interstate or foreign commerce. Nor can they claim that their rights or interests will be so affected in the future, given that the tax was repealed in 2011. Eby is a New Hampshire resident who paid taxes on a winning scratch ticket purchased in New Hampshire, and alleges no injury related to any participation in interstate commerce. Willey, on the other hand, did derive the entirety of his gambling winnings from out-of-state sources for the portion of the 2009 tax year in which the tax was in effect. However, his out-of-state winnings were taxed at the same rate as they would have been if they were derived from New Hampshire sources. He does not allege that he was, in fact, taxed disproportionately because his gambling winnings were derived from a different state, that he was doubly taxed by both New Hampshire and another state, or that he was discouraged from gambling in certain states because of the potential for double taxation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At best, Willey alleges only that the Gambling Winnings Tax gave rise to the mere possibility of disproportionate or double taxation. Because the petitioners fail to show any cognizable harm related to the alleged Commerce Clause violation, they consequently lack standing to raise this challenge, and we do not consider it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We next turn to whether the petitioners have standing to bring their as-applied challenges. The petitioners argue that the Gambling Winnings Tax: (1) was unconstitutionally retrospective as applied to previous lottery winners receiving their winnings through annuity payments; (2) was a proscribed occupation tax as applied to professional gamblers; and (3) violated the State and Federal Due Process and Equal Protection rights of professional gamblers. We do not reach these arguments because the petitioners lack standing to bring the as-applied claims of annuitants or professional gamblers. We analyze their standing to bring the claims of each, in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We first analyze the petitioners\u2019 standing to bring their retrospectivity claim on behalf of pre-enactment lottery winners receiving their winnings through annuities. The petitioners argue that the Gambling Winnings Tax was unconstitutional as applied to persons who won the lottery prior to the tax\u2019s enactment and received some of those winnings through an annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">However, Eby and Willey do not claim to have paid taxes on gambling winnings from an annuity. As set forth above, a party may challenge the constitutionality of a statute only when the party\u2019s own rights have been or will be directly affected. <em>Gen. Elec., </em>154 N.H. at 461. The petitioners originally raised this argument when the Leighton Petitioners, who <em>had </em>suffered the injury here alleged, were still parties to this action. However, because neither Eby nor Willey has established standing to advance this claim, we find that the trial court correctly declined to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The issue of the petitioners\u2019 standing to raise the claims of professional gamblers turns on whether Willey is a professional gambler. In its order on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court denied both motions with respect to Willey because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether he was a professional gambler. The trial court further stated that it would make this determination by applying factors drawn from the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s criteria and used by at least one other court. Thereafter, the petitioners conceded that Willey was not a professional gambler under the IRS criteria, although they reserved their right to appeal the trial court\u2019s use of those criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">On appeal, the petitioners assert that the State is estopped from disputing that Willey was a professional gambler because it had already stipulated to that fact in the Interlocutory Transfer Statement (ITS) the parties submitted in their failed effort to have this court accept an interlocutory appeal of this case. They also argue that the trial court erred in adopting the IRS criteria. Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The ITS recites that \u201c[t]he action was initiated by... a professional gambler who derived \u2018gambling winnings\u2019 through earned income.\u201d It further states that \u201cthere are no material facts in dispute.\u201d The petitioners contend that these statements in the jointly filed ITS amount to admissions by the State that Willey is a professional gambler and that this fact is not in dispute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number> \u201cThe doctrine of judicial estoppel protects judicial integrity by preventing a party from prevailing in one phase of a case using one argument and then relying upon a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.\u201d <em>In re Zachary G., </em>159 N.H. 146, 152 (2009) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe general function of judicial estoppel is to prevent abuse of the judicial process, resulting in an affront to the integrity of the courts.\u201d <em>Pike v. Mullikin, </em>158 N.H. 267, 270 (2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-3\">While the circumstances under which judicial estoppel may be invoked vary, three factors typically inform the doctrine\u2019s application: (1) whether the party\u2019s later position is clearly inconsistent with the party\u2019s earlier position; (2) whether the earlier position was accepted by the court; and (8) whether the party seeking to assert a later inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We agree with the trial court that the State derives no unfair advantage nor imposes any unfair detriment on the petitioners by challenging Willey\u2019s status as a professional gambler, and thus his standing to contest the constitutionality of the Gambling Winnings Tax as applied to professional gamblers. Given that the interlocutory transfer request was denied by this court, the petitioners cannot show any particular unfair advantage to the State or unfair detriment to themselves in the case before the trial court that resulted from the State challenging Willey\u2019s status as a professional gambler, whether or not such a position was inconsistent with the ITS. <em>See In the Matter of Carr &amp; Edmunds, </em>156 N.H. 498, 502-03 (2007) (holding that father failed to establish that any unfairness resulted from mother\u2019s allegedly inconsistent positions in seeking to modify child support pursuant to statutory right); <em>cf. Kelleher v. Marvin Lumber &amp; Cedar Co., </em>152 N.H. 813, 849 (2005) (holding that defendant would derive an unfair advantage by taking a factual position inconsistent with one taken in an earlier action in which defendant prevailed). Had the State challenged whether Willey was a professional gambler prior to the parties\u2019 interlocutory transfer request, the State may have objected to the transfer outright, or the trial court could have denied the request or included the question of whether Willey was a professional gambler in the request. Under any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>these scenarios, after we denied the interlocutory transfer, the case would have followed the same course as it did. Therefore, application of judicial estoppel is not warranted here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"> The petitioners next argue that the trial court committed an error of law in adopting a multi-faceted test, including factors promulgated by the IRS, in determining whether a taxpayer\u2019s activity constitutes a trade or business for tax purposes. No New Hampshire case defines \u201cprofessional gambler.\u201d The trial court relied upon <em>Busch v. Commissioner of Revenue, </em>713 N.W.2d 337, 346-48 (Minn. 2006), in which the Minnesota Supreme Court analyzed whether the relator was a professional gambler by applying factors from <em>Commissioner v. Groetzinger, </em>480 U.S. 23, 35-36 (1987), and IRS regulations. <em>Busch, </em>713 N.W.2d at 346-48. As described in <em>Busch, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Groetzinger </em>considered \u201cthe regularity of Groetzinger\u2019s gambling, the effort he exerted, the skill that he applied, and his intent to produce a livelihood via gambling.\u201d <em>Busch, </em>713 N.W.2d at 347 <em>(citing Groetzinger, </em>480 U.S. at 35-36). The Minnesota court then set out the IRS factors, which include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A055\">(1) the manner in which the taxpayer carries on the activity (e.g., keeping records in a businesslike way); (2) the expertise of the taxpayer or his advisors; (3) the time and effort expended by the taxpayer in carrying on the activity; (4) the expectation that assets used in the activity may appreciate in value; (5) the success of the taxpayer in carrying on other similar or dissimilar activities; (6) the taxpayer\u2019s history of income or losses with respect to the activity; (7) the amount of occasional profits, if any, which are earned; (8) the financial status of the taxpayer; and (9) elements of personal pleasure or recreation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citing Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(b)). The <em>Busch </em>court noted that these federal sources were particularly persuasive in that case because the Minnesota tax code incorporated aspects of the federal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The petitioners argue that the trial court should not have borrowed a legal standard from a source other than the tax statute under review, and that doing so improperly added language to the statute. They argue that the court should have \u201capplied a test on a case-by-case basis\u201d and determined that Willey was a professional gambler because he had derived almost all of his earned income from gambling for a period of three years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>and he had reported $184,700 in gambling winnings for the portion of 2009 in which the Gambling Winnings Tax was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The State asserts that if these facts suffice to determine that Willey was a professional gambler, then any individual without other significant income who gambled a significant enough amount of money could qualify as a \u201cprofessional gambler,\u201d regardless of other relevant considerations. We agree that this is not the test. The trial court properly concluded that the <em>Groetzinger </em>and IRS factors listed in <em>Hughes </em>are relevant to the fact-based determination of whether a party is a professional gambler. We need not determine whether other factors would also be relevant to this determination, as that question is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Because the petitioners have failed to show that the trial court erred in utilizing the multi-faceted test as described above, because Willey concedes that he does not qualify as a professional gambler under that test, and because he did not present the trial court with any additional facts establishing that he is a professional gambler, we hold that the petitioners lack standing to raise their challenges that the Gambling Winnings Tax is unconstitutional as applied to professional gamblers.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">In their remaining arguments, the petitioners contend: (1) that Willey has standing as a putative class representative to raise arguments on behalf of all persons in the class; and (2) that the Legislature\u2019s 2012 amendment to the declaratory judgment statute gives the petitioners standing to bring an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the tax was unconstitutional. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">First, the petitioners argue that, because Willey filed this case as a class action on behalf of all persons subject to the Gambling Winnings Tax, he has standing to raise <em>all </em>arguments on behalf of <em>all </em>others in the class, <em>i.e., </em>all those who paid the Gambling Winnings Tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">\u201cThe class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>131 S. Ct. 2541, 2550 (2011) (quotation omitted). \u201cIn order to justify a departure from that rule, a class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Superior Court Civil Rule 16 sets forth a similar requirement for class representatives. <em>See </em>SUPER. Ct. Crv. R. 16(a)(2). Because Rule 16 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>23 are similar, \u201cwe rely upon federal cases interpreting the federal rule as analytic aids.\u201d <em>See In re Bayview Crematory, LLC, </em>155 N.H. 781, 784 (2007) (construing former Superior Court Rule 27-A, which was identical to Superior Court Civil Rule 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We disagree with the petitioners. The fact that the petitioners brought this case as a class action does not exempt them from the requirement that they have standing. Although the class certification determination was postponed until after the ruling on the merits, this does not mean that we may simply assume that they have standing to raise challenges to the statute on behalf of any members of the putative class. For example, because Willey has not established that he is a professional gambler, he lacks standing to raise the as-applied constitutional claims of professional gamblers notwithstanding that this case has been filed as a class action. In order to represent a class, the petitioners must be part of that class, possessing the same interest and suffering the same injury as the class members. Even the cases cited by the petitioners in support of their argument are, in fact, fully consistent with this rule. <em>See Kinney v. Metro Global Media, Inc., </em>170 F. Supp. 2d 173, 181 (D.R.I. 2001) (holding that putative class representatives had standing to represent the class, even when they owned stock for only part of lengthy class period, because they alleged a \u201ccommon course\u201d of conduct to defraud over that entire period, including the period during which they owned stock); <em>Gen. Elec. Co., </em>154 N.H. at 463 (holding that petitioner had standing to challenge constitutionality of tax deduction for which it did not qualify precisely because it had been denied the benefit of that deduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Because the petitioners have not shown that they have suffered harm under the Commerce Clause, are professional gamblers, or are gambling winnings annuity recipients, they have not suffered the same injury as the members of these subclasses they claim to represent, and thus they have not demonstrated their entitlement to act as class representatives for the members of those subclasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Finally, the petitioners argue that the 2012 amendment to RSA 491:22 grants them standing as taxpayers to raise all constitutional deficiencies of the Gambling Winnings Tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">We review matters of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Appeal of Phillips, </em>165 N.H. 226, 230 (2013). \u201cOn questions of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We first examine the language of the statute and ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The Legislature amended RSA 491:22, I, in 2012 by adding the emphasized language, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">I. Any person claiming a present legal or equitable right or title may maintain a petition against any person claiming adversely to such right or title to determine the question as between the parties, and the court\u2019s judgment or decree thereon shall be conclusive. <em>The taxpayers of a taxing district in this state shall be deemed to have an equitable right and interest in the preservation of an orderly and lawful government within such district; therefore any taxpayer in the jurisdiction of the taxing district shall have standing to petition for relief under this section when it is alleged that the taxing district or any agency or authority thereof has engaged, or proposes to engage, in conduct that is unlawful or unauthorized, and in such a case the taxpayer shall not have to demonstrate that his or her personal rights were impaired or prejudiced. The preceding sentence shall not be deemed to convey standing to any person (a) to challenge a decision of any state court if the person was not a party to the action in which the decision was rendered, or (b) to challenge the decision of any board, commission, agency, or other authority of the state or any municipality, school district, village district, or county if there exists a right to appeal the decision under RSA 511 or any other statute and the person seeking to challenge the decision is not entitled to appeal under the applicable statute. </em>The existence of an adequate remedy at law or in equity shall not preclude any person from obtaining such declaratory relief. However, the provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the burden of proof under RSA 491:22-a or permit awards of costs and attorney\u2019s fees under RSA 491:22-b in declaratory judgment actions that are not for the purpose of determining insurance coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Laws 2012, 262:1 (emphasis added). Under the plain language of the amended statute, the petitioners\u2019 argument fails. Although it confers broad taxpayer standing, the amended declaratory judgment statute contains the limitation that it does not \u201cconvey standing ... to challenge the decision of any board, commission, agency, or other authority... if there exists a right to appeal the decision under RSA 541 or any other statute and the person seeking to challenge the decision is not entitled to appeal under the applicable statute.\u201d Put another way, where the Legislature has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>conferred standing, by statute, upon a certain class of persons to challenge the decision of a board, commission, agency or other authority, RSA 491:22 does not confer standing upon a larger class of petitioners, simply because they are taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In the case of a taxpayer challenge to the constitutionality of an assessed tax, such an alternative, statutory scheme exists. RSA21-J:28-b (2012) sets forth procedures for a taxpayer to appeal a tax assessment made by the New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration (DRA). Under the statute, following a petition for redetermination and subsequent petition for reconsideration, a \u201ctaxpayer may appeal such decision by written application to the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court.\u201d RSA 21-J:28-b, IV. The statute limits the legal issues to be considered on appeal to those raised in the prior petitions for redetermination and reconsideration, \u201cwith the exception that the taxpayer may raise additional legal claims <em>addressing constitutional issues.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The procedures outlined in RSA21-J:28-a (dealing with the refund or credit of overpayment of taxes) and :28-b are \u201cthe exclusive method by which taxpayers may challenge their liability for any tax, or the application to them of any provision\u201d of the statutes governing the DRA. RSA 21-J:28-a, VI (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">RSA 21-J:28-b thus creates a right to challenge the decision of a \u201cboard, commission, agency, or other authority\u201d as contemplated in the exception to RSA 491:22 \u2014 in this case, the assessment of a tax by the DRA. Here, however, the petitioners seek to challenge assessments against persons other than themselves. But because the petitioners have not been subjected to the Gambling Winnings Tax in the circumstances in which they claim it is unconstitutional \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>as applied to those persons facing multi-state taxation, professional gamblers, and gambling-winnings annuity recipients \u2014 and therefore are not among those entitled to pursue the appellate process under RSA 21-J:28-b, it follows that they also lack standing to pursue such claims under the amended version of RSA 491:22.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">In sum, we hold: (1) that the Gambling Winnings Tax neither lacked uniformity nor was disproportional and unreasonable; and (2) that the petitioners lack standing to bring their remaining challenges to the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-10\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Leighton is a New Hampshire resident who won a Powerball jackpot on March 20, 1996, receiving his winnings via a twenty-year annuity.

Because Willey does not allege that he was taxed by another state on his gambling winnings, it follows that he was not harmed in any way by the absence of such a provision in former RSA 77:38-:50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> To the extent that the petitioners\u2019 argument could be interpreted as asserting that the State stipulated to their <em>standing </em>to raise claims on behalf of professional gamblers, we note that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>party cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction by waiver where it does not exist, and any court order that acts on the merits based on a waiver would be void. <em>See In the Matter of Goulart &amp; Goulart, </em>158 N.H. 328, 332 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\"> To the extent that the petitioners argue that the State derived an unfair litigation advantage because its prior stipulation was a judicial admission, this is a separate argument that was not preserved for appeal. Therefore, we do not address it. <em>See State v. Noucas, </em>165 N.H. 146, 152 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
