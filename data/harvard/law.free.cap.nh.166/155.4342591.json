We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-17\">The record supports the following facts. The defendant was charged with aggravated felonious sexual assault in an indictment alleging, in part, that on or between September 1, 2009, and January 2, 2011, he \u201cengaged in a pattern [of] sexual assault\u201d with a male juvenile under the age of thirteen by \u201cintentionally touching the male juvenile\u2019s genitalia with his hand on more than one occasion.\u201d Prior to trial, the defendant filed motions <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude, among other things: (1) the testimony of Dr. Kent Hymel, the victim\u2019s examining physician, because, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>things, it would not be helpful to the jury; and (2) testimony by the victim\u2019s stepfather regarding a disclosure by the victim, on the ground that such testimony would constitute inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The trial court denied both motions. In its written order, the court found, with regard to the testimony of Hymel, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">[t]he State seeks only to admit evidence that a normal exam of a child who alleges sexual abuse as a result of touching \u201cneither confirms nor refutes the possibility of sexual abuse.\u201d The testimony is admissible because it will avoid the jury speculating on whether medical evidence exists which was not produced to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The court also found that the victim\u2019s stepfather would \u201ctestify that the [victim] disclosed to him the fact that the defendant assaulted him and he observed that the [victim] visibly was upset when he did so.\u201d The court ruled that the testimony was relevant and not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Hymel and the stepfather. \u201cGenerally, we accord considerable deference to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and will only intervene when they demonstrate an unsustainable exercise of discretion. Unless a party establishes that such a ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the party\u2019s case, it will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>State v. Belton, </em>150 N.H. 741, 743 (2004) (citation omitted). We will address each challenge in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The defendant challenges the admission of Hymel\u2019s testimony on grounds that it was irrelevant, unhelpful to the jury, and prejudicial. He first characterizes the trial court\u2019s rationale as finding that Hymel\u2019s testimony was \u201cnecessary to prevent the jury from harboring a misimpression that the absence of physical evidence was significant.\u201d He then asserts that this rationale is erroneous because, \u201cwhile otherwise inadmissible evidence may become admissible to rebut a misimpression under the doctrine of specific contradiction, that doctrine requires that the misimpression be created by the opposing party.\u201d Here, he asserts, it was the State, rather than the defendant, that introduced evidence that the victim had been examined by a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s characterization of the trial court\u2019s ruling. The court did not admit the doctor\u2019s testimony to rebut a misimpression created by either party, but rather to \u201cavoid the jury speculating on whether medical evidence exists which was not produced to it.\u201d We need not, therefore, address the defendant\u2019s arguments based upon the doctrine of specific contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The defendant next contests that any risk of jury speculation existed. He argues that \u201cthe misimpression that the State claimed it needed to rebut \u2014 that touching would produce physical evidence \u2014 defies common sense.\u201d At the hearing, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">I think that as much as we would like to think there would not be any speculation on the part of the jury as to what could potentially show that a child has been touched, we\u2019re talking about a pattern allegation over a long period of time, alleging touching of the genitalia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">And I think that the climate that we live in now, a lot of jurors see things on TV; a lot of jurors hear things in the community and have a higher expectation that there may be the possibility of obtaining some sort of physical evidence in [a] case where we would normally have thought that might not <em>be the </em>case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The court summarized, \u201cThis is a case about credibility. [The State] want[s] to say there\u2019s no [scientific] test that can show whether or not this happened.\u201d It then reasoned that \u201cthere is relevance because it avoids speculation and I don\u2019t see any harm to the Defendant in telling the jury that there is no medical test.\u201d Under our deferential standard of review, we cannot say that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by allowing the testimony for the limited purpose it identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The defendant goes on, however, to argue that the trial court \u201cerred in permitting the State to elicit Hymel\u2019s further testimony about the [physical] examination in this case.\u201d Prior to Hymel\u2019s testimony, the defendant sought a ruling \u201cthat there be no questions allowed about the exam... [that was actually performed on the victim] because that would mislead the jury\u201d given that the State\u2019s premise for offering the testimony was to inform the jury \u201cthat there is no physical test to be done to support a finding of touching.\u201d The State assured the court that \u201cthe doctor will be very clear that while there is no physical test that can be done as a diagnostic tool... [a] test is done, [and] there are reasons for doing it. He\u2019ll explain what [the victim\u2019s] demeanor was like during that test and the steps that he took.\u201d The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, finding the evidence \u201call relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">On appeal, the defendant argues that, given Hymel\u2019s testimony that touching would not \u201ccause any tissue damage, or changes\u201d that he would expect to observe in a physical examination, his testimony about the examination of the victim in this case was irrelevant and not helpful to the jury. Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401. Expert testimony is admissible under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 702 \u201c[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Hymel\u2019s testimony about the actual physical examination of the victim was brief. He testified that he followed the usual procedure that he had previously described in general. When asked about his physical findings with respect to the victim, Hymel\u2019s entire response was: \u201cHe had a normal exam. A completely normal exam. His general exam and the genital and anal exam were all just fine. No abnormalities. No signs of penetrating trauma. No lesions or sores concerning for a sexually transmitted infection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Even if Hymel\u2019s testimony regarding the victim\u2019s normal examination findings tended neither to disprove nor prove the alleged touching, and thus could arguably have been irrelevant and not helpful to the jury, we fail to see how its admission prejudiced the defendant. Under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard, we will not disturb a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling \u201c[u]nless a party establishes that such a ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Belton, </em>150 N.H. at 743; <em>cf. United States v. Mejia, </em>909 F.2d 242, 246 (7th Cir. 1990) (\u201cIt is not reversible error to admit irrelevant details that have no probative value but do not prejudice a defendant.\u201d). In addition, Hymel\u2019s testimony regarding the victim\u2019s physical examination laid a foundation for his testimony about the victim\u2019s demeanor, the relevance of which we address below.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Indeed, it appears that the defendant\u2019s real issue with Hymel\u2019s testimony relates to \u201cadditional testimony\u201d that the prosecutor \u201celicited\u201d after the doctor described his physical examination findings. As with the examination findings themselves, the defendant challenges this additional testimony as irrelevant and not helpful to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The prosecutor immediately followed Hymel\u2019s answer regarding his examination findings with the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">Q. Okay. And was this surprising to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">A. Not at all. For the reasons I\u2019ve already discussed and in addition because the information I had, the reason why he had been referred to us was that he had been touched. There was no additional information about penetrating trauma. And it seems intuitively obvious to me that if he was just touched I would never be able to tell that just by looking on an exam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">So the main purpose \u2014 so an additional purpose of our exam is to examine for the possibility that something happened more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>what has been disclosed, but I found nothing to suggest that he had experienced penetrating trauma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The defendant asserts that \u201c[f]ar from the \u2018neutral explanation\u2019 the prosecutor assured the court\u201d that Hymel would provide, \u201cthe State elicited Hymel\u2019s opinion in a manner which suggested that he personally believed that [the victim] had been abused.\u201d Thus, in essence, the defendant is claiming that the doctor\u2019s testimony exceeded the scope allowed under the trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The defendant did not, however, object to, or move to strike, any of this additional testimony as it was elicited at trial; nor did he request a limiting instruction. \u201cIn general, a defendant must make a specific and contemporaneous objection during trial to preserve an issue for appellate review. A motion <em>in limine </em>is sufficient to preserve an issue for appeal without an objection at trial if the trial court definitively rules on the issue before trial.\u201d <em>State v. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. 269, 275 (2007) (citation omitted). Here, the defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>preserved his objection with respect to the issues ruled upon therein, but the doctor\u2019s alleged deviation from that ruling raised a new issue not brought to the trial court\u2019s attention. <em>Cf. People v. Diaz, </em>930 N.E.2d 264, 269-70 (N.Y. 2010) (finding that when \u201cdefendant failed to make any objections during [psychiatric expert\u2019s] testimony, even when the testimony exceeded the scope of the court\u2019s ruling [on defendant\u2019s motion <em>in </em>limine,]... many of the troubling aspects of [the expert\u2019s] testimony . . . are unpreserved for review\u201d). Accordingly, we decline to address the defendant\u2019s arguments with respect to those additional portions of Hymel\u2019s testimony. <em>Cf. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. at 275 (declining to address on appeal argument that 911 tape was inadmissible under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403 where defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>was based on different ground and Rule 403 was neither mentioned in motion <em>in limine </em>nor argued to the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The defendant also challenges \u201cHymel\u2019s testimony about his actual motivation for examining [the victim],\u201d which, the defendant asserts, was \u201cto assure [the victim] that his body was normal.\u201d \u201cSuch an assurance,\u201d the defendant argues, \u201cwould only be necessary if [the victim] was, in fact, abused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s characterization of Hymel\u2019s testimony. During his general description of his practice and procedure, the doctor testified that in performing a medical examination when there has been an allegation of sexual abuse, \u201cmost of the time the value of what we do, and therefore the real purpose of what we do is to verify... [a]nd then reassure the child that their body is normal\u201d because \u201c[s]ome <em>children </em>I am convinced harbor a belief <em>if they\u2019ve been sexually abused </em>that people can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tell.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Hymel\u2019s testimony did not indicate an \u201cactual motivation\u201d for examining this particular child and expressed no opinion or personal belief as to whether this child had been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The defendant next challenges Hymel\u2019s testimony as to the victim\u2019s demeanor. Specifically, the defendant challenges the admission of the doctor\u2019s response to the following question by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">Q. Can you describe what [the victim\u2019s] demeanor was like when you dealt with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">MS. SIRANIAN: Objection, it\u2019s vouching for the credibility of the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">THE COURT: [Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">THE WITNESS: I did include a statement in my report, which was \u2014 which is atypical for me. I don\u2019t usually include. Is I have one sentence. It says, he appeared very withdrawn and/or scared during today\u2019s exam. And actually, I think that I\u2019m pretty good, my team is pretty good at putting kids at ease, and distracting them, and making it fun and nonthreatening. So rereading my report that is somewhat unique, fairly unique. I usually don\u2019t include a sentence like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">And so it suggests that I didn\u2019t succeed in the usual degree. Our team did not succeed in the usual degree to put this child completely at ease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he implication of this testimony was that [the victim\u2019s] reaction to the examination was corroborative of abuse.\u201d He argues further that, given Hymel\u2019s \u201cextensive qualifications^] ... it was unlikely that the jury would have disregarded . . . the implication that he found [the victim\u2019s] demeanor during the examination significant of abuse.\u201d The State counters that \u201cHymel never stated or implied that [the victim\u2019s] demeanor showed that he had been abused\u201d and notes that \u201c[o]ther courts have had little hesitation in holding that demeanor evidence is always admissible to corroborate a victim\u2019s testimony and to rebut a charge of fabrication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Having reviewed the testimony, we agree that Hymel conveyed no opinion as to whether or not the victim in this case had been abused. The doctor noted that it was \u201catypical\u201d and \u201cfairly unique\u201d that he would have included a comment about a patient\u2019s demeanor in his notes, but made no suggestion that he found the victim\u2019s demeanor corroborative of abuse. <em>Cf. State v. Oscarson, </em>845 A.2d 337, 356 (Vt. 2004) (doctor \u201cdid not \u2018clearly and impermissibly bolster the credibility\u2019 \u201d of child victims where he \u201coffered no opinion as to whether [they] were telling the truth about being sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>abused by defendant\u201d and his description of one victim\u2019s \u201cdemeanor was not tantamount to vouching for [the victim\u2019s] credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The defendant correctly notes that the State summarized Hymel\u2019s demeanor testimony during its closing, but a review of the defendant\u2019s opening statement and closing argument demonstrates why the evidence was relevant. In his opening, the defendant contended that he was \u201cnot guilty because [the victim] made this up ... to get attention.\u201d Specifically, the defendant elaborated in his closing argument that the victim was a middle child and a loner who \u201cgot left behind a lot\u201d and who \u201cmade up a story to get the attention of his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The State, in its closing, questioned what motive the victim would have for making up such a story, given the unchallenged evidence that the defendant was like a grandfather to the victim and gave him \u201call this wonderful attention, one-on-one.\u201d The State juxtaposed that \u201cwonderful attention\u201d against the victim\u2019s post-disclosure experiences, testing the plausibility of the defendant\u2019s theory in light of, among other things, the victim\u2019s demeanor as observed by the jury and as testified to by the State\u2019s witnesses. The State then argued to the jury that the defendant\u2019s theory \u201cmakes no sense\u201d because \u201c[n]o child in their right mind would trade\u201d the positive attention of a grandfather figure for the negative experiences that the victim had had since disclosing the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">On appeal, the State argues that the challenged demeanor evidence was admissible to counter a defense of fabrication by the victim. We agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">Evidence of a victim\u2019s state of mind or behavior following a crime has long been admissible if relevant to a contested issue in a case. Demeanor evidence may be of particular importance in a case such as this, where the trial devolves to a contest of credibility concerning whether the charged offense . . . occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\"><em>Com. v. Starkweather, </em>950 N.E.2d 461, 469, 470 (Mass. App. Ct. 2011) (quotation and citation omitted) (finding police officer\u2019s \u201cfirsthand observations of the victim\u2019s demeanor in the emergency room, and physical and emotional state of mind in the wake of the sexual attack, played an integral role in assessing credibility\u201d). We conclude that the demeanor testimony by Hymel was relevant to respond to the defendant\u2019s theory of the victim\u2019s motive for fabricating allegations against him. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s advancement of that theory at trial undermines his claim of prejudicial error. <em>See Belton, </em>150 N.H. at 743 (prejudice required to show unsustainable exercise of discretion in evidentiary ruling); <em>State v. Burney, </em>954 A.2d 793, 805 (Conn. 2008) (concluding that \u201c[b]ecause defense counsel opened the door to the demeanor testimony at trial by attacking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>victim\u2019s credibility . . . , the defendant\u2019s claim that he was unfairly prejudiced by the subsequent introduction of the testimony in response is less than persuasive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The defendant next challenges the admission of demeanor testimony given by the victim\u2019s stepfather. The defendant had moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude that testimony as hearsay and objected at trial on relevance grounds. The trial court ruled against him on both grounds and he now reasserts both grounds on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">At trial, the victim\u2019s stepfather testified that, on January 2, 2011, the victim \u201ctold me he had something to tell me,\u201d that he looked \u201c[s]cared\u201d and \u201cnervous\u201d when he said that, but looked \u201c[r]eally relieved\u201d after he shared the information. The stepfather further testified that he felt \u201c[a]ngry\u201d and \u201cdisgusted\u201d when he heard what the victim told him, that he related the information to his wife, and that he thought she called the police. The stepfather also testified that he did not confront the defendant \u201c[b]eeause it would have been a bad scene.\u201d The stepfather never testified as to what the victim told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">On appeal, the defendant first contends that the stepfather\u2019s testimony was hearsay. Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 801(c). A statement, in turn, is \u201c(1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 801(a). The defendant argues that the evidence revealed in the stepfather\u2019s testimony concerning the child\u2019s disclosure to him constituted a statement for hearsay purposes because, \u201c[w]hile the State did not elicit direct evidence of the content of the statement, it clearly elicited circumstantial evidence that [the victim] claimed that [the defendant] had abused him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Even assuming that the child\u2019s disclosure constitutes a statement under Rule 801, we conclude that it is not hearsay because we agree with the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">[t]he child\u2019s statement is not for the truth of the matter and is plainly relevant, because the State intends to introduce evidence that the child was upset when he made the disclosure. [The victim\u2019s stepfather] can be cross examined on what he observed and what he saw in the alleged victim\u2019s demeanor. His observations are not hearsay. Thus, the testimony is admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u201cIf a statement is not offered to prove its truth, but is offered for some other reason, such as to prove simply that the statement was made, it is not hearsay.\u201d C. DOUGLAS, NEW HAMPSHIRE EVIDENCE MANUAL \u00a7 801.02[5], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>at VIII-7 (2013 ed.). Here, the State did not introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s statement to his stepfather in order to prove the statement\u2019s truth, but rather to provide a foundation for the evidence of the victim\u2019s demeanor. The portion of the stepfather\u2019s testimony offered as proof of the alleged crime was not the victim\u2019s <em>disclosure, </em>but his <em>demeanor, </em>thus, the evidence of the victim\u2019s statement to his stepfather \u2014 the content of which was not disclosed \u2014 was offered \u201cto prove simply that [a] statement was made.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In addition, the demeanor evidence was not evidence of a statement because it was neither assertive nor intended as a communication. \u201cAlthough nonverbal conduct may be considered hearsay if it is assertive and intended as a communication^] conduct that is nonassertive is not considered a statement for hearsay purposes.\u201d <em>Burney, </em>954 A.2d at 802 (citation omitted). Accordingly, courts have held that testimony regarding a sexual assault victim\u2019s demeanor is not hearsay. <em>See State v. Tibor, </em>738 N.W.2d 492, 499 (N.D. 2007) (holding child sexual abuse victim\u2019s \u201cnonverbal conduct during the interview [with a social worker and forensic interviewer] was offered as evidence about [the victim\u2019s] demeanor and attitude\u201d and was therefore \u201cadmissible, non-hearsay evidence\u201d); <em>Com. v. Patosky, </em>656 A.2d 499, 506 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1995) (holding \u201cvictim\u2019s nervous demeanor when reporting\u201d indecent assault by a coworker to her supervisor \u201cwas not a statement as it was not intended as a communication\u201d). We find particularly instructive the observation of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals addressing both hearsay and relevance concerns regarding demeanor evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">It is the general rule that testimony of a witness as to the mental or emotional state of another, deduced from observation, is admissible when relevant. Such demeanor evidence is not hearsay, but rather a fact-based observation by the witness on which the observing witness can be cross-examined. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">. . . [T]he relevance of the complainant\u2019s demeanor does not depend on the truthfulness of [his or] her report [of sexual assault] \u2014 the trier of fact is not required to consider the report\u2019s truth to evaluate the probative value of the complainant\u2019s demeanor. Rather, the complainant\u2019s demeanor when discussing the subject is independent evidence that [he or] she was the victim of a sexual assault, just as a physical injury might constitute such evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\"><em>Garibay v. United States, </em>72 A.3d 133, 137-38 (D.C. 2013) (quotation and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>We conclude that the evidence elicited from the victim\u2019s stepfather about the victim\u2019s demeanor was not hearsay, and, in addition, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the stepfather\u2019s testimony was irrelevant. <em>See id.; see also Burney, </em>954 A.2d at 805 (\u201cThere can be no question that the victim\u2019s emotional state when she made the complaint, as evidenced by her outward demeanor, was relevant to the ultimate question of whether a sexual assault occurred because it bore on her. credibility.\u201d). Because we find the trial court\u2019s ruling neither untenable nor unreasonable, we need not address the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding prejudice. <em>See Belton, </em>150 N.H. at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">Finally, the defendant challenges the stepfather\u2019s testimony that he felt \u201c[a]ngry\u201d and \u201cdisgusted\u201d when the victim made the disclosure and that he did not confront the defendant \u201c[b]ecause it would have been a bad scene.\u201d The defendant argues on appeal that this testimony constituted hearsay, was irrelevant, and was prejudicial. We conclude, for the reasons previously discussed, that this was not assertive conduct, and therefore was not hearsay. <em>See Garibay, </em>72 A.3d at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">We decline to address the defendant\u2019s contention that this testimony was irrelevant and prejudicial because he failed to preserve the issue for our review. The defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>sought exclusion of testimony concerning the victim\u2019s disclosure solely on hearsay grounds. At the hearing on the motion, the State indicated that it was not seeking to introduce the content of the victim\u2019s disclosure, but, rather, wanted to elicit the circumstances under which it was made: \u201cHow the [victim] appeared to [the stepfather] at the time. How the child appeared afterwards. What [the stepfather] did as a result of it.\u201d This proffer, and the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion <em>in limine, </em>make clear that the trial court considered, and ruled upon, only the admissibility of evidence of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>demeanor. When the prosecutor arguably exceeded the scope of the <em>in limine </em>ruling and inquired about the <em>stepfather\u2019s </em>reaction, it was incumbent upon the defendant to object in order to preserve the issue for our review. <em>Cf. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. at 275. Because he failed to do so, we decline to consider the issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, Lynn and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
