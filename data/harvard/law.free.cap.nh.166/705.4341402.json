Costella, was convicted on two counts of criminal threatening and one count of disorderly conduct arising out of an incident that took place at the Wal-Mart store located in Tilton. RSA 631:4 (2007 &amp; Supp. 2013); RSA 651:6, 1(f) (2007); RSA 644:2 (2007). The two criminal threatening convictions were subject to an extended term of imprisonment under RSA 651:6,1(f), the \u201chate crime statute.\u201d On appeal, the defendant argues that the superior court erred when it: (1) denied his motion to dismiss the hate crime enhancement; and (2) excluded the testimony of his daughter that he was not motivated by hostility towards Judaism. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">The jury could have found the following facts. On November 29,2010, the defendant brought his car to Wal-Mart for an oil change. Jane Sylvestre, an employee in the automobile department, drove the defendant\u2019s car into the service bay. While in the defendant\u2019s car, Sylvestre saw a photograph of the defendant and his daughter in front of a red flag with a swastika on it. In the photograph, the defendant and his daughter were, as described by Sylvestre, \u201cdoing the heil Hitler.\u201d Sylvestre took offense because the Nazis had killed her uncle, who had been a member of the French resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">After parking the car in the service bay, Sylvestre returned to the service area, where she told the defendant that she had the right to refuse service to customers with whom she was uncomfortable. In response, the defendant asked Sylvestre if she was a Jew. Sylvestre testified that her response was along the lines of, \u201c[Wjhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d The defendant told Sylvestre that not enough Jews had been killed during World War II, and that \u201ca good Jew is a dead Jew.\u201d He then asked her if she had seen his \u201cJew killing gun\u201d in the car. Sylvestre told the defendant that her uncle had been burned alive by the Nazis during World War II, and that her mother had been forced to watch. The defendant responded that he hoped that Sylvestre\u2019s uncle \u2014 \u201cthat Jew bastard\u201d \u2014 had suffered when he died. After the exchange, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>defendant repeatedly walked by Sylvestre, calling her a \u201cgypsy Jew\u201d and stating that the \u201cworst thing in the world is a gypsy Jew. They didn\u2019t kill enough Jews.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">After the oil change had been completed, a second employee handed the car keys to the defendant. As Sylvestre started to process the invoice, the defendant asked her if she had seen his gun, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a Jew killing killer.\u201d He also accused Sylvestre of \u201cwrecking]\u201d his car because she was \u201ca stupid Jew that doesn\u2019t know how to drive a car.\u201d The defendant then paid his bill. As he was leaving, the defendant declared \u2014 to no one in particular, but audibly, and within earshot of Sylvestre \u2014 that he was \u201cgetting his gun to kill the Jew b***h behind the counter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The defendant then walked past the second employee and asked him what he thought of Jews. When the employee replied that Jews did not bother him, the defendant stated that \u201cwe should kill them all starting with the woman behind the counter,\u201d and referred to \u201cwhy [he] keeps a gun underneath [his] front seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Jonathan Allard, a store manager, overheard that conversation. Allard also had heard the defendant talk about his \u201cJew killing gun\u201d as well as his threats to kill. The defendant then started speaking to Allard, raising his voice and asking Allard whether he was Jewish. The defendant appeared agitated. Allard did not respond. The defendant told Allard that he was going to kill \u201cboth of you Jews,\u201d and he again stated that he had his \u201cJew killing gun\u201d in the car. Allard understood that the defendant was referring to him and Sylvestre. Allard then told the defendant to leave the store and informed him that the police would be called. The defendant left the premises, and the police arrived shortly thereafter. The police investigated the incident and arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The defendant was indicted for disorderly conduct and charged with two counts of criminal threatening, one count for his statements to Sylvestre, and the other for his statements to Allard. Prior to trial, the State notified the defendant that pursuant to the hate crime statute it would seek enhanced penalties on the criminal threatening charges. The hate crime statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">I. A convicted person may be sentenced according to paragraph III if the jury also finds beyond a reasonable doubt that such person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">(f) Was substantially motivated to commit the crime because of hostility towards the victim\u2019s religion, race, creed, sexual orientation as defined in RSA 21:49, national origin or sex ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>RSA 651:6, 1(f). In addition, RSA 651:6, III (Supp. 2013) states: \u201cIf authorized by paragraph I or II, and if written notice of the possible application of this section is given the defendant at least 21 days prior to the commencement of jury selection for his or her trial, a defendant may be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, the defendant moved to dismiss all charges, as well as the hate crime sentencing enhancement, arguing as to the latter that the \u201cState has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant\u2019s] actions, if, indeed, he did them, was [sic] motivated by the victim\u2019s religion. No testimony was given that [the defendant] was told by any of the witnesses that they were, indeed, Jewish.\u201d The State countered that \u201cthe fact that a victim is a member of one of those [statutorily] protected classes is not an element of the offense.\u201d The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The jury convicted the defendant of all charges, including the two counts of enhanced criminal threatening. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The defendant raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that the evidence offered at trial was insufficient to prove that, pursuant to the hate crime statute, RSA 651:6,1(f), he was substantially motivated to commit the crime of criminal threatening because of hostility towards Sylvestre\u2019s and Allard\u2019s religion. He contends that there was no evidence that either Sylvestre or Allard is Jewish. Second, he argues that the trial court erred when it excluded the testimony of his daughter that he was not motivated by hostility towards Judaism.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">\n<em>I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">We first address whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant was substantially motivated to commit the crime of criminal threatening because of hostility towards Sylvestre\u2019s and Allard\u2019s religion. The defendant argues that the hate crime statute requires the State to prove the victims\u2019 <em>actual </em>religion, and that the statute would not apply if the defendant were \u201cmotivated by hostility towards a religion to which he reasonably [but mistakenly] believed the victim ascribed.\u201d He contends that neither Sylvestre nor Allard told him that she or he is Jewish, and, further, that there was no evidence adduced at trial that either actually is Jewish. The State counters that it is required only to prove that the defendant was substantially motivated to commit the crime because of hostility against a protected class, <em>not </em>that the victim was actually a member of that class. Alternatively, the State argues that, even if we were to adopt the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the hate crime statute, we must nonetheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>affirm the sentence enhancement on the count involving Sylvestre because the State introduced sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she is Jewish.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In order to prevail on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201ca defendant must show that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Noucas, </em>165 N.H. 146, 151 (2013) (quotation omitted). Here, resolution of the sufficiency issue requires that we first engage in statutory interpretation, after which we assess the sufficiency of the evidence introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo\u201d State v. Gagne, </em>165 N.H. 363, 370 (2013). \u201cIn matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen examining the language of the statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We construe the Criminal Code according to the fair import of its terms and to promote justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The issue before us is the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe victim\u2019s religion,\u201d as used in RSA 651:6, 1(f). The defendant argues that, because the hate crime statute requires the State to prove that the defendant was substantially motivated because of hostility towards the <em>victim\u2019s religion, </em>the State is required to prove two distinct elements: first, the actual religion of the victim, and, second, that it was hostility towards the victim\u2019s religion that substantially motivated the defendant to criminally threaten the victim. He contends that construing the statute to require only that the crimes be motivated by the defendant\u2019s <em>perception </em>of the victim\u2019s religion adds the word \u201cperceived\u201d to the statute, which the legislature did not see fit to include.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The State counters that the plain language of the hate crime statute enhances the punishment for bias-based crimes, and thus requires only that the State prove that the defendant was substantially motivated to commit the crime because of hostility towards a protected class; here, the protected class consists of members of the Jewish faith. It further argues that it is the defendant, rather than the State, who is advocating for a construction that adds words to the statute. It contends that the defendant\u2019s interpretation would require the addition of the word \u201cactual\u201d to the statute, and establish a requirement which the legislature did not see fit to include: that the defendant had knowledge of the victim\u2019s actual status.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>We conclude that because both proffered interpretations of the statute are reasonable, the statute is ambiguous. <em>See State v. Lathrop, </em>164 N.H. 468, 470 (2012). Under such circumstances, we turn to the legislative history to aid in our interpretation of the meaning of the statutory language. <em>See id. </em>Here, however, a review of the legislative history is unavailing. <em>See </em>N.H.H.R. JOUR. 656-57 (1990); N.H.S. JOUR. 719-20 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Nonetheless, \u201c[w]e construe statutes to address the evil or mischief that the legislature intended to correct or remedy.\u201d <em>Lathrop, </em>164 N.H. at 470. The State\u2019s interpretation of the hate crime statute\u2014 enhancing a punishment because the defendant selected a victim based on the defendant\u2019s perception of the victim\u2019s membership in the protected class \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 is consonant with the fundamental purpose of hate crime penalty enhancement statutes in general, and of RSA 651:6,1(f) in particular: to recognize and punish the greater harm that bias-motivated crimes inflict upon society and individual victims. As the United States Supreme Court observed in regard to the Wisconsin hate crime statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">[T]he Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired conduct because this conduct is thought to inflict greater individual and societal harm. For example, according to the State and its <em>amici, </em>bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and incite community unrest. The State\u2019s desire to redress these perceived harms provides an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders\u2019 beliefs or biases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\"><em>Wisconsin v. Mitchell, </em>508 U.S. 476, 487-88 (1993) (quotation and citations omitted); <em>see also In re Joshua H., </em>17 Cal. Rptr. 2d 291, 299 (App. Ct. 1993) (explaining that \u201c[t]he \u2018basis\u2019 for punishing violent crimes directed against members of a racial, religious, or other specified group more severely than randomly inflicted violent crimes is that such crimes inflict greater injury upon the victim and society at large and existing criminal statutes and penalties have been inadequate to stop them\u201d). \u201c[I]t is but reasonable that among crimes of different natures those should be most severely punished, which are the most destructive of the public safety and happiness\u201d: a category into which bias-motivated crimes fall. <em>Mitchell, </em>508 U.S. at 488 (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>Gilbert <em>&amp; </em>Marchand, Note, <em>Splitting the Atom or Splitting Hairs </em>\u2014 The <em>Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, </em>30 St. Mary\u2019s L. J. 931,933-34 (1999) (\u201cHate crimes are not only injurious to the individual victim, but they also fracture a surrounding community, creating a pervasive disharmony among citizens.\u201d); Pfeiffer, Note, <em>To Enhance or Not to Enhance: Civil Penalty Enhancement for Parents of Juvenile Hate Crime </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number><em>Offenders, </em>41 VAL. U. L. Rev. 1685, 1692-93 (2007) (\u201cIn addition to its significant effects on victims, hate crime imposes even greater effects on the community. . . . [T]he surrounding community suffers increased psychological trauma similar to that suffered by victims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The significant community harm resulting from a hate crime flows from the defendant\u2019s bias-motivated actions, rather than the victim\u2019s actual status as a member of a protected class. <em>See </em>U.S. Department of Justice, Hate Crime Data Collection Guidelines and Training Manual 7, 8, 20 (Dec. 19, 2012), <em>available at </em>http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/data-collectionmanual (defining \u201cbias crime,\u201d including the following note: \u201cEven if the offender was mistaken in his or her perception that the victim was a member of the group he or she was acting against, the offense is still a bias crime because the offender was motivated by bias against the group.\u201d). Society is harmed by a bias-motivated crime regardless of whether the victim is, in fact, a member of the protected class that the defendant has targeted. Indeed, in this case, the crimes committed by the defendant had a pernicious impact on the community independent of whether Sylvestre and Allard are, in fact, Jewish.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Moreover, \u201cit is not to be presumed that the legislature would pass an act leading to an absurd result and nullifying to an appreciable extent the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>143 N.H. 559, 562 (1999) (quotation and brackets omitted). We note that, were we to interpret the hate crime statute to require the State to prove the victim\u2019s actual status, <em>i.e., </em>his or her religion, race, creed, or national origin, an absurd result could follow because every prosecution under the statute would require a trial within a trial. How would a jury determine a victim\u2019s race, creed or religion? What evidence would a jury consider in order to determine whether a victim is Jewish? Would a jury consider how often a victim attends synagogue, or whether one or both of a victim\u2019s parents were Jewish, or whether the victim\u2019s grandparents were Jewish? How would a jury determine whether a victim is a Native American, or the race of a biracial victim? \u2018We think it unlikely that [the legislature] intended that... courts engage in these unwieldy inquiries.\u201d <em>Mississippi ex. rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., </em>134 S. Ct. 736, 743-44 (2014) (declining to construe diversity jurisdiction statute in such a way as to render its requirements \u201can administrative nightmare that Congress could not possibly have intended\u201d). In contrast, requiring the State to prove that the defendant was motivated by his or her hostility towards a victim\u2019s perceived religion leads to a straightforward and easy-to-administer process. <em>Cf. id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The defendant next observes that, although the legislature in 2012 added language in RSA 21:49 (2012) that explicitly provided for enhanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>sentences for crimes motivated by hostility towards a victim\u2019s <em>perceived </em>sexual orientation, it did not explicitly define \u201cthe victim\u2019s religion\u201d in the hate crime statute to encompass a victim\u2019s <em>perceived </em>religion. RSA 21:49 states in part that \u201csexual orientation\u201d means \u201chaving or <em>being perceived as having </em>an orientation for heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant contends that the use of this language in RSA 21:49 means that the continuing absence of such language regarding religion in the hate crime statute is indicative of the fact that the legislature intentionally chose not to provide for enhanced punishment for crimes motivated by hostility towards the victim\u2019s <em>perceived </em>religion. The State counters that the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cperceived\u201d in a statutory provision enacted seven years after the hate crime statute \u2014 in a separate chapter of the state statutes \u2014 is irrelevant to an inquiry as to the intent of the legislature when it enacted the hate crime statute. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\u201cStatutory context includes earlier-enacted statutes, but does not include later-enacted statutes.\u201d <em>State v. Neff, </em>265 P.3d 62, 65 (Or. App. 2011). Indeed, \u201c[i]f \u2014- as in this case \u2014 two statutes are involved, the rationale for the later one cannot automatically be transformed by some thaumaturgical feat of rhetorical prestidigitation into the rationale for the preexisting one.\u201d <em>Denny v. Westfield State College, </em>880 F.2d 1465, 1470 (1st Cir. 1989). RSA 21:49 was enacted in 1997 as part of comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination based upon sexual orientation. <em>See </em>Laws 1997, 108:1, :2; <em>cf. </em>Laws 1997,108:16 (amending the hate crime statute to include a reference to RSA 21:49). In contrast, RSA 651:6, 1(f) was enacted in 1990 as a hate crime penalty enhancement. <em>See </em>Laws 1990,68:1. Accordingly, we conclude that the statutory definition of sexual orientation \u2014 enacted seven years after the hate crime statute \u2014 cannot, and does not, shed light on the legislature\u2019s intent when it enacted the hate crime statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The defendant further supports his statutory interpretation by comparing our hate crime statute with statutes from other states. He argues that because statutes in a number of other states refer explicitly to the \u201cactual or perceived\u201d protected status of the victim, <em>see </em>720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-7.1 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2012), or to a crime committed \u201cbecause of\u2019 a protected status, without identifying a victim, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:16-1 (2005 &amp; Supp. 2011), the absence of such terminology in our own statute must indicate the legislature\u2019s intent to enhance the penalty only when the victim was accurately targeted as an actual member of a protected class. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The mere fact that some states use the word \u201cperceived\u201d in their hate crime statutes,' while our legislature has not chosen to use the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201cperceived,\u201d does not affect our analysis: Although the perceived status of the victims is explicitly stated in the statutes of other states, as we explained above, that basic concept is implicit in our statute. Our task here is to interpret our hate crime statute; the language in other states\u2019 statutes is of little assistance. Second, we cannot find, nor has the defendant cited, any case in which a court has interpreted a hate crime statute that, like ours, does not explicitly refer to the defendant\u2019s perception of status as a motivating factor as requiring the State to prove the victim\u2019s <em>actual </em>religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Accordingly, we hold that pursuant to RSA 651:6 the State must prove only that a defendant was substantially motivated to commit a crime because of his hostility towards the victim\u2019s perceived \u201creligion, race, creed, sexual orientation..., national origin or sex,\u201d and that it need not prove the actual status of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Having construed RSA 651:6, we now address the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Specifically, we examine whether the defendant has demonstrated that no rational trier of fact, viewing all the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant was substantially motivated to commit the crime because of hostility towards Judaism, and that he perceived that Sylvestre and Allard were Jewish. <em>See Noucas, </em>165 N.H. at 151. The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that either victim is Jewish. However, as we have explained, the State was not required to prove that the victims <em>are, </em>in fact, Jewish. The defendant does not argue that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was substantially motivated to commit the crimes because he perceived Sylvestre and Allard to be Jewish. Indeed, given the evidence adduced at trial, such an argument would not be supportable. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s sufficiency argument fails, and we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the hate crime enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">\n<em>II. Character Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">We next address whether the trial court erroneously excluded testimony offered at trial by the defendant to show that he was not motivated to act because of hostility towards the victims\u2019 religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">During the testimony of the defendant\u2019s daughter, counsel for the defendant asked, \u201cCan you describe your relationship that you have with [your father]?\u201d The State objected on the ground of relevance. The defendant offered this explanation to the trial court: \u201cIt\u2019s background. And the State is also seeking to enhance this with the hate crime statute. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>[New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(a)] I can seek to provide evidence that there is no motive and that [the daughter] has knowledge regarding that.\u201d The trial court sustained the objection, stating, \u201cTalk about the picture, but as far as the rest of it, it\u2019s not relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The defendant contends that the trial court erred because the daughter\u2019s testimony would have shown that the defendant \u201cdid not have the character trait of being motivated by hostility towards Judaism.\u201d The State responds that the trial court did not err because defense counsel\u2019s \u201cproffer failed to identify a pertinent trait of character that might have been admissible under Rule 404(a)(1).\u201d We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\u2018We review challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard and reverse only if the rulings are clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Noucas, </em>165 N.H. at 158 (quotation omitted). \u201cIn determining whether a ruling is a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we consider whether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary decision made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Although character evidence is generally not admissible, N.H. R. Ev. 404(a), it is admissible if it is evidence of \u201ca pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 404(a)(1). Nonetheless, \u201c[i]n order to predicate error on a trial court\u2019s ruling excluding evidence, the proponent of the evidence bears the burden of making a contemporaneous offer of proof sufficient to apprise the court of the specific nature of the excluded evidence.\u201d <em>Noucas, </em>165 N.H. at 158; <em>see also </em>N.H.

Ev. 103(b)(2). \u201cThe object of Rule 103(b) is to advise the trial judge of a claim of error so that it can be addressed before any damage is beyond correction in the trial court.\u201d <em>Noucas, </em>165 N.H. at 158 (quotation and brackets omitted). It is \u201cthe defendant\u2019s burden to make a sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>specific offer of proof as to the substance of the expected testimony to satisfy the trial court that what he sought to elicit\u201d was relevant. I'd; <em>accord United States v. Adams, </em>271 F.3d 1236, 1241 (10th Cir. 2001) (explaining that \u201cmerely telling the court the content of proposed testimony is not an offer of proof. In order to qualify as an adequate offer of proof, the proponent must, first, describe the evidence and what it tends to show and, second, identify the grounds for admitting the evidence.\u201d (citations, quotations and ellipsis omitted)); <em>People v. Morrison, </em>101 P.3d 568, 586 (Cal. 2004) (\u201cEvidence is properly excluded when the proponent fails to make an adequate offer of proof regarding the relevance or admissibility of the evidence.\u201d); <em>see also Bohan v. Ritzo, </em>141 N.H. 210, 218 (1996) (offer of proof must set \u201cforth the specific basis for admissibility of the proffered evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Here, the defendant failed to make a sufficiently specific offer of proof. Defense counsel asked a question that sought to elicit a statement characterizing the daughter\u2019s relationship with the defendant, which the trial court ruled to be irrelevant. Defense counsel represented that the daughter had knowledge that the defendant had no motive, but counsel never apprised the trial court as to the substance of the daughter\u2019s expected testimony. Indeed, on appeal, the defendant acknowledges that counsel never explained to the trial court whether the daughter would offer opinion, reputation, or specific instances of character testimony. Nor did trial counsel explain how the question to which the State objected would elicit specific testimony relevant to the defendant\u2019s motive, or the lack thereof, or to a pertinent trait of character admissible under Rule 404(a)(1). Given that trial counsel failed to make a sufficiently specific proffer, we conclude that the defendant is precluded from raising this issue on appeal. <em>See So. Willow Properties v.
