On appeal, he argues that the trial court erroneously: (1) determined that he \u201copened the door\u201d to certain otherwise inadmissible evidence; (2) denied his motion for a mistrial during the State\u2019s opening statement; (3) denied his two motions for a mistrial during the State\u2019s closing argument; and (4) failed to conduct an adequate inquiry after excusing one of the deliberating jurors. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\n<em>I. Factual Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The jury could have found the following facts. The victim was born in November 1989. The defendant, the victim\u2019s father, is divorced from her mother. In 2001, when she was twelve years old, the victim lived with him in New Hampshire. One day, the defendant came into the victim\u2019s room and asked to view a scar on her breast. Although she felt \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d and told him \u201cno,\u201d the defendant pulled her shirt down and rubbed her breast for \u201cabout ten minutes.\u201d The defendant told the victim not to tell anyone, and because she was afraid, she complied. After that incident, the victim moved out of the defendant\u2019s home and lived with her mother and stepfather in Maine.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The defendant next assaulted the victim in 2005 when she visited him in New Hampshire for her sixteenth birthday. On the night in question, the defendant gave the victim two beers. While the two watched a movie in the living room, the victim fell asleep. When she awoke, she was lying naked on the defendant\u2019s bed. The defendant was lying naked next to her, rubbing his erect penis against her leg, and \u201crubbing [her] vagina with his hand.\u201d The victim felt \u201creally weird[,] . . . uncomfortable[,] [and] . . . scared\u201d and went across the hall to her own bedroom. The next morning, the defendant \u201csaid he was sorry\u201d for the previous night. The defendant drove the victim back to Maine. Again, because she was afraid, the victim did not tell her mother about the assault. The victim did not report the assaults to the police until five years later, in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">After speaking to the police, the victim was informed by the defendant\u2019s former employer and business partner, Dwight Raymond, that the defendant \u201chad some money.\u201d Raymond, who has known the victim since she was a child, was aware that the defendant had inherited a house, which he had sold for $160,000. He was also aware, generally, of the victim\u2019s allegations against the defendant, having been informed of them by the police. Raymond advised the victim to file a civil lawsuit against the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>because he thought that she deserved some of the defendant\u2019s money. The victim took Raymond\u2019s advice and filed a civil suit against the defendant in Maine. Her lawsuit was still pending when the instant criminal charges were tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The relevance of the Maine lawsuit at the defendant\u2019s criminal trial was the subject of several colloquies between counsel and the court. Before counsel gave opening statements, defense counsel informed the court that she intended to refer to the Maine lawsuit. The State objected, arguing that the lawsuit was irrelevant because it seeks \u201cdamages based on conduct that occurred strictly within . . . Maine.\u201d Defense counsel countered that the victim\u2019s affidavit, supporting her lawsuit, also referred to conduct that occurred in New Hampshire. Defense counsel then stated: \u201cI think we can address the existence of the lawsuit without leaving a misimpression that [the New Hampshire] charge[s] [are] the sole basis of the lawsuit.\u201d She explained: \u201cI think it can be said that there is a lawsuit in... Maine and that part of th[e] [New Hampshire] allegations are included in paperwork in that lawsuit.\u201d The trial court decided that defense counsel could refer to the Maine lawsuit in her opening statement, but ruled that if she created \u201ca misleading impression that the New Hampshire charges are the motivation or the only motivation for the Maine lawsuit,\u201d then the court would allow the State \u201cto make it clear that the lawsuit does not concern only these charged events here in New Hampshire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In accord with the trial court\u2019s decision, defense counsel made the following statements in her opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">[P]eople ... come to Court and [do] not tell the truth for many reasons.... [I]n this case, I will suggest two of them to you. Two motivations, motives for [the victim] to lie to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">First, as the State has already told you, [she] was never close to [the defendant]\u2014 She thought [he] was... nicer to her sister and she didn\u2019t like it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">Second, [the defendant] inherited a home and a sum of money just a couple of years before these allegations came to light. And it also seems that [he] wasn\u2019t going to share any of that money with [the victim]. And [she] needed, and may still need, that money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">[The victim] will tell you during this trial that she\u2019s had problems with money. That she has needed money and needed it badly. And you will find out these allegations are included as part of a lawsuit she has filed in the State of Maine where she lives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">With that, I\u2019m going to ask that you pay attention to [the victimj\u2019s testimony and to her two stories, to her memories, and to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>motives, to her relationship with [the defendant], and to anything she may have to gain by making these allegations against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The State objected, arguing that defense counsel had created \u201ca misimpression that [the New Hampshire allegations are] what the lawsuit is about as opposed to years of sexual and physical abuse, including the specific charged acts in that lawsuit of acts that occurred in Maine.\u201d The State further objected that it was misleading for defense counsel to suggest that the victim\u2019s motivation for bringing the lawsuit \u201cis to make money.\u201d The State contended that it had the \u201cright to argue how much weight, if any, evidence [of the victim\u2019s motive] should be given,\u201d and that it could not \u201cadequately do that [with] the misimpression that this lawsuit was filed ... last year about these things that occurred eight years ago, without the jury knowing that the abuse had occurred before that, between the two [charged] occasions, and also subsequent to the[ ] charged conduct[,] in multiple states.\u201d Defense counsel countered that her statement that the New Hampshire allegations were part of the Maine lawsuit was true and that, therefore, there was no misimpression for the State to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The trial court ruled that defense counsel\u2019s opening statement was misleading to the extent that it suggested that the New Hampshire allegations constituted the sole basis for the Maine lawsuit. The court stated: \u201cIn . . . balance then, looking at [New Hampshire] Rule [of Evidence] 403, as [the defendant] actively decided to open with reference to the lawsuit, of course the State cannot be limited to simply evidence concerning these charges as in support of that lawsuit.\u201d The court observed that a juror \u201clistening carefully\u201d to defense counsel\u2019s opening \u201cwould understand there\u2019s more to that lawsuit.\u201d Accordingly, the court decided that the State was \u201cnot precluded from having the jury understand that there is more to that lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">With regard to the evidence necessary to counter the misleading impression, the State asserted that the victim \u201cshould be allowed to testify what her real motivation is, in that. . . she endured years of physical and emotional and sexual abuse at the hands of this man.\u201d Defense counsel agreed that it would be proper for the victim \u201cto say [that] money isn\u2019t [her] motivating factor\u201d and to \u201csay there are... other reasons why [she\u2019s] suing him in ... Maine beyond just [the New Hampshire allegations].\u201d However, defense counsel argued that it would not be proper for the victim to \u201csay [the defendant] physically and sexually abused [her] over all of these years.\u201d Defense counsel stressed that it would be particularly improper for the victim to testify that she was abused in Maine because the Maine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>allegations had not resulted in criminal charges and because defense counsel had \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that the Maine alleged assaults did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The trial court explained that although the State would be \u201cpermitted to rebut any potentially] misleading impression\u201d by asking the victim questions about her motive for filing the lawsuit, the State would not be allowed to do so by questioning her about \u201cspecific allegations of specific incidents of bad acts such as vaginal penetration in Kennebunk, Maine.\u201d The trial court ruled that with regard to the allegation that the defendant sexually penetrated the victim in Maine, \u201cRule 403... trump[s] the opening the door doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The State then questioned the victim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">Q . . . Why did you agree to go along with this lawsuit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">A Dwight thought that we deserved some money . . . that [the defendant] got from selling a boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">Q . . . Did you believe you deserve this money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-12\">Q Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-13\">A Because everything I went through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-14\">Q And by \u201ceverything\u201d, what do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\">A All the physical abuse and everything I went through from when I was younger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-17\">Q Was that in Maine or New Hampshire or both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-18\">A Maine and New Hampshire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-19\">Q Okay. Are you testifying today in hopes it will help you make money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-21\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-22\">Q Why have you agreed to testify today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-23\">A Because I just want to get this over with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-24\">Q Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-25\">A I don\u2019t want to keep having it inside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-26\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-27\">A. <em>Opening the Door Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-28\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by finding that his counsel\u2019s opening statement \u201copened the door\u201d to the victim\u2019s testimony about his uncharged conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>(\u201call the physical abuse and everything\u201d the victim endured in \u201cMaine and New Hampshire\u201d). The \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine comprises two doctrines governing the admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Wamala, </em>158 N.H. 583, 589 (2009). The first doctrine, \u201ccurative admissibility,\u201d applies when inadmissible prejudicial evidence has been erroneously admitted, and the opponent seeks to introduce testimony to counter the prejudice. <em>Id. </em>The second doctrine, \u201cspecific contradiction,\u201d is more broadly applied to situations in which one party has introduced admissible evidence that creates a misleading advantage and the opponent is then permitted to introduce previously suppressed or otherwise inadmissible evidence to counter the misleading advantage. <em>Id. </em>Here, we are concerned only with the specific contradiction doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">For this doctrine to apply, a party must introduce evidence that provides a justification, beyond mere relevance, for the opponent\u2019s introduction of evidence that may not otherwise be admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 589-90. However, the initial evidence must have reasonably misled the fact finder in some way. <em>Id. </em>at 590. The rule, thus, prevents a party from successfully excluding evidence favorable to his opponent and then selectively introducing some of this evidence for his own advantage, without allowing the opponent to place the evidence in proper context. <em>Id. </em>The fact that the \u201cdoor has been opened\u201d does not permit all evidence to pass through because the doctrine is intended to prevent prejudice and is not to be subverted into a rule for the injection of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe trial court is in the best position to gauge the prejudicial impact of particular testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201cwe will not upset the trial court\u2019s ruling on whether the defendant opened the door to prejudicial rebuttal evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The defendant contends that his counsel\u2019s statement that the New Hampshire allegations \u201care included as part of\u2019 the Maine lawsuit was accurate, and, therefore, did not mislead the jury. <em>See id. </em>According to the State, <em>that </em>statement did not create the misleading impression. The State asserts that the misleading impression was created by defense counsel\u2019s implied assertions that the victim\u2019s motive for bringing the Maine lawsuit was greed (\u201cshe has needed money and needed it badly\u201d) and that the Maine lawsuit provided a motive for her to fabricate (\u201cpay attention ... to anything she may have to gain by making these allegations against [the defendant]\u201d). The defendant counters that the victim\u2019s \u201cpecuniary motivation was not misleading evidence, but was rather the conclusion the defense hoped the jury would draw from the facts relating to the civil suit.\u201d He argues that \u201c[t]he fact that the State disagrees with the inference the defense will urge the jury to draw\u201d from the evidence \u201cdoes not make that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>evidence, or the defense\u2019s theory, misleading.\u201d We believe that whether defense counsel\u2019s opening statement created any misleading impression is an arguable point. <em>See State v. Blackstock, </em>147 N.H. 791, 797 (2002). We also recognize that the trial court carefully considered the parties\u2019 competing positions when it concluded that a misleading impression was created. However, for the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the trial court erred by so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We next consider whether the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of the defendant\u2019s case. The State asserts that the defendant \u201ceffectively waived\u201d any claim of prejudice. The State contends that the defendant conceded in the trial court that \u201cthe State properly could inform the jury that the victim had made \u2018additional allegations relating to stuff in Maine.\u2019 \u201d However, the State has quoted defense counsel\u2019s statement out of context. At this point in the proceeding, defense counsel was arguing that her opening statement was not misleading. The trial court had not yet ruled to the contrary. Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the defendant did not waive his argument that admitting evidence of the uncharged acts was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The defendant contends that admitting the testimony constituted an unsustainable exercise of discretion because it conveyed to the jury that he had committed other crimes against the victim. We disagree. Here, the trial court twice instructed the jury that it could not consider the allegations in the victim\u2019s civil lawsuit for their truth. In other words, the jury was specifically instructed that it could not consider whether the uncharged acts alleged in the victim\u2019s civil lawsuit in fact occurred. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s limiting instructions, which the jury is presumed to follow, \u201cminimized the possibility that the jury would misuse the evidence, thus reducing the potential for unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Costello, </em>159 N.H. 113, 123 (2009). Under these circumstances, we hold that the defendant has failed to carry his burden of establishing that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\n<em>B. Motions for Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The defendant next challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions for mistrial. \u2018We will not overturn the trial court\u2019s decision on whether a mistrial or other remedial action is necessary absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Bisbee, </em>165 N.H. 61, 68 (2013) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\n<em>1. Motion for Mistrial During Opening Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">We first address the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial based upon the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. \u201cThe standard for reversible error in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s opening statement is that the prosecutor must be shown to have acted in bad faith, the opening statement must be completely unsupported by the evidence, <em>and </em>the defendant must be prejudiced thereby.\u201d <em>State v. Dayutis, </em>127 N.H. 101, 103 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In her opening statement, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">[The victim] will tell you [that]... when she was about 12 years old, she moved back in with... her dad... because she missed her sister, really. She will also tell you that not long after moving in with her father,... he became verbally and physically abusive to her and her sister.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The defense objected to that statement, and the trial court sustained the objection, although it denied the defense motion for a mistrial. The court then issued the following curative instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">All right. Thank you, jurors, for your patience as I resolved that. . . issue of. . . law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">And the bottom . . . line is as I . . . indicated at the outset, opening statements are not to be argument, among other things. And, accordingly, I sustained the objection that was posed on behalf of [the defendant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">[W]hich means that. . . the last statement made by counsel is stricken from the record. I... assume that you understand that, jurors, but I should make it clear. It\u2019s stricken; not to be considered by you in any way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">We assume, without deciding, that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was improper. However, there is no evidence that the prosecutor acted in bad faith. Moreover, any possible prejudice produced by the statement was negated by the court\u2019s curative instruction to the jury. <em>See State v. Hearns, </em>151 N.H. 226, 233-34 (2004). Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial based upon the challenged comment by the prosecutor in her opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">\n<em>2. Motions for Mistrial During Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">We next address the motions for mistrial based upon the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. \u201cIn examining claims of prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument, we face the delicate task of balancing a prosecutor\u2019s broad license to fashion argument with the need to ensure that a defendant\u2019s rights are not compromised in the process.\u201d <em>Bisbee, </em>165 N.H. at 68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>(quotation omitted). \u201cA prosecutor may draw reasonable inferences from the facts proven and has great latitude in closing argument to both summarize and discuss the evidence presented to the jury and to urge them to draw inferences of guilt from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). At the same time, \u201cthere must be limits to pleas of pure passion and there must be restraints against blatant appeals to bias and prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cMistrial is the proper remedy only if the evidence or comment complained of is not merely improper, but is so prejudicial that it constitutes ah irreparable injustice- that cannot be cured by jury instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe trial court is in the best position to determine what remedy will adequately correct the prejudice created by a prosecutor\u2019s remarks, and absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion, we will not overturn its decision.\u201d <em>Hearns, </em>151 N.H. at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">\n<em>a. First Motion for Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">During her closing argument, defense counsel told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">[The victim] testified that she didn\u2019t go to the police station [after the November-Deeember 2005 assault], which was next door. She didn\u2019t call the police and she didn\u2019t call 911. [The victim] then says that the next morning, [the defendant] apologized. So here in court, she said very specifically that at the time he apologized, she knew what he was referring to. Even though, in November of 2010, when specifically asked that question [by the police], she said she didn\u2019t know what [the defendant] was talking about. She now says she knows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">[The defendant] never threatened her, never asked her not to tell, nothing according to her testimony but she doesn\u2019t tell her mom when she gets home. She doesn\u2019t tell the police. She said she was afraid but she also told you that she ... was having very little contact with her dad during this period of time. She said that her relationship with him was basically non-existent. That was how she characterized it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">... She didn\u2019t tell police, in November [2010] anything about the time when she was 12 and this alleged touching of her left breast, where she says that [the defendant] spent 10 minutes rubbing her left breast when she was 12 years old. She didn\u2019t mention that in November either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">I can\u2019t tell you why [the victim] is making these accusations. I can\u2019t tell you what relationship there may be between these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>accusations and Dwight Raymond and this lawsuit but you\u2019re not here to figure that out. It isn\u2019t your job to sort out what is going on with this case any more than it is my job to explain it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">When you consider the evidence that\u2019s been presented, what I\u2019ve said about memory and motives should be forefront in your mind. [The victim\u2019s] testimony is not consistent with the way that memories work. [The victim] has motives to lie.... [S]he has told you about a lawsuit that these allegations are part of. These allegations are not true. [The defendant] is innocent and the testimony has done absolutely nothing to dispel that presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The State then argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">You heard the testimony of a brave young woman, [the victim], who told you about a secret that she has carried with her for several years; a secret that she told you about because she no longer wanted to keep it inside; a secret of how her father sexually abused her when she was 12 and when she was 16 years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">[The victim] told you that when she was 12 years old and she and her father were alone in his house ... , he came into her bedroom and pulled down her shirt and groped and rubbed her chest \u2014 her breast. He did this when the two of them were alone in the house so no one would know. She told you how uncomfortable that made her feel and that she didn\u2019t tell anyone because her father told her not to tell and she was afraid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">[After the incident when the victim was sixteen], [o]nce again, she was afraid to tell. She was afraid to tell because she did not know what her father would do because of the physical abuse she suffered \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Defense counsel objected to the statement, \u201cShe was afraid to tell because she did not know what her father would do because of the physical abuse she suffered.\u201d Defense counsel argued, \u201cAt no point did this witness ever[ ] say that she feared physical abuse from [the defendant] if she told. It\u2019s ... not part of the evidence in the case____\u201d Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, contending that the trial court allowed the victim\u2019s testimony about physical abuse only to counter the misleading impression about her motive caused by defense counsel\u2019s opening statement. Defense counsel argued that the victim\u2019s testimony about why she sued the defendant in Maine \u201cwas not ... let in for any purpose\u201d other than to counter that misleading impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The trial court agreed with defense counsel, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">She did say that she was afraid on the stand but I did not let the testimony about the allegations in the lawsuit in for the truth of the underlying assertion. I let it in because the door was open by the Defense concerning the lawsuit and that lawsuit\u2019s motivation for her to be fabricating here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">To take it to the next step takes [it] directly into [Rule] 404(b) and I did not let it in for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection, but denied the motion for a mistrial. The trial court then issued the following curative instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">[J]urors, as I will discuss in my instructions to you after lunch; some evidence is admitted only to assist you in judging the credibility of witnesses, not for whether the underlying assertion is true or not. Such is the case of the evidence that was just referred to by the Prosecutor in her closing argument. Accordingly, I strike that portion of the last phrase of her closing argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we must determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks amounted to impermissible comments.\u201d <em>Hearns, </em>151 N.H. at 232. Unlike the trial court, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not improper. \u201c[T]he prosecutor\u2019s comments here were a permissible response to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument.\u201d <em>State v. Ainsworth, </em>151 N.H. 691, 698 (2005). In her closing argument, defense counsel specifically referenced the victim\u2019s motive for accusing the defendant of sexual assault: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you why [the victim] is making these accusations.\u201d Defense counsel implied that there was a relationship between the victim\u2019s accusations and the Maine lawsuit: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what relationship there may be between these accusations and Dwight Raymond and this lawsuit but you\u2019re not here to figure that out.\u201d Defense counsel specifically told the jury that the victim \u201chas motives to lie\u201d and intimated that the Maine lawsuit provided such a motive. Defense counsel also implied that the victim\u2019s failure to promptly report the charged assaults demonstrated that the assaults never happened: \u201c[S]he didn\u2019t go to the police station, which was next door. She didn\u2019t call the police and she didn\u2019t call 911____[S]he [didn\u2019t] tell her mom when she [got] home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">The State\u2019s assertion that the victim did not immediately disclose the charged assaults because she was \u201cafraid\u201d was a permissible evidence-based response to defense counsel\u2019s implied assertions that the victim\u2019s allegations against the defendant were untrue and were made to advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>her position in her civil lawsuit. The victim specifically testified that she did not disclose the charged assaults when they happened because she was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cafraid\u201d to do so. To the extent that the State\u2019s reference to the \u201cphysical abuse\u201d the victim suffered could have been interpreted as a reference to the alleged uncharged assaults in Maine, the trial court\u2019s instruction cured any possible prejudice the comments could have caused. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial based upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>b. Second Motion for Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The defendant again moved for mistrial after the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">[The victim] told you that she filed a civil suit in Maine against her father. She told you why she filed the civil suit because of physical abuse. She told you that filing the civil suit against her father was not her idea and that Dwight Raymond suggested that she file the lawsuit. Dwight Raymond\u2019s testimony corroborates that fact about what [the victim] told you. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">If [the victim] filed a civil suit in Maine because of physical abuse, that would not give her a motive to testify about sexual abuse in New Hampshire, however, years of what happened to her as stated in the civil suit of abuse would give her motive. It would give her motive not to tell, not to get her father angry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s statements and argued that a mistrial was warranted because the State did not merely refer to the physical abuse allegation in the civil suit as a motive for bringing that suit, but also as a motive for the victim\u2019s delay in reporting the defendant\u2019s sexual assaults. Defense counsel argued that because this was the second time that the State had improperly referred to the physical abuse allegation, a mistrial with prejudice was required. The State explained that \u201c[t]here was no intent on [its] part... to do what it was told not to do in this case.\u201d The prosecutor stated that she made the error, but not in bad faith, because she mistakenly did not strike all references to the physical abuse allegation from her previously-prepared written closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The trial court ruled that the State\u2019s comment constituted \u201can improper argument,\u201d but that a mistrial, either with or without prejudice, was not required. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">It is not. . . does not, for instance, tr[ea]d into constitutionally impermissible territory, such as a comment on Defendant\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>to testify or comment on a failure of a Defendant to rebut an assertion made by the State or evidence presented by the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">So, mistrial... with or without prejudice is denied. Prosecutor indicates that she was . . . reading from a pre-prepared closing argument and neglected to redact in light of my prior ruling. I accept that representation although I do stress that I thought my prior ruling was clear. It does warrant a clear and unequivocal instruction from me to the jury as to what is and is not proper argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">And as much as I hate to do it, I think it is necessary that I inform the jury that that portion... of [the State\u2019s] argument was improper argument and to use that phrase and I believe it is not only warranted but necessary to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The trial court then instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">[J]urors, welcome back. In a moment, I\u2019m going to turn the floor back over to [the prosecutor] to complete her closing argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">First though, I do want to be clear about this. I let in evidence concerning allegations made in a civil lawsuit in Maine for a very limited purpose; the sole purpose, to the extent that you may find it helpful or not, of aiding you in your ability to make determinations about the credibility of the testimony of a witness, specifically, [the victim\u2019s] testimony and not for any purpose other than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">Whether those allegations in a civil lawsuit are true or not true have no bearing on any issue in this case. No direct bearing certainly. And accordingly, it would be impermissible and improper for you to consider whether those allegations are true or not. Likewise, that makes it improper, impermissible for the State to make any argument or even a suggestion to you as to whether the allegations in the civil [suit] are true or not and to the extent that you understood the State to be making references to the allegations in the civil suit and understood those references to make any direct or indirect statement or implication as to the truth of those allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">That\u2019s improper argument and it is stricken from this case. I\u2019ve told the attorneys that I was going to tell you that and that, accordingly, the last portion that you heard of [the prosecutor\u2019s] closing argument concerning the allegations in that civil suit is stricken. In your own minds, you need to consider this case as if those arguments had never been made. They are not proper arguments and are not in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>I\u2019ve told the attorney[s] that that was my ruling. I\u2019ve also told them that I\u2019m turning the case back over to [the prosecutor] for completion of her closing argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">And I should say as [the prosecutor] retakes the podium, that I do expect you to follow that instruction as you would follow all other instructions that I give you during the course of this case and in my final instructions after lunch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Here, even if the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper, the trial court\u2019s thorough instruction cured any possible prejudice. Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s second motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\n<em>C. Investigation of Juror Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Before the second day of jury deliberations began, Juror No. 10 asked to speak to the court. Outside of the presence of the other jurors, the juror presented the court with the following note, which was entered as an exhibit and given to counsel and the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">I thought I had better [write] this down as ... I might not be able to correctly convey my thoughts, in the spoken word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">First I think you have an outstanding jury .... I am proud to be associated with [it]. We discussed many points and explored many avenues but always someone would ask whether the point was within the parameters and scope of your instructions. I am sure they will work hard and do a good job; I only hope they get it right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">One of the things that puzzled us was why she was the only victim and why the sister didn\u2019t testify. I had these things on my mind on the drive home; it couldn\u2019t have hit me harder if I drove into a telephone pole. I know why, I know everything, this isn\u2019t his first time, this son of a bitch has been doing this all along. Why did he take the older girl? Because she w\u00e1s ripe, (please excuse that vulgarity but that\u2019s the way this guy thinks) the son of a bitch has been raping her too. What was the other matter the cops were discussing when this came to light? It was her sister\u2019s rape when they asked her if dear old dad was raping her too. Why didn\u2019t the state put the sister on the stand? Because if they did all this would come out and you would have to declare a mistrial, no jury can hear what I know and remain impartial. The state is saving her sister as insurance, in case we get it wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Your honor I knew this guy was guilty before I came to this revelation, based on the evidence legally presented. In the logical part of my mind I know these are two different cases but I also know I can no longer be impartial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">Please apologize to the rest of [the] jurors but it can\u2019t be helped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The trial court then had the following exchange with the juror:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">THE COURT: [M]y concern now, I\u2019m telling you ..., is whether the whole jury can proceed or not, and so I need to back up and ask whether you\u2019ve shared any of these thoughts \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">JUROR NO. 10: Not a soul. They didn\u2019t even know I was going to leave the room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">THE COURT: [D]id this come to you overnight, during the overnight break?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">JUROR NO. 10: [Last night] ... I was asking myself that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-11\">THE COURT: [I] just want to be sure that during deliberations, that none of this was on your mind; that you could not have shared any of this information with other jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-12\">JUROR NO. 10: None of that. I recalled that on my way home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">After this colloquy, the State asked that the juror be dismissed and that one of the alternates serve in his place. The defendant moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied. He does not challenge that denial on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">The court then conducted limited <em>voir dire </em>of the remaining jurors to determine whether to allow the jury to proceed. Specifically, the court asked each juror whether he or she would be able to \u201cset aside . . . deliberations that have occurred to this point\u201d and to base his or her \u201cdecision on the evidence from trial and [the court\u2019s] instructions of law.\u201d All of the jurors answered \u201cyes\u201d to both questions, except for one, who answered \u201cno\u201d to both. This juror was questioned more specifically outside of the presence of the other jurors and then was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>of the remaining jurors was insufficient to determine whether they considered the same improper matters as Juror No. 10 \u2014 <em>e.g., </em>the failure of the victim\u2019s sister to testify and speculation as to whether the defendant had sexually assaulted the sister. However, as the State aptly observes, the defendant has not preserved this argument for our review. At no time did defense counsel argue to the trial court that its limited <em>voir dire </em>of the remaining jurors was in any way deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Even if preserved, the defendant\u2019s argument is unavailing. \u201cIt is axiomatic that a defendant has a right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>State v. Bathalon, </em>146 N.H. 485, 487 (2001). \u201cAny juror found to be disqualified before or during trial should be removed.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>RSA 500-A:12, II (2010) (\u201cIf it appears that any juror is not indifferent, he shall be set aside on that trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Because the defendant has made no claim of extrinsic contact or communication in this case, we are concerned here only with possible improper intra-jury communication. <em>See State v. Bader, </em>148 N.H. 265, 279 (2002). \u201cIn these circumstances, the burden of proving actual prejudice rests with the defendant.\u201d <em>Bathalon, </em>146 N.H. at 488 (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cWhen confronted with an allegation of improper intra-jury conduct, especially where it was alleged that a juror prematurely concluded guilt or innocence and communicated an opinion to.other jurors, the trial court should generally remove the offending juror from the panel and undertake individual <em>voir dire </em>...\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe trial court is obviously in the best position to observe the impact of premature jury discussions of guilt and to observe the mood at trial and the predilections of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). This is a fact-specific determination that we review for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Bader, </em>148 N.H. at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Here, the trial court not only excused the juror who disclosed his conclusions, but also assured itself, after careful <em>voir dire </em>of the remaining jurors, that no prejudice had affected the panel. <em>See Bathalon, </em>146 N.H. at 488. Absent proof of actual prejudice, it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine the nature and extent of its inquiry into the situation. <em>Bader, </em>148 N.H. at 279. Thus, even if the defendant\u2019s argument were preserved, we cannot conclude that the nature and scope of the trial court\u2019s inquiry into potential intra-juror misconduct constituted an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-8\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
