Peter Taylor </em>on the brief and orally), for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-19\"><em>Wing &amp; Weintraub, PC., </em>of Milford <em>(David C. Wing </em>on the brief and orally), for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-20\">CONBOY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4b\">The respondent, Hellen Couture, appeals an order of the 7th Circuit Court \u2014 Dover Probate Division <em>(Cassavechia, </em>J.), which granted the petition of the petitioner, Thomas Couture, the adult son of the decedent, Luden Couture, to impose a constructive trust, for the benefit of the decedent\u2019s heirs, over certain life insurance proceeds paid to the respondent upon the decedent\u2019s death. We affirm and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-21\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-22\">The parties either do not dispute, or the record establishes, the following facts. The petition for a constructive trust is grounded upon the claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the respondent, the decedent\u2019s wife, through fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation, induced the decedent to marry her after she gave birth to a daughter whom she claimed was his. The $140,000 life insurance proceeds were paid equally to the respondent and to the daughter pursuant to the decedent\u2019s beneficiary designation. The petitioner sought a constructive trust over only the respondent\u2019s portion of the insurance proceeds, which were placed in escrow when the petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The respondent and the decedent married in September 2008, a few days after the child was born. The child\u2019s birth certificate lists the decedent as her father. Although the decedent had had a vasectomy many years before the respondent\u2019s pregnancy, he did not question whether the child was his biological child. Nor did he seek medical confirmation or further evaluation as to whether he could have fathered the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Following their marriage, the decedent, the respondent, and the child did not live together as a family. Instead, the decedent lived in Rochester, and the respondent and the child lived together in Somersworth. Unbeknownst to the decedent, the respondent had a concurrent relationship with John Tamara. The trial court found the relationship was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d a marriage. The respondent and Tamara continued their relationship throughout the respondent\u2019s marriage to the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In December 2005, the decedent designated the respondent and the child as his beneficiaries of a death benefit payable under an employer-provided life insurance policy. In October or November 2007, Tamara, the respondent, and her daughter moved to Hawaii. The respondent and her daughter returned to New Hampshire in 2008 and lived with the decedent for approximately one month. In August 2008, the decedent filed a petition to divorce the respondent. On January 7, 2009, only days before the final divorce hearing was scheduled to occur, the decedent committed suicide. He died intestate. Pursuant to the subject beneficiary designation form, fifty percent of the death benefit was paid to the respondent and fifty percent was paid to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">In February 2009, the decedent\u2019s sister brought the petition for a constructive trust. When it was determined that the sister lacked standing, the court allowed the petitioner to be substituted as a party. In November 2011, the respondent moved to dismiss the petition on the grounds that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to impose a constructive trust on her share of the life insurance proceeds, and that the instant claim was not yet justiciable. The trial court denied the motion, and the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Based upon the evidence at trial, the trial court found that the petitioner had established by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent wrongfully induced the decedent to marry her, even though she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>already married to Tamara, \u201cor at least in a more intimate marriage-like relationship with him.\u201d The trial court further found that the decedent provided life insurance death benefits to the respondent that \u201cwere spousal-based,\u201d and that it would be unconscionable for her to retain them \u201cgiven her bad faith, deceit and misrepresentations.\u201d The trial court decided that if the respondent were allowed to retain the proceeds, she would be unjustly enriched. Accordingly, the court imposed a constructive trust on the respondent\u2019s share of the life insurance proceeds. The trial court denied the respondent\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Our standard of review of a probate division decision is determined by statute: \u201cThe findings of fact of the judge of probate are final unless they are so plainly erroneous that such findings could not be reasonably made.\u201d RSA 567-A:4 (2007). Consequently, we will not disturb the probate division\u2019s decree unless it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law. <em>See In re Angel N., </em>141 N.H. 158, 161 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\n<em>A. Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\"> The respondent first argues that the petitioner lacks \u201cstanding\u201d in the instant dispute, even though he is one of the decedent\u2019s heirs, and even though she concedes in her brief that \u201c[i]n the event that the constructive trust is upheld,\u201d the life insurance proceeds will be \u201caward[ed] ... to the Estate.\u201d \u201cIn evaluating whether a party has standing to sue, we focus on whether the party suffered a legal injury against which the law was designed to protect.\u201d <em>Libertarian Party of N.H. v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>158 N.H. 194, 195 (2008) (quotation omitted). Here, the petitioner has standing to seek a constructive trust because, as one of the decedent\u2019s heirs, he has a direct legal or equitable interest in the decedent\u2019s estate. <em>See </em>RSA 561:1 (2007); <em>cf. In re Estate of Kelly, </em>130 N.H. 773, 778 (1988) (\u201c[A] will contestant must generally have some direct legal or equitable interest in the decedent\u2019s estate\u201d to have standing in an action challenging a will\u2019s validity.).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">We disagree with the respondent\u2019s argument that the petitioner lacks standing because, she, as the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse, will be the ultimate recipient of the life insurance proceeds pursuant to the intestate succession statute. <em>See </em>RSA 561:1. As the trial court correctly observed, upon imposition of the constructive trust, the respondent merely holds the life insurance proceeds \u201cas constructive trustee for the benefit of [the decedent\u2019s] heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>We similarly reject the respondent\u2019s contention that the petitioner \u201chas no legal or equitable rights at stake in the life insurance proceeds\u201d because' he is not the decedent\u2019s named beneficiary. Her reliance upon the beneficiary form is mistaken. Because the proceeds have already been distributed according to the beneficiary form, the fact that the petitioner is not named as a beneficiary is immaterial, and does not divest him of standing to pursue a constructive trust on the respondent\u2019s share of those proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\n<em>B. Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The respondent hext asserts that this case falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(2006 &amp; Supp. 2012). Although there is no dispute that the life insurance plan at issue is an ERISA-covered benefit plan, the respondent is mistaken in her assertion that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over this petition for a constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">ERISA\u2019s jurisdictional provision states: \u201cExcept for actions under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this subchapter brought by the Secretary or by a participant, beneficiary, fiduciary, or any person referred to in \u00a7 1021(f)(1) of this title.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1) (2006). Section 1021(f)(1) refers to: (1) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; (2) plan participants; (3) plan beneficiaries; (4) employers; and (5) labor organizations. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1021(f)(1) (Supp. 2012). As we explain below, this is not a \u201ccivil action under [ERISA].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1). However, even if it were, the exclusive jurisdiction provision does not apply because the petitioner is not a person to whom section 1021(f)(1) refers. The respondent\u2019s reliance upon <em>Appeal of A &amp; J Beverage Distribution, </em>163 N.H. 228 (2012), is misplaced. In that case, the petitioner <em>was </em>a plan participant. <em>See Appeal of A &amp; J Beverage Distribution, </em>163 N.H. at 230, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\n<em>C. ERISA Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\n<em>1. Express Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Alternatively, the respondent contends that the petitioner\u2019s state law constructive trust claim is preempted by a section of ERISA, which provides that ERISA \u201csupersede^] any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d described in the statute. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) (2006); <em>see Appeal of A &amp; J Beverage Distribution, </em>163 N.H. at 232. As we explained in <em>Appeal of A &amp; J Beverage Distribution, </em>163 N.H. at 232, \u201c[e]arly interpretations of this language by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the United States Supreme Court relied heavily upon textual analysis and a dictionary definition of \u2018relate to\u2019 and led to the conclusion that ERISA preemption was \u2018conspicuous for its breadth.\u2019 \u201d (Quotation omitted.) Thus, in <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, </em>498 U.S. 133, 139 (1990), the Court held that \u201c[a] law \u2018relates to\u2019 an employee benefit plan, ... if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Relying upon those early interpretations of ERISA preemption, the respondent argues that the petitioner\u2019s claim is preempted because it \u201cis a claim against death benefits from a life insurance policy pursuant to an employee welfare benefit plan.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) However, as we also explained in <em>Appeal of A &amp; J Beverage Distribution, </em>163 N.H. at 232, the Supreme Court has since \u201cabandoned] strict textualism in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d to ERISA preemption. (Quotation omitted.) Under the new approach, \u201cpreemption issues must be decided by examining the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive, as well as the nature of the state law\u2019s effect on ERISA plans.\u201d <em>Appeal of A &amp; J Beverage Distribution, </em>163 N.H. at 232 (quotation omitted). Thus, the Court identified three categories of state laws that \u201crelate to\u201d ERISA plans such that their preemption furthers the purpose of ERISA: (1) state laws that mandate employee benefit structures or their administration; (2) state laws that bind plan administrators to a particular choice; and (3) state law causes of action that provide alternative enforcement mechanisms to ERISA\u2019s enforcement regime. <em>Id. </em>at 233; <em>see Hampers v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., Inc., </em>202 F.3d 44, 51 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In <em>Appeal of A &amp; J Beverage Distribution, </em>we concluded that the petitioner\u2019s state law whistleblower claim implicated the third category. <em>See Appeal of A &amp; J Beverage Distribution, </em>163 N.H. at 233. We then held that because ERISA provides a remedy for the conduct alleged in the petitioner\u2019s state law whistleblower complaint, his state law claim constituted a cause of action that provided an alternative enforcement mechanism to ERISA\u2019s enforcement regime, and, therefore, was preempted by ERISA. <em>Id. </em>at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Although the respondent argues that the petitioner\u2019s action here is also an action to redress an ERISA violation, we disagree. The petitioner\u2019s action is a state law action to impose a constructive trust on benefits that have already been paid according to the life insurance policy. Here, the plan administrator <em>complied </em>with ERISA by paying the benefits pursuant to the decedent\u2019s benefit designation form. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D) (2006) (directing administrator of ERISA-covered benefit plan to discharge her duties \u201cin accordance with the documents and instruments governing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>plan\u201d); <em>see also Kennedy v. Plan Administrator for DuPont Sav. and Investment Plan, </em>555 U.S. 285, 304 (2009) (holding that an ERISA plan administrator must distribute benefits to the beneficiary named in the plan). As the trial court here stated: \u201cNone of the parties to this action have any issue with the employment benefit plan.\u201d To the extent that the respondent contends that ERISA provides a remedy equivalent to a common law constructive trust, she has failed to brief this argument sufficiently for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>2. Conflict Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We also reject the respondent\u2019s assertion that the petitioner\u2019s state law constructive trust claim conflicts with, and, therefore, is preempted by, ERISA\u2019s anti-alienation provision, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1) (2006). The anti-alienation provision provides: \u201cEach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The respondent argues that this provision not only required the plan administrators in this case to distribute the life insurance proceeds to her, but also precluded the petitioner from seeking to prevent her from retaining them.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u201cBy its terms, the anti-alienation provision . . . requires a plan to provide expressly that benefits be neither \u2018assigned\u2019 nor \u2018alienated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>555 U.S. at 292. There is nothing in the plain language of the provision to indicate Congressional intent to preclude an action by the estate of a deceased plan participant to recover benefits already paid to a plan beneficiary. <em>See Hoult v. Hoult, </em>373 F.3d 47, 54 (1st Cir. 2004). \u201cIf Congress had intended [ERISA\u2019s anti-alienation provision] to reach that far, it could easily have employed the type of language found [in other statutes], which prohibit[ ] attachment of benefits \u2018either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The respondent contends that the policy objectives of the anti-alienation provision will be thwarted if she is not permitted to retain her share of the life insurance proceeds. In so arguing, she relies primarily upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kennedy. Kennedy </em>involved a suit by the estate of a deceased plan participant against an ERISA plan administrator for wrongfully distributing the plan\u2019s proceeds to the participant\u2019s ex-spouse. <em>Kennedy, </em>555 U.S. at 289-90. Before the couple divorced, the participant (husband) had designated his then-wife as the sole beneficiary of his savings and investment plan. <em>Id. </em>at 289. In the divorce decree, the wife purported to waive her right to the plan proceeds. <em>Id. </em>However, the husband never removed the wife as beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>Despite the divorce decree, the plan administrator paid the proceeds to the wife. <em>Id. </em>at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The Supreme Court ruled that the plan administrator did not violate ERISA by ignoring the wife\u2019s purported waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 299-300. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>decided that an ERISA plan administrator must distribute benefits to the beneficiary named in the plan regardless of any state-law waiver purporting to divest that beneficiary of her right to them. <em>Id. </em>at 304. However, the Court explicitly left open the question of whether, once the plan administrator distributes the benefits, the decedent\u2019s estate may enforce the waiver against the plan beneficiary. <em>See id. </em>at 299, n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The Court \u201cemphasized two important policy considerations in explaining its holding.\u201d <em>Estate of Kensinger v. URL Pharma, Inc., </em>674 F.3d 131, 135 (3d Cir. 2012). \u201cFirst, it stated that ERISA\u2019s well-established policy favoring uniform and efficient plan administration would be undermined if employers had to consider benefit claims from sources extrinsic to plan documents.\u201d <em>Id.; see Kennedy, </em>555 U.S. at 300-01. \u201cSecond, [it] explained that its holding was necessary in order to avoid subjecting plan administrators to potential double liability.\u201d <em>Estate of Kensinger, </em>674 F.3d at 135; <em>see Kennedy, </em>555 U.S. at 301. Allowing the estate to sue the plan administrator for disbursing the proceeds to the named beneficiary \u201cwould have placed the administrator in a hopeless bind: if it honored the waiver, it could be sued by the named beneficiary for disregarding the mandate of ERISA; if it honored the plan documents, it could be sued by the estate for disregarding [the]. . . waiver.\u201d <em>Estate of Kensinger, </em>674 F.3d at 135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Contrary to the respondent\u2019s assertions, \u201c[t]hese two concerns \u2014 the need for straightforward administration of plans and the avoidance of potential liability \u2014 ... are not implicated here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136. The constructive trust action brought against the respondent, after she received her share of the life insurance proceeds, does not implicate the administration of the decedent\u2019s life insurance plan. <em>See id. </em>As the trial court aptly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">If imposed, a constructive trust would not interfere with or disrupt the transfer of the insurance proceeds to [the respondent]. The money has already been paid out by the insurer and is currently being held in escrow.... Accordingly, if the remedy of constructive trust is ultimately awarded, it will be funded with the money now held in escrow \u25a0 \u2014 \u2022 not with an insurance policy or property rights under it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Although the Supreme Court also stated that an important ERISA objective was to \u201censur[e] that beneficiaries get what\u2019s coming quickly, without the folderol essential under less-certain rules,\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>555 U.S. at 301 (quotation omitted), this refers to the \u201cexpeditious distribution of funds from plan administrators.\u201d <em>Estate of Kensinger, </em>674 F.3d at 136 (emphasis omitted); <em>see Andochick v. Byrd, </em>709 F.3d 296, 299 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>134 S. Ct. 235 (2013). Imposing a constructive trust on the proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>in this case does not prevent the beneficiary from \u201cgetfting] what\u2019s coming quickly\u201d from the plan itself. <em>Kennedy, </em>555 U.S. at 301 (quotation omitted). Rather, it merely prevents her from retaining what she \u201cquickly\u201d received. <em>See Andochick, </em>709 F.3d at 300 (quotation omitted). As other courts have observed, there is \u201ca fundamental difference between state law causes of action that challenge a plan beneficiary\u2019s right to <em>receive </em>the proceeds of an ERISA plan and those that seek to challenge a plan beneficiary\u2019s right to <em>keep </em>the proceeds of an ERISA plan.\u201d <em>Brown ex rel. Estate of Sanger v. Wright, </em>511 F. Supp. 2d 850, 853 (E.D. Mich. 2007). As one commentator has explained: \u201cOnce the proceeds are distributed, the person seeking recovery of [them] is no longer seeking a determination of the beneficiary under the plan, but is instead challenging who has the continuing right to retain the proceeds.\u201d Comment, <em>When Happily Ever After is Not Ever After, After All: Rectifying the Plan Documents Rule Under ERISA to Benefit the Right Person, </em>52 S. Tex. L. Rev. 127, 133 (2010). Here, because the respondent has already received her share of the life insurance proceeds, we conclude that ERISA does not bar the petitioner\u2019s constructive trust action.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Federal courts have held that ERISA does not preempt post-disbursement suits against ERISA beneficiaries in similar contexts. <em>See Andochick, </em>709 F.3d at 301 (\u201cadopting] the same view as every published appellate opinion to address the question\u201d); <em>Estate of Kensinger, </em>674 F.3d at 132 (in case of first impression, court decides that estate may bring action directly against beneficiary to recover proceeds paid to her pursuant to beneficiary designation form); <em>Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, </em>39 F.3d 1078, 1080-83 (10th Cir. 1994) (affirming, <em>en banc, </em>imposition of trust on distributed proceeds from ERISA plan); <em>Central States, SE &amp; SW Areas Pension v. Howell, </em>227 F.3d 672, 678-79 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that constructive trust could be imposed on employee welfare plan benefits after distribution to beneficiary). <em>But see Staelens ex rel. Estate of Staelens v. Staelens, </em>677 F. Supp. 2d 499, 508 (D. Mass. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">That the petitioner should be able to bring a constructive trust action against the respondent \u201cfinds further support in a line of federal cases holding that creditors can sue named beneficiaries to recover plan benefits once those benefits have been distributed.\u201d <em>Estate of Kensinger, </em>674 F.3d at 137. \u201cA number of circuits,\u201d including the First Circuit Court of Appeals, \u201chave held that even though ERISA prevents a creditor from encumbering [benefit payments] <em>held by a plan administrator, </em>the funds are no longer entitled to ERISA\u2019s protections against the creditor\u2019s claims <em>once they are paid to the beneficiary.\u201d Id.; see Kickham Hanley PC v. Kodak Retirement Income Plan, </em>558 F.3d 204, 211 (2d Cir. 2009) (\u201cOnly once the proceeds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the pension plan have been released to the beneficiary\u2019s hands, can creditors and others pursue claims against the funds and the funds\u2019 owners[s].\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cox, </em>447 F.3d 967, 974 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201cThis circuit, along with a majority of the other circuits, has held that once benefits payments have been disbursed to a beneficiary, creditors may encumber the proceeds.\u201d); <em>Hoult, </em>373 F.3d at 54-55 (holding that once benefits have been distributed to a beneficiary, a creditor\u2019s rights are enforceable against that beneficiary). \u201cThe same principle is equally applicable here.\u201d <em>Estate of Kensinger, </em>674 F.3d at 138. If a creditor may enforce its rights against a beneficiary once plan proceeds have been distributed, there is no reason why the petitioner in this case should not be able to seek to impose a constructive trust against the respondent\u2019s share of the proceeds, which have already been distributed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Although the respondent relies upon <em>Staelens </em>to support her argument, we agree with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that <em>Staelens </em>is inapposite to claims such as the respondent\u2019s claim here. <em>See Estate of Kensinger, </em>674 F.3d at 138. In <em>Staelens, </em>the court held that the decedent\u2019s estate could not sue the decedent\u2019s ex-wife to enforce her purported waiver of her entitlement to plan proceeds. <em>Staelens, </em>677 F. Supp. 2d at 508-11. However, the court based its decision on the specific language of the couple\u2019s separation agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 510-11. Though the court opined, in dicta, that allowing lawsuits to be brought against a plan beneficiary after plan proceeds have been distributed \u201cwould appear to go against the various interests which the Supreme Court deemed served by a uniform administrative scheme,\u201d it also \u201cacknowledge^] that the First Circuit itself, <em>pre-Kennedy, </em>appears to have treated distributed funds differently\u201d from funds that had not yet been distributed. <em>Id. </em>at 508; <em>see Hoult, </em>373 F.3d at 54. Accordingly, \u201c[r]ecognizing what appeared to be the law of the circuit in which it sat, the court avoided the question of whether the estate could sue the ex-wife directly and instead based its decision on narrow grounds related to the specificity of the contract language.\u201d <em>Estate of Kensinger, </em>674 F.3d at 139; <em>see Teves v. Teves, </em>Civil Action No. 13-11162-FDS, 2013 WL 5508246, at *3 (D. Mass. Sept. 27, 2013) (\u201cAfter benefits have been distributed to the designated beneficiary in accordance with plan documents, . . . ERISA is no longer implicated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\n<em>D. Constructive Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The respondent next argues that the trial court \u201cmisapplied the law of constructive trust\u201d to the facts of this case. We disagree. \u201c[T]here are no rigid requirements for imposing a constructive trust.\u201d <em>In re Estate of McIntosh, </em>146 N.H. 474, 478 (2001). \u201c[A] constructive trust is merely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>formula through which the conscience of equity finds expression.\u201d <em>Milne v. Burlington Homes, Inc., </em>117 N.H. 813, 816 (1977) (quotation omitted). \u201cA constructive trust will be imposed whenever necessary to satisfy the demand of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"> To support a claim for a constructive trust, the moving party must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such action is warranted. <em>Walsh v. Young, </em>139 N.H. 693, 695 (1995). To prevail in the instant case, the petitioner had to prove that the respondent possessed the life insurance proceeds at issue, that she and the decedent had a confidential relationship, and that she would be unjustly enriched were she allowed to retain the proceeds. <em>See id. </em>\u201cThe basic confidential relationship arises out of the family relationship, where one party is justified in believing that the other party will act in [his] interest.\u201d <em>Clooney v. Clooney, </em>118 N.H. 754, 757 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The respondent argues that, to recover in this case, the petitioner had to prove what we required of the plaintiffs in <em>Patey v. Peaslee, </em>101 N.H. 26 (1957). In <em>Patey, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that \u201cknowing that the decedent was possessed of property of substantial value, and was of unsound mind and suffering from physical disabilities from which she would shortly die, the defendant entered into a marriage with her, intending at her death to marry another woman. . . .\u201d <em>Patey, </em>101 N.H. at 28. The plaintiffs further alleged that in marrying the decedent, \u201cthe defendant concealed from her his sole purpose in doing so, which was to become a beneficiary of her estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of those allegations, we held that, to recover, the plaintiffs had to show that the defendant and the decedent had a confidential relationship \u201cin which the defendant occupied a dominant position\u201d and that he used that position, \u201ceither by concealment of his purpose or by undue influence, to procure the marriage solely to obtain the decedent\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. The plaintiffs also had to \u201cprove that the decedent was thereafter incompetent to dispose of her property, so that but for the marriage it would have gone to the plaintiffs by intestacy; or if she was competent, that she would have made no other disposition of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that if the plaintiffs met this burden of proof, the burden of proof would then shift to the defendant \u201cto show that the action by which he obtained title to the property was fair, and taken in good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\"> In <em>Patey, </em>we did not set forth a \u201crule of law\u201d to be applied generally. Rather, we set forth what was required of the plaintiffs in that case because of the allegations in their complaint. \u201cThe <em>Patey </em>case recognized ... that the equitable principle of imposing a constructive trust rests upon the doctrine that restitution will be compelled to prevent unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Lamkin v. Hill, </em>120 N.H. 547, 551 (1980). \u201cThe specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>instances in which equity imposes a constructive trust are numberless, as numberless as the modes by which property may be obtained through bad faith and unconscientious acts.\u201d <em>Milne, </em>117 N.H. at 816. Accordingly, in this case, the trial court properly focused upon whether the circumstances rendered it unconscionable \u201cfor the [respondent] to retain and enjoy [her] beneficial interest\u201d in the life insurance proceeds. <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipses omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The respondent next asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust. We review such claims as a matter of law and uphold the findings and rulings of the trial court unless they are lacking in evidentiary support or tainted by error of law. <em>Walker v. Walker, </em>158 N.H. 602, 608 (2009). We accord considerable weight to the trial court\u2019s judgments on the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given testimony. <em>Id. </em>We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the petitioner. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the petitioner, we conclude that it supports the trial court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust. The trial court found, and the record supports its finding, that the respondent fraudulently induced the decedent because she married him without telling him of her concurrent relationship with Tamara. For instance, Pastor Wallace Elliot Horton testified that, in approximately 2002, he first met Tamara and the respondent, whom Pastor Horton knew as Tamara\u2019s wife, then known as Ellen or Hellen Tamara. The child whom the respondent claims was fathered by the decedent was known to the Pastor as Tamara\u2019s child. Indeed, Pastor Horton testified that he presided at a \u201cdedication ceremony\u201d in which Tamara and the respondent participated with the child as her parents. Pastor Horton further testified that before he provided a reference for Tamara to the Northern New England District Council for the Assembly of God church in 2005, he contacted numerous individuals who confirmed that Tamara and the respondent were husband and wife. Pastor Horton testified that throughout his friendship with Tamara, he never doubted that the respondent was Tamara\u2019s wife and, until the instant proceeding, he had never heard of the decedent. Although, as the trial court noted, the respondent \u201csteadfastly denied that she was married to, or intimately involved with,.. . Tamara,\u201d the trial court found that her testimony \u201cwas evasive, nonresponsive and not credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The trial court also found, and the record supports its finding, that by concealing her relationship with Tamara, the respondent \u201cwas able to deceive the decedent into believing that he was [the] only possible biological father\u201d of the respondent\u2019s daughter. The decedent\u2019s sister testified that the decedent believed that the respondent\u2019s daughter was his child, despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the fact that he had had a vasectomy, and that the respondent convinced the decedent that he had fathered her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The record also supports the trial court\u2019s finding that as a result of the respondent\u2019s fraud and deceit, the decedent was not only induced to marry her, but also to designate her as a beneficiary of his life insurance policy. The sister testified that in 2008, while the divorce action was pending, the decedent told her that he now believed that the respondent was \u201calready married\u201d to Tamara. The sister also testified that she believed that the decedent did not change the beneficiary form because he was told that he could not do so while the divorce was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Accordingly, the trial court found, and the record supports its finding, that the decedent and the respondent had a confidential relationship (a marriage) into which the decedent entered because of the respondent\u2019s \u201cbad faith, deceit and misrepresentations.\u201d The trial court found \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that were the Respondent allowed to profit from her misconduct by retaining her beneficial share of the life insurance proceeds, an unjust enrichment would result.\u201d Because the record supports the trial court\u2019s findings, we uphold its determination that it was necessary to impose a constructive trust to prevent the respondent from being unjustly enriched.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\n<em>E. Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The respondent next asserts that the trial court erred when it declined to award her prevailing party attorney\u2019s fees. The respondent did not prevail in the probate division and has not prevailed in this appeal. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by denying her request for prevailing party attorney\u2019s fees. Although the petitioner argues that the trial court should have awarded him attorney\u2019s fees, he did not file a cross-appeal, and, accordingly, this issue is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">\n<em>F Ripeness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">We briefly address the respondent\u2019s argument that the instant case is not ripe for adjudication because it is not clear that the petitioner will ultimately receive the life insurance proceeds now that the trial court has imposed, and we have upheld its imposition of, a constructive trust on them. However, as the trial court explained when it denied the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, \u201c[i]f a constructive trust were to be imposed, the beneficiary of these assets would be the person wronged by [the respondent], as determined by the court.\u201d We decline to decide, in the first instance, the identity of \u201cthe person wronged by [the respondent],\u201d and remand this issue to the trial court for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>We have reviewed the respondent\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they do not warrant further discussion. <em>Vogel v.
