Walker sold the milk to the plaintiff who paid him for it by crediting it in his store account, until he received notice of the arrangement above noted, \u2014 after which he credited all the milk to the defendant. The amount so credited to Walker was $85, and this is the disputed item. The issue was tried by the court, and the findings state that \u201cthere was no evidence tending to show whether Walker was or was not indebted to the defendant.\u201d In these circumstances, the item was properly disallowed. The defendant\u2019s right to the milk money either depended upon an assignment thereof which would not be good agaihst the plaintiff until he had notice of it; or upon a lien thereon as security for the amount specified, which would not be good against the plaintiff after the requirements of the lease had been satisfied. In other words without proof of a debt from Walker to the defendant, there is- nothing for a lien to stand as security for. <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>79 Vt. 66, 64 Atl. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The defendant attemps to challenge the finding that there was no evidence of a debt from Walker to the defendant. He makes this attempt under an exception thus stated in the bill: \u201cThe defendant excepted to the finding of facts and to the judgment. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Such an exception is too general to be available. The particular finding should have been pointed out and the particular fault therein should have been specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Besides, even if we were to treat the exception as sufficient, the transcript is not referred to, so there is nothing before ns by which we can test the finding. To be sure, we are supplied with what are apparently excerpts from the testimony, certified to by the reporter, but these are not made a part of the exceptions by reference or otherwise, so their use is unwarranted. <em>Sargeant </em>v. <em>Leland, 2 </em>Vt. 277; W<em>heelock </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>19 Vt. 559; <em>Child </em>v. <em>Pinney, </em>81 Vt. 314, 70 Atl. 566; <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>80 Vt. 37, 66 Atl. 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
