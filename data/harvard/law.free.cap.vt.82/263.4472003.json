Bancroft, who is in the Waterbury asylum, who is a resident of your town, sick in the hospital at St. Johnsbury. He has had an operation of some kind, and his family have applied for help from this town. I will see that these bills are paid, and will look to the town of Plainfield for remuneration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-13\">Tours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-14\">A.

N. G.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The statute requires that the notice shall disclose the <em>condition </em>of the alleged pauper. The condition here referred to is his financial condition which is the basis of the right of recovery, and not his physical condition which is merely the cause of it. This was recognized in <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Roxbury, </em>70 Vt. 175, and made plain in <em>Mt. Holly </em>v. <em>Peru, </em>72 Vt. 68. In the latter case, the notice described the party on account of whose assistance the suit was brought as a \u201cpoor person, unable to supply herself by her own labor and has no means of support and is being now cared for and supported by said Mt. Holly.\u201d It was objected that the notice should have shown the cause of her need of support. In holding that the notice was sufficient, the Court said \u201cnor was it necessary to mention Mrs. Lyons\u2019s sickness in giving notice of her condition. The requirement relates to the condition which is the basis of recovery, and not to the circumstances producing that condition. If a person is poor and in need of assistance, the cause of this condition is immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">If we were to strike out of the notice here in question all that relates to young Bancroft\u2019s physical condition, \u2014 which is immaterial under the above holding,' \u2014 we should have one not materially unlike that which was held insufficient in <em>Essex </em>v. <em>Jericho, </em>76 Vt. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">This holding being decisive of the case, the other questions are not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\n<em>The pro forma judgment is reversed, and judgment rendered for the defendant to recover its costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
