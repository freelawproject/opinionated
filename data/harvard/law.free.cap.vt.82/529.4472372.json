The contention of the relator is that the village of South Vernon is not the chief village of the town of Vernon, and that the place of sale under the license granted to the defendant is at a point nearer the State line than the chief village in said town, and that therefore the license was granted in violation of the express terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Regarding <em>quo warranto </em>proceedings, the statute (P. S. 1973) provides: \u201cThe complaint may be preferred and prosecuted by the state\u2019s attorney of the proper county, by virtue of his office, either upon his motion, or upon the relation of a private person; or it may be preferred and prosecuted by a person interested in the matter of the complaint and the judgment sought. \u2019 \u2019 \u25a0 Exclusive of authority here given by statute a private person has no right to prefer and prosecute such a complaint in his own name. Whether under this statute he may file a complaint in his own name in any circumstances it is unnecessary now to decide; for if he can, it is only udien he has an interest in the matter of the complaint and the judgment sought peculiar to himself aside from the public interest. If the license to the defendant was granted in violation of law, as claimed by the relator, the wrong is exclusively of a public nature involving no grievance to individual rights. The interest of the relator is only the same as that common to every citizen; and the law does not contemplate that a private individual shall be allowed to prefer and prosecute a complaint to redress the wrongs of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\n<em>Without considering the questions presented in argument therefore, the Court on its own motion will dismiss the complaint with costs to the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
