Heard on the pleadings and findings of fact made by the chancellor, at the April Term, 1907, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Windham County, <em>Taylor, </em>Chancellor. Decree dismissing the bill with costs to the defendant. The orator appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-3\">The bill alleges that, while the orators owned certain land, the orator; Ephraim Fuller, by deed duly recorded conveyed to one Ashford \u201call the saw timber standing and growing\u201d thereon; that subsequently the orators sold the land to defendant, who had read the deed to Ashford, \u201creserving all the lumber, timber, and wood standing\u201d thereon, with the privilege of placing a portable mill on the land for sawing said lumber and timber, which lumber and timber was to be removed within a specified time; that the parties engaged a scrivener to make a deed of the land from the orators to defendant and the orators duly executed and delivered the same; but that \u201cbecause of some accident in drawing said deed\u201d no mention of said reservation or privilege was made therein, and praying, among other things that said deed from the orators to defendant be reformed by inserting therein said reservation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-4\">The answer admits all the foregoing allegations, except that of mistake in drawing the deed, and alleges that it was distinctly understood that defendant acquired no title to the \u201csaw lumber and timber\u201d on the land, and that he claims none, \u201cbut that he did understand and was informed by said Fuller that the wood, being the tops of the saw lumber and timber trees on said premises, were to be the property of said defendant;\u201d and denies that the reservation was omitted from the deed because of any accident or mistake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\">The chancellor found that \u201cat the time of the conveyance to the defendant he was fully aware of the interest of the said Ashford in the land thereby conveyed to him, having seen and examined the record of said Ashford\u2019s deed, and at the time of the execution of said deed the subject-matter of the reservation of said Ashford\u2019s rights in said land was talked over by the orators and the defendant. The scrivener who wrote the deed, informed them that said Ashford\u2019s rights in the land should be reserved to prevent the defendant\u2019s claiming a conveyance of the land without reservation, but the orators told him that that was not necessary as it was all understood between them. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-6\"><em>A.

No admissions are made in defendant\u2019s answer \u2022 requiring a different conclusion of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The case presented does not entitle the orators to the relief sought. A court of equity will reform a written contract, and especially a deed, on the ground of mistake, only when the evidence showing the mistake is strong and of a conclusive character, such as shall establish the fact beyond reasonable doubt. <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>10 Vt. 452; <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>11 Vt. 138; <em>Goodell </em>v. <em>Field, </em>15 Vt. 448; <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>17 Vt. 183; <em>Shattuck </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>45 Vt. 87; <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>49 Vt. 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
