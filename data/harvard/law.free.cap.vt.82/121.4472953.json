It is not alleged nor is it found however that the Vermont Peoples Telephone Company requested the respondent to grant, nor that the respondent etfer refused to grant, to that company equal and reasonable terms, arrangements and facilities for the installation of a telephone instrument at and in the same depot and station house.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The relative situation of the Vermont Peoples Telephone Company to the respondent at Barton Landing may be substantially dissimilar to that of the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, in the number of subscribers and the size of the territory covered by them; in advantages and disadvantages, conveniences and inconveniences, consequent on the installation of one of its telephone instruments in the depot and station house at that place. Reasonable and equal terms for one are not necessarily reasonable and equal terms for the other, for they can be so only when the conditions are substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Therefore the refusal by the respondent on request of the Vermont Peoples Telephone Company to grant to it the \u201csame terms and conditions,\u201d or \u201cthe same and equal arrangements and facilities\u201d as it (respondent) had granted to the other telephone company named was no violation of the statute. Nor was the refusal to make or submit any terms upon which it (respondent) would permit such installation and connection to be made by the Vermont Peoples Telephone Company an offence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>This refusal was in response to a demanded right to install and. connect such telephone instrument \u201call under the same terms and conditions as the\u201d other named telephone company theretofore had and did then have an instrument there installed and connected. To that demand, such a refusal is not within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Constitutional questions were presented, but since the case is otherwise finally disposed of the general rule applies that such questions will not be passed upon unless it is necessary to the final determination of the case. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>City of Barre, </em>77 Vt. 420, 60 Atl. 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and respondent discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
