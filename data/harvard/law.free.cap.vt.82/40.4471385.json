The evidence tended to show that the sale was for a lump sum, and that, while each item of property was called of a certain value, the purchase price of the whole was less than the aggregate of the agreed values; that the price at which the plaintiff\u2019s property was sold was not the price at which he was to be credited; that the personal property defendant contributed to the sale was to be taken into account in his settlement with the plaintiff, and defendant claimed on trial that the value of this property was to be considered in determining his interest in the proceeds of the sale. <em>Held, </em>error to exclude defendant\u2019s offered evidence of the value of the personal property by him contributed to the sale.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-5\">General Assumpsit.

In making this sale the defendant put in certain personal property of his own, and evidence of the value of this property was excluded as immaterial. The correctness of this ruling is the only question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The exceptions state that the evidence of the plaintiff tended to show that the personal property belonging to the plaintiff was sold at prices agreed upon by the plaintiff, the defendant, and the purchaser; and that the evidence of the defendant tended to show that the price at which this property was sold was not the price with which the plaintiff was to be- credited. The exceptions also state that defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that the personal property he contributed to the sale was to be taken into account in his settlement with the plaintiff, and it appears that he claimed on the trial that the value of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>property was to be considered in determining his interest in the proceeds of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The exceptions contain, in addition to the statement, the entire evidence relating to the terms on which the plaintiff\u2019s personal property was sold. It appears from this that there was evidence tending to show that the farm, and the personal property that went with it, both of the plaintiff and the defendant, were sold for a lump sum; that while each item of property was called of a certain value, the purchase price of the whole was less than the amount of the sums thus agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">It is argued for the plaintiff that the statements contained in the exceptions, when construed in the light of the testimony submitted in connection with them, fail to show that the offered testimony was material; but we are unable to adopt this view. It seems clear that the defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that he was entitled to be allowed for the personal property he put into the sale; that the amount of the allowance was not determined by any agreement; and that a valuation of the property was essential as the basis of an adjustment on the defendant\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
