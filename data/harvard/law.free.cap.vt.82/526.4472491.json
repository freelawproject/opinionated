A liquor license is not a franchise and the holder is not an officer. There is not a case under the common law in which a mere license or privilege of this character has been attacked in such proceedings. The granting or refusing the writ rests in the sound \u25a0 discretion of the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, 55 </em>Tex. 451; <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>66 Ga. 503; <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>112 Ind. 462; <em>People </em>v. <em>Utica Ins.

Y. 122, 56 N. E. 538. \u201cA privilege emanating from the sovereign power of the State, owing its existence to a grant, or, as at common law, to prescription, which presupposes a grant, and invested in individuals or \u00e1 body politic something not belonging to the citizen of common right.\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>Hazelton Boiler Co. </em>v. <em>Hazelton Tripod Boiler Co., </em>137 Ill. 231, 28 N. E. 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">A franchise has the legal character of property or an estate, in which the holder has a vested right, and is entitled to the same protection under constitutional guaranties as other property. <em>Armington </em>v. <em>Barnet et al., </em>15 Vt. 745, 40 Am. Dec. 705; <em>Enfield Toll Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford etc. R. R. Co., </em>17 Conn. 40, 42 Am. Dec. 716; <em>Norwich Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Norwich City Gas Co., </em>25 Conn. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u2022 The right of the State to regulate the traffic in intoxicating liquors, and to prohibit the sale thereof except by license, comes from its inherent and constitutional power of governing and regulating its internal police. A license to 'sell liquor is not a contract between the State and the licensee giving the latter vested rights, and it cannot be so granted as to be irrevocable. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blackington, </em>24 Pick. 352, Chief Justice Shaw delivering the opinion, it was held that \u201cthe exclusive authority and power to sell spirit by retail, is not conferred on the licensed person, as a benefit or privilege to him, or with a \u2022view to give him an exclusive right; but solely because the peace and security, the morals and good order of the community, will be promoted by it, and the exclusive power therefore is collateral, and incidental, and not one of the objects and pui\u2019poses of the law. \u2019 \u2019 It follows that a revocation would not be an infringement upon any constitutional rights. \u201cThe necessary powers of the legislature over all subjects of internal police, being a part of the general grant of legislative power given by the Constitution, cannot be sold, given away or relinquished. Irrevocable grants of property and franchises may be made, if they do not impair the supreme authority to make laws for the right government of the State; but no one legislature can curtail the power of its successors to make such laws as they may deem proper, in matters of police.\u201d <em>Board of Excise </em>v. <em>Barrie, </em>34 N. Y. 657; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>101 U. S. 814, 25 L. ed. 1079; <em>Boston Beer Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>97 U. S. 25, 24 L. ed. 989; <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Kurby, </em>5 Gray 597; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>103 Mass. 70; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>38 N.

Rep. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">On principle and authority the license issued to defendant Gibbs is merely a permit to him to carry on the sale of intox<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ieating liquors under certain restrictions, \u2019 and its validity cannot be tested by proceedings of this character. <em>Swarth </em>v. <em>The People, </em>109 Ill. 621; <em>Hargett </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>134 N. C. 394, 46 S. E. 749; <em>Chicago City Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>The People, </em>73 Ill. 541; <em>City of Carbondale </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>106 Ill.
