Sbriglio, appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion to open the judgment rendered after they were defaulted for failure to plead and after their counsel failed to appear at the hearing in damages. The sole issue on appeal is whether the court abused its discretion in denying the motion to open. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Notwithstanding the defendants\u2019 efforts to obfuscate this matter by reciting a litany of details unrelated to the present appeal, the pertinent facts are rather straightforward.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In November, 2001, the plaintiff, Rino Gnesi Company, Inc., brought an action against the defendants, alleging the fraudulent conveyance of certain real property and seeking to set aside the conveyance. Shortly thereafter, counsel filed an appearance on behalf of the defendants. In January, 2002, the defendants were defaulted for failure to plead. The plaintiff claimed the fraudulent conveyance action to the hearing in damages calendar to obtain a judgment. After three continuances, the court granted a final continuance to June 25, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On June 25, 2002, the plaintiff appeared in court prepared to proceed with the matter, which was on the printed court calendar and marked \u201cready\u201d by the plaintiff. The plaintiff also notified the defendants of the marking. Neither the defendants nor their counsel appeared at the hearing. The court made certain findings and rendered judgment for the plaintiff, setting aside the conveyance at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The defendants timely filed a motion to open the June 25, 2002 judgment, arguing that the judgment should be set aside to permit them to file an answer and special defenses to the plaintiffs complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of that motion, the defendants\u2019 counsel provided his affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>in which he explained that his failure to appear at the hearing in damages to contest the default judgment was the result of a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He explained that he represented Sebastian Sbriglio and Angela Sbriglio in a separate legal action, also brought by the plaintiff, seeking to collect a commercial debt by foreclosing a mortgage on certain commercial property. Counsel argued that when he received notice from the court clerk\u2019s office about a hearing in damages in the case of <em>\u201cGnesi </em>v. Sbriglio,\u201d he assumed that the hearing was for the foreclosure action, not the fraudulent conveyance action. He further argued that when he spoke with the plaintiffs counsel prior to the hearing, he informed him that he believed the matter going forward was the foreclosure action. The defendants\u2019 counsel stated that despite his mistaken belief, the plaintiffs counsel \u201cdid not inform or disavow [the defendants\u2019] counsel that the plaintiff was proceeding on [the fraudulent conveyance action] . . . and did not in any way identify which action the plaintiff intended on proceeding [with] in the hearing in damages.\u201d The defendants\u2019 counsel concluded that the \u201cfailure of the defendants to . . . appear at the hearing in damages calendar call was as a result of a misunderstanding of the [defendants\u2019] counsel arising from the telephone conversation with plaintiffs counsel regarding upon which action the plaintiff was proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">At the hearing on the motion to open, the plaintiff submitted a verified objection, arguing that the failure of the defendants\u2019 counsel to appear was the result of his negligence and, therefore, constituted an insufficient ground to set aside the default judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-212, Practice Book \u00a7 17-43 and <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritz Realty Corp., </em>63 Conn. App. 544, 548-49, 776 A.2d 1195 (2001). The plaintiffs counsel also vehemently denied the allegation of the defendants\u2019 counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>that the plaintiffs counsel was aware of his mistaken impression that the foreclosure action was going forward on June 25, 2002, yet failed to correct his misimpression.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs counsel further argued and submitted supporting documentation evidencing that, on June 19,2002, he notified the defendants\u2019 counsel by facsimile that he was going forward with the fraudulent conveyance action. He further pointed out that the defendants\u2019 counsel never claimed that he had not received the notice issued by the clerk\u2019s office identifying the foreclosure action, by docket number, as the case going forward on June 25, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court postponed its ruling on the motion so that it could consider the parties\u2019 briefs. A short while later, a notice issued from the clerk\u2019s office, indicating that the motion had been denied. Although the court did not issue a memorandum of decision, citation was made in the notice to <em>\u201cState </em>v. <em>Ritz Realty Corp., </em>[supra, 63 Conn. 548-49],\u201d to support its ruling. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the court abused its discretion in denying the motion to open. The defendants argue that the motion should have been granted because the two-pronged test governing the granting of such motions, set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212, was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">\u201cA motion to open and vacate a judgment ... is addressed to the [trial] court\u2019s discretion, and the action of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless it acted unreasonably and in clear abuse of its discretion. ... In determining whether the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>abused its discretion, this court must make every reasonable presumption in favor of its action. . . . The manner in which [this] discretion is exercised will not be disturbed so long as the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Vaccaro, </em>80 Conn. App. 436, 440, 835 A.2d 491 (2003), cert. denied, 268 Conn. 920, 846 A.2d 881 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">A motion to open a default judgment is governed by Practice Book \u00a7 17-43 and General Statutes \u00a7 52-212. \u201cSection 52-212 requires a party moving for the opening of a judgment to make a two part showing that: (1) a good defense existed at the time an adverse judgment was rendered; and (2) the defense was not at that time raised by reason of mistake, accident or other reasonable cause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritz Realty Corp., </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 548. We also have determined that the \u201c[n]egligence of a party or his counsel is insufficient for purposes of \u00a7 52-212 to set aside a default judgment.\u201d Id., 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">We initially note that the record contains no memorandum of decision and that the transcript of the hearing on the motion to open provides little insight into the factual and legal underpinnings of the court\u2019s determination. Additionally, the defendants failed to file a motion for articulation, as provided for by Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. In such cases, we frequently have declined to review claims on appeal because the appellant has failed to furnish this court with an adequate record. See, e.g., <em>Resurreccion </em>v. <em>Normandy Heights, LLC, </em>76 Conn. App. 642, 649, 820 A.2d 1116, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 917, 826 A.2d 1159 (2003). Notwithstanding the defendants\u2019 failure to take necessary steps to assemble an adequate record in the present case, there nevertheless exists a sufficient basis for appellate review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>factual and legal underpinnings of the court\u2019s determination can reasonably and logically be inferred from the court\u2019s citation in the notice to <em>\u201cState </em>v. <em>Ritz Realty Corp., </em>[supra, 63 Conn. App. 548-49].\u201d The relevant portion of that case holds that the negligence of a party is not a sufficient reason to open a default judgment. See <em>Woodruff v. Riley, 78 </em>Conn. App. 466, 469-70, 827 A.2d 743, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 922, 835 A.2d 474 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Our review of the record supports the court\u2019s determination. The defendants\u2019 counsel does not dispute having received notice of the default for failure to plead, which was entered on January 30, 2002, nor does he dispute having received notice from the clerk\u2019s office that the hearing in damages for the fraudulent conveyance action was scheduled for June 25, 2002. Furthermore, he does not dispute that he received the plaintiffs June 19, 2002 facsimile informing him that the fraudulent conveyance action was being marked \u201cready.\u201d In short, the defendants\u2019 counsel has failed to demonstrate that his failure to appear at the hearing to contest the default was caused by a factor that would entitle the defendants to relief pursuant to \u00a7 52-212.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\"> Almost half of the defendants\u2019 brief is devoted to a lengthy recitation of facts. The majority of those facts concerns other litigation involving the parties, the merits of which are not at issue in or central to the resolution of this appeal. That is an obvious attempt by counsel to complicate the facts of this case to support his contention that this complexity led to his failure to appear at the hearing in damages or to contest the prior default judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\"> We note that the motion was entitled \u201cmotion to reopen\u201d and is referred to as such throughout the defendants\u2019 brief. Because the judgment had not previously been opened, the use of that term is both improper and misleading. See <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>State, </em>76 Conn. App. 614, 617 n.5, 820 A.2d 1097 (2003). The appropriate phrase is \u201cmotion to open,\u201d and we reference it in this opinion accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\"> Aside from his affidavit, the defendants\u2019 counsel offered no other evidence at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\"> In his objection to the motion to open, the plaintiffs counsel stated that while he did speak with the defendants\u2019 counsel on June 18, 2002, he never told him that he believed the foreclosure matter was going forward. He stated, to the contrary, that the defendants\u2019 counsel never made any statements as to which of the two matters he believed was going forward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> Clearly, the preferred practice would be for the defendants to have filed a motion for articulation or rectification of the record. As we often have stated: \u201cThe duty to provide this court with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Fleet Bank, </em>73 Conn. App. 593, 596, 812 A.2d 14 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\"> As previously discussed, the defendants\u2019 counsel claimed that his failure to appear was the result of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d stemming from a telephone conversation with the plaintiffs counsel just days before the hearing. In language rife with accusations of subterfuge, he contends that the plaintiffs counsel was responsible for his failure to appear because he did not clarify which action he was marking \u201cready,\u201d which the plaintiffs counsel denies unequivocally. This court is troubled by counsel\u2019s misleading statement to the trial court at the hearing on the motion to open that his confusion was due in part to the fact that the docket numbers for the two cases were \u201cidentical except for the last two digits in the CV number.\u201d The foreclosure action bears docket number CV 00-0800943, and the fraudulent conveyance action bears number CV 01-0812352. Those docket numbers are, quite obviously, entirely different, and counsel\u2019s attempt to evade responsibility for the consequences of his conduct by resorting to unsubstantiated accusations and inaccurate representations to the trial court is inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
