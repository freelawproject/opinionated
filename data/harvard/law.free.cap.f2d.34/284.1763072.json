Cohn, attorneys for the petitioning creditors,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-16\">\u201cOrdered, that the issues raised by .the said petition and answers be referred to George W. W. Porter, Esq., as referee, to ascertain and report the facts with his conclusions thereon, with all convenient speed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Uz\">The alleged error is, first, that on account of the financial interest of the referee in the way of fees, and his financial interest in the result of his action, the court committed error in so referring the matter to him; and, second, that the order erroneously states the reference was made by consent of counsel. So far as appears from the record, neither one of these contentions were ever brought to the notice of the court below, or an opportunity given to it to revise its order, if any error was committed. As the record stands, we have nothing but the above order, which states it was made by consent. It would he manifestly unfair to dispose of the ease on questions now raised, but which were never called to the attention of the court below. The appeal is therefore dismissed, without prejudice to the right of the appellants, if any they now have, to apply to the court below for such relief as they are entitled to.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
