Said patent discloses a loud speaker having an octagonal outline, whereas the application design here under consideration shows a circular outline. There is no other difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-17\">In order to sustain the application, we must find that the change of design from an octagonal sound hoard, covered by patent 70,115, to a circular sound board, is inventive in character. This we cannot do, and we agree with the Board of Appeals that the mere choice of one well-known geometric form rather than another equally well known, which does not in any way modify the other portions of the design, cannot support a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-18\">The decision of the Board of Appeals of the Patent Office is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
