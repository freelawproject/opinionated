Holmes, No. 430,211, for patent on alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>inventions claimed to constitute an improvement in hoisting mechanisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The application was first heard by Examiner Merritt, who gave his final decision April 24, 1925. Sixty-one claims were made. Of these the Special Examiner allowed Nos. 7, 9, and 11 to 15, inclusive, and rejected all others. Appeal was thereupon taken to the Board of Patent Appeals, and after the disposition of certain motions not deemed necessary to be here related in detail, the application was decided by the Board on July 1, 1927. In his brief before the Board, appellant waived consideration of claims 1, 2, 3, 33, 34, 37, and 55 to 58, and the appeal was dismissed as to them. Claim 44 was amended and allowed as amended, and as to the others the decision of the Special Examiner was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">We accordingly have before .us for determination the claims first enumerated above.

Would invention be involved in substituting the motor of Holmes 1,207,555 for that of Browning 798,494? (The patentability of claims 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 21, 22, 25, and 26 turns on this point.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-20\">\u201cII. Would invention be involved in substituting the motor of Holmes 1,207,555 for that of Tadey 1,165,814? (Claim 10 is concerned.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-21\">\u201cIII. Is the feature of conducting fluid under pressure to an air motor, a portion at least of the motor being disposed within a drum, by way of a relatively fixed passage within the drum, anticipated by German patent <em>279,2661 </em>(Claim 28 is concerned.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>\u201cIV. Does appellant\u2019s arrangement of reduction gearing present patentable features over the British patent to Wild 113,366 of 1918? (Claim 29 is concerned.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-4\">\u201cV. Is the feature of driving a drum by a motor whose casing is rotatable therewith and providing within the drum a gear chamber for the reduction gearing between the motor and drum anticipated by either Howell 660,686 or German patent 279,266? (Claims 30 and 31 are concerned.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-5\">\u201cVI. Is there invention in causing an integral part of the drum to project to provide a conduit so that pressure fluid may enter the motor without there being any necessity of packing within the drum, having regard to patents to Abbe 1,110,995 and Davenport 1,-110,313? (Claim 43 is concerned.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-6\">\u201cVII. Is appellant entitled to the protection of claims to an article of manufacture defined as a hoisting drum having bores therein of a specified kind? The patents to Benson, Backstrom, Holmes, and McNamara were here alluded by the Office. (Claims 59 to 61 are concerned.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">We do not deem it necessary to attempt, in this opinion, to state in minute detail the readings which we have attempted to make in our study of the diagram accompanying the application and those accompanying the several patents cited as references. We have endeavored to analyze all parts of the several specifications and the illustrative drawings that seem to be applicable to the issues presented for our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">It seems to the court that the only differences in the claims involved in the first group, of which No. 4 is illustrative, from the references cited are, as stated in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office, \u201cin specifying that the motor rotor shaft is offset from the axis of the drum, and that the motor comprises a pair of intermeshing fluid-pressure operated rotors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">In the specification of the Browning patent, 798,494 (Transcript, p. 86), in lines 109 to 112 it is said, \u201calthough different means may be employed for conducting the steam, compressed air, gas or other driving agents to the various cylinders, we prefer (etc.),\u201d and figures 5 and 6 of the' accompanying drawings (Transcript, p. 81), illustrate the point. In the Holmes patent, 1,207,555, there is disclosure of a form of fluid-pressure motor including a pair .of intermeshing fluid-pressure rotors, <em>6 </em>and <em>6' </em>illustrated in figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, which, it seems to the .court, obviously might be used in the manner specified in the applicable claims. In the matter of a form of gearing to connect the motor to the drum, the Board of Appeals said: \u201cSo far as this group of claims is concerned the problem (of substitution) does not appear at all difficult in the light of the art cited. The applicant has merely mounted the motor of his patent, No. 1,207,555, insidie a hoisting drum, as in Browning, making the casing of the same an \u2022integral part of the drum. This results in the location of the rotor shafts exeentrie to the axis of rotation of the drum and raises the question of gearing such rotor shaft to a fixed member on the frame in order to rotate the drum and motor about the axis of the drum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">The opinion then proceeds to describe methods for accomplishing the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">It seems to the court that the Solicitor for the Patent Office makes a fair statement relative to the controversy as to these phases when he says in his brief: \u201cIt may be pointed out that if substitution of the Holmes\u2019 motor in the Browning device, as obviously suggested by the Browning disclosure, produces an impractical device, so that modifications thereof which might be said to involve invention, such as higher engine speed, as intimated at the bottom of page 12 of Appellant\u2019s brief, are necessary to produce a successful device, it is certain the rejected Claim 4 gives no clue as to what such modifications requiring invention are, and accordingly fails to point out the alleged invention if any there be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">As to this group of claims, therefore, we do not think there is any error to be found in the decision of the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">Claim 10 was also rejected on the prior patent to appellant in view of Tadey, 1,165,-814, and we discern no error in this. It seems to us that the substitution of the intermeshing rotor .type of motor for Tadey\u2019s motor is so obvious as not to require inventive skill, and falls within the classification relative to mechanical skill and construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">Claim 2S was rejected on the German patent, 279,266, Abbe, 1,110,995, and Davenport, 1,110,313.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-16\">It seems to us that all the factors of claim 28 are included in the German patent, except, as is stated by the Solicitor for the Patent Office, \u201can air actuated motor\u201d and \u201cmeans forming only a relatively fixed passage within said drum means for conducting air to said motor.\u201d The German device appears to contemplate an electrically actuated motor, and the claim was originally rejected by the Examiner on the ground that no invention was involved in substituting an air motor for the electric motor of the reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>for purposes of actuation. This, in our opinion, is a sound view. But were it erroneous, we think the specifications and illustrative drawings covered by both the Abbe and Davenport patents so clearly disclose \u201conly a relatively fixed passage\u201d for conducting air to the motor as to be a legitimate bar to this claim of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">Claim 29 was rejected on a British patent, \"Wild, being 113,366 of 1918; the Board stating that the only feature distinguishing applicant\u2019s claim from Wild is in locating his (Wild\u2019s) gears <em>b </em>and <em>e </em>outside the plate <em>i </em>(Mg. 4 Wild, Transcript, p. 120), and that \u201cno invention would be involved in so doing\u201d and there would be no difference in the result. It is noted that in the decision of the Examiner the German patent of 279,266, of 1914 was also referred to, and that a further ground of rejection was \u201cincohereney or indefiniteness\u201d; but we have considered the claim only in the light of Wild.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Appellant insists that his claim differs from the- Wild patent in two particulars, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-6\">\u201c1. The drum in the Wild disclosure is not closed at the axial portion thereof. The shaft <em>b </em>extends on through the end of the drum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-7\">\u201c2. The gears <em>d, e, g </em>and <em>h </em>are all in a common chamber, whereas the claim specifies that a portion be disposed within the closed chamber, but that one gear at least be carried by and be outside of the member forming the outermost end of the chamber.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">As for the first alleged differentiation, it appears from a study of the Wild Mg. 2 that it discloses a shaft <em>b </em>whieh fills the opening of the drum <em>e </em>whieh closes the chamber containing the gears, and we think the process whereby, in appellant\u2019s device, the closed chamber is formed by securing the end member <em>4 </em>\u201cfixedly\u201d to the drum, is a matter of skill in the art rather than of invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">It is undoubtedly true that in Wild the gearing indicated by the letters <em>d, e, g, </em>and <em>h </em>is totally inclosed. The specifications (Transcript, p. 109) and the drawing Fig. 4 so show. It is also true that in the claim at issue and the illustrative drawing Mg. 6 it is shown that there is proposed an outer driving gear whieh is to mesh with the internal gear \u201cso as to drive the drum in the manner set forth in the description of the hoisting mechanism.\u201d We are not convinced, however, that it is inventive merely to place certain of the gears outside rather than having them all inclosed, particularly in view of the fact that this causes no alteration in the final result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">It seems to the court that there is a degree of indefiniteness in claim 30 whieh is confusing. The specific language to whieh we refer is, \u201cA hoisting mechanism comprising rotatable drum means, a motor therefor having a housing rotatable therewith.\u201d Does this mean that the housing rotates with the drum or with the motor? Appellant insists that it means the drum, and the Examiner seems to have so interpreted it and held that the limitation was immaterial. The Board points out that \u201cthe claim does not make it clear whether the motor rotates with the drum or not,\u201d but adds that \u201cthe motor of the reference would operate if it were connected to the drum instead of to the frame.\u201d The reference is to the German patent, supra, to Howell, 660,686, October 30, 1900, and to Benson, 731,425, June 23, 1903. Upon the whole language of the claim we are content to take appellant\u2019s interpretation as understood by the Examiner, and construe the language to mean a \u201cmotor whose housing is rotatable with the drum.\u201d Appellant insists that under this construction the Howell patent is obviously irrelevant, and we think this is correct, since the Howell motor appears to be one whieh drives a drum by means of reduction gearing contained within the drum. In the German patent, however, it appears that there is member s, the left portion of whieh constitutes a housing for the motor <em>m, </em>and that this motor housing is rotatable with the drum, and the Examiner considered the combination in claim 30 unpatentable over the German patent, on the ground that a motor like that in Benson might be substituted for the German patent, while the Board holds out the idea that the motor <em>m </em>of the German patent might be connected to the drum instead of the frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">Appellant argues upon these points that the patent to Benson discloses an engine carried by standards; that eaeh of the valve shafts is provided with a pinion; that these pinions mesh with stationary gear; and that there is not the slightest suggestion from the patents themselves of replacing the motor of the German patent by a rotary engine of the type disclosed by Benson, which is adapted to drive a belt passed around its easing and has no arrangement for driving a set of gearing. He further insists that it would be a fundamental change in the hoisting mechanism of the German patent to connect the motor to the drum instead of to the frame, and that, even if the change were made, far-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>reaching alterations would have to he made or else there would be no possibility of driving the drum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">From our study and analysis of the drawings, processes of operation, .etc., of the application and references, we have concluded that under the interpretation which we place upon daim 30 as to it being \u201climited to a motor whose housing is rotatable with the drum,\u201d we believe appellant\u2019s contentions are well founded, and hold that No. 30 presents a patentable claim, and we think that No. 31 is so closely related to 30 as that it should also he allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Claim 43 was rejected on either Abbe or Davenport, and we think correctly so, for practically the same reasons given in passing upon claim 28 and which will not he here repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">In passing upon claims 59 and 61, which were rejected on Benson, Backstrom, Holmes, McNamara, and also as defining only a fragment of an invention (referring to Jay v. Weinberg [D. C.] 250 F. 469), the Board of Patent Appeals said: \u201cWe understand these claims to relate to the intersection of the two bores for the rotors of the motor as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The arrangement is the same as in Fig. 2 of Holmes or Fig. 2 of Baekstrom and to merely embody this motor as a part of the hoisting drum would not involve invention. These claims do not even define the function of the bores nor include anything cooperating therewith and there is nothing inventive in forming two intersecting bores in a hoisting drum or anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">We agree with the Board as to these claims. Examination of the decisions and authorities cited by appellant, and analyzing them along with those cited by the Solicitor for the Patent Office, leads us to the conclusion that appellant\u2019s contention as to these claims is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">In accordance with this opinion, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed as to all claims at issue except Nos. 30 and 31, and as to these it is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
