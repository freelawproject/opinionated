(C. C. A.) 25 F.(2d) 96. In the opinion in that case the discussion of claim 12 begins on page 101, and that opinion is here referred to for statement and discussion of the claim, and description and comparison of the devices there considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-22\">After our decision of that appeal, appellee herein filed in the District Court its supplemental bill of complaint, charging that appellant was making another device called \u201cSimplex,\u201d which was alleged to be likewise an infringement of the Huebner patent, and asking injunction and accounting, which the decree gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-23\">\u201cSimplex\u201d consists of a base which supports a plate of glass, over whieh there is laid a rectangular frame holding tautly a thin sheet or film of transparent celluloid, the frame being also provided with a pair of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>dowel pins accurately machined to engage corresponding holes in a superposed negative frame or plate holder similar to the plate holder of the Koppe device. The purpose of the film is to locate thereon certain points corresponding with registry marks made upon a superposed photographic negative, so that every other negative of the same series and having the same registry marks may be brought into registry with the marks made upon the film, and in each ease, while in such registry, clamped within the plate holder. Thus each of the negatives of the same series will be similarly positioned when within its holder; and the holder or frame, while containing the negative so positioned therein, is ready to he transferred to the photographic reproducing apparatus, with which the patent is not concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Each of the negatives of the series is designed to produce ultimately so much of the image to be reproduced as is represented by one of its colors, and the object of the.patent, as may be inferred from its title, is to position on or in negative plate holders the different negatives of the series, so that each will occupy the same position in its plate-holding device.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">It may be assumed that the usual marks on the \u201cSimplex\u201d film are two lines, parallel to the respective sides of the frame, and intersecting at right angles approximately at the center of the plate holder area.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">In the former opinion we held that Koppe\u2019s underlying mechanism of point-carrying blocks, with fine threaded right and left screw arrangement for moving the blocks toward and from each other in fixed line of movement, was the mechanical equivalent of Huebner\u2019s overlying movable registering fingers slidably mounted upon an upper frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Appellant contends that by its elimination of the movable blocks and of all other mechanism for registering, \u201cSimplex\u201d no longer responds to claim 12; also that in the employment of the film, \u201cSimplex\u201d is constructed under the teachings of the prior art rather than those of Huebner\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">For appellee it is contended that this court held the Huehner patent to be of primary scope, and his range of equivalents broad enough to include a device of such \u201cstriking dissimilarity\u201d as the Koppe machine, and that therefore claim 12 is sufficiently broad to include \u201cSimplex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Our statement in the former opinion was that certain prior art did not \u201cserve to detract from Huehner as a primary inventor, \u25a0nor to narrow the application of his claim.\u201d These words, having reference, of course, to the mechanisms with which we were there dealing, seem to have inspired extreme contentions of counsel respecting the inclusiveness of the claim, and to have likewise made the District Court more ready to accord the claim unduly broad scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Does this device, with its complete absence of mechanism for bringing about the registry, respond to claim 12 of the patent? It is evident from the former opinion that it was what we there denominated the \u201cfifth\u201d element of the claim, which gave us most concern. This element is here likewise the storm center of the controversy. Of it we said before, !\u201cit is not entirely clear just what is meant by relative movement between the registering device and holder for removably locating registering device adjacent the face of the printing plate in predetermined relation to the plate holder.\u201d We must admit that, notwithstanding the very able briefs and arguments of counsel, and even the learned and exhaustive opinion of the District Court, our comprehension of the meaning of this element of the claim still falls short of that degree of clarity which is always \u201cdevoutly to be wished\u201d by those on whom devolves the duty to make decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">If we were .then substantially correct in assuming there \u201cthat the registering device adjacent the face of the printing plate is found in the movable fingers of the device which contact with it,\u201d does not the conclusion follow that the \u201cmeans whereby a relative movement may be effected between the registering device and the holder\u201d in the patent are found in the mechanism shown for supporting the fingers in the overlying frame, and enabling them to slide in fixed course along the frame? It was then our view that Huebner was not limited to specific \u2019 mechanism shown for bringing about the registration, and that although the frame was entirely absent in Koppe, and the mechanism Koppe showed was beneath the negative instead of over it as in Huebner, nevertheless Koppe\u2019s mechanism for moving the operative parts into registering relation was fairly within Huebner\u2019s concept, and infringed claim 12 of his patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">Whether or not we properly subdivided claim 12, or placed the proper construction upon element \u201cfive,\u201d we feel justified in assuming that, notwithstanding the want of clarity in claim 12, it presupposes an invention for <em>mechameally </em>positioning a plate within or upon a holder so that the successive plates of a series would be in the same registry. An examination of the record indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>that this had not before been <em>mechanically </em>done, and we were then, and are now, satisfied that the invention and the claim, notwithstanding the want of clearness in the latter, are clear enough and broad enough to include the registering mechanism of Koppe for achieving the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">But it seems plain to us that registering <em>mechanism </em>is the very essence of Huebner\u2019s patent, while in \u201cSimplex\u201d the registering <em>mechanism </em>is entirely absent. The registry marks on the negative are manually <em>aligned </em>With the lines drawn on the film, and in this position the negative is locked in the plate holder. In the absence of this essential element \u201cSimplex\u201d fails to respond to claim 12. Fairbanks, Morse <em>&amp; Co. </em>v. American Valve <em>&amp; </em>Meter Co. (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The practice of suitably positioning the various plates of a series for color printing, by the employment of a transparent film or sheet, was pointed out in Cohen\u2019s patent, No. 565,153, August 4, 1896, for an \u201cImplement for Obtaining Correct Register in Color Printing.\u201d He describes a sheet of transparent material, called \u201cregister sheet,\u201d held upon a support and adapted to be readily placed in a determined position over a \u201cstone or block or plate.\u201d Upon the sheet are then marked the registry points or \u201ckey marks\u201d which appear upon one of the plates or stones of the series, and the key marks on each one of the series are then successively brought into registry with the marks thus made on the transparent sheet, the stone or plate being adjusted and held \u201cby means of the ordinary adjusting screws, until the key marks on said stone or block or plate are immediately under those on the register sheet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">This seems quite simple, but it is practically all there is to \u201cSimplex,\u201d except that in the latter the film is below the negative, while in Cohen it is above. Cohen was dealing with stones and plates which were opaque, while \u201cSimplex\u201d deals with negatives through which the registry lines on the film are visible. In both the problem of registry is the same, viz., to effect accurate registry in the completed print of the various parts of the image as they appear upon the several plates or negatives. From the viewpoint of invention, the principle, as well as the operation, is quite the same in \u201cSimplex\u201d as in Cohen.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Huebner testified that with the Cohen device the different plates of a given series might be accurately registered, except for the fact that atmospheric conditions would cause the film to contract and expand, and the points or lines thereon would not remain constant, and thereby exact registration would be impossible. This would no doubt be a serious objection; but whether serious or trivial, or not at all well grounded, \u201cSimplex\u201d employs a film in substantially the same relation as Cohen. The drawing of lines upon the film, in lieu of the marks which Cohen describes, does not materially differentiate \u201cSimplex\u201d from Cohen; and we are of the opinion that Cohen\u2019s disclosure stands in the way of the inclusion of \u201cSimplex\u201d within Huebner\u2019s range of equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\"><em>Entertaining these views, </em>wn are unable to concur in the decree of the District Court, which is accordingly reversed, with direction to dismiss the supplemental bill for want of equity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
