The prayer for reversal and remand for a new trial remains to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">That the loss of a portion of the record made in the trial court may entitle an appellant to a new trial by order of the appellate court, we do not doubt. Whether a new trial will Ire granted on that ground usually depends upon a variety of facts and circumstances, and it so depends in the ease at bar. Was Government Exhibit 40 vital to the case of the government as a whole, or only to some particular phase thereof? Is there sufficient evidence in the record relative to the contents of Exhibit 40, so that those contents, so far as they were material to the ease, can be substantially reproduced? Neither of these - questions can be answered by us without a careful study of the whole record of the case. And the proper record to be studied cannot -be known without an examination of those assignments of error which relate to- the alleged erroneous introduction of items of evidence. It may also be possible that Exhibit 40 itself or some of the items of the evidence connected therewith were improperly received in evidence. We are advised that the record in the ease consists of some 6,000 or 7,000- pages of typewritten matter. The assignments of error number 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">By reason of the foregoing facts and circumstances, we feel that the present motion should more properly be made at the time of the final submission of the appeals upon the merits. At that time a careful consideration can be given to the record as an entirety. The voluminous record will then be in printed form; it will be&lt;analyzed by counsel in their briefs; and the court can then more readily determine the status of Government\u2019s Exhibit 40 and its relative importance in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The motion is accordingly denied without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
