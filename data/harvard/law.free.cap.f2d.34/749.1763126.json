B. Humphrey, in the winter of 1893 and spring of 1894, procured some grape cuttings from the Department of Agriculture at the State University in Berkeley, from grape vines which had been imported by the United States Department of Agriculture from Persia. Beginning in September, 1895, A. B. Humphrey entered into the business of marketing the grapes grown by him from these cuttings under the name \u201cLady Finger.\u201d In July, 1924, he registered the name \u201cLady Finger\u201d as a trade-mark with the Commissioner of Patents. The grapes are long, slender, firm, and white, and Mr. Humphrey testified that, as soon as he saw the grapes, he was impressed with their resemblance to ladies\u2019 fingers, and at once named the grapes \u201cLady Fingers.\u201d The method of using the phrase \u201cLady Finger\u201d was by rubber stamp impressed upon the lithographed label. It was also used in advertising matter as \u201cHumphrey\u2019s Lady Fingers.\u201d Later A. B. Humphrey assigned his business of growing and packing grapes to the appellant, who brought suit against the appellee for violation of its trade-mark \u201cLady Finger\u201d in connection with the packing and selling of this variety of grapes. The appellee also is engaged in growing, packing, and selling grapes, and uses the name \u201cEnchantress\u201d as its trade-name, but in the case of this particular variety of grapes only impressed upon its lithographed labels with a rubber stamp the words \u201cLady Finger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">Mr. Humphrey, from- time to time, gave away cuttings from his grapevines, but always, he claims, with the admonition to the donee that the grapes must not be marketed as \u201cLady Finger\u201d grapes. It does not appear that he gave them any other name to use for the grapes, or that he knew the grapes by the name of \u201cRish Baba,\u201d now claimed to be the Persian name for this variety of grapes. It appears that those grapes were grown in Dalmatia, in Jugoslavia, and that they were known there at least as early as 1889 (and in Turkey as early as 1895) as \u201cLady Finger\u201d grapes; the phrase, of course, being in the language of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">One of the witnesses for the defendant testified that as early as 1897 or 1898 he saw this variety of grape in the Eiseman vineyard near Fresno-, and was then told that they were \u201cLady Fingers.\u201d Another witness testified that between 35 and 38 years ago he purchased this variety of grapes from the Marguerita vineyard, and sold them as \u201cLady Fingers.\u201d The defendant Ben H. Arkelian testified with relation to the name \u201cLady Finger\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-13\">\u201cA. The government lists them on their market report. The county or the state inspection bureau writes certificates and calls them \u2018Lady Fingers.\u2019 Our county horticulturist at Modesto, as well as Bakersfield, insists that we should put the word \u2018Lady Finger\u2019 on the boxes, because they are a \u2018Lady Finger\u2019 grape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">In 1927 the state of California passed an act with reference to the marking, packing, and selling of the fruit, and therein provided, among other things, that boxes con-' taining grapes must be marked with the name of the variety, and designated one of the varieties to be thus named upon the box as \u201cLady Finger.\u201d Stat. 1927, p. 1845, c. 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">In section 12 of that act it is declared that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person, firm, company, organization or corporation to pack or cause to be packed, import, sell, offer for sale, deliver for shipment, load, ship or transport any fruits, nuts nr vegetables which do not conform with all requirements of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-16\">It is provided in section 22 as follows: \u201c* *\u25a0 * For the purpose of this act grape varieties shall be classified as follows: * * * .Lady Finger * * *(Some 121 varieties are named in the list, including Rish Baba.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-18\">The section then provides for the marking of the packages of grapes with reference to their quality and variety. With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>reference to the latter it is provided as follows: \u201cIn addition to the markings required above, and those required by section 9 of this act, all containers of grapes shall bear upon them in plain sight and in plain letters on the outside thereof the following: Net weight and name of the variety, provided that the words Variety unknown,\u2019 \u2018mixed varieties\u2019 or the color of the grapes may be marked in lieu of the name of the variety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">By section 37 of this act a violation of any of its provisions is declared to be a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of. not more than $500 and imprisonment for not more than six months. The appellees call attention to this state legislation for the purpose of enforcing their contention that the name \u201cLady Finger\u201d is a recognized name for the variety of grapes produced by both the appellants and appellees. They do not rely upon the proposition that the appellant is seeking to enjoin the appellees from complying with a criminal law of the state. For that reason we do not base our decision upon that ground. In addition to the use of the name \u201cLady Finger\u201d in the statute above mentioned, it is also used in Webster\u2019s International Dictionary of 1920 as a name for a variety of grape, and also in various California catalogs and price lists introduced in* evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">It is not contended that there is any effort on the part of the appellants to simulate appellant\u2019s labels, or to in any way indicate that the grapes were produced or packed or marketed by appellants, other than by the use of the name \u201cLady Finger\u201d impressed in its labels by a rubber stamp, indicating the variety of grape contained in the package. The sole question presented is the claim of infringement of appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cLady Finger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The chancellor who tried this case was justified from the evidence in arriving at the conclusion that the name \u201cLady Finger\u201d was the name of a variety of grape produced in various parts of the world, and that the appellees were entitled, if not required, to use that name in designating the variety of the grape packed and shipped by them, and in denying the appellant relief by injunction. The appellant attacks the credibility of some of appellees\u2019 witnesses, and emphasizes the weight of his own rebutting evidence; but the witnesses appeared before the chancellor and testified in his presence, and there is nothing in the record to justify a rejection of their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
