B.L. and A.J.B. told W.K. that they wanted to post materials on M.B.'s Twitter page to elicit a \"negative response.\" A.J.B. created a Twitter account with no identifying information called \"Jeb Bush's Guac Bowl.\" A.J.B. then began tweeting messages tagging M.B.'s account over two to three hours, with several referring to autism. One post contained a sign saying \"Autistic Children Play Here\" with a caption reading \"Meanwhile at [M.B.]'s Daycare.\" Another post contained a checkerboard of images with M.B.'s face and a caption reading \"Click the Autistic Child.\" Another post encouraged M.B. to \"try a new cologne called 'Anthrax.' \" One post encouraged M.B. to \"consider suicide,\" while another contained an image stating \"Consider the following\" with a picture of a person holding a Clorox Bleach bottle. A.J.B. also posted an image of Pepe the Frog, \"a known hate symbol,\" hanging by the neck on a rope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Several days later, the tweets came to the attention of the high school's dean of students. She spoke to M.B. and asked if he had seen anything online that made him concerned. M.B. told her that he had not checked his Twitter account for several days. After the dean of students investigated and learned that W.K., B.L., and A.J.B. were involved, she spoke to A.J.B., who admitted to posting the tweets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that afternoon, when M.B. looked at the tweets, he immediately became upset and cried. M.B. testified that the tweets made him want to commit suicide and that he held a knife near his chest. M.B. decided not to commit suicide and called his mother. M.B. testified that when he returned to school, he was afraid that someone was going to attack him. M.B.'s mother took him to see a psychiatrist and a social worker because she was afraid that M.B. would try to hurt himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.J.B. was charged with gross-misdemeanor stalking and misdemeanor harassment. A.J.B. moved to dismiss, but the district court denied the motion, ruling that the stalking and harassment statutes were constitutional, both facially and as applied to A.J.B. The state later amended the juvenile petition, adding the charge of felony stalking because of disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a trial, the district court concluded that the state proved each count of the petition beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court adjudicated A.J.B. delinquent on the gross-misdemeanor stalking and misdemeanor harassment charges, but stayed adjudication on the felony stalking charge. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.

Here, the evidence showed that by tagging M.B.'s Twitter account, the user posting the tweets intended that the tweets would be seen by the tagged individual as well as being viewable by the Twitter community at large.

Anyone can see it but [the poster is] just making sure that the [tagged] person sees it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   M.B. testified that he saw the tweets because his username had been tagged. Based on the evidence, we conclude that tweets tagging a specific individual are both public and specifically targeted because the act of tagging someone is intended\n   so that the tagged individual sees the posts. Therefore, A.J.B.'s comparison to posting information on a bulletin board is misplaced and his actions are not entitled to greater protection merely because they were visible to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Unprotected speech\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The parties disagree as to whether A.J.B.'s actions fell within a category of unprotected speech.

Specifically, he argues that the savings clause of the stalking statute imposes a burden on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the charged conduct is not constitutionally protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Minnesota Statutes section 609.749, subdivision 7 (2014), provides that \"[c]onduct is not a crime under this section if it is ... authorized, required, or protected by ... the state, federal, or tribal constitutions.\" In\n   <em>\n    Machholz\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court briefly discussed this \"savings clause\" and agreed that \"a general savings provision cannot substantively operate to save an otherwise invalid statute, since it is a mere restatement of well-settled constitutional restrictions on the construction of statutory\n   enactments.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11866406\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/574/415/\">\n    574 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   421 n.4 (quotation omitted). The supreme court cited\n   <em>\n    Long v.

Crim. App. 1996). The Texas court reasoned that a savings provision \"would permit the defendant to introduce evidence before the jury regarding the constitutional nature of his conduct,\" which would \"relegate the First Amendment issue to a case-by-case adjudication, creating another vagueness problem.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008017\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/931/285/#p294\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008017\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/931/285/#p294\">\n    at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).

Thus, we conclude that the savings provision does not create an additional affirmative duty on the state to present evidence at trial concerning a statute's constitutionality. If a district court determined, as a matter of law, that the stalking statute infringed on free speech, the district court could not find, in its role as fact-finder, that a defendant violated that statute. We conclude that the state did not bear the burden at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that A.J.B.'s activity was not protected by the state or federal constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency of the evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A.J.B. also argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt for the felony stalking charge.

The record demonstrates that several of the tweets specifically referred to M.B.'s autism. Although A.J.B. testified that he did not know that M.B. was autistic when he sent the tweets and that he used the term \"autistic\" synonymously with \"out of place,\" the district court determined that A.J.B.'s testimony was not credible. On this record, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to find beyond a reasonable doubt that A.J.B. stalked M.B. because of his disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20609.749\">\n    Minn.
