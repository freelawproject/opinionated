We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2007, appellant Steven Leino was convicted of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The district court stayed imposition of sentence and placed him on probation. In 2009, Leino was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. The district court revoked Leino's probation on his fourth-degree criminal-sexual-conduct conviction and imposed a 21-month prison term and a ten-year conditional-release term. The district court sentenced Leino to a concurrent 51-month prison term and a lifetime conditional-release term on his third-degree criminal-sexual-conduct conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2011, Leino began the supervised-release portion of his sentence. In February 2012, Leino was arrested for failing to cooperate with sex-offender treatment, which violated a condition of his release. The Minnesota Department of Corrections' (DOC) Hearings and Release\n   Unit (HRU) revoked Leino's supervised release, and Leino returned to prison. In August 2012, the commissioner released Leino from prison to an approved residence in Wright County. In December 2012, Leino completed the supervised-release portion of his sentence and began serving his lifetime conditional-release term. He was required to successfully complete sex-offender programming as a condition of release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2013, the HRU revoked Leino's conditional release for one year and ordered him to complete sex-offender programming while in prison because he had not cooperated with sex-offender treatment in the community. On December 16, 2013 and December 8, 2014, the HRU held review hearings and extended Leino's incarceration for one year and for 240 days, respectively, to give him more time to complete sex-offender treatment. On July 19, 2015, Leino completed sex-offender treatment in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 10, 2015, the HRU held a review hearing and extended Leino's term of incarceration for up to 90 days, to give him time to find suitable housing. Leino's supervision was assigned to an intensive supervised release (ISR) team in St. Cloud. On November 9, 2015, the HRU held a review hearing and again extended Leino's term of incarceration for 90 days unless his ISR team could find him suitable housing before then. On December 8, 2015, Leino appealed his continued incarceration to the HRU's executive officer of hearings and release. His appeal was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 8, 2016, the HRU held another review hearing and extended Leino's term of incarceration for 30 days unless his ISR team could find him suitable housing before then. On March 14, 2016, the HRU again held a review hearing and extended Leino's term of incarceration for 150 days unless his ISR team could find him suitable housing before then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 23, 2016, Leino petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that he was unlawfully detained by the commissioner, the commissioner was not authorized to hold review hearings, and the commissioner impermissibly deferred to counties in determining whether he could release predatory offenders into those counties. On July 6, 2016, the commissioner released Leino to three-quarters housing at the Wright County Detention Center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 28, 2017, the district court held a hearing regarding Leino's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court heard legal arguments, but it did not hold an evidentiary hearing. On June 16, 2017, the district court issued an order denying Leino's requests for habeas relief and dismissing his petition, reasoning that Leino could only obtain habeas relief if he was restrained because of a constitutional violation and that the commissioner did not violate Leino's substantive due-process rights by detaining him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Leino appealed to this court. The commissioner moved to dismiss the appeal as moot and supplement the record with exhibits establishing that the commissioner had released Leino to live with family in Hennepin County. This court denied the commissioner's motions, reasoning that the appeal \"survives the mootness doctrine\" because the issue of \"the lawfulness of the DOC's use of review hearings\" in administering\n   supervised and conditional release and re-incarceration \"is capable of repetition and may evade review.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.

Although the facts regarding the particular circumstances of this case are disputed, the DOC's regular use of review hearings as a decision-making tool regarding re-incarceration of offenders for violating conditional release is undisputed. Therefore, we review the application of law to the DOC's use of such review hearings de novo.

R. 2940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .0100, the relevant definitional rule for the rules and procedures regarding the HRU, defines \"revocation hearing,\" but it does not define \"review hearing,\" and that the term \"review hearing\" only appears in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%202940\">\n    Minn. R. 2940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1800, a rule regarding inmates with life sentences. Leino is correct: the review hearings in this case are not expressly authorized by statute or administrative rule.

In fact, DOC rules do not require a guaranteed release date in those circumstances. Instead, they provide for a \"projected release date,\" defined as \"a date in the future at which an inmate will be released providing the inmate's behavior is satisfactory, the release date was based on complete and accurate information, and the inmate is not considered to be a risk to the public at the time of release.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%202940\">\n    Minn.

Thus, the relevant DOC administrative rules give the commissioner significant discretion in determining when to release an offender following re-incarceration for violating conditional release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, the DOC's use of review hearings to evaluate whether, given the offender's behavior and the relevant circumstances, it is appropriate to release the offender at the offender's projected release date is consistent with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20244.05\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 244.05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2, which requires the commissioner to \"specify the period of revocation for each violation of release\" and establish procedures for the revocation of release that \"provide due process of law for the inmate.\" Procedural due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    Sawh v. City of Lino Lakes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7071656\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/823/627/#p632\">\n    823 N.W.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 632 (Minn. 2012). Specifying the period of revocation provides an offender notice of the projected length of his incarceration. A review hearing provides the offender an opportunity to be heard regarding his projected release or continued incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, although the relevant statutes and DOC administrative rules do not expressly authorize review hearings in the context of the DOC's administration of re-incarceration of offenders for violations of conditional release, such use of review hearings is consistent with the relevant statutes and DOC administrative rules. We discern no basis to declare the DOC's use of review hearings in this context unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In fact, this court has consistently rejected challenges to the DOC's authority to extend projected-release dates following review hearings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
