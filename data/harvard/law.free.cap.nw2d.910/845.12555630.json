The complaint alleges that Governor Burgum failed to supervise and govern officials and staff at the NDSP. Wheeler claims that NDSP officials and staff interfered with his mail, discriminated against him on the basis of race, denied him access to the courts, prevented him from challenging the conditions of his confinement, and retaliated against him for exercising his rights. Wheeler sent Governor Burgum two letters commenting on the conduct of these individuals. Governor Burgum did not respond to the letters. Wheeler sought injunctive relief against Governor Burgum in his official capacity for failing to supervise the actions of officials and staff at the NDSP. Wheeler also sought punitive damages for Governor Burgum's failure to respond to his letters or otherwise investigate the issues described in his letters. Additionally, Wheeler moved for appointed counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Governor Burgum moved to dismiss the complaint under N.D.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and opposed Wheeler's motion to appoint counsel.

Wheeler argues that Governor Burgum should be \"enjoined to compel prison officials to respect and enforce prisoners Constitutional rights in his official capacity.\" However, Wheeler does not cite any authority for his argument that would support \u00a7 1983 liability for such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Although Governor Burgum is responsible for supervising the DOCR director, who is responsible for the NDSP and its staff, the Governor's supervisory responsibility over the alleged actions Wheeler complains of is too indirect and remote to support \u00a7 1983 liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Nixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178985\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/537/#p543\">\n    747 F.3d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543 (8th Cir. 2014) (stating, \"While the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply to \u00a7 1983 cases, a supervisor may still be liable under \u00a7 1983 if either his direct action or his 'failure to properly supervise and train the offending employee' caused the constitutional violation at issue.\"). Because Governor Burgum does not directly supervise or train the officials or staff at the NDSP, he cannot be held liable in his official capacity under \u00a7 1983. Thus, the district court did not err by concluding Wheeler failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted against Governor Burgum in his official capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    B.

Wheeler has not provided adequate support for his contention that Governor Burgum's failure to respond to his letters or otherwise investigate his allegations violated a constitutional or statutory right.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Public officials do not have a free-floating obligation to put things to rights, disregarding rules (such as time limits) along the way. Bureaucracies divide\n   tasks; no prisoner is entitled to insist that one employee do another's job. The division of labor is important not only to bureaucratic organization but also to efficient performance of tasks; people who stay within their roles can get more work done, more effectively, and cannot be hit with damages under \u00a7 1983 for not being ombudsmen. Burks's view that everyone who knows about a prisoner's problem must pay damages implies that he could write letters to the Governor of Wisconsin and 999 other public officials, demand that every one of those 1,000 officials drop everything he or she is doing in order to investigate a single prisoner's claims, and then collect damages from all 1,000 recipients if the letter-writing campaign does not lead to better medical care. That can't be right. The Governor, and for that matter the Superintendent of Prisons and the Warden of each prison, is entitled to relegate to the prison's ... staff the [implementation of prison policy].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Burks v.

Because Wheeler has not alleged any act or omission by Governor Burgum that deprived him of any legal right, Wheeler has no claim against Burgum in his personal capacity.

Wheeler points to no state statute that would authorize appointed counsel for his \u00a7 1983 claims, and his constitutional claims find no support in our precedent. Because the district court was presented with no authority allowing it to appoint counsel, it was not error to deny Wheeler's motion for appointment of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Because Wheeler has failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted, the district court did not err by granting Governor Burgum's motion to dismiss.
