Bowen challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and the district court's jury instructions. We conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction of simple robbery because a bottle of liquor is, as a matter of\n   law, \"personal property.\" We also conclude that the district court did not err by instructing the jury that, to find the defendant guilty, the jury must find that the defendant took \"a bottle of liquor.\" Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 2, 2016, Bowen entered Big Top Liquors, a retail liquor store at the intersection of University Avenue and Snelling Avenue in St. Paul. After Bowen yelled at a cashier, she refused to assist him and told him to leave the store. He did so, but he returned less than an hour later. Bowen again yelled at the cashier, entered her workspace behind the cash register, and pushed products off a shelf onto the floor. Bowen walked to another shelf, took a bottle of liquor, and punched a store manager in the face. Bowen left the store with the bottle of liquor. In a subsequent interrogation, Bowen admitted to a police officer that he took the bottle of liquor without paying for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The state charged Bowen with two offenses based on the incident: making a threat of violence, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.713\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1 (2016), and simple robbery, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.24\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Bowen represented himself in the district court with the assistance of advisory counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. R. Crim. P. 5.04, subd. 2. The case was tried to a jury in August 2016. The state called six witnesses: the cashier, two managers of Big Top Liquors, and three police officers. Bowen did not testify and did not introduce any other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the instructions conference, the district court provided the parties with its proposed jury instructions. The district court proposed an instruction on the simple-robbery charge that would require the jury to determine whether \"the defendant took a bottle of liquor in the presence of employees of Big Top Liquors.\" Bowen objected to the district court's proposed instruction on the ground that a bottle of liquor is not \"personal property,\" which is the term used in the simple-robbery statute. Bowen requested an instruction that would have required the jury to determine whether \"the defendant took personal property.\" The district court overruled Bowen's objection, denied his request for an alternative instruction, and gave the instruction that was originally proposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his closing argument, Bowen did not argue that he did not take a bottle of liquor. But he argued that, under Minnesota law, the bottle of liquor at issue is not personal property. The jury found Bowen guilty of simple robbery and not guilty of making a threat of violence. The district court sentenced Bowen to 38 months of imprisonment but stayed execution of the sentence and placed him on probation for five years. Bowen appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. Is the evidence sufficient to support Bowen's conviction of simple robbery?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Did the district court err by instructing the jury to determine whether Bowen \"took a bottle of liquor,\" not whether he \"took personal property?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bowen argues that the state's evidence is insufficient to support his conviction of simple robbery. He contends that that, to prove the offense of simple robbery, the state is required to prove that he took \"personal property,\" which, he contends, means property owned by or belonging to a person (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a human being), not property owned by or belonging to a business entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In general, when this court seeks to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, we undertake \"a painstaking analysis of the record to determine whether the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the conviction, was sufficient to\" support the conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Laws ch. 444, at 775-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Bowen's argument requires us to interpret section 609.24 to determine the meaning of the term \"personal property.\" Bowen contends that the statute is unambiguous because the plain meaning of the\n   term \"personal property\" is property owned by or belonging to a person, thereby excluding property owned by or belonging to a business entity. In response, the state contends that the statute is unambiguous because the plain meaning of the term \"personal property\" is all property that is not real property, regardless whether it is owned by or belonging to a human being or a business entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The simple-robbery statute itself does not define the term \"personal property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.24\">\n    Minn.

Likewise, chapter 609 of the Minnesota Statutes does not define the term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.02\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Because there is no statutory definition of \"personal property,\" we must look to other sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In general, when seeking to determine the meaning of a statute, we begin by looking to \"the common and ordinary meaning\" of the words used in the statute.\n   <em>\n    Thonesavanh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338046\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/904/432/#p435\">\n    904 N.W.2d at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Bowen contends that, because the noun \"property\" is modified by the adjective \"personal,\" the common and ordinary meaning of the two words, when used together, is property \"of or pertaining to a person.\" He further contends that, in light of that meaning, the term \"personal property\" does not include property owned by or belonging to a business entity. Bowen's proposed interpretation finds some support in lay dictionaries. The word \"personal\" has been defined to mean \"[o]f or pertaining to a particular person,\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1828 (2d ed. 1946), and \"[o]f, pertaining to, concerning or affecting the individual person or self,\"\n   <em>\n    The Oxford Universal Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1479 (3d ed. 1964). Furthermore, the statute provides that a person commits simple robbery if he or she \"takes personal property\n   <em>\n    from the person\n   </em>\n   or in the presence of another,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.24\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which might suggest that the property taken must be owned by or belonging to the person from whom it was taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In response, the state contends that the term \"personal property\" is a term of art that means any type of property that is not real property. Consequently, the state contends that \"personal property\" includes property that is owned by or belonging to a business entity. The state's proposed interpretation finds support in both lay dictionaries and legal dictionaries. Two leading lay dictionaries define the term \"personal property\" to mean \"[e]state or property that is not real, consisting in general of things temporary or movable,\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   at 1828, and \"an estate or property consisting of movable articles both corporeal, as furniture or jewelry, or incorporeal, as stocks or bonds (distinguished from\n   <em>\n    real property\n   </em>\n   ),\"\n   <em>\n    The Random House Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   1446 (2d ed. 1987). In addition, a leading legal dictionary defines \"personal property\" to mean \"[a]ny movable or intangible thing that is subject to ownership and not classified as real property.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1412 (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The existence of conflicting dictionary definitions may mean that a statute is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thonesavanh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338046\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/904/432/#p435\">\n    904 N.W.2d at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He refers to Eighteenth Century common law and asserts that the \"origins of robbery as a crime involved an emphasis on the connection between the victim and the property taken.\" Our review of the common-law origins of robbery indicates otherwise. Blackstone defined larceny as \"the felonious taking, and carrying away, of the personal goods of another,\" and he defined robbery as a form of larceny: \"the felonious and forcible taking, from the person of another, of goods or money to any value, by putting him in fear.\" 4 William Blackstone,\n   <em>\n    Commentaries on the Laws of England\n   </em>\n   230, 241 (Legal Classics Library 1983) (1769);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   3 Wayne LaFave,\n   <em>\n    Substantive Criminal Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 19.2, 20.3, at 74, 222 (2018). Blackstone made clear that the term \"personal goods of another\" means property that is not real property: \"This felonious taking and carrying away must be\n   <em>\n    of the personal goods of another\n   </em>\n   : for if they are things\n   <em>\n    real\n   </em>\n   , or favour of the realty, larciny at the common law cannot be committed of them.\" Blackstone,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 232. Blackstone's\n   <em>\n    Commentaries\n   </em>\n   gives no indication that the phrase \"personal goods of another\" refers to property owned by or belonging to a human being as opposed to property owned by or belonging to a business entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blackstone,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 232-34. In any event, under the common law of Minnesota, it is clear that the term \"personal property\" has a specialized, technical meaning: all property that is not real property. Thus, the well-accepted common-law meaning of the term \"personal property\" \"indicates that we should define the term in accordance with its common-law meaning, consistent with the direction provided by the imputed-common-law-meaning canon.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thonesavanh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338046\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/904/432/#p435\">\n    904 N.W.2d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Neither party has suggested that any other canon of construction should apply. Because two canons support the state's argument concerning the meaning of the term \"personal property,\" we conclude that the term \"personal property,\" as used in section 609.24, means all property that is not real property, without regard for whether the property is owned by or belonging to a human being or a business entity. By introducing evidence that Bowen took a bottle of liquor from Big Top Liquors, the state satisfied its burden of proving that Bowen took \"personal property.\" Thus, the state's evidence is sufficient to support the jury's verdict that Bowen is guilty of simple robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Bowen argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury that it should determine whether Bowen \"took a bottle of liquor,\" not whether he \"took personal property.\" Bowen's argument has two parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Bowen argues that the district court violated his constitutional right to a jury trial by instructing the jury to determine whether he \"took a bottle of liquor\" rather than whether he \"took personal property.\" He argues that the district court essentially directed a verdict for the state on an element of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Bowen's argument is based on the United States Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gaudin\n   </em>\n   , which described the applicable law as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that no one will be deprived of liberty without \"due process of law\"; and the Sixth, that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury.\" We have held that these provisions require criminal convictions to rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

The right to have a jury make the ultimate determination of guilt has an impressive pedigree. Blackstone described \"trial by jury\" as requiring that \"\n   <em>\n    the truth of every accusation\n   </em>\n   , whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant's] equals and neighbors....\" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769) (emphasis added). Justice Story wrote that the \"trial by jury\" guaranteed by the Constitution was \"generally understood to mean ... a trial by a jury of twelve men, impartially selected, who must unanimously\n   <em>\n    concur in the guilt of the accused before a legal conviction can be had.\n   </em>\n   \" 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 541, n.2 (4th ed. 1873) (emphasis added and deleted). This right was designed \"to guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of rulers,\" and \"was from very early times insisted on by our ancestors in the parent country, as the great bulwark of their civil and political liberties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/#p277\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 540-541.

But that issue is not a question of fact, nor does it require the application of law to facts. A bottle of liquor is, as a matter of law, personal property.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   part I.

In this case, the district court likely would not have abused its discretion if it had given Bowen's requested\n   instruction. But the district court exercised its discretion and decided to instruct the jury using the phrase \"took a bottle of liquor.\" In light of our resolution of Bowen's statutory-interpretation argument,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   part I, the district court \"fairly and adequately explain[ed] the law of the case\" and did not \"materially misstate[ ] the applicable law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koppi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7074789\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/798/358/#p362\">\n    798 N.W.2d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Bowen's request for a jury instruction that would have required the jury to determine whether he \"took personal property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The evidence is sufficient to support Bowen's conviction of simple robbery.
