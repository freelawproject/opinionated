Midway abuts both Duluth and appellant City of Proctor. The OA Agreement divided the Orderly Annexation Area into three parcels identified as Parcel I, Parcel II, and Parcel III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Julia Ann (Hovland) Savalas and George Hovland III own approximately 92 acres of real property (the property) located within Parcel II. In May 2014, the owners executed a petition requesting annexation by ordinance to Proctor. In August 2014, Proctor adopted an ordinance to annex the property. Duluth objected to the proposed annexation by ordinance on the grounds that the property is subject to the OA Agreement and was therefore not eligible for annexation by ordinance into Proctor. In October 2014, the chief administrative law judge (chief ALJ) issued an order annexing Parcel I into Duluth. Neither Duluth nor Midway has commenced proceedings to annex Parcel II or Parcel III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2016, the chief ALJ issued her findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order approving Proctor's annexation by ordinance. Duluth and Midway appealed to the district court, which vacated the chief ALJ's order and determined that once real property is subject to an orderly annexation agreement, that property cannot subsequently be annexed by ordinance. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Did the district court err by concluding that once parties execute an orderly annexation agreement with respect to a designated area, nonparties cannot subsequently seek to annex real property within the designated area by ordinance?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) and Proctor argue that the district court erred by concluding that Proctor could not annex the property by ordinance because the property was already subject to the OA Agreement between Duluth and Midway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case involves potential conflict between two statutory schemes for the annexation of real property-annexation by agreement and annexation by ordinance.

They assert that (1) subdivision 1(e) does not preclude a municipality from annexing part of a designated area by ordinance and (2) the \"preemption\" clause in subdivision 6 is ambiguous as to whether a valid annexation agreement is binding on nonparties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under section 414.0325, subdivision 1(c), an annexation agreement confers the chief ALJ with jurisdiction over annexations in designated areas. Subdivision 1(e) provides two possible mechanisms by which \"an annexation of any part of the designated area\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be initiated.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20414.0325\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 414.0325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1(e) (emphasis added). Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.44\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 645.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 15 (2016), \"may\" is defined as \"permissive.\" Conversely, \"shall\" denotes that something is \"mandatory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.44\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subd. 16 (2016). As the chief ALJ noted, the statute's use of \"may\" suggests that there may be other ways to initiate annexation of designated property besides the two processes laid out in subdivision 1(e). To read subdivision 1(e) otherwise would require this court to add the word \"only\" to that subdivision. This court cannot add words to a statute that the legislature did not include.\n   <em>\n    Genin v. 1996 Mercury Marquis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11125729\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/622/114/#p119\">\n    622 N.W.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119 (Minn. 2001). We conclude that section 414.0325, subdivision 1(e), does not preclude other methods of annexation within a designated area beyond the two methods listed in that subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   OAH and Proctor also argue that the district court erroneously read the \"preemption\" clause as barring nonparties from initiating annexation by ordinance in a designated area. The second sentence of subdivision 6 states that \"[t]he provisions of an orderly annexation agreement are not preempted by any provision of this chapter unless the agreement specifically provides so.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20414.0325\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 414.0325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 6. OAH acknowledges that one could reasonably read this sentence to mean that the terms of an annexation agreement supersede an attempt to annex by ordinance. However, to determine whether a statute is ambiguous, this court interprets the statute \"as a whole so as to harmonize and give effect to all its parts.\"\n   <em>\n    328 Barry Ave., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6852961\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/871/745/#p749\">\n    871 N.W.2d at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The first sentence of subdivision 6 states that \"[a]n orderly annexation agreement is a binding contract\n   <em>\n    upon all parties to the agreement\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20414.0325\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 414.0325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 6 (emphasis added). The third sentence of subdivision 6 states, \"If an orderly annexation agreement provides the exclusive procedures by which the unincorporated property identified in the agreement may be annexed to\n   <em>\n    the municipality, the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    municipality\n   </em>\n   shall not annex that property by any other procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20414.0325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Both the first and third sentences of subdivision 6 suggest that the purpose of that subdivision is to ensure that parties to annexation agreements are bound by them and cannot attempt to annex land by alternative means unless the agreement provides otherwise. The second sentence is silent as to whether its preemption mandate applies only to parties to an annexation agreement or if nonparties are bound as well. Because this court must look to the statute as a whole to determine ambiguity, rather than a single sentence in isolation, we conclude that subdivision 6 is ambiguous as to whether an annexation agreement is binding only upon parties to that agreement or whether the agreement restricts the rights of nonparties as well. Therefore, we must use other tools to determine legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under section 414.01, subdivision 1a(5) (2016), \"joint resolutions for orderly annexation ... should be encouraged.\" However, that does not necessarily imply that these agreements are binding upon nonparties. Encouraging orderly annexation agreements is equally consistent with OAH and Proctor's reading of the annexation-by-agreement statute-once parties have entered into an agreement, they cannot circumvent the agreement by pursuing annexation by alternative means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In 2002, the Minnesota House of Representatives Local Government and Metropolitan Affairs Committee discussed the bill that added the preemption language in section 414.0325, subdivision 6 (2004). The bill's author, Representative Howes, described it as follows: \"What this bill does is an agreement between the city and the township, it basically makes it a binding contract and both parties have to adhere to that.\" Hearing on H.F. No. 1620 Before H. Comm. on Local Gov't &amp; Metro. Affairs (Feb. 20, 2002). Representative Howes then introduced Kent Sulem from the Minnesota Association of Townships, who described the bill as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [I]t is just clarifying that when [orderly annexation] agreements are entered into between a city and a township ... that agreement will be binding, that there won't be any loopholes that either side can use, that the two parties ... will honor their word as entered into in that orderly agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20414.0325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sulem also stated that the added language of subdivision 6 \"just simply clarifies a problem that has arisen because of some old case law that exists.\" He then explained that he believed the added language was necessary because \"there is case law involving the City of La Crescent versus the City of-the Township of La Crescent versus the City of La Crescent that found that despite the existence of an orderly annexation agreement, the property subject to that agreement could be annexed via other means.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20414.0325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    LaCrescent Twp. v.
