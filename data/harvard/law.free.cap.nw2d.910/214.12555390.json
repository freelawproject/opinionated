Ct. App. Nov. 29, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Grandberry was convicted of carrying a concealed and dangerous weapon contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20941.23\">\n    Wis.

Grandberry appealed his conviction, arguing that his conduct was in compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20167.31\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 167.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b), which regulates the transportation of firearms in motor vehicles (the \"Safe Transport Statute\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that his compliance with the Safe Transport Statute precluded his conviction under the Concealed Carry Statute. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that compliance with the Safe Transport Statute does not preclude conviction for a violation of the Concealed Carry Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Grandberry raises two issues. First, he argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction. He reaches this conclusion by asserting that a conflict exists between the two statutes that can be resolved only by holding that persons in compliance with the Safe Transport Statute do not violate the first element of the crime of carrying a concealed and dangerous weapon contrary to the Concealed Carry Statute. We hold that the Concealed Carry Statute and Safe Transport Statute are not in conflict because Grandberry could have complied with both by either\n   obtaining a license to carry a concealed weapon pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20175.60\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 175.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (hereinafter \"concealed carry license\" or \"license\") or by placing his loaded handgun out of reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Second, Grandberry argues that the Concealed Carry Statute is unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence would reasonably believe that complying with the Safe Transport Statute is sufficient to lawfully place a loaded, uncased handgun in the glove compartment of a motor vehicle. We hold that the Concealed Carry Statute is not unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence has sufficient notice that carrying a concealed and dangerous weapon is unlawful unless one of the enumerated exceptions in the Concealed Carry Statute applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Grandberry was charged with one count of carrying a concealed and dangerous weapon, contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20941.23\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 941.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). The charge arose out of a traffic stop in the City of Milwaukee. At the bench trial held on the matter, Grandberry and the State stipulated to the truth of the facts in the criminal complaint. Accordingly,\n   no testimony was taken. The complaint states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 9, 2014, [two] City of Milwaukee Police Officer[s] ... conducted a [traffic] stop of a vehicle ... driven by the defendant [on] N. 60th St. Upon stopping the vehicle, the defendant identified himself by name but stated he did not have his wallet [or] identification. [One officer] then asked the defendant if he had any firearms in the car[,] and the defendant stated he did[,]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   in the glove compartment. [The officer] then asked the defendant if he had a valid [concealed carry license] and the defendant stated he did, but did not have it with him. Officers then conducted a search of the [license] database and discovered that the defendant did not, in fact, have a valid [concealed carry license]. Officers then went to the glove compartment and discovered a loaded, Hi-Point, .45 [caliber], semi-automatic pistol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon arresting the defendant and conveying him to the station, the defendant made unprovoked statements to the effect of[:] \"The gun in the glove compartment is mine, I took the [concealed carry license] class but never actually got a [license].\" Additionally, the defendant is not a peace officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based upon these facts, the circuit court entered a judgment of conviction against Grandberry. Grandberry then appealed his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 The court of appeals affirmed, holding that the Safe Transport Statute did not apply to Grandberry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Grandberry\n   </em>\n   , unpublished slip op., \u00b6 9.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 We begin our analysis by first setting out the relevant portions of both the Concealed Carry and Safe Transport Statutes. We then address Grandberry's argument that a person in compliance with the Safe Transport Statute cannot, as a matter of law, violate the first element of the Concealed Carry Statute, which he frames as a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge. Finally, we address Grandberry's argument that the Concealed Carry Statute is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Statutory Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1. The Concealed Carry Statute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Concealed Carry Statute, with certain exceptions, criminalizes the carrying of concealed and dangerous weapons.

His first premise is that the two statutes are in conflict because the same conduct-placing a loaded handgun in a motor vehicle-can comply with the Safe Transport Statute yet violate the Concealed Carry Statute. His second premise is that this purported conflict between the statutes must be resolved by a holding from this court that a person in compliance with the Safe Transport Statute does not \"carry\" for purposes of the Concealed Carry Statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grandberry's conclusion is that he complied with the Safe Transport Statute, and\n   so, as a matter of law, his conduct could not violate the first element (\"carry\") of the offense of carrying a concealed and dangerous weapon contrary to the Concealed Carry Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2.

When a person places a loaded handgun in a motor vehicle, he can both transport a firearm\n   in that motor vehicle (an act governed by the terms of the Safe Transport Statute) and carry a concealed and dangerous weapon (an act governed by the Concealed Carry Statute). Contrary to Grandberry's assertions, compliance with both statutes is not only possible, it is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 22 Grandberry argues that it is impossible to comply with the Safe Transport Statute without violating the Concealed Carry Statute. Grandberry asserts that \"Wisconsin courts have ... generally considered firearms located anywhere inside the interior portion of a vehicle to be within a defendant's reach and thus 'carried' for purposes of the [Concealed Carry Statute].\" According to Grandberry, a person who transports a loaded handgun in a motor vehicle that lacks a trunk separate from the passenger area (e.g., a minivan, SUV, hatchback, or station wagon) complies with the Safe Transport Statute yet is always in violation of the Concealed Carry Statute. This is so, he says, because the loaded handgun would always, as a matter of law, be \"within reach,\" and thus \"carried\" for purposes of the Concealed Carry Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 23 This would be a compelling argument if it were true.

Grandberry asks how a person reading the Safe Transport Statute can possibly know that complying with the terms of that statute may, in some circumstances, also violate\n   the Concealed Carry Statute. Unlike the bulk of Grandberry's arguments, the answer to his question is straightforward and elegant in its simplicity: read the Concealed Carry Statute. Due process does not demand that every regulation on a certain subject be in the same statute; such a requirement would be absurd. Rather, where multiple statutes govern a defendant's conduct, due process requires that the terms of the statute under which the defendant was charged be sufficiently clear.\n   <em>\n    Cissell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675551\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/127/205/#p224\">\n    127 Wis. 2d at 216-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675551\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/127/205/#p224\">\n    378 N.W.2d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And I agree with that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 39 But in reaching that conclusion, we created unnecessary ambiguity about what it means to \"carry\" a weapon.

We said that what is \"within reach\" for Fourth Amendment purposes is something different from what is \"within reach\" for purposes of the Concealed Carry Statute. The court offers two reasons for its belief that these are \"entirely separate concepts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   majority op., \u00b6 29. First, it says they are substantively\n   different because the court decides one, while the jury decides the other. The second is just a matter of rhetoric. Literally. The court chose synonymous phrases to describe the same concept and then asserted the synonyms created a substantive difference. I'll address each of these reasons in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 44 \"Within reach,\" the court said, is a question of law in the Fourth Amendment context, while in the context of the Concealed Carry Statute it is a question of fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25. Therefore, the court concluded they mean different things because the court decides the former and juries decide the latter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Get it? I don't. And I don't think the court does either. Whether it is a question of law or a question of fact, both questions address precisely the same consideration: Can a person reach the firearm? The length of a person's arm doesn't change because a jury measures it instead of a judge. The only real significance presented by the different contexts is that one deals with\n   a potentiality and the other with the resolution of the potentiality. Here is what I mean.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 45 The lawful scope of a warrantless search incident to an arrest is defined by a potentiality, to wit, the space into which a person could conceivably reach to retrieve a weapon. The purpose of such searches is \" 'to remove any weapons that [the arrestee] might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape' and the need to prevent the concealment or destruction of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722898\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/454/#p460\">\n    453 U.S. at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722898\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/454/#p460\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chimel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772077\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/752/#p763\">\n    395 U.S. at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772077\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/752/#p763\">\n    89 S.Ct. 2034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

The Court has decided, as a matter of law, that the entirety of a vehicle's passenger compartment can be reached by such a movement. Presumably, it had a good basis for making that determination. If it did not, we would have to conclude that the Court's understanding of the Fourth Amendment in this context has its roots in a\n   factual fallacy. Nothing suggests we ought to entertain that possibility, so I must conclude that the Court truly meant that a firearm in a vehicle's passenger compartment is within an occupant's reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 47 Now for the court's rhetorical distinction between \"within reach\" and \"within reach.\" The court says the federal judiciary \"describe[s] the area subject to a warrantless search incident to arrest as the arrestee's 'grab area,' \" majority op., \u00b6 24 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gandia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8923089\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/255/#p261\">\n    424 F.3d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261 (2d Cir. 2005) ), whereas our court uses \"within reach\" to describe the area subject to the Concealed Carry Statute. And then the court says \"Grandberry and the concurrence fail to recognize the important distinctions between these terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25. Well, that much is certainly true. But I take comfort in the fact that the\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   court-upon which the\n   court relies for its rhetorical distinction-shares the same purported failure.\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   said that \"the passenger compartment of an automobile\" is subject to search because it is \"within 'the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m].' \"\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722898\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/454/#p460\">\n    453 U.S. at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722898\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/454/#p460\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoted source omitted). This is the actual sentence in which the court says it discovered a substantive difference between \"grab area\" and \"within reach.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   majority op., \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 48 The problem with the court's discovery is twofold. First, there is not even a theoretical difference between \"grab area\" and an area that is \"within reach.\" To conclude otherwise would be to say that one may grab something beyond one's reach, or that one may reach something one cannot grab. The second problem is grammatical. The court reads\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   as using \"grab\" to define an area. That's not what\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   was doing. It was describing what a suspect might\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   in an\n   <em>\n    already defined\n   </em>\n   area-to wit, \"grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m].\"\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722898\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/454/#p460\">\n    453 U.S. at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722898\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/454/#p460\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoted source omitted). How did the\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   court define where that might be done? It said a weapon might be grabbed from \"within the area into which an arrestee might reach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722898\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/454/#p460\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Or, with the judicious use of one's editing pencil, this definition can be shortened-without losing a jot or tittle of meaning-to \"within ... reach.\" So the court's discovery of a substantive difference between \"within reach\" and \"within reach\" is both illogical and ungrammatical. I am confident the\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   court would find no \"important distinctions between these terms.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   majority op., \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 49 The court also faults me (and Mr. Grandberry) for not substantively distinguishing \"within reach\" (Fourth Amendment) from \"within reach\" (Concealed Carry Statute) based on the separate lines of cases in which the concept has been used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27. I acknowledge that I find this to be a distinction without a difference, but I don't think it's a fault. The Concealed Carry Statute concerns itself with the same physical reality addressed by\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gant\n   </em>\n   . In the Fourth Amendment context, the concern is whether there\n   <em>\n    could be\n   </em>\n   a weapon within reach. In the Concealed Carry Statute context, the concern is whether there actually\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a weapon within reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 50 This just means that the jury resolves as a factual matter the potentiality described by our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. The Fourth Amendment defines the outer parameters of what could be lawfully within a defendant's reach; the jury decides whether a specific defendant could actually reach that location under the circumstances of a specific case. If he could, then the weapon was \"within reach\" within the meaning of the Concealed Carry Statute. However, if circumstances\n   arise that make it impossible for a defendant to obtain a weapon from the area described by\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gant\n   </em>\n   , the jury may acquit. The defendant attempted this very gambit in\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   . He argued that the glove compartment in which he placed his gun would not open when the passenger seat was occupied, so the gun was not within reach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675262\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/131/153/#p182\">\n    131 Wis. 2d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675262\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/131/153/#p182\">\n    388 N.W.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury convicted him anyway, and we found no error.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675262\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/131/153/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675262\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/131/153/#p182\">\n    at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675262\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/131/153/#p182\">\n    388 N.W.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor did we address the concealed-carry question as anything other than a particularized inquiry into the relationship between the weapon and the area described by\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gant\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 51 Mr. Grandberry's concerns have a good foundation, and we shouldn't have dismissed them as abruptly as we did. The court said that \"[a]ccording to Grandberry, a person who transports a loaded handgun in a motor vehicle that lacks a trunk separate\n   from the passenger area (e.g., a minivan, SUV, hatchback, or station wagon) complies with the Safe Transport Statute yet is always in violation of the Concealed Carry Statute.\" Majority op., \u00b6 22. We then concluded that this would be a compelling argument but for the lack of any \"statute, case law, or regulation\" to support it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23. But in actuality\n   <em>\n    we\n   </em>\n   are the ones who lack a statute, opinion, or regulation to answer Mr. Grandberry's concern. No law defines \"within reach\" more narrowly in the concealed-carry context than in the Fourth Amendment context. Consequently, if Mr. Grandberry encases a handgun and puts it in the furthest corner from the driver's seat in an SUV, he is at risk of prosecution for violating the Concealed Carry Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 52 Ultimately, the court doesn't finish the job it set out for itself. It proposed that the concept of \"within reach\" could describe one area for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, and a different area for purposes\n   of the Concealed Carry Statute. But the court went no further than opining on why it believes the concept\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   describe different areas. That is to say, the opinion doesn't describe what the difference actually\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   . In fact, we affirmatively refused to say what it might be. Instead, we chillingly advised the people of Wisconsin to risk criminal liability on multi-factor tests and common sense: \"[C]itizens and factfinders can find guidance in our precedent and common sense, and should consider factors such as the location of the dangerous weapon in the motor vehicle relative to the location of its possessor, the motor vehicle's size, and the possessor's ability to reach the dangerous weapon while in the motor vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31 (footnote omitted). Anent the last clause of this formulation: How does \"ability to reach the dangerous weapon while in the motor vehicle\" differ from \"within the area into which an arrestee might reach\"? Common sense will utterly exhaust itself trying to find any room between the two, and we aren't saying what the difference might be. And yet, a person placing a firearm in a vehicle hazards criminal prosecution if he can't figure out a distinction that we refuse to describe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 53 The Concealed Carry Statute is not unconstitutionally vague, but only because its proscription reaches the entirety of the passenger compartment. This is a readily-ascertainable prohibition. But if criminality depends on a non-exclusive list of variables like the size of a vehicle, the placement of a weapon, and \"common sense,\" then we have denied the people of Wisconsin the ability to identify with any certainty what the statute prohibits with respect to vehicles. So, ironically, in the process of explaining why the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, we have made it so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kolender v.

The line is far from clear in the matter before this court, except perhaps to a lawyer so well-versed in the laws governing weapons as to be aware of this court's reach into Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, which transfigured the rather simple concept of \"carrying\" into something altogether detached from the person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 72 A person of ordinary intelligence who is trying to learn the legal ways to transport a firearm (or\n   bow or crossbow) would logically turn to the Safe Transport Statute because it addresses transportation of these weapons in vehicles. The text of the Safe Transport Statute allows a person to \"place, possess, or transport a firearm, bow, or crossbow in or on a vehicle\" if the firearm is unloaded or is a handgun, if a bow does not have an arrow nocked, and if a crossbow is either not cocked or is unloaded and encased. The Safe Transport Statute says nothing about where any weapon must be placed in the vehicle, and specifically requires concealment of one type of weapon as one method of compliance. The Safe Transport Statute plainly gives fair notice that: (1) a loaded handgun can be placed, possessed or transported in a vehicle; (2) any other unloaded firearm can be placed, possessed or transported in a vehicle; (3) a bow without an arrow nocked can be placed, possessed or transported in a vehicle; and (4) a crossbow can be placed, possessed or transported in a vehicle if it is either not cocked or is unloaded and in a carrying case. The Safe Transport Statute's text does not say that only a concealed carry licensee can place, possess or transport a handgun in a vehicle. Further, it gives no instruction on specifically where in the vehicle these weapons must be placed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 73 The majority concludes that these statutes are not void for vagueness because Grandberry could have complied\n   with both by either getting a concealed carry license or putting his handgun out of reach in his vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   How would a person of ordinary intelligence\n   know this? The text of both statutes does not alert a gun owner of any connection between the two, much less a dependency of the Safe Transport Statute on the Concealed Carry Licensing Statute. Other states' statutes combine their carrying a weapon statute with transportation of a weapon in a vehicle statute so a person clearly knows what is lawful and what will subject a person to prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046.02\">\n    Tex.

Code Ann. \u00a7 2923.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2017-18). Wisconsin's Concealed Carry Licensing Statute limits licenses to handguns, billy clubs, and electric weapons and requires all licensees to be at least 21 years old. If the majority's conclusion is correct, then a large group of gun (and all bow/crossbow) owners, for whom concealed carry licenses are unavailable, are treated differently than handgun owners 21 years old or older. Under the majority's statutory construction, it is impossible for long gun owners who drive small vehicles without trunks to lawfully transport their guns. Additionally, most gun ranges require weapons to be encased when they are brought into these facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, such\n   concealment is prohibited by the Concealed Carry Statute, making it impossible to lawfully take a long gun from a car into a range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 74 The majority's conclusion absolves the legislature from enacting laws that give fair notice to Wisconsin citizens who exercise their Second Amendment right to bear arms on how to lawfully transport them. Instead, the majority declares it reasonable to expect the ordinary person reading the statutes to do the work of a lawyer and study, analyze, and properly interpret case law (assuming he can find it) in order to reconcile two conflicting statutes. Even more absurdly, the majority expects, indeed requires a person of ordinary intelligence to know what is \"within reach\" despite the inability of the justices on this court to define it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   majority op., \u00b6 31 (recognizing \"it [is] impossible for this court to establish a bright-line rule setting forth which parts of a vehicle are and are not within reach\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 75 Even if a person of ordinary intelligence was able to find and read every applicable Wisconsin case and to understand that a gun placed \"within reach\" in a vehicle violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20941.23\">\n    Wis.

Going forward, the majority's decision prevents the State from using any \"within reach\" incident to arrest cases as the basis for argument in a concealed carry case. It also necessitates a trial in\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    concealed carry \"within reach\" case, regardless of where the weapon is located in the car.
