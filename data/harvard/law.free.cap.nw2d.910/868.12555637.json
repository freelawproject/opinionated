Lee argues IRET failed to perform all the prerequisites under N.D.C.C. ch. 47-32 in order to bring an eviction action against Lee, and therefore, they were unlawfully evicted. Lee further argues the district court failed to make sufficient findings on the issue of default and the district court improperly awarded IRET attorney's fees and costs. We conclude IRET properly brought an eviction action against Lee for failure to pay rent and the district court's findings\n   are sufficient to sustain its conclusions. We affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] IRET owns the premises at 4915 11th Ave. West, Apartment 511, Williston, North Dakota, and leased the property to Lee in July 2017. Lee's monthly rent included $1,050.00 plus $5.00 per month for a trash fee and $24.50 for utilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Between July and September 2017, IRET cited Lee for several lease infractions including excessive noise during quiet hours, keeping unauthorized pets in the apartment, and riding bikes in the apartment building. On September 18, 2017, IRET gave Lee a notice of intention to evict due to multiple lease infractions. Lee refused to vacate the premises. On October 6, 2017, IRET cited Lee for two lease infractions, failing to leash their dogs and leaving garbage in a public area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Lee failed to pay October's rent on time. On October 9, 2017, IRET served Lee with a \"3 day notice to pay rent or vacate\" for failure to pay October's rent, in addition to $125.00 in late fees. On that same day, IRET served Lee with a summons and complaint for violation of the lease by failing to pay rent, and failure to get proper registration or paperwork for their alleged service animal[s]. On October 12, 2017, Lee paid $1,337.63 for October's rent, late charges, and utilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 5] A hearing was held on October 18, 2017.

N.D.C.C. \u00a7 47-32-04.

However, the district court did not further explain its conclusions. When a district court's findings do not disclose the basis for the court's conclusions of law and decisions, this Court cannot properly perform its appellate court function.\n   <em>\n    Sorenson v.

However, the record contains exhibits from the hearing that support the district court's conclusions. On September 18, 2017, IRET served Lee with a three days' notice of intention to evict for multiple lease infractions. Lee refused to vacate, and for the next three weeks, IRET continued to document violations of the lease agreement. On October 9, 2017, after failing to receive rent payment, IRET served Lee with a \"3 day notice to pay rent or vacate\" for failure to pay October's rent, as well as a summons and complaint for violating the terms of the lease by failing to pay rent. The time specified in the summons for the appearance of Lee, October 18, 2017, was not less than three nor more than fifteen days from the date on which the summons was issued, and thus, complied with N.D.C.C. \u00a7 47-32-02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 12] Based on the record below, the district court correctly concluded IRET properly brought an action under N.D.C.C. ch. 47-32 and complied with the notice requirements under \u00a7 47-32-02.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902482\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/857/362/\">\n    2014 ND 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902482\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/857/362/\">\n    857 N.W.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing failure to file a transcript leaves this Court to only look to the record in reviewing the district court's findings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 13] Lee argues the district court did not make sufficient factual findings as to how Lee breached the lease agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 14] \"In an action tried without a jury, a district court's findings of fact are governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review under N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

Also, pursuant to said lease agreement, if payment was not made by the 5th of each month, a $50.00 late fee would be assessed. The Defendants are required to pay $24.50 each month for utilities.

Lee's argument fails under the terms of the lease. After IRET served Lee with a \"3 day notice to pay rent or vacate,\" Lee paid the amount due, in full, within the 3 days provided in the notice. However, this did not remedy the breach. The lease specifically provides IRET's \"exercise [of] any right or remedy upon a breach thereof, shall not constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any other breach or default by Tenant in its performance of its obligations under this Lease.\" The lease further provides IRET's \"acceptance of full or partial Rent from Tenant (or from any third party) during the continuance of any breach or default by Tenant under this Lease ... shall not constitute Landlord's waiver of any such breach or default, and ... shall not constitute Landlord's waiver of Landlord's right to recover possession of the Apartment for non-payment by Tenant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 18] We conclude the district court's findings on default for failure to pay rent were not clearly erroneous. No other factual findings regarding default for other breaches of the lease agreement were included in the findings or judgment. Lee asserted other claims and defenses, but they are not within the scope of the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902482\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/857/362/\">\n    2014 ND 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902482\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/857/362/\">\n    857 N.W.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
