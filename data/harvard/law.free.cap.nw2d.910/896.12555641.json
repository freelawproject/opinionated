We affirm the judgment, concluding the district court's parenting plan decision is supported by sufficient findings and is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Kevin Hoff and Nicole Gututala-Hoff were married in 2013. They have two children together, born in 2014 and 2016. In November 2016 Hoff commenced this action for divorce. In September 2017 the district court held a trial on issues remaining after mediation. Hoff represented himself at trial. Gututala-Hoff appeared personally with her attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] In December 2017 the district court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order for judgment. The court subsequently entered a divorce judgment distributing their property and debts, granting Gututala-Hoff primary residential responsibility for the children, granting Hoff parenting time, granting joint decisionmaking responsibility, and awarding child support to Gututala-Hoff. Hoff filed objections to the judgment, which Gututala-Hoff opposed. The court denied his objections. Hoff appealed from the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Hoff argues that he should receive residential responsibility for the children because it is in the children's best interests and that the parenting time schedule should be modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Generally, custody and visitation decisions are findings of fact and will not be reversed on appeal unless clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Horsted v.

He seeks a revised parenting-time schedule and requests a mediator decide where the children will eventually attend school.
