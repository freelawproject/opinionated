We affirm the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62] In February 2015, officers seized $3,260 in United States currency from Newhauser. Newhauser was a passenger in a vehicle where police discovered methamphetamine and other paraphernalia. Newhauser was charged in connection with this stop in district court, but those charges were later dismissed because of federal charges relating to the incident against Newhauser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63] The State served Newhauser in this forfeiture action in September 2017. Newhauser moved for summary judgment, which he supported with an affidavit. In his affidavit, Newhauser admits the $3,260 was in his wallet and officers seized it as part of the traffic stop. Newhauser also said he obtained the $3,260 from his social security disability income and savings from working occasionally for a contractor. The State responded to Newhauser's motion, but it did not support its response with any affidavits or other evidence. In its response, the State argued Newhauser raised factual questions through his affidavit requiring an evidentiary hearing. The State never scheduled a hearing on the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64] The district court granted Newhauser's motion for summary judgment. The district court noted the State and Newhauser's arguments regarding the promptness of the action and lack of significant nexus between the property seized and offense committed. But the district court concluded the State failed to rebut any facts set forth by Newhauser in his affidavit. Because the State failed to present any evidence that created a genuine dispute of material fact, the district court granted Newhauser's motion for summary judgment without holding a hearing. The district court entered a judgment requiring the State to return the $3,260 to Newhauser. The State appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] On appeal, the State argues the district court erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing on the forfeiture and granting Newhauser's motion for summary judgment. This Court reviews orders on motions for summary judgment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In determining whether summary judgment was appropriately granted, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, and that party will be given the benefit of all favorable inferences which can reasonably be drawn from the record. On appeal, this Court decides whether the information available to the district court precluded the existence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitled the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Hokanson v.

The procedure for forfeitures is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If an answer is filed within the time limits in this chapter,\n   <em>\n    the forfeiture proceedings must be set for hearing before the court.

If the court finds that the property is not subject to forfeiture under this chapter, the court shall order the property released to the owner or other person with a legal interest in the property as that person's right, title, or interest appears. The court shall order the property forfeited if it determines that such property or an interest therein is subject to forfeiture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.1-36.6 (emphasis added). Section 19-03.1-36(1)(h), N.D.C.C., provides that certain property is forfeitable, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   All money, coin, currency, and everything of value furnished, or intended to be furnished, in exchange for a controlled substance in violation of this chapter or an imitation controlled substance in violation of chapter 19-03.2, and all real and personal property, assets, profits, income, proceeds, or an interest therein, acquired or derived from the unlawful purchase, attempted purchase, delivery, attempted delivery, manufacturing, or attempted manufacturing of any controlled substance or imitation controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b67] The State argues the district court prematurely shifted the burdens by applying N.D.R.Civ.P. 56, the rule governing summary judgment, to the proceeding. The State argues N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.1-36.6 always requires the district court to hold a hearing, allowing the State to meet its burden at the hearing, if the forfeiture is contested. \"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that is fully reviewable on appeal.

The plain language also requires the State to first meet its burden, at the hearing, before the burden shifts to the property owner. However, the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure apply, and a party against whom relief is sought may move for summary judgment under N.D.R.Civ.P. 56.

N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.1-36.6. This Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Probable cause is only a minimal, threshold burden. This burden requires the State to establish only that reasonable grounds exist to believe that the property was \"probably connected with criminal activity.\" This level of proof is greater than mere suspicion, but is less than that needed to convict for the suspected crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    One 1990 Chevrolet Pickup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10716978\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/523/389/#p392\">\n    523 N.W.2d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b616] The State did not argue that Newhauser's affidavit met the State's burden to show the $3,260 was probably connected with criminal activity to the district court. We are not ferrets and are not obligated to engage in unassisted searches to support the State's position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Earnest v.

Additionally, this Court has noted that summary judgment is appropriate when a party will be unable to prove an essential element at trial.\n   <em>\n    Dahlberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11156808\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/625/241/\">\n    2001 ND 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11156808\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/625/241/\">\n    625 N.W.2d 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, summary judgment was proper because the State failed to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to its case and on which the State would bear the burden of proof at a hearing. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment because the State failed to provide competent admissible evidence showing it could establish that reasonable grounds existed to believe the $3,260 was probably connected with criminal activity and forfeitable as defined in N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.1-36(1)(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b617] We affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment to Newhauser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b618] Jon J.

Tufte\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   VandeWalle, Chief Justice, concurring in the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b619] I concur in the result reached by the majority opinion. While I am concerned the State may have been misled by the requirement of a hearing in N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.1-36.6, and the fact the State requested but did not set a hearing, once the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment it was apparent that the summary-judgment procedure became operative and I agree with the majority's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b620] I write separately to note that the sum of money which is the subject of the forfeiture action alone might be sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment. The sum of $3,260.00 may not be an unusually large amount of money and might be explained by the defendant's affidavit, thus requiring additional evidence from the State. But, if the sum were, for\n   an extreme example, $300,000.00\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   and the same affidavit was filed by the defendant, I believe summary judgment would have been improperly granted, notwithstanding the absence of further evidence by the State. In such an instance, I submit the sum to be forfeited alone would be evidence from which the court could draw an inference creating a material factual issue, notwithstanding the defendant's affidavit and the lack of further evidence from the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.1-23.3(1)(a), establishing a statutory presumption of forfeiture of currency in excess of $10,000 under certain circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b621] Gerald W.
