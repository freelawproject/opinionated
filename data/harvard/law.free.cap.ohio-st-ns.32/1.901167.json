He had two infant children, Sarah and Stevenson, and a wife, in whom he appears to have had no confidence. He had a brother and sister, residing in Manchester, England, each of whom had a family of children. He made the will in question in March, 1831, when he was contemplating a visit to England. The ship on which he sailed was wrecked on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>voyage, and he was lost.

Perry, </em>of Perry &amp; Jenney, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-6\">I. There is no expression in the will, indicating that testator had any other estate in his mind for any one, than an estate in fee. He spoke in the concrete of \u201c real estate,\u201d of \u201c property, real and personal.\u201d It was devised to his children, and if they should live to maturity, it was to remain theirs. But in case of the death of both, it was to be \u201c left,\u201d \u201c given up\u201d to other devisees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-7\">Had it been given to them for life only, the interest, rents, and accumulations during their lives should have been theirs. On the contrary, all these accumulations were to become a part of the estate, and if anything had to be \u201c given up\u201d to nephews and nieces, all was to be given up, which otherwise had been given to his children. There is no indication that the property, which, in the contingency supposed, was to be \u201c left\u201d or \u201c given up\u201d to the children of his brother and sister, was to be theirs in any different, superior, or more unlimited sense, than it was to be his own children\u2019s, in case they should live to enjoy it. If his children should live to get possession, to a disposing age, there is no indication it was to be \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cgiven up\u201d to anybody.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-8\">If a different intention anywhere appears, it is in the <em>habendum,.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-9\">The meaning which does appear there is in no sense in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>consistent with the devising clause. Hawkins, 203, 204; 1 Redfield on Wills, 473, sec. 4; Ib., n. 6; <em>Frogmorton </em>v. <em>Holly, day, </em>3 Burr. 1623; Hawkins, 136, 137, 215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-4\">As to dying without issue: Hawkins, 215; Redfield on Wills, 706.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-5\">An express estate for life to a devisee may be enlarged by implication. See authorities already cited; <em>King </em>v. <em>King, </em>12 Ohio, 300. If, then, an express estate for life may be enlarged by implication, it may assuredly be enlarged by express words. Hawkins on Wills, 75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-6\">The language in this will, -\u201cdecease . . . without issue,\u201d does not mean \u201c a general failure of issue,\u201d but does mean failure of issue living at the time. <em>Parish\u2019s Heirs </em>v. Ferris, 6 Ohio St. 563; <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>12 Ohio St. 320; Hawkins, 176, 214; 3 Greenleaf's Cruise, 444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-8\">II. If I am right in the construction of this will, there was no life estate in testator\u2019s children, and no remainder to their heirs, issue, children, or descendants. Consequently the rule in Shelley\u2019s ease has no bearing on it. But if the other side is right in supposing the will to' devise a life estate to testator\u2019s children, with remainder in fee or intail to heirs, children, issue, or descendants, the rule in Shelley\u2019s case is in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-9\">The same remark is true of section 53 of the wills act (2 S. &amp; C. 1626), which is identical with section 47 of the wills act of 1840 (Swan\u2019s Stat. 319), and cbmmonly spoken of as abolishing the rule in Shelley\u2019s case. The present will, having been made in 1831, can not, of course, be affected by a statute passed long after the title vested under the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-10\">As to whether the rule in Shelley\u2019s case is operative in Ohio, see 12 Ohio, 471; 2 S. &amp; C. 1626, Judge Swan\u2019s annotation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-11\">The rule in Shelley\u2019s case has been used as a rule of construction, like any other rule, to ascertain the meaning of a testator. In this sense I do not understand it to have been abolished or impaired. It has also been used as an imperative rule of property, to be enforced even as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the intention of testator. In this latter sense it has been abolished by the Ohio statute, and extensively elsewhere.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-5\">\u201c The great difficulty has been,\u201d says Kent, \u201c to settle' where the rule, and where the intention in opposition to the rule, shall prevail.\u201d 4 Kent, 721. Nearly two years after Reddish\u2019s will vested his estate in somebody, our supreme court held the rule in Shelley\u2019s case to be in force in Ohio, as an arbitrary rule of property. <em>McFeeley\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Moore\u2019s </em>Heirs, 5 Ohio, 465. More than ten years afterward, December 7, 1843, after arguments unusually full and elaborate, <em>Armstrong </em>v. Zane, 12 Ohio, 287, and <em>King </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>12 Ohio, 390, were decided. In <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Zane, </em>the court expressly asserted the rule as a rule of property, and such was clearly the ground of decision in the other cases. It is quite clear, therefore, that if an application had been made to any court in Ohio, having jurisdiction to construe Reddish\u2019s will, any time within fifteen years of its taking effect, the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, so far as pertinent, would have prevailed in its arbitrary sense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-6\">Indeed, all the cases decided in Ohio on the basis of the rule, wmre cases where the language construed would have caused more difficulty as to the real intention, than is caused by the language in Reddish\u2019s will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-7\">In Greenleaf\u2019s Cruise, he says the rule, \u201c as now settled and expounded by modern decision,\u201d has the following qualification, viz : \u201c Unless it clearly and unequivocally appear that the words (i. <em>e., </em>heir or heirs of the body) arc used merely as <em>descriptio personarum.\u201d </em>2 Greenl. Cruise, 305, top paging 381, n. 1. The note also states that Judge Story regarded the rule in the United States as a rule of construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-8\">The will of Reddish, in the devising clause, was broad enough to carry a fee. The general frame of it was iu accord with the idea of a fee in the first takers. Then in the habendum clause, \u201c to have and to hold to them during their natural lives and to their heirs,\u201d without break, punctuation, or restriction of meaning; then the devise over is on condition of first devisees \u201c <em>ilying before maturity,\u201d </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>language would by itself enlarge a life estate to a fee simple by implication. Then another branch of the condition, \u201c dying without issue,\u201d expressly limited to a particular time, and yet farther by legal construction, not meaning a geueral failure of issue, therefore, never at any time held to restrict a fee, but always to make a condition for the devise over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-4\">There is nothing in the will which, by recognized rules of construction, can limit the fee simple, which was clearly given in the devising clause, and again in the habendum. Besides this, the devise over is unmistakably a fee given <em>in substitution </em>of the fee first given to testator\u2019s children, in case that fee should be defeated by the happening of specific conditions. 1 Redfield on Wills, 421.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b16-5\"><em>Fdward </em>Colston, also for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-6\">We insist that Stevenson Reddish took a fee simple by the will of his father, Thomas Reddish, in the property in question, and that the <em>children </em>of Stevenson, who are the plaintiffs in this suit, took nothing under their grandfather\u2019s (Thomas Reddish) will. That by said will the children of Stevenson acquired no title whatever in or to the lands and other property devised to Stevenson.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-7\">The words \u201c during their natural lives and. to their heirs,\u201d taken alone will convey a fee, by force of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case.

Glendenning, 8 Paige\u2019s Ch. 295, 804; <em>Shoonmaker </em>v. <em>Sheely, </em>3 Hill (N. Y.), 165 ; 12 Ohio, 471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-6\">It is perfectly clear, then, that if the testator had stopped at the word \u201c <em>heirs,\u201d </em>that if the will contained no other words descriptive of the quantity of interest than the words \u201cto have and to hold during their natural lives, and to their heirs,\u201d that each child, Sarah and Stevenson Reddish, would have taken a fee in their respective devises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-7\">It remains to considey what effect the words immediately following the word \u201c <em>heirs </em>\u201d have.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-8\">We deny that these words, \u201cand in case of the decease of both of my aforesaid children before they be of maturity, according to law, and without lawful issue,\u201d which introduce the ulterior devise, have the effect of impairing the meaning of the word \u201c <em>heirs\u201d </em>occurring in the prior devise, so as to exempt that prior devise from the operation of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case. On the contrary, that these words do not refer at all to the <em>quantity </em>of estate bestowed by the first devise, but that they simply designate a contingency on the happening of which the estate created by the first devise, <em>whatever is the quantity of that estate, </em>shall pass over. The contingency named is the decease of both Sarah and Stevenson under maturity according to law \u2014.that is, under twenty-one, and without lawful issue. 1 Eearue, 149, 193; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 214 et seq.; 5 Ohio, 465; 4 Preston on Estates, 273-284.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-9\">As to the rule of construction where the testator uses legal words, see Eearne Con.

But that is not the case. The language cited is followed by the immediate context, \u201c each of my aforesaid children to have and to hold the same during their natural lives, and to their heirs, and in case of the decease,\u201d etc. The plain, obvious, popular meaning is that he shall not convey it away from his children. When that life estate should be ended, he then gives it to the heirs of his son Stevenson; and who he meant by his sou\u2019s heirs is evident enough, for he further provides, that if his son should die under age and without surviving issue, the estate intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>for those heirs should go to the children of his brother and sister. His son\u2019s heirs, then, for whom he desires to make provision, are his son\u2019s issue living at his son\u2019s death. He provides first for his son; then for his son\u2019s issue, if he leave any; then, if he dies without leaving any, for his nephews and nieces.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\">This, we submit, is the natural construction of the will \u2014what would occur to plain people, looking at it merely to discover its meaning, and taking its language in its usual and ordinary sense, as opposed to the artificial and technical interpretation forced upon it by the use of arbitrary rules, applied in a cheap, mechanical, and inconsiderate way. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>27 Ohio St. 371; <em>Harkness </em>v. <em>Corning, </em>24 Ohio St. 416.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-6\">If, in the case at bar, the words \u201c and to -their heirs,\u201d occurring after the limitation to the testator\u2019s son and daughter, \u201c during their natural lives,\u201d be restricted to mean \u201c heirs of their bodies,\u201d or \u201cissue,\u201d then, the estate devised would be an estate tail in Stevenson Reddish, executed by our statute to restrict entailments, in his issue, tlie plaintiffs below, as an estate in fee simple. <em>Roddy </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>6 H. L. C. 823. And such, a construction is supported by the consideration, elsewhere urged, that, as the ulterior limitation over was to take effect only on the death of the testator\u2019s son under age, and without issue, the intention was manifested that the issue of Stevenson were the persons described as his heirs. If so, it is immaterial whether they take by descent or by purchase. In the former case, their father had an estate tail; in the latter, an estate for life merely. The result, so far as this controversy is concerned, is the same either way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">We can understand that a devise for life maybe enlarged to an estate tail, by implication, arising in consequence of a limitation over or a dying without issue living, and before attaining a particular age ; because, in such a ease, the intention of the testator to make the issue of the first taker an object of his bounty is plain; and such an intention upon the limitations in Reddish\u2019s will would be strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>executed by the operation of our statute of 1811, to resti\u2019ict entailments, which would make Stevenson Reddish the first donee in tail, but for his life only, perfecting the fee absolutely in his issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-4\">The plain and manifest intention of the testator, to limit to his son Stevenson an estate for his life only, is expressly declared, and can be defeated only, if at all, by the application of the rule in the Shelley case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\">'Whether that application will be made, depends on the effect this court will give to the decision in the case of <em>King </em>v. Beck, 15 Ohio, 559. According to that decision, it is impossible to distinguish this case from that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">Since the passage of the act of 1840 relating to wills (sec. 47), no controversy could arise upon such limitations as are contained in Reddish\u2019s will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">Hid the testator use the words in question for the purpose of giving to his son and daughter, in case they attained full age, the absolute power of alienation; or did he use them to describe a class of persons to take the estate after the d\u00e9ath of his son and daughter? Now, there is nothing whatever in the will, other than these very words themselves, to show that he meant to enlarge the estate of his son and daughter beyond an estate for life; and the use of the words descriptive of the estate given to them, \u201cto have and to hold the same during their natural lives,\u201dis entirely inconsistent with such a result. A testator <em>inops consilii, </em>may be supposed to have used the words, <em>\u201cand to their heirs\u201d </em>in a vague and indeterminate sense, for the technical and popular usage, to which they are subject, differs and varies widely; but the phrase, <em>\u201cduring their natural lives,\u201d </em>as applied to an estate in lands, is not capable of ambiguity. The technical and popular meaning are identical and uniform.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b20-8\">Scott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">In the construction of a will, it is well settled as a paramount rule, in this state, that the intention of the' testator, as gathered from the whole will, must control, when such intention is not in conflict with the law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>against public policy. It is also an established rule of construction, that words in a will are to be understood according to their ordinary and legal signification, unless it is manifest from the <em>context, or from other </em>provisions in the will, that the testator has used them in a different sense, and unless the sense in\u2019which they were used is clearly apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">Reading the will under consideration, in the light of this latter rule, the question is, what is the quantum and character of the estate which the testator intended that his children should take in- the realty specifically devised to them ?</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">The English rule, that a devise to A. and his heirs, followed'by a devise over in case A. die without issue, will be cut down to a fee tail in A., and the woi\u2019d heirs be construed as meaning issue, is owing to the fact that in that country the words \u201cdying without issue\u201d are construed as meaning <em>an indefinite failure of issue. </em>2 Jar. on Wills, <em>301. </em>In this state, however, it is well settled that the words \u201cdying without issue \u201d import a dying without issue living at the death of the prior devisee. <em>Parrish\u2019s Heirs </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>6 Ohio St. 563; <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>12 Ohio St. 320. Still, we should have no hesitation in finding, from the language of the-will before us, that the. testator intended a life estate only for the first devisees, if the sole condition of the limitation over to the nephews aud nieces had been the dying of his children without issue ; and without reference to the time when they should so die. But such is not the language of the will. The testator does not attempt to make any disposition of his property, after the- death of his children, except in the event of the death of both of them before becoming of full. age. And yet it is obvious from the general and comprehensive terms of the residuary clauses, that he was anxious to leave no property undisposed of, which it was in his power to control. If he intended to give his children a mere life estate in the premises, then he purposed, in case either of them should live till majority, and both should die without leaving issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>that the fee of- the land should remain wholly undevised. Eor it is very clear that, in such case, the contingent devise over to his nephews and nieces could never take effect. Had a life estate only been intended for his son, why should the remainder over depend on his death <em>during minority ? </em>Hence, a very strong implication arises that the testator intended by the words \u201c and to their heirs\u201d (found in the <em>habendum </em>clause), to give to his children an estate of inheritance in fee simple in the premises devised, which should become indefeasible upon their attaining an age which would render them legally capable of controlling and disposing of it. His scheme of testamentary disposition contemplated his children as the primary objects of his bounty. Should both of them die during minority, and leaving no issue, then he intended the estate to pass over to certain nephews and nieces in fee simple. This purpose he could effect by an executory devise, which should make the estate given to his children defeasible, upon the happening of the contemplated contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">But this defeasible character of the estate given to his children, was in no case to affect or defeat their estate \u201cduring their natural lives.\u201d It is clear also that he did not intend to prefer the children of his brother and sister to the lawful issue of his own children; for the limitation over is in case bis own children shall die under age, and <em>\u2018without lawful issue. </em>But it is to be presumed that he knew the statutes of descent of this state, and was aware that if his children should die under age, and of course intestate, their issue would1 succeed to the inheritance, unless he should otherwise direct. With the statutory rule of descent he was content, and made no provision to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">If one only of his children should die during minority, leaving no issue, it is to be presumed he knew that his surviving child would, under the statute of descents and distribution, take, as heir, the property devised or bequeathed to the one so dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">That this would accord with his wishes, is evident from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the fact that the gift over is conditioned upon the death o\u00ed <em>both </em>his children during minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">If, then, by taking the words of the <em>habendum, \u201c and to their heirs,\u201d </em>in their ordinary and legal signification, as words of limitation, defining the extent of the estate or interest in the lands devised (which it is the proper office of a <em>habendum </em>to do) \u2014 if, by assuming that the testator meant just what he has said, we,can give full effect to the whole scheme of disposition, so far as it is clearly shown in any and every part of the will, we have no right to conjecture that the testator <em>may </em>have used the word \u201c heirs,\u201d in a different sense, as meaning children or issue; and thereupon to change the testator\u2019s scheme for one of our own. There is no direct devise of the laud in question to any one except to Stevenson Reddish, and the ulterior devisees, his English cousins, in the event of his dying within age and without issue. The word \u201cheirs\u201d does not occur in the devising clause proper. But defendants in error claim that this word heirs, means children or issue, because the condition of the limitation over is that Stevenson shall die without issue, which could only have been intended for the benefit of his children ; but, as we have said, this implication is rebutted by the provision that the property shall go over only in the event of Stevenson\u2019s death during minority. If he live to be twenty-one, the testator has said, in effect, that the property devised to him shall never go over, -under the will, issue or no issue. This condition could be intended Only for the benefit of Stevenson himself. <em>We </em>can not, therefore, be even <em>reasonably </em>certain that the testator used the word \u201c heirs\u201d as descriptive of the children that might be born to Stevenson, and to whom he intended to devise the fee simple. Indeed, he seems to have understood the distinction between <em>heirs </em>generally, and <em>children </em>or <em>issue. </em>He uses both words in the same s\u00e9ntence. 'When he speaks of \u201clawful issue,\u201d he evidently means <em>children; </em>and when he speaks of \u201c heirs,\u201d why shall we not presume that he means <em>\"heirs'generally, </em>as the word usually and legally imports ? There could be no room for a possible doubt on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>this question, were it not that the testator has said that his children should have and hold the premises previously devised to them \u201c <em>during their natural lives </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">These words standing alone, or if followed by the word <em>only, </em>would clearly indicate an intention to restrict the estate previously given in general terms, to a mere life estate. But this expression does not stand alone. His children are \u201cto have and hold during their natural lives, <em>and to their heirs.\u201d </em>Here we find an apparent express enlargement of the estate given, to a fee simple. The reason fbr this form of expression may be learned by looking to the remainder of the sentence, in which there is a contingent devise over. Construing the whole sentence together, we think the meaning of the testator can not be regarded as doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">He intended that each of his children should take an estate in fee simple in the premises devised to them respectively. But he farther intended that this estate should be defeasible, and terminate with \u201c their natural lives,\u201d in case they should both die before attaining the age of twenty-one years, and without lawful issue. Upon the happening of that contingency no one should take the premises devised, as heir to his children, or either of them, but they should pass to the ulterior devisees under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">This construction is in harmony with the general scope of the will. For, after disposing of the real estate specifically described, and which he divides between his two children according to his own judgment, the testator proceeds to give to his children the whole of his remaining property, whether real or personal, to be equally divided between Sarah and Stevenson, when Sarah (the elder) should become of age. Stevenson\u2019s share, upon this division, is to be retained by his guardian until he becomes of age, and then \u201c the said share to be given immediately up to him, and the functions of the guardian, as also the executor or executors, to cease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">There can be no doubt that as to all this residuary px\u2019opex\u2019ty, whether real or personal, the childrexx were to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>absolute owners, with full power of control over it, as soon as they would respectively become of age. And yet all this property, as well as the accumulations arising from interest, or the rents of any part of the whole estate, was subjected to the same limitation over, in favor of the same nephews and nieces, and upon the same conditions, as in the case of the lands and lots specifically described and divided by the testator between his children. We see no reason to doubt that he intended their title to the property specifically devised to be equally absolute and indefeasible, if either of them should live to be of full age, or should leave lawful issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Such would, very clearly, be the construction of the will under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case. But, by the 47th section of the wills act of 1840, and the corresponding 53d section of our present wills act, it is declared that \u201c when lands, tenements,orhereditaments are given by will to any person for his life, and after his death to his heirs in fee, or by words to that effect, the conveyance shall be construed to vest an estate for life only in such first taker, and a remainder in fee simple in his heirs.\u201d The rule of construction prescribed by these statutes, was intended to give a controlling effect to the clear intention of the testator, and to forbid the application of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, when such application would defeat the manifest intention of the testator. Were we to regard this statute as applicable to wills which, like the one before us, took effect before its passage, we should still he of the opinion that the language of the will under consideration is not such as to bring it within the class of cases contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">We think the judgment of the court below should be reversed, and the petition of the plaintiffs, in the court below, be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
