Reserved in the District Court of Cuyahoga county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-9\">On the 1st day of May, 1873, the plaintiff in error commenced an action in the court of common pleas against the defendants in error, Miles D. Carrington, William Casey, and John Cunningham, to recover damages against the said defendants for cansing the death of Richard Conway, by tbe negligence and wrongful acts of said defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-10\">The petition charges, \u201c that said defendants, on tbe 30th day of April, 1873, were the owners of and in control of a schooner, or sailing vessel, called tbe 1S. D. Hnngerford,\u2019 filled witb iron ore, and lying at the docks of tbe Atlantic and Great Western Railroad Company, in Cleveland, being unloaded by the said Richard Conway and others, wbo were then and there unloading in the employment of said railroad company. That, for tbe purpose of enabling said Conway and others to unload said vessel, and remove the ore aforesaid from her, the defendants, personally and by tbe aid and means of their agents, servants, and employes, erected upon said vessel an apparatus for hoisting said ore therefrom, which apparatus consisted mainly of a set of pulleys and tubs. That such apparatus was wholly insufficient for tbe purpose for which it was erected and used. That said Conway, relying upon said apparatus being properly put up, erected, fastened, and secured, was, upon the day last aforesaid, engaged in unloading said ore with the same, and was dumping the ore, when said apparatus, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>reason of being improperly and insecurely erected, fastened, and secured, gave way and broke, and without any fault, negligence, or carelessness on his part, the pulley block of said apparatus fell down, and in its fall with great force and violence hit said Richard Conway on the head and .wounded him so severely that he died from the effects of such blow within about four hours after receiving the same.\u201d . . . \u201c That the said defendants were then the owners of said schooner, and in charge thereof, and of such machinery and apparatus, and in consequence of their wrong and negligence as aforesaid, said Richard Conway was fatally wounded and injured as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-6\">The petition contains other allegations in regard to the family of said Richard Conway, deceased, and other allegations not necessaryhere to be noticed..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-7\">A summons was issued to the sheriff\u2019 of Cuyahoga county and served upon John Cunningham, one of the defendants, and he appeared and filed his answer to the petition. At the same time that the summons was issued and served upon Cunningham in the county of Cuyahoga, another summons was issued and served upon the defendants Carrington and Casey in Lucas county ; and, thereupon, the defendants, Carrington and Casey, filed' a motion to set aside the summons and dismiss the petition as to them. It sets forth, as the grounds for dismissing the proceedings, <em>First. </em>That the said John Cunningham has never had any interest in said schooner \u201c Hungerford,\u201d her-earnings or profits; that he was, at the date mentioned in plaintiff's petition employed by Carrington and Casey as captain of said vessel, at a fixed salary; that neither said Carrington nor Casey were at Cleveland on any of the dates mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s petition, nor have either of them any personal knowledge of, or connection with, any of the said transactions in said petition stated. <em>Second. </em>Said Carrington and Casey have been for many years past residents of said city of Toledo, in Lucas county, Ohio; no summons in this case has been served upon either of them in said county of Cuyahoga, and the said Carrington and Casey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>offer in support of this their motion, affidavits in the form of an answer to the plaintiff\u2019s petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-4\">In support of this motion, they also file an answer. They appear for the single purpose of supporting their motion to dismiss. \u201c They file this their answer under oath for the sole purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the court over them as defendants, and in support of their motion heretofore filed, praying that the summons issued to Lucas county in this case be set aside and the plaintiff\u2019s petition be dismissed. They say, that they have been for several years past residents of the city of Toledo, in said county of Lucas, doing business therein as partners under the firm name of Carrington and Casey <em>; </em>they have, also, for more than a year past, owned the schooner \u00a3 S. D. Hungerford;\u2019 defendant John Cunningham has never owned any interest in said vessel, or the earnings or profits thereof, at the dates mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s petition, but was employed by Carrington and Casey to act as captain of said vessel, at a fixed salary; neither said Carrington nor said Casey was in Cleveland at any of the dates mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s petition, nor had either of them any knowledge of any of the occurrences in said petition until several days afterward ; neither of them has been served with summons in said Cuyahoga county, nor has either in any way assented that the said court take jurisdiction over them as defendants in said case. Wherefore, they pray that said summons be set aside, and said petition as to these defendants dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-5\">At the May term, 1873, of the court of common pleas, this motion came on for hearing, and it appears by the bill of exceptions that the plaintiff objected to the allowance of said motion, and especially upon the ground that he was entitled to a trial by jury upon the issues presented by his petition and said answer, and demanded such jury trial, which objection was overruled, and a jury trial upon such issue refused; to which orders of the court the plaintiff duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">The said Carrington and Casey read in support of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>motion the said answer under oath, and also the answer of the defendant, John Cunningham, by him filed in said case. The plaintiff objected to the introduction of said affidavits in evidence, which objection was heard and said affidavits received; to all of which plaintiff duly excepted. No other affidavits or evidence was offered by either party; whereupon, the court granted said motion, and ordered that said petition be dismissed as to the defendants, Carrington and Casey; to which order plaintiff excepted, and thereupon, upon motion of the plaintiff, a bill of exceptions was allowed and signed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-5\"><em>Estep &amp; </em>Burke, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-6\">[No brief for the plaintiff in error was found on file by the reporter.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-7\"><em>Bissell &amp; Gorrill, </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-8\">Our code of civil procedure does not authorize the joinder in question.

The petition alleges as a ground of action, that all the defendants were the owners of the schooner, and that all were guilty of the negligence charged, which was, \u201c that \u25a0for the purpose of enabling said Conway and others to unload said vessel and remove the ore aforesaid, the defendants personally, and by the aid and means of their agents, servants, and employes, erected upon said vessel an apparatus for hoisting said ore therefrom, . . . which was wholly insufficient for the purpose; . . . said apparatus, by reason of being improperly and insecurely erected, fastened, and secured, gave way and broke,\u201d and thereby the deceased was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">If these allegations are true, then the suit was purely transitory in its character, and might be brought in any county where any one of .the defendants resided or might be served. Code, \u00a7 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The grounds for a recovery are that each and all these defendants were guilty of negligence, in erecting upon said vessel, of which they were owners, an unsafe and insecure hoisting apparatus, to be used in unloading the ore, which, while being used by Conway, without any fault of his, fell and caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The motion and answer of Carrington and Casey does not deny these allegations, except as to the joint ownership of the vessel. They aver, however, that Cunningham was not such joint owner, but only in command as captain at a fixed salary, and that neither of them was in Cuyahoga county at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">As to the charge that they, with Cunningham, were guilty of negligence in erecting and keeping on the vessel an unsafe hoisting apparatus, the motion and answer are silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Assuming, however, that these material averments of the petition, as to negligence, were put in issue by the motion and answer, the question is presented \u2014 who is to determine the question of fact thus raised ? The claim is, that, if Carrington and Casey are liable at all, it is as owners responsible for the acts of the captain and other employes on the schooner, under the rule of <em>respondeat superior; </em>and it is claimed, as a matter of pleading, that the master and his servant can not be joined in an action for the negligence of the servant. Whether this be so or not, we need not here inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery does not depend on the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>His claim does not rest on that ground, but on that of joint and mutual negligence of each of the defendants in the erection of an unsafe hoisting apparatus on a vessel of which they were joint owners. We may assume, for the purposes of this case, that, upon the state of fact as claimed in this motion and answer, these defendants could not be served in Lucas county.. It will be conceded that, if the facts are as alleged in the petition, they were pioperly served.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The petition has, upon its face, made a case, under the 53d and 58th sections of the code, for sending a summons to Lucas county. The answer and motion, in substance, deny the allegations of the petition in that behalf. The petition makes a case in which all the defendants are guilty of negligence! The answer makes one, or seeks to make it, where the liability of the non-resident defendants, if any \u25a0 exists, is for the acts of their servants and agent, under the maxim, <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">This is an issue of fact. The action is to recover a money judgment, and the question is, is this an issue for the court or jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">If, upon the face of the petition, it appeared that the plaintiff had no right, under section 58 of the code, to send a summons to another county, a motion to quash such summons might be entertained and determined by the court, for that would be a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Under section 87 of the code, a demurrer lies, where it appears upon the face of the petition, that the court has no jurisdiction over the person. If it does not so appear, then by section 89 the objection may be taken by answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The issue of fact in this case, raises the single question, had the court jurisdiction over the persons of Carrington and Casey ?</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">If this issue is found for plaintiff the court has such jurisdiction. If found for the defendants, and if, as a matter of law, which we do not determine, a master and servant, can not be joined as defendants in an action for the servant\u2019s negligence, then no jurisdiction was acquired over these defendants, although they are liable as masters for the acts of Cunningham as their servant in Lucas county.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">By section 261 of the code, \u201c an issue of facts arises, 1. Upon a material allegation of the petition denied by the answer,\u201d etc.; and, by section 263, \u201c issues of fact for the recovery of money . . . shall be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived.\u201d We think the court erred in hearing and determining this issue. The plaintiff had the right to submit it to a jury. The court in assuming to try this issue, on motion was, in fact, fiuding upon material allegations of the petition alleged as a ground for a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\"><em>The Presbyterian Society of Gallipolis </em>v. <em>Smithers, </em>12 Ohio St. 248, is decisive of this point. In that case, persons claiming to be trustees of a corporation, brought suit to recover possession of property owned by it. The answer by the defendants denied these persons were such trustees, and averred that they were the lawful trustees. Upon motion of defendant the issue was tried by the court, and the action was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">On error to this court, it was held, that this was an issue oi fact, under sections 87 and 89 of the code, as to the legal capacity of plaintiffs to sue, which was properly triable by a jury, and that the court below erred when it undertook to determine it upon motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>It is not within the power of a plaintiff to compel parties residing out of the county where suit is brought to answer out of their own county, by uniting with them a mere nominal party, or one not rightly joined with them as a defendant. In order to give the court jurisdiction over the persons of non-resident defendants, who are joined with resident defendants, the latter must have a real and substantial interest adverse to the plaintiff. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>11 Ohio St. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Where a resident and a non-resident of the county are sued as joint contractors, and service is made on the latter in his own county, and on the trial it turns out that the resident defendant is not liable, judgment can not be rendered against the non-resident, because the jurisdiction of the court over his person depended on his being rightly joined with the resident defendant, and as the verdict found he was not liable, there was no authority to summon the non-resident to answer out of the county where he was served.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In the last two cases, like the one at bar, the jurisdiction of the court over the non-resident defendants depended upon the facts in issue, which could only be determined in the usual way.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>the non-resident defendant answered to the jurisdiction, and also to the merits; and, upon final trial, it appearing that the resident defendant was not properly joined as a defendant, and had no real interest adverse to the plaintiff', the case was dismissed as to the non-resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">So, in this case, if upon a trial of the issue it should appear that Cunningham was not properly made a defendant, the service on the non-residents gave the court no jurisdiction over them. In such a case, the court could only obtain jurisdiction over them by a service in Cuyahoga county, or by waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\"><em>Allen </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>11 Ohio St. 374, was an action by assignees of an account against the assignors resident of the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>where suit was brought, who was there served, joined with the debtor, who resided in another county, as co-defendants, and who was served by summons where he resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">It was admitted by the plaintiff that the defendants who, as alleged, owed the account, were not residents or served with process in the county where the action was pending, and, it appearing on the face of the petition that the assignors of the account had no real and substantial interest adverse to the plaintiff, the court, on motion, dismissed the action as to the non-residents served in another county. The admission in this case presented a question of law, and was properly determined by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Judgment is reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
