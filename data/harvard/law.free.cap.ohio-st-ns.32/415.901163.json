The work being done, and it being agreed by ail that B. should pay G.r who was to give up his claim against S. and look to E. alone for payment; this is such a contract as need not be in writing under the statute.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\">Error to the Superior Court of Montgomery county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">In this case there are three bills of exceptions, the first two of which relate to errors occurring at the trial, with regard to the admission of testimony. The trial was at the March term, 1874, and the bills of exceptions were not filed until May, 1874, after the trial term had closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">The third bill of exceptions, though taken at a subsequent term, was upon the overruling of a motion for a new trial. This bill sets out all the evidence together with the charge of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">Erom this bill, it appears that Estabrook, who was defendant below, made a contract with one Showalter to build a house in Dayton. Gebhart was plaintiff below, and his-claim is, in substance, that Showalter wanted him to do certain work on the house, and furnish material therefor. Showalter was irresponsible, and Gebhart would not do as desired, unless defendant, Estabrook, promised to see plaintiff paid out of the moneys which would have been payable to Showalter under the contract. Gebhart says, that without this promise of Estabrook, he would not have done the work or furnished the materials. After the work was done, Showalter, who was cognizant of the agreement between Gebhart and Estabrook, gave Gebhart an order on Estabrook for the amount due. Estabrook said he would not accept the order, not having the money, but that he had not paid Showalter, and there was enough due to satisfy Gebhart\u2019s claim, and he would see it paid when the building was completed. Estabrook repeated his promises and assurances, telling Gebhart that it was no.t necessary to take a mechanic\u2019s lien, as he had agreed to see the amount paid, and would do so as soon as he could borrow the money. Gebhart claims to recover $717.47 and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-8\">These statements are all denied by defendant. He denies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>having made any promise or agreement of any kind; says he never agreed to pay Gebhart in any way, and is at issue-with plaintiff upon all material allegations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">In an amended answer, Estabrook sets up the statute of' fraud, averring that the alleged promise was to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of the said Showalter, was. not in writing, and therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">There was testimony on the part of plaintiff tending to-prove his side of the case, and that Estabrook did assume and promise as claimed. There was also testimony on the-part of defendant-, tending to prove his side, and negativeing all the assertions of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-8\">\"Whereupon the court charged the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-9\">If the alleged promise of Estabrook amounted simply to-an agreement to answer for the debt of Showalter to Gebhart, it being admitted that there was no contract or memorandum in writing signed by Estabrook to that effect,. Gebhart \u2018can not recover. On the other hand, if there was-a new and independent arrangement between Gebhart and. Estabrook by which, for the purpose \u2022 of inducing Gebhart to furnish labor and material for his house, Estabrook. promised to pay him for said work out of the funds which,, under the contract, would be coming to Showalter; thatGebhart furnished said work and material relying on this-promise; that he would not otherwise have furnished them ; that Showalter was irresponsible, and assented to the arrangement, it is your duty to enforce this contract, by your-verdict, although it was not in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-10\">Again, even if you find that there was no contract at the-beginning which, under the rule thus given, would hold Estabrook; yet, if after work was done, Estabrook being-indebted to Showalter, an arrangement was made by the consent of all parties that Estabrook should pay Gebhart the amount of his bill furnished under the Showalter contract, Estabrook assuming to pay, and Gebhart giving up-his claim against Showalter and looking alone to Estabrook,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>for payment, Estabrook must be held bound by this new \u00abcontract, 'though it was not in writing, and must pay the \u25a0debt. This arrangement or contract, to be binding on. Estabrook, must have all the features indicated, the consent \u25a0of all parties and the extinguishment of two debts. Plaintiff is bound to satisfy you by a preponderance of proof that \u00abone or the other of these contracts existed between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-4\">To which charge, and every portion thereof, the said defendant, by his counsel, their excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">The jury found for plaintiff, Gebhart, in the amount \u2022claimed, and the motion for a new trial having been over-a-uled, a petition in error was filed in the supreme court. \u2019The alleged errors are:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">1. That said court erred in admitting the evidence offered by said \"Willian F. Gebhart, to which said Joel Estabrook \u2022objected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">2. That said court erred in the instructions given to the jury upon said trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\">3. That said court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial, filed in said ease by said Joel Estabrook.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-9\">4. That the facts set forth in said petition, filed in said \u2022cause by said \"William F.

Code, \u00a7 294. If, then, not \u201c filed \u201d till a subsequent term, it is \u25a0only an exception as of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">As to the third bill, however, it is different. That was taken to present alleged error in overruling the motion for a new trial. That error, if any, occurred when the motion was overruled, and the bill is properly taken as of that term. This is settled by the cases, <em>City of Dayton </em>v. <em>Hinsey </em>and <em>P. C. </em>&amp; <em>St. L. R. R. </em>v. <em>Porter, ante, </em>258, 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The first part of the charge relates to the nature of the alleged promise made by Estabrook. The court told the-\" jury plainly, that if this promise was merely to answer for Showalter\u2019s debt, there could be no recovery for want of writing; but, if there was a new contract between Gebhart and Estabrook, by which, to induce Gebhart to furnish the labor and material, Estabrook undertook to pay, out of funds which would be coming to Showalter; that Gebhart furnished the work and material relying on this1' promise, which he would not otherwise have done, and that Showalter was irresponsible and assented to this arrangement, then the contract might be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We see no error in this. In 1 Smith\u2019s L. C. 507, notes to <em>Birkneys </em>v. <em>Damill, </em>it is said, \u201cWhen it is doubtful whether the sale was made exclusively on the defendant\u2019s credit, the question should be left to the jury.\u201d And in 2 Parsons on Contracts, 11: \u201c Whether a contract is collateral or original, may be a question of construction, and then it is for the court; but it is often regarded as a question of fact, and then it is for the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">If the jury saw fit to believe the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, they could have found that Estabrook did agree to make the payments, and Gebhart refused to work without this assurance; and, without going into an elaborate discussion of testimony, it seems to us that, though much might be said upon either side, we can not interfere with the verdict on the ground that it is against the evidence. It presents a square conflict between witnesses, and the verdict should have been with that party to whose evidence the greatest credibility attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The court further charged, that if the original contract was not made, as Gebhart alleged, yet, if, after the work was done, Showalter being indebted to Estabrook, an arrangement was made, by consent of all, that Estabrook should pay Gebhart, he giving up his claim against Showalter, and looking to Estabrook alone, then Estabrook could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>be held, although there was no writing. The court further saying that such an arrangement must have the features of \u25a0consent of all parties and the extinguishment of the debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">This is making a case of novation, and w\u00e9 can only make the same remarks as those applied to the other branch of the case. The matter was fairly left to the jury, .and the evidence is not such as would authorize us to interfere with their conclusion. We see no error in the other points made.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-7\">Scott and Ashburn, JJ., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
