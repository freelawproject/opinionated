See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Irvin, </em>5 Blackf. 343.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b179-9\">Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATD\">The plaintiff in error was indicted, convicted, and sentenced under section 7 of \u201can act for the prevention of gaming.\u201d 1 S. &amp; C. 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">That section provides: \u201c That if any person shall play at any game whatsoever, for any sum of money, or other property of any value, . . . every such person shall,\u201d etc., \u201c on conviction thereof, be fined,\u201d etc. This indictment charges (omitting formal parts), that-the plaintiff in error \u201c did unlawfully play at a certain game called \u2018 poker,\u2019 for a large sum of money, to wit, for the sum of two dollars, by means of a certain gaming device, to wit, a pack of cards,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">A motion to quash, on the ground that the indictment was defective, in not stating the names of the person or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>persons with whom the game was played, was overruled, .and an exception was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The same question was then raised by demurrer, and again during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We have already had occasion to consider the question here involved, <em>Carper </em>v. <em>The State, </em>27 Ohio St. 272. Although that case was determined chiefly on other grounds, yet what was there said touching the sufficiency of such an indictment is now re-affirmed. Numerous authorities may be cited in support of this conclusion. <em>The State </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>83 N. H. 212; <em>Coggins </em>v. <em>The State, </em>7 Porter (Ala.), 263; <em>Huffman\u2019s case, </em>6 Rand. 685; <em>McGuffey </em>v. <em>The State, 4 </em>Texas, 156; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Ake, </em>9 Texas, 332; <em>Haran </em>v. <em>The State, </em>24 Texas, 161; <em>The State </em>v. <em>McBride, </em>8 Humphreys, 66; <em>Hulsted </em>v. <em>Com., </em>5 Leigh, 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Some of these cases, as well as the cases cited by the plaintiffs in error, turn upon the wording of the statutes of the different states.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">On this point it has been well said, the decisions in the \u25a0different states are, by no means, harmonious, nor do they all proceed upon just principles. 2 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Proced. \u00a7 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Counsel rely on <em>Davis </em>v. <em>The State, </em>7 Ohio (pt. 1), 204, and <em>Buck </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Ohio St. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>The State, </em>it was held, that to constitute a good indictment, under the <em>ninth section </em>of this statute, for suffering gaming by others, in a house or building in possession of the defendant, it must state the names of the persons who were suffered to play.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">In <em>Buck </em>v. <em>The State, </em>the same rule was applied to the first section of the act of 1846, for permitting gambling in defendant\u2019s house or building, and <em>Davis </em>v. <em>The State </em>was followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">To constitute an indictable offense, under either of these statutes, two different acts must be charged and proved:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">1. That some third parties were guilty of violating the provisions against gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>2. That the party charged was guilty of suffering or permitting such unlawful act in his building named.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">These two essential elements were involved in the offenses charged in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>The State, </em>and in <em>Buck </em>v. <em>The State. </em>Good pleading would therefore require that in such cases the indictment should advise the accused of the names of the-persons whom lie suffered or permitted to gamble on his premises, in order that a completed offense be charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Under the 7th section, the offense consists of the single act of playing with a gaming device for money. This act is a completed offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">This indictment contains a plain and unmistakeable-charge that defendant violated this section. It is couched in the words of this statute. No substantial right of the-accused is prejudiced. The indictment is in the form in-common use (Warren\u2019s Grim. Law, 630), and clearly describes the act constituting the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>Butler </em>v. <em>The State, </em>5 Blackford, 280, and <em>The State </em>v. <em>Irvin, </em>5 Blackford, 343, relied on by plaintiffs, rest upon the authority of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>The State, </em>which we have shown is under a different section of our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
