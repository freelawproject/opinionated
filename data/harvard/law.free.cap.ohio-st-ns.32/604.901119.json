A trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff'. A motion for a new trial was overruled, and judgment entered. The proceedings and-judgment of the court of common pleas were affirmed on error in the district court.

Duval, came to the house of the plaintiffs, and in the presence and hearing of the plaintiffs, and no other person, said to Hannah Davey: \u201c You God damned whoring bitch,\u201d and also other remarks concerning the plaintiffs, Joseph and Hannah Davey; to the introduction of which testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>mony the defendant, by his attornej^s, objected at the time.

Also excluded the cross-examination of the witness as to such special matter. Question seven and answer thereto are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>During the time you worked for Mrs. Davey, then Mrs. Blake, did anything take place between you and her of an intimate character?

To which question the plaintiffs, by their attorneys, objected, and the court refused to permit said question to be answered; and thereupon the defendant proposed and offered to prove bv said witness, that the plaintiff, Hannah Davey, at the time referred to, had and sustained a general had reputation for chastity and virtue; and thereupon, the plaintiffs objecting to the introduction of said testimony, the court refused to permit any testimony to be given to the jury, touching the reputation of Hannah Davey for chastity, and the court stated and directed that the only evidence of reputation that the defendant was entitled to produce and show was the general reputation of Hannah Davey as a woman, and that the inquiry could not be confined to the reputation for chastity or virtue, or any other particular; to which holding and ruling of the court the defendant at the time excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\">The defendant below having offered evidence tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>show that Hannah Davey did not sustain a good general reputation in the county in which she resided, thereupon plaintiff below introduced evidence tending to show that she was a woman of good reputation at the time referred to, and, among others, called as a witness James H.

Was it error to permit Joseph Davey to testify, under the circumstances in which the alleged, conversation, or rather declarations, took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">As alleged in the petition and disclosed by the testimony,, the defamatory words, as testified to by Davey, had in them, no element of a confidental relation as between husband, and wife. The language used by defendant was addressed to the wife in the presence of her husband. There was a known third party, John Gr. Duvall, present, which would,, uuder any circumstances, render the husband a competent witness. Uttering the defamatory words to or in the presence of the husband was a publication, and to one vitally interested in their truth, and any damaging effect suck words were likely to have upon the character of his wife.. We think the husband was a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">II. Did the court err in excluding evidence directly showing acts of sexual intercourse by Hannah Davey,, while single, with Hartman and others?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">This class of evidence was, under the pleadings, properly excluded. Its direct tendency was to prove a justification. If credited, it would have shown her guilty of a want of chastity \u2014 proved the truth of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">It has long been the settled rule, and recognized in the practice of this state, that under the general issue, to-which the general denial provided in the code is, in effect,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>'in this class of cases, practically analogous, a. justification \u2022can not be proved. Townsend on Slander, etc., \u00a7 409; Eoulkard\u2019s Starkie on Slander, etc., \u00a7 667. Where the testimony proposed to be offered can have no other effect than to make apparent the guilt of the plaintiff, and prove the truth of the words spoken, thereby necessarily tending \u25a0to justify the speaking of the words, and not merely to mitigate damages, the facts relied on, and proposed to be \u2022offered in evidence, must be specially pleaded, and can not be permitted to go in evidence under the general denial. <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>16 Ohio, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">III. Hid the court err in refusing to allow defendant to prove, in mitigation of damages, plaintiff\u2019s general reputation for chastity?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">This question is not without difficulty. The rule, as gathered from the text books, is by no means uniform, and the reported decisions of other states and countries are in \u2022conflict on this point. Our own supreme court, in <em>Dewitt </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>5 Ohio, 225, limits.the inquiry to the <em>\u201c general good or bad character of the party\u201d </em>The reason of the rule is said to be, \u201c A man is supposed to be always ready to sustain his general character, but not to meet particular reports.\u201d This rule is too contracted to meet all eases. When a party is charged with a particular vice of character, that particular element of character is put in issue by the general denial; and the party, knowing that his char.aeter is assailed in a particular respect, must be held as ready to sustain his general character in the respect in which it is attacked, as to sustain it as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">It is said in <em>Dewitt </em>v. <em>Greenfield, supra, </em>\u201c but spreading a plea of the truth of the words on the record, in justification, is always an aggravation of the damages, if not proven.\u201d This rule of damages has been changed by the cas\u00e9 of <em>Rayner </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>14 Ohio St. 287. The rule that inquiry as to reputation must be confined exclusively to general good or bad character, is not sound. Indeed, it may be questioned whether the learned judge, who wrote the opinion in that case, contemplated that the rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>as announced, should cover all cases where character is in issue. If he did, the opinion contains evidence of, and authority for, a broader rule. He says, \u201c under the general issue, the defendant, in mitigation of damages, may prove that the plaintiff, at the time of speaking the words, was under a general suspicion of having been guilty of the charge imputed to him.\u201d This we think the true rule, and renders the general doctrine of the case untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s character for chastity was in issue under the general denial. It was the object of defendant\u2019s assault. Injury to it was the <em>gravamen </em>of complaint. The action was brought for its vindication. She claims, in her petition, that prior to the speaking of the slanderous words, by defendant, \u201c she sustained a good name and character among her neighbor\u2019s and acquaintances for chastity, moral worth, and integrity,\u201d and was never suspected of \u201c unchaste conduct,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Touching this point, 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7 55, .states the modern rule to be, \u201c But it seems that the character of the party, in regard to any particular trait, is not in issue, unless it be the trait which is involved in the matter charged against him.\u201d Taylor, in his work on evidence, vol. 1, \u00a7 334, p. 365, states the rule thus: \u201c It seems, however, that here, as in other cases where witnesses to \u25a0character are admitted, evidence must be confined to the particular trait which is attacked in the alleged libel; and, as to this, it can only furnish proof of general reputation, and must, by no means, condescend to particular acts of bad conduct.\u201d Foulkard\u2019s Starkie on Slander, etc., \u00a7 714; Eoulkard\u2019s Law of Slander, etc. (4th ed.) 539; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Parke, </em>11 Irish Com. Law, 413-420; <em>Earl of Leicester </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>2 Camp. 251; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Foxall, </em>2 Cranch C. C. 324; - v. <em>Moor, </em>1 M. &amp; S. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">While we find a conflict of authority on this point, the modern cases are founded on better reason, and clearly admit the competency of general reputation in' regard to the trait of character assailed. An examination of the cases we think would clearly show, that the apparent conflict in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the decisions, arises principally from the nature of the* pleadings, or single nature of the accusation. But we-will not pursue this branch of investigation, because we-think, upon principle, a general reputation of want of good character in the very particular in which it has been assailed,, is competent evidence in mitigation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The plaintiff seeks a compensation for a loss of character,, not her reputation for truth, integrity, sobriety, or industry,, but in respect to her reputation for chastity. That alon\u00e9is claimed to have been soiled. That is put in issue. The-law presumed it good, and therefore to her valuable. If her character for chastity has sustained no damage, she is-entitled to but little or no compensation. If her general reputation for chastity was notoriously bad when the alleged slanderous words were spoken, could it be that the pecuniary injury sustained by her, from the wrongful act\u2019 of defendant, is as great as it would have been if her general reputation for chastity had been untarnished?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">That evidence of general reputation, as a woman, is admissible in mitigation of damages is not disputed. Such was the theory of the court below, but it went further, and\u2019 ruled that evidence of the general reputation for chastity was not admissible. It seems to us the reason is much stronger for allowing evidence affecting her general character in respect to the trait that has been assailed. Reputation is complex \u2014 made up of many things. A woman may possess many virtues, consequently a fair, or even good general reputation as a woman, and yet be notorious-for some one vice. If the defamer assails all her virtues she sustains an injury, if only her other vice is assailed theinjiiry is less.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Plaintiff asserts in her complaint that her standing in society, as a virtuous woman, has been assaulted and damaged,, and that her character for chastity was, prior thereto, irreproachable. It is the element of chastity in her character which she claims has been damaged. Its value then becomes the proper subject of inquiry \u2014 not her truthfulness,, h\u00e9r integrity, her sobriety, her industry \u2014 but her chastity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>alone. If that is worthless in the general market of public estimation, it would seem strange indeed, if defendant might not show, in mitigation of damages, that it was generally reputed of little value.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The court erred in refusing to allow defendant to prove plaintiff\u2019s general reputation for chastity was. bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">IY. We think the court ruled correctly in refusing to allow a cross-examination of witness Carnes on the subject proposed by defendant. The witness was examined by plaintiff as to her general reputation alone. If the character of plaintiff\u2019s associates could be used in any aspect of the case, it was evidence in chief, and not admissible on cross-examination. Facts not admissible in chief, as a defense, were sought to be introduced indirectly, under the guise of impeaching the witness. We know of no rule of evidence that would authorize the proposed cross-examination of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Reversed and remanded to the court of common pleas for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b621-8\">Wright, J., dissented from the second proposition of the syllabus.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
