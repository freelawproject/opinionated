However, the Industrial Commission found that in three prior claims filed by the relator, it had allowed him compensation for permanent partial disability which totaled 84%, and therefore awarded him compensation equal to a 16% permanent partial disability, or 32 weeks at a rate of $49 per week totaling $1,568.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The relator contends that there was no limiting provision in the Code section prior to October 1, 1963. Since the amount of compensation payable to an injured employee was involved, a substantive right of the relator was affected, and the amendment can apply only to claims in which the injury was received after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The Industrial Commission contends that the statute merely sets forth the procedure for the recovery of compensation and the extent to which relator may participate in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Fund on account of his injury; that the section as amended October 1, 1963, provides only a limitation on the extent of the recovery, affecting only remedial or procedural rights, and applies to all claims whether filed before or after that date. They rely on an Attorney G-eneral Opinion No. 108, dated October 17, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">We believe that the maximum amount of compensation to which a claimant is entitled is a substantive right and is governed by the statutory law in effect on the date of injury. See <em>Industrial Commission </em>v. <em>Kamrath, </em>118 Ohio St. 1; <em>State, ex rel. Schmersal, </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>142 Ohio St. 477; and <em>State, ex rel. Jeffrey, </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>164 Ohio St. 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Even assuming that the limitations on the amount of compensation were procedural, it would appear that Section 1.20, Revised Code, would govern this case and that the amendment should apply prospectively only. Section 4123.571 was enacted on November 2, 1959, to control only amendments to Section 4123.57 effective the same date. The section specifically states \u201cas amended by this act,\u201d and refers to claims filed prior to the effective date of \u201cthis act.\u201d The wording of the section limits its application to that particular act of the Legislature. It was not amended on October 1, 1963, nor does the amended Section 4123.57, effective October 1, 1963, expressly provide that it shall apply to pending actions before the Industrial Commission. See <em>Woodward, Admr., </em>v. <em>Eberly, </em>167 Ohio St. 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The motion for summary judgment filed by the relator will be granted, and judgment entered ordering the Industrial Commission to pay the compensation for permanent partial disability under the law in effect at the time the relator received the injury for which his claim was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-8\">Bryant, P.
