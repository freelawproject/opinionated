Under the very apparent contingency of one or the other of the grandchildren dying without issue, the other grandchild would take both shares, sending a portion of the combined entitlement out of the one percent and into the three percent bracket established by Section 5731.12, Revised Code. This is not seriously contested by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The principal dispute, however, is over the finding of the Probate Court that Item III F creates a contingency that would give rise to a succession by a person in Class (D) of Section 5731.12 \u2014 a nonrelative. This is based on the possibility that under the attempted or involuntary alienation provision the rights of the named grandchild to payments would terminate and such payments could, under the instrument, be payable to his or her spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>We can easily understand that in a discretionary trust with specific remainderman over this should be the case. See <em>In re Estate of </em>Coyle, 97 Ohio App. 458, decided by this court. However, the instant trust is neither a spendthrift nor a discretionary one, but a protective trust. See 1A Bogert on Trusts and Trustees 461, Section 221. Unquestionably, the contingency that rights in the named beneficiary may be cut off is provided for in the will. See <em>In re Estate of Phellis, </em>113 Ohio App. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">But it is not sufficient merely to demonstrate that the right of the named beneficiary is defeated or abridged; it is also necessary to demonstrate that a succession is created in the spouse, in order to conclude that the rate for the spouse should be applied in a temporary order under Section 5731.28, Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Succession is defined by Section 5731.01 (B) as \u201cthe passing of property in possession and enjoyment, present or future.\u201d The Tax Commissioner contends that \u201cthe passing of property\u201d occurs each time the trustee of a protective trust writes a check to or for the benefit of a beneficiary, and that, since theoretically all the money in the trust could thus be siphoned off in a series of checks to the spouse, all the \u201cproperty\u201d could thus pass. This distorts the meaning of the word \u201cproperty.\u201d Property is not the check written by the trustee; property, in this case, is the beneficial legal relationship to the source of the payment, a right in the fund itself, which includes the right to demand and receive payment. See 1 Thompson On Real Property 2, Section 1; <em>Pennsylvania Rd. Co. </em>v. <em>Kearns, Recorder, </em>71 Ohio App. 209, 218-219.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In this case, the spouse of a grandchild has no rights whatsoever in the fund or to the income from it; what may come her (or his) way from the trustee comes not as a matter of right but as a matter of grace. It comes, not because she (he) is entitled to it but because her (his) grandchild spouse may have failed in the obligation of providing for her (his) family. It comes not to her (him) as a person, but is paid out to her (him) as being expended for her (his) grandchild spouse\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The Tax Commissioner\u2019s argument overlooks entirely all except the first clause of Section 5731.28, Revised Code, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u201cWhen, upon any succession, the rights, interests, or estates of the successors are dependent upon contingencies or conditions * # V\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">His eyes are so firmly fixed on the word, \u201ccontingencies,\u201d that he assumes that any contingency which would defeat or abridge rights in one <em>cestui que trust </em>necessarily must create or extend corresponding rights in another. In the case of a protective trust, as here, this algebraic simplicity does not hold true. No right, interest or estate corresponding to that lost by the named beneficiary is created in the spouse. This being so, there is no succession by the spouse upon the occurrence of the contingencies, and there is no justification for using the spouse as the measure of the tax rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The order of the Probate Court is reversed, and the cause remanded for determination of the tax under the temporary-order at such rate as would be proper should one grandchild die without issue allowing the other to take the entire trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-7\">Jones and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b347-9\">Brown, J., of the Fourth Appellate District, sitting by designation in the Seventh Appellate District.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
