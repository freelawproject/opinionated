At this time, after the usual thorough examination of the facts, medical and otherwise, he was awarded a pension of fifty per cent of his then salary. He received this pension for over five years. On November 30, 1961, the respondents reduced relator\u2019s pension to five dollars per month for the reason that it appeared that he earned some $10,000 in 1960 as an automobile sales manager, and $9,000 in 1961 as a credit investigator for a furniture company. Respondents\u2019 right to do this, they claim, arises by virtue of the statutes of Ohio, Section 741.49 (C), Revised Code, in such cases provided. The particular language upon which the trustees (respondents) rely is as follows: \u201cThe board my increase or decrease such monthly benefits whenever the impairment in the member\u2019s <em>earning capacity </em>warrants an increase or decrease.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The difficulty in the case is presented by the definition which is to be placed on the words \u2018 \u2018 earning capacity. \u2019 \u2019 It must be kept in mind that the pension granted relator in the first place was based on his <em>earning capacity as a policeman. </em>If that is the interpretation which was used in determining the original amount of pension, with what logic can we apply another definition for the purpose of reducing or increasing the pension by saying that his earning capacity, not as a policeman, but as an automobile salesman has increased over his earning capacity as a policeman?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We think, under the statutes, that the trustees\u2019 rights to increase or decrease the pension of a policeman, after once making an award, are limited to a determination of whether his <em>earning capacity as a policeman </em>has increased or decreased and that they may not consider what his income might be from any other sources. In other words, so long as the physical disability which occasioned the granting of his pension remains constant, his pension remains the same. Section 741.46 of the Revised Code provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">\u201cThe granting of a pension to any person pursant to the rules adopted by the board of trustees of the police relief and pension fund vests a right in such person, so long as he remains the beneficiary of such fund, to receive such pension at the rate fixed at the time of granting the pension.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">That statute states specifically that \u2018 \u2018 so long as he remains the beneficiary of such fund,\u201d the pensioner is \u201cto receive such pension at the rate fixed at the time of granting the pension.\u201d In the opinion of this court, so long as the pensioner\u2019s loss of earning capacity remains as a result of the debility which occasioned the granting of the original pension, \u201che remains the beneficiary of such fund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">In a similar suit, <em>State, ex rel. Wunderly, </em>v. <em>Sine, </em>77 Ohio App. 275, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">\u201cA pension which has been properly granted by the trustees of a police relief and pension fund since May 26,1937, is a vested right, and the trustees cannot, after the granting of such a pension, adopt a rule which will deprive the recipient of his right to continue to receive the installments thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-12\">Hover, P. J., and Hildebrant, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
