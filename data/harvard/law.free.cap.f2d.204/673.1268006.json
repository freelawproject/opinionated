The Tax Court held it to be capital gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-23\">The facts are not in dispute. The taxpayer conducted a retail store in New London. In 1903 it made a contract with United Drug Company, a manufacturer of drugs, whereby it was appointed United\u2019s \u201cspecial selling agent\u201d in New London. United agreed not to sell its products to any other dealer in that city and the taxpayer agreed to sell the products at retail only and at not less than prices set by United. The agency contract did not require the agent to render personal services; nor did it create an employer-employee relationship. In 1943 United paid the taxpayer $6,394.57 for agreeing to the termination of the 1903 contract and entering into a new and nonexclusive agency contract, United expressly reserving \u201cthe right to grant one or more franchises for the sale of its merchandise in the City of New London, Connecticut, to whomever it may choose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-24\">Subdivision (a)(1) of section 117 defines capital assets. Subdivision (a) (4) defines \u201clong-term capital gain\u201d as gain from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u201csale or exchange\u201d of a capital asset. Subdivision (a) (10) (A) defines \u201cnet capital gain\u201d, in the case of a corporation as \u201cthe excess of the gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets over the losses from such sales or exchanges\u201d. Undoubtedly the taxpayer\u2019s rights under the 1903 contract were property; and we will assume arguendo, as does the Commissioner, that they were a capital asset. The decisive issue is whether there was a \u201csale or exchange\u201d of such capital asset when the contract was terminated in 1943. To refer to the contract as a grant of a \u201cfranchise\u201d tends, we think, to becloud analysis of the legal relations. What the taxpayer gave in return for the cash payment was a release of United\u2019s contract obligations, chief of which was its promise not to sell its products to other dealers in New London. Such release not only ended the promisor\u2019s previously existing duty but also destroyed the promisee\u2019s rights. They were not transferred to the promisor; they merely came to an end and vanished. A closely analogous situation exists when the holder of a note surrenders it to the maker on receiving payment. In Bingham v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 971, 972, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">\u201cWhat may have been property in the hands of the' holder of the notes simply vanished when the surrender took place and the maker received them. He then had, at most, only his own obligations to pay himself. Any theoretical concept of a sale of the notes to the maker in return for what he gave up to get them back must yield before the hard fact that he received nothing which was property in his hands but had merely succeeded in extinguishing his liabilities by the amounts which were due on the notes. There was, therefore, no sale of the notes to him in the ordinary meaning of the word and no exchange of assets for assets since the notes could not, as assets, survive the transaction. That being so, such a settlement as the one this petitioner made involved neither a sale nor an exchange of capital assets within the meaning of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Another analogy may be found in Beals\u2019 Estate v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 82 F.2d 268 which held that payment received for a covenant not to engage in competitive business was ordinary income, not gain realized on disposal of a capital asset.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here the converse situation is presented, \u2014 payment for the release of such a covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">In holding that the taxpayer made a sale of its 1903 contract the Tax Court relied particularly upon Jones v. Corbyn, 10 Cir., 186 F.2d 450, where cancellation of an exclusive general insurance agency contract was held to be a \u201csale\u201d of a capital asset. With due deference to the majority opinion, we respectfully agree with Judge Phillips\u2019 dissent. The Third Circuit has also given a very broad construction to \u201csale or exchange\u201d. See Commissioner v. Golonsky, 3 Cir., 200 F.2d 72, involving surrender of a lease to the lessor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our own decision in McAllister v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 157 F. 2d 235, certiorari denied 330 U.S. 826, 67 S.Ct. 864, 91 L.Ed. 1276, where transfer by a life tenant to the remainderman for a sum of money was held to constitute a sale, is also cited as inconsistent with the conclusion that termination of the 1903 contract was not a sale. That case was decided upon the theory that it was within the rule of Blair v. Commissioner, 300 U.S. 5, 57 S.Ct. 330, 81 L.Ed. 465 rather than that of Hort v. Commissioner, 313 U.S. 28, 61 S.Ct. 757, 85 L.Ed. 1168. Whether that distinction is valid we need not' now consider. In any event, to hold the life tenant\u2019s transfer of possession of income-producing property a \u201csale\u201d puts less strain upon the ordinary meaning of that term than does a holding that the taxpayer\u2019s release of United\u2019s negative covenant is a sale. When Congress has wished to tax as capital gains receipts which would not fall within the ordinary meaning of \u201csale or exchange\u201d of assets, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>has dealt specifically with such transactions, as in subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 117. See Helvering v. William Flaccus Leather Co., 313 U.S. 247, 251, 61 S.Ct. 878, 881, 85 L.Ed. 1310. We regard as significant the absence of any statutory provision treating the termination or modification of a selling agency contract as a sale or exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The decision is reversed and the cause remanded for recomputation of the tax.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-5\">. To the same effect are Salvage v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 70 F.2d 112, affirmed Helvering v. Salvage, 297 U.S. 106, 56 S.Ct. 375, 80 L.Ed. 511; Cox v. Helvering, 63 App.D.C. 264, 71 F.2d 987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-10\">. The Commissioner\u2019s brief states that a petition for certiorari mil probably be filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
