Thereupon, on November 28, 1949, the District Court entered (1) a judgment sentencing appellant to be imprisoned for three years on the first indictment, (2) a judgment sentencing him to be imprisoned for three years on the second indictment, to run consecutively with the sentence on the first indictment, and (3) a judgment sentencing him to be imprisoned for three years on the third indictment, to run consecutively with the sentence on the second indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">On June 9, 1952, while in custody under the sentences mentioned above, appellant caused to be filed in the District Court (1) a petition entitled \u201cPetition for writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum\u201d and (2) a petition entitled \u201cPetition for motion to quash, annul and make void sentences as made and provided for under Title 28, section 2255 U.S.C.A.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The first petition stated that appellant was in custody of the warden of the United States penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. It prayed the District Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum requiring the warden to produce appellant before the District Court at the time of hearing the second petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It did not pray for any other relief. The second petition prayed the District Court to release appellant from further imprisonment and punishment. It did not pray for any other relief. The stated ground of the second petition was, in substance, that the sentences ran concurrently and had expired. Actually, as the judgments clearly showed, the sentences ran consecutively and, had not expired. Accordingly, on July 14, 1952, the District Court entered an order denying the petitions without a hearing. This appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The petitions and the files and records of the three cases wherein appellant was sentenced conclusively showed that he was entitled to no relief. There was, therefore,no error in denying the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">. The petitions are in the record on appeal filed hero on September 19, 1952. The printed \u201ctranscript of record\u201d contains a true copy of the second petition (including the title thereof) and a true copy of the body of the first petition but does not contain a true copy of the title of the first petition. As indicated above, the first petition was entitled \u201cPetition for writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Amy\">. In the first petition, the second petition was called a motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
