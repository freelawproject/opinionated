H. Lindsay Company, a corporation, brought this suit against O. H. Greager to specifically enforce a contract for the sale and purchase of wool and for damages. The complaint alleges than on October 29, 1950, the defendant agreed to sell, and the plaintiff agreed to buy, the defendant\u2019s 1951 wool clip, not to exceed 38,000 pounds, at 80$ per pound; that the purchase and sale agreement was reduced to writing and signed by the defendant;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ant notified the plaintiff that he would re-' fuse to deliver the wool in accordance with the' agreement. The material part of the' answer denied the existence of the contract. It was also alleged that contract was ' void under the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">To eliminate the necessity of proving the value of the wool for the purposes of the action the parties stipulated that value to be $1 per pound. It was further stipulated that the defendant would deliver his wool to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff would pay the defendant 800 per pound therefor; that in the event the court should find that there was no effective contract of purchase, the plaintiff would pay the defendant an additional 200 per pound for the wool; and that in the event the purchase contract was upheld, the plaintiff would not be fur-, ther obligated to the defendant. Pursuant to the stipulation, the wool was delivered to the plaintiff and the defendant was paid 800 per pound therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Upon trial, the court concluded that the plaintiff did not sustain its burden of proof \u201cthat a mutually joint oral contract of purchase and sale of defendant\u2019s wool was made, or intended to be made,\u201d and that the plaintiff\u2019s right to relief rested upon the wool purchase contract. The court refused to enforce the written contract because it lacked mutuality, and entered judgment for the defendant in accordance with the stipulation. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The action was clearly one for the enforcement of an oral sale and presents two questions. 1. Was there an oral agreement between the parties for the purchase and sale of defendant\u2019s wool? 2. Was there a sufficient memorandum signed' 'by the party to be charged to satisfy the Colorado Statute of Frauds? We answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The evidence is not in substantial conflict. The defendant was a wool grower and G. A. Hanson was a wool purchasing agent for the plaintiff. The agent testified that he and another wool buyer met the defendant in a cafe in Norwood, Colorado and talked to him about purchasing his 1951 wool clip. The defendant then invited them to his home where the discussion continued. The plaintiff\u2019s agent told the defendant that he was paying 750 to 800 for wool, and the defendant asked the agent if he would pay that much for his wool. After some dickering as to the price, the agent told the defendant that he would pay him 800 for his wool, and the defendant replied that that was a good price, and that he would talk with his wife. The defendant left the room, returned and said, \u201cI will sell my wool for that price if you will pay it,\u201d and the agent replied, \u201cAll right, I will pay it.\u201d Whereupon the defendant said, \u201cProceed to make your contract out.\u201d The agent asked the defendant if he desired an advance payment, but the defendant replied that he did not need the money because he did not want to pay interest on it. The agent further testified that he told the defendant he would pay him 800 per pound for the wool and pay for it when it was delivered at Mont-rose, Colorado. The written memorandum was then made out, signed by defendant and a copy delivered to him. This testimony was corroborated by the other wool buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">The defendant testified that he met plaintiff\u2019s agent and buyer at a cafe in Norwood; that they went from the cafe to plaintiff\u2019s home where, after some negotiations, the agent, who was also a wool grower, said that he had sold his wool for 800 and asked, \u201cWould you take 800 for your wool?\u201d; that after some hesitation he told the agent, \u201cYou just write up that contract\u201d; and that he then v^ent to the kitchen and told his wife that he had contracted his wool for 800. Defendant further testified that he refused an advance on his wool at that time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 28, 1951, defendant\u2019s at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>torney wrote to the plaintiff stating that: \u201c\u201cAfter careful consideration of said contract it is my opinion that Mr. Greager is not bound thereunder because, among other things, the contract lacks mutuality under Colorado law, and is therefore not binding upon either party. Accordingly, I have advised Mr. Greager that he is privileged to withdraw and he has elected to do so. His notice of withdrawal is enclosed herewith.\u201d The notice of withdrawal signed by the defendant stated that \u201cInasmuch as you have not accepted, ratified or executed the wool purchase contract, dated October 29, 1950 * * * you are hereby notified that I withdraw from said contract.\u201d The defendant did not deny that Hanson had offered him 80$) for his wool, or that he had agreed to sell for that price. He sought to repudiate the sale because the plaintiff had not signed the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The Uniform Sales Act effective in Colorado, states \u201cA contract to sell goods is a contract whereby the seller agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a consideration called the price.\u201d \u201935 C.SA. Ch. 143A, Sec. 1; 46 Am.Jur., Sales, Sec. 2. We think, considering all the facts and circumstances in the case, there was a definite offer by plaintiff to purchase the wool at a price of 80{5 per pound and an unqualified acceptance of that price by the seller. The oral agreement of purchase and sale was complete, certain and definite and so considered by the defendant until several months later. The finding of the trial court to the contrary is clearly erroneous. It is true that the parties intended that the terms of the agreement should be incorporated in the so-called \u201cWool Purchase Contract\u201d but this was not a condition to the validity of the offer and acceptance. The document was only a memorial of the completed oral agreement and did not affect its validity. 1 Restatement, Contracts, Sec. 26; Rosenfield v. U. S. Trust Co., 290 Mass. 210, 195 N.E. 323, 122 A.L.R. 1210, Annotation 1217; Nigro v. Conti, 319 Mass. 480, 66 N.E.2d 353, 165 A.L.R. 752, Annotation 756. It is quite obvious that the memorandum executed by the defendant was for the purpose of satisfying the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">This leaves the question of the sufficiency of the memorandum signed by the party to be charged, to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. \u201935 C.S.A. Ch. 143A, Sec. 4(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asr\">\u201cA contract to sell or a sale of any goods or choses in action of the value of five hundred dollars or upwards shall not be enforceable by action unless the buyer shall accept part of the goods or choses in action so contracted to be sold or sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the contract, or in part payment, or unless some note or memorandum in writing of the contract or sale be signed by the party to be charged or his agent in that behalf.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Generally speaking, a memorandum is sufficient if it sets forth with reasonable certainty the names of the parties to' the contract, a description of the goods to which the contract relates and the essential terms and conditions constituting the oral contract, including the consideration. 1 Restatement, Contracts, Sec. 207; North American Seed Co. v. Cedarburg Supply Co., 247 Wis. 31, 18 N.W.2d 466, 159 A.L.R. 250; Block v. Sherman, 109 Ind.App. 330, 34 N.E.2d 951; Micheli v. Taylor, 114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Colo. 258, 159 P.2d 912; Eppich v. Clifford, 6 Colo. 493. All the essential provisions of the purchase and sale agreement are found in the memorandum. The defendant contends that the written memorandum is insufficient because it does not contain any requirement that the plaintiff purchase the wool. It provides that the plaintiff will pay by draft, the amount due on the purchase price when the wool is delivered. This is clearly understandable to a sheep man and imports an obligation to purchase.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with instruction to enter judgment for the plaintiff pursuant to the stipulation of the parties. , .</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-16\">.

Will you tell the Court all of the circumstances leading up to your signing that instrument? \u2014 A.

In the Micheli case it is said [114 Colo. 258, 159 P.2d 913]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u201cAs we declared in Eppich v.

Here, the words \u2018received * * * one Dollar and other valuable consideration for my entire interest\u2019 import obligation to sell, and the words, \u2018purchase price balance of $7000 to be paid,\u2019 import obligation to purchase.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b184-5\">BRATTON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"acv-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Plaintiff never became committed to purchase the wool unless the commitment was made in the course of the verbal discussion which preceded the filling out of the so-called wool purchase contract and the signing of it by the defendant. And unless plaintiff did make such commitment there was a complete lack of mutuality of contract. Therefore, the crucial question in the case was whether in the course of the verbal discussion a firm commitment was made on the part of plaintiff to purchase the wool. Three witnesses testified in respect to that question. They were G. A. Hanson, vice president and a director of plaintiff, William A. Kelley, a representative of plaintiff in the purchase of wool in Colorado, and the defendant. Hanson and Kelly each testified to statements by Hanson in the verbal discussion which if made constituted a firm commitment of purchase. But the defendant testified in minute detail concerning the discussion and his testimony disclosed that no statement was made which constituted a firm commitment of purchase. He further testified that he signed the so-called wool purchase contract; that he thought Hanson signed it for plaintiff as purchaser; that he learned later that Hanson had merely signed it as a witness to the signature of defendant; that he did not \u201canticipate\u201d making an oral contract; and that he thought it was a written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">The learned trial court of long experience found that in the discussion \u201cno firm commitment was made on behalf of plaintiff to purchase defendant\u2019s 1951 wool clip.\u201d It is my view that this critical and dispositive finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence; and that it is not clearly erroneous, due regard being had for the opportunity of the court to observe the witnesses while testifying, to appraise their credibility, and to weigh their testimony. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
