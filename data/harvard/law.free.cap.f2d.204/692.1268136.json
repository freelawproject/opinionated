The sole question in the case is whether the district court erred in holding that the defendant is not a common carrier by railroad within the meaning of that Act and entering summary judgment accordingly. We find ourselves in complete agreement with the views expressed in the able and comprehensive opinion filed by Judge Clary in the district court, 110 F.Supp. 4, to which we need add nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-29\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
