His principle contentions are (1) that the officers who arrested him without a warrant had no probable cause to believe he had committed a felony, and therefore the evidence taken from him was illegally seized and should have been suppressed; and (2) the evidence presented at the trial was insufficient to convict. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
