The trial judge thought it his duty, among other things, to read the examination questions and appellant\u2019s answers to them and to review the grading of these answers to the extent of determining that \u201cby reasonable tests, the officials of the Patent Office acted fairly and without discrimination in the grading of the plaintiff\u2019s examination, pursuant to a uniform standard, that the plaintiff failed to pass the required examination,\u201d etc. Cupples v. Marzall, D.C., 101 F.Supp. 579, 583. We need not decide whether in our opinion this kind of review of the examination was necessary. In all other respects we agree with the'opinion of the District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b110-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
