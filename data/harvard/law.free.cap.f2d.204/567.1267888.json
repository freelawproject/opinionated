The Board\u2019s answer to the petition requests enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The petitioner\u2019s brief states that the following issues are raised: (1) whether petitioner violated section 8(a) (3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (3), by discharging Joseph Petti; (2) whether petitioner violated section 8(a) (1), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1); (3) whether the Board\u2019s proceeding was brought in good faith; and (4) whether so much of the order as directs the petitioner to cease and desist from \u201cin any other manner\u201d violating the Act is too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">The first question is whether Joseph Petti, at the time of his discharge was a \u201csupervisor\u201d as defined in the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 2(3), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(3), excludes from the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d any individual employed as a \u201csupervisor.\u201d The question is essentially one of fact, the answer to which must turn on what powers Petti was authorized to exercise. He was employed in the steel rule die department of the employer\u2019s plant from March 1947 until his discharge on August 22, 1951. He testified that at least 80% of his time was spent in actually operating machines. The petitioner contends that in addition to operating machines Petti had the supervisory duty to \u201cassign\u201d the work to be done by the other employees in the department. Mr. Bishop, the production manager, testified that he would give Petti a \u201cproduction list\u201d and \u201corders\u201d from one to three times a week. The list would contain \u201cthe customers\u2019 names, the parts that were to be run, and what date was on the schedule that we had to meet to satisfy the customer.\u201d Petti himself testified \u201cEverything that I did or the employees was [sic] supposed to do, I did by Mr. Bishop\u2019s information to me.\u201d The Trial Examiner on the entire record found \u201cthat though Petti may have assigned work to other employees, whatever authority he exercised was of a routine nature pursuant to Bishop\u2019s direction and that he was not a supervisor within the meaning of the Act.\u201d We agree with this conclusion. Petti did no more than to keep all hands busy on the work given him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>by Mr. Bishop. When an employee finished a job, she would ask Petti what to do next.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will assume that he was the room \u201cboss\u201d or \u201cleadman,\u201d but the discretion given him appears to be \u201croutine\u201d in the natural sense of that word. As Judge Magruder said in National Labor Relations Board v. Quincy Steel Cast Co., 1 Cir., 200 F.2d 293, 296: \u201cThe legislative history of \u00a7 2(11) tends to support the Board\u2019s view that certain employees with minor supervisory duties, such as straw bosses and lead-men, were not intended to be excluded from the coverage of the Act.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The petitioner argues that Petti also had authority to recommend the discharge of employees and exercised it in two instances. Petti denied making such recommendations and the Trial Examiner gave credence to his denials. When a finding of fact turns upon the Examiner\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of witnesses who appeared before him, this court cannot say that the finding is unsupported by the record, merely because the Examiner has believed one witness rather than another. National Labor R. Board v. Dinion Coal Co., 2 Cir., 201 F.2d 484, 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">It is next contended that even if Petti was not a supervisor, the Examiner\u2019s finding that he was discharged for labor union activity is not supportable. The principle to which we have just referred with respect to the credibility of witnesses is also applicable here. It will suffice to say that on the whole record there was ample evidence to support the finding that Petti\u2019s discharge violated \u00a7 8(a) (3).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ao--dedup-0\">\u201cIn any other manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing its employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization, to form labor organizations, to join or assist International Brotherhood of Paper Makers of America, A. F. of B., or any other labor organization, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and to refrain from any or all of such activities, except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in Section 8(a) (3) of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Nor is it necessary to detail the evidence upon which was based the Board\u2019s finding that \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act was violated. There was testimony which the Examiner credited that the petitioner\u2019s president interrogated some of the employees about the union and threatened to \u201cclose the place\u201d if the union should get in. Such conduct is not within the privilege conferred by \u00a7 8(c), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">The contention that the Board\u2019s complaint should be dismissed because it was not brought in good faith is so lacking in merit as to require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\"> Finally it is urged, in reliance upon National Labor Relations Board v. Express Publishing Co., 312 U.S. 426, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930 and May Department Stores Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 326 U.S. 376, 66 S.Ct. 203, 90 L.Ed. 145, that paragraph (c) of the cease and desist order is too broad because it goes beyond those acts of violation specifically found to have occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board adopted verbatim the Examiner\u2019s recommendation. If the petitioner did not raise before the Board objection to this paragraph, he apparently cannot raise it before the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But assuming we may consider it, we think the petitioner\u2019s past conduct was such as to warrant a broad prohibition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">The petition is dismissed, and the Board\u2019s request for an enforcement order is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-14\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(11):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8v\">\u201cThe' term \u2018supervisor\u2019 means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust * * * grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, hut requires the use of independent judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">.
