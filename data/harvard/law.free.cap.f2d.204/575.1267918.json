As the facts and rulings of the Tax Court are adequately stated in its findings and opinion reported in 17 T.C. 485, they will not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-27\">1. <em>Gain from purchase by taxpayer of its own bonds in 1941.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-28\">(1) The taxpayer argues that the amendment of \u00a7 22(b) (9) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in \u00a7 114(a) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the Revenue Act of 1942, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 22 (1,) (9) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 climinating- (A) and (B) from \u00a7 22(b) (9) \u2014 was retroactive. We do not agree. The amendatory statute contains three subsections, (a), (b) and (c). Subsection (c) reads thus: \u201c(c) <em>Taxable years to which Amendment Applicable. </em>\u2014 The amendment made by subsection (b) shall be applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1939.\u201d With such an explicit provision concerning subsection (b) exclusively, we think it cannot reasonably be said that Congress intended subsection (a) to have a retroactive effect, especially as generally repeals by implication must be cold-shouldered.</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\"><em>(2) </em>Unamended \u00a7 22(b) (9) (B), with reference to certification \u201cby any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Federal agency authorized to exercise regulatory power over such corporation, that at the time of such discharge [of indebtedness] the taxpayer was in an unsound financial condition,\u201d plainly does not include a certification by a federal \u201cconstitutional\u201d court having statutory jurisdiction of the taxpayer\u2019s reorganization proceeding. Consequently, the certification by the reorganization judge had as little significance as the number of home runs in 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">(3) Section 22(b) (9) (A) provides that a discharge of indebtedness shall not be included in gross income if \u201cit is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner\u201d that the taxpayer was in an unsound financial condition at the time of the discharged indebtedness. Obviously, here the Commissioner evidenced no such \u201csatisfaction,\u201d for he determined a deficiency in respect of this deduction. We think this determination was conclusive of a lack of the required \u201csatisfaction\u201d because there was no showing of bad faith, or of gross error indicative of irrationality or caprice, on the Commissioner\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">2. <em>Expenses in connection with taxpayer's reorganization. </em>These items were not deductible as \u201cordinary\u201d business expenses under \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A), 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A). See Skenandoa Rayon Corp. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 122 F.2d 268, 271; Motion Picture Capital Corp. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 80 F.2d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">3. <em>\"Interest\" on sinking-fund instalments. </em>The taxpayer\u2019s supplemental mortgage (executed pursuant to its reorganization plan) provided that the taxpayer, if and when it paid to the indenture trustee deferred sinking-fund instalments, would pay them \u201ctogether with interests thereon at the rate of five (5) percent per annum.\u201d Although labelled \u201cinterest,\u201d the amounts so paid to the trustee were the taxpayer\u2019s capital assets \u2014 later to be applied in certain circumstances in reduction of its debts \u2014 and therefore when paid to the trustee did not constitute deductible \u201cinterest paid\u201d on indebtedness within \u00a7 23(b), since none of the funds so paid to the trustee were in turn paid out as interest on taxpayer\u2019s indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">4. <em>\"Net operating loss carryover.\u201d </em>Taxpayer asserts that it was entitled to have its \u201cnet operating loss carryover\u201d, pursuant to \u00a7 122(b) (2), 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 122(b) (2), increased by including three items. Two of them we have already discussed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The third has to do with expense incurred in litigation involving taxpayer\u2019s right as a tenant to the use and occupancy of a powerhouse.\" Consequently, we think the expense was a cost incurred in \u201cdefending * * * title to property.\u201d Such a cost, under the applicable Regulation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cconstitutes a part of the cost of the property and is not a deductible expense.\u201d This regulation is valid <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and applies to defense of a leasehold interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because of the disposition of this contention, we need not consider the question whether the Tax Court correctly ruled as to this item on the basis of <em>res judicata </em>on account of the Tax Court\u2019s previous decision in Bush Terminal Buildings Company v. Commissioner, 7 T. C. 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">.

In such case the amount of any income of the taxpayer attributable to any unamortized premium (computed as of the first day of the taxable year in which such discharge occurred) with respect to such indebtedness shall not be included in gross income and the amount of the deduction attributable to any unamortized discount (computed as of the first day of the taxable year in which such discharge occurred) with respect to such indebtedness shall not be allowed as a deduction.
