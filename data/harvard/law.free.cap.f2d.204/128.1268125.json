The facts are fully and correctly set forth in the decision of the Board and the report of the trial examiner, and what was there said need not be repeated. The findings and order of the board are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole and the order will accordingly be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-18\">Order enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
