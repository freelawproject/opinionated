During the tax year 1948 the corporation maintained in the District of Columbia a nine-room office in charge of one of the corporation\u2019s officers. He and his staff kept \u201cin contact with all kinds of developments either in the legislative or executive departments of the Federal Government which might affect [the] business in any way at all.\u201d He testified, for example, that \u201cWe keep the Administrative Division in Toledo informed on the introduction of all bills into Congress and report on the progress of those bills, which in our judgment would have some effect on the operation of our activities. * * * We report on the regulations of the Treasury Department as they affect taxes and affect our business.\u201d They also \u201cregularly\u201d received inquiries about sales of the corporation\u2019s products in the District, which they referred to the corporation\u2019s Baltimore office. Salesmen from its Baltimore and Philadelphia offices solicited sales in the District. The Baltimore salesmen sometimes visited the District office but their visits were usually social, though they sometimes used office telephones for business purposes. The corporation sold and shipped to customers in the District goods to the value of $794,867.12 during the tax year 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">(1) The District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1947' imposes a 5% tax on the net income from District sources of foreign and domestic corporations \u201cFor the privilege of carrying on or engaging in any trade or business within the District and of receiving income from sources within the District * * *.\u201d D.C.Code (1951), \u00a7 47-157la, 61 Stat. 345. It defines \u201ctrade or business\u201d to \u201cinclude the engaging in or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or calling or commercial activity in the District of Columbia; * * * <em>Provided, however, </em>That the words \u2018trade or business\u2019 shall not include * * * (1) Sales of tangible personal property * * * by a corporation * * * which does not physically have or maintain an office, warehouse, or other place of business in the District, and which has no officer, agent, or representative having an office or other place of business in the District * * * ; or (2) * * * by a corporation * * which does not maintain an office or other place of business in the District and which has no office, agent, or representative in the District except for the sole purpose of doing business with the United States * * D.C.Code (1951), \u00a7 47-1551c(h), 61 Stat. 332, 62 Stat. 206, 207. \u201cThe measure of the franchise tax shall be that portion of the net income of the corporation * * * fairly attributable to any trade or business carried on or engaged in within the District and such other net income as is derived from sources within the District; <em>Provided further, </em>That income derived from the sale of tangible personal property by a corporation * * * not carrying on or engaging in trade or business within the District as defined * * * shall not be considered as income from sources within the District * * D.C.Code (1951), \u00a7 47-1580, 61 Stat. 349, 62 Stat. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">In our opinion extensive solicitation by salesmen, in the District, which results in a large volume of sales and shipments to customers in the District, is plainly \u201ccommercial activity in the District\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The corporation was therefore, unless saved by the provisos, \u201cengaging in * * * trade or business within the District\u201d as the Act defines that term. By defining \u201ctrade or business\u201d to include \u201cengaging in * * * any * * * commercial activity\u201d as well as engaging in \u201ctrade\u201d or \u201cbusiness\u201d, Congress plainly intended to go beyond the ordinary concept of \u201cdoing business\u201d. There could be no other reason for adding the phrase \u201cany * * * commercial activity\u201d. The many cases that deal with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>concept of \u201cdoing business\u201d, usually in connection with service of process, e. g. Mueller Brass Co. v. Alexander Milburn Co., 80 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 152 F.2d 142, are therefore not in point.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the corporation had an office in the District, and also because it had an officer there, not \u201cfor the sole purpose of doing business with the United States\u201d, the first statutory proviso quoted above <em>{\"Provided, however </em>* * <em>\u201d) </em>does not apply. Because the corporation was engaging in business in the District, the second proviso <em>{\u2018\u2018Provided further </em>* * *\u201d) does not apply. It follows that in our opinion the Board erred in holding that the corporation was not taxable under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">(2) On the afternoon of July 19, 1950 the corporation delivered to an examiner in the office of the Assessor of Taxes checks for the amount for which it had been assessed, less $1,000 previously paid, with interest, and a letter protesting the whole tax. On the same day the corporation filed an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals. Either after the close of business on July 19, or on July 20, the Assessor\u2019s office handed on the checks to the office of the Collector of Taxes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board ordered refund of the $1,000 originally paid, but thought it lacked jurisdiction of the rest because of a statutory requirement that before the taxpayer appeals to the Board he \u201cshall first pay such tax, together with penalties and interest due thereon, to the collector of taxes of the District of Columbia under protest in writing.\u201d D.C.Code (1951), \u00a7 47-2403, 52 Stat. 371, as amended; made applicable by D.C.Code (1951), \u00a7 47-1593, 61 Stat. 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">We think the Board had jurisdiction of the entire claim. It was not unusual for tax payments to be deposited in the Assessor\u2019s office and handed on to the Collector\u2019s office. The Collector himself testified that this was \u201cproper\u201d and \u201cdone\u201d though he \u201cwould say it is the exception.\u201d Interest on a deficiency assessment stops when the amount due reaches the Assessor\u2019s office. Income tax payments are treated as timely if they reach that office by the due date. In view of these circumstances we think deposit of tax checks in the Assessor\u2019s office for delivery to the Collector\u2019s office was payment \u201cto the collector\u201d within the meaning of the statute. No one would suggest that the statute required payment to the Collector personally, and we think the practices of the two offices obviated any distinction, for present purposes, between employees in his office and employees in the Assessor\u2019s office. The case of District of Columbia v. McFall, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 217, 188 F.2d 991, in which the taxpayer failed to protest the tax until after he had filed his appeal to the Board, is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">(3) D.C.Code (1951), \u00a7 47-2404(a) provides that \u201cThe decision of the board may be reviewed by the court * * * if a petition for such review is filed by either the District or the taxpayer within thirty days after the decision is rendered. Such petition for review shall be filed with the board * * The Board\u2019s decision was rendered April 30, 1951. The taxpayer filed its petition for review, and the clerk of the Board served a copy on the District, shortly before the Board closed its office at 4:45 p. m. on May 31. With the knowledge of the sole member of the Board, who had been consulted by telephone at his home, the District put its cross-petition for review under the door of the Board\u2019s office an hour later. A charwoman found it there that night. The Board first stamped the cross-petition as filed June 1 but after-wards, on the District\u2019s motion, changed the date to May 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">We think the District\u2019s cross-petition was timely. In Lewis-Hall Iron Works v. Blair, 57 App.D.C. 364, 23 F.2d 972, we held that a petition placed in the mail slot of the United States Board of Tax Appeals after its office had closed for the day was not filed that day. But the United States Board had adopted a rule establishing office hours. The District Board had not. Though it usually closed its office at 4:45 p. m. it was free to close either earlier or later. In McCord v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 74 App.D.C. 369, 370, 123 F.2d 164, 165, we said \u201ca full op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>portunity, an open doorj must be maintained for the potential filer until the clock strikes.\u201d We agree with the Board that in the absence of -established office hours \u201cthe. clock does not strike until midnight of the last day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The corporation did not ask the Board to decrease the amount of the assessment. It asked for cancellation of the entire assessment and refund of the entire tax. Its contention was that it was not taxable at all. It made no alternative contention, before the Board or here, to the effect that its tax liability, if any, was less than its assessment. The District of Columbia did not contend, before the Board or here, that the assessment was too low. Accordingly we do not consider the amount of tire assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">So far as the Board directed a refund its decision is reversed. So far as it denied-a refund its decision is affirmed because the corporation was subject to tax, not because of any lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Reversed in part; affirmed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-17\">. Cf. Neild v. District of Columbia, 71 App.D.C. 306, 311-312, 110 F.2d 246, 251-2S2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\">. We imply no opinion as to whether the present taxpayer was or was not within the ordinary concept of \u201cdoing business\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b83-16\">. The Collector\u2019s office stamped the tax bill \u201cJul-20-50\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\">On Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">We now think it possible, by a liberal construction, to conclude that the corporation raised before the Board the question of the measure of the tax, <em>i. e. </em>the amount of the assessment. These cases are therefore remanded to the District of Columbia Tax -Court for consideration of that question. See Lever Brothers Company v. District of Columbia, 92 U.S.App.D.C.-, 204 F.2d 39, decided March 26, 1953.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
