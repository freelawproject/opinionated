The facts are stated in an opinion rendered by Judge Holtzoff, denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Hord v. National Homeopathic Hospital, D.C.1952, 102 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Supp. 792. The contention principally urged by the defendant-appellant is that the jury should have been instructed to confine its verdict, in the event it found for the plaintiff, to the out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by the parents. We cannot accept this contention. For the reasons set forth in the opinion of the District Court, damages in a case such as the present may be substantial in amount. \u2019Of course, \u201cif in a particular case the verdict is deemed excessive the trial justice or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, on appeal of the cause, may order a reduction of the verdict\u201d. Section 16-1201, D.C.Code 1951 (relative to suits for wrongful death). But appellant has not asked us to take action of that sort. And the amount of the verdict here ($17,-000) is not so extreme as to cause us to act of our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The remaining contentions of the appellant relate chiefly to rulings on points of evidence. None of them appear to us to require discussion here. The evidence of negligence was ample, and the case was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">There being no error, the judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
