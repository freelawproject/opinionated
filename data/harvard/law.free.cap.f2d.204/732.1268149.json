The verdict was directed at close of plaintiff\u2019s case in chief, so the question is whether her evidence was sufficient to take the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-27\">The evidence in part showed that the fracture was of a common type, known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>as a \u201cColle\u2019s fracture\u201d; that the usual period for a union was from four to eight weeks; that casts applied by defendant during a period of postoperative treatment were too tight; and that a state of severe contraction developed. Plaintiff offered to prove that the usual prognosis is good in the case of a Colle\u2019s fracture, with only slight widening of the wrist, and that the functioning of the hand, wrist and arm is usually unaffected. This evidence upon objection was rejected, \u2014 erroneously we think.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\"> A careful consideration of all the evidence, construed most favorably to plaintiff, with the benefit of every legitimate inference, leads us to conclude that it brings the case fairly within the scope of our opinion in Goodwin v. Hertzberg, 91 U.S. App.D.C. 385, 201 F.2d 204 (December 22, 1952),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and cases referred to therein. See also Crist v. White, 1933, 62 App.D.C. 269, 66 F.2d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-27\">.
