On July 28, 1926, he appeared in open court and entered a plea of guilty to the information and was sentenced to imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-23\">As grounds for the writ he set up that he was induced to enter the plea of guilty through threats, intimidation, and coercion of the County Sheriff and state officials. An application for a writ of habeas corpus predicated on substantially the same grounds was denied by the Criminal Court of Appeals of Oklahoma. See Ex parte Paul, Okl.Cr.App., 227 P.2d 422. A petition for certiorari to review that decision was denied by the Supreme Court. Paul v. Burford, Warden, 341 U.S. 922, 71 S.Ct. 738, 95 L.Ed. 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-24\">After a full hearing the court below found that the petitioner had failed to establish the facts alleged in his application as grounds for the writ. The question presented is peculiarly one of fact. The trial court had the opportunity to observe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>witnesses while on the stand and their demeanor while testifying and to judge their credibility. We cannot say that the finding of the trial court was clearly erroneous. The order discharging the writ is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
