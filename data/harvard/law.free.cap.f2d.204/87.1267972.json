The facts are fully set forth in the report of the trial examiner and the decision of the board. We think that the findings and order of the board are sustained by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, except with respect to the discharges of Davis and McGraw. As to these employees, we do not think that.the record as a whole supports the finding that they were discharged for union membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-22\">The order of the Board will accordingly be modified by eliminating therefrom all provisions relating to Davis and McGraw; and as so modified it will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-23\">Modified and enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
