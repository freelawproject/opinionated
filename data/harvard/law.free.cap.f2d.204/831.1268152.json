The complaint alleged that the United States was engaged in a \u201cReconversion Housing Project\u201d;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and had employed \u201ca project engineer\u201d to inspect the machinery used in its construction. The United States had let out the project by a contract with the Buffalo Borden Building Company; but had \u201cretained the right to supervise and interfere in the progress of the work.\u201d The partners released were subcontractors and used on the \u201cProject\u201d a \u201ctruck crane\u201d that was \u201cdefective and was constituted a nuisance and was highly dangerous both in itself and in its operation\u201d; and the \u201cproject engineer knew * * * and was aware of the defective crane,\u201d but \u201cpermitted\u201d it \u201cto be operated on the project and failed to have\u201d it \u201cremoved and barred from the project.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>The plaintiff was an employee of the contractor in chief and was injured by the operation of the crane. He brought an action in the state court in New York against the three partners, which he settled for $14,000 by giving them a release \u201cfor personal injuries and damages suffered by me on June 7, 1946, when struck by the boom of a truck crane\u201d owned by them. The only question that we need consider is whether this was a bar to the action against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">\u25a0The \u201cFederal Tort Claims Act\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> gives jurisdiction to the district courts over actions for injuries caused by an employee of the United States \u201cunder circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred\u201d, and we will assume without deciding that the complaint alleged a good case under the law of New York where the claim arose. On the other hand it is the settled law of that state, following the common-law, that the release of one of several joint tort-feasors, without reserving any claim against the others, releases all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The- plaintiff\u2019s answer to this is that, although the Act adopts the local law so far as concerns those facts that are necessary to determine whether a claim arises at all, it stops there. Transactions that may relase the claim, or, we assume, may affect its continued existence in any other way, are not within the words: \u201cunder circumstances where * * * a private person, would'be liable\u201d. We need not say whether the effect of a release, executed in another st\u00e1te, is to be determined by the law of that state, or by the law of the state where the claim arises, for the release at bar was executed in New York; and the plaintiff does riot tell us to what law we are to look: whether to some \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cfederal\u201d law under the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 10 L.Ed. 865, or elsewhere. Nor need we seek any such umbrageous refuge; for it is plain that Congress meant to make the proper state law in all respects the model for the liabilities it consented to accept; and that the \u201ccircumstances\u201d included as much those facts that would release a liability once arisen, as those on which its creation depended. Since the release was executed in New York, it is the law of that state that controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-18\">. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 et seq., Title 28, U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-26\">. \u00a7 1521 et seq., Title 42, U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b884-6\">. \u00a7 1346(b)' Title 28, U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b884-19\">.
