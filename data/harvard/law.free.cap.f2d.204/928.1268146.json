In Florida, however, it is held that circumstantial evidence alone will support a finding of negligence, the inferences being for the jury to determine where the circumstances shown in evidence are such that reasonable minds might differ as to the conclusions to be drawn. Cobb v. Twitchell, 91 Fla. 539, 108 So. 186, 45 A.L.R. 865; Jones v. Stoddard, 138 Fla. 458, 189 So. 400; Orr v. Avon Florida Citrus Corp., 130 Fla. 306, 177 So. 612; Dehon v. Heidt, 38 So.2d 39; Felshin v. Sir, 149 Fla. 218, 5 So.2d 600; Bassett v. Edwards, 158 Fla. 848, 30 So.2d 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">There is abundant evidence of circumstances from which it could be reasonably inferred that gasoline delivered by the defendant to plaintiff was diluted with diesel oil, due to the negligence of defendant\u2019s employee operating the delivery truck, and that the diluted gasoline damaged the engines of plaintiff\u2019s equipment, which were designed to use pure gasoline only. The case was therefore properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
