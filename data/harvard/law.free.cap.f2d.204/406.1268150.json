Lee was separately convicted on one count and Allen on two counts. Appellants attack the District Court\u2019s denial of motions to suppress evidence for alleged invalidity of a search warrant upon which it was seized; motion for severance, and motion for judgment of acquittal for alleged entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">Consideration of these points upon the basis of the record leads us to the conclusion that the court\u2019s rulings were correct. Finding no error the judgments below are</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
