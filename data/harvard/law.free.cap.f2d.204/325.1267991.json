S. v. Strickland Transp. Co., 5 Cir., 200 F.2d 234, 235, decided after the judgment on appeal was rendered. It was there held by this court in a suit between these same parties, on facts precisely the same in principle, that engines such as these should be classified as \u201cEngines, steam or internal combustion, NOI\u201d (not otherwise indexed) under the general heading \u201cMachinery, or Machines or Parts Named\u201d, which take a low rate, and not as \u201cAircraft Parts,\u201d which take a higher rate. This is because the term \u201cinternal combustion engines\u201d more precisely describes the articles shipped, than the term \u201cairplane parts,\u201d and, being more specific, is the applicable rating. It was further held in the last cited case that articles shipped are to be classified according to their nature and essential character at the time of shipment, disregarding the future use to which <em>they might </em>be put, but if such articles could come under either of two- classifications the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the shipper, and the lower rate applied. Compare U. S. v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., 5 Cir., 194 F.2d 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">As the United States has paid in full under the applicable (low) rate, the judgment awarding recovery under the higher rate must be, and is hereby, reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
