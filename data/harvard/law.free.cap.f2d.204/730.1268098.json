The District Court found that there was no invention displayed, in view of the disclosures in the patents to Bergh (No. 1,618,566) and Edling (No. 2,504,508).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think these findings have ample basis in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-17\">Appellant says that certain mechanical features of Bergh, claimed by the latter to be capable of controlling the temperature in the combustion zone,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were not in fact effective to prevent sintering, that is, plasticizing or clinkering, of the fuel and the material being distilled. He claims high efficiency in this regard for his own structure. But an applicant for a device or structure patent must show novel and distinguishable mechanical features in his own apparatus: lacking this, added efficiency in reaching desired effects docs not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>create patentability. General Electric Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 1938, 304 U. S. 364, 58 S.Ct. 899, 82 L.Ed. 1402. And the inefficiency of an old machine need not destroy its significance as a disclosure. In re Japikse, 1950, 181 F.2d 1019, 37 C.C. P.A., Patents, 1026. Even if Bergh\u2019s structure be considered practically ineffective, by reason of its lack of control over sinter-ing, that lack can be supplied by Edling\u2019s concept, namely, the use for that purpose of a series of pipes embedded in the combustion zone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Combining the teachings of these two patents would not constitute invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\">. Suit was brought under Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4915 (1875), as amended, 35 U.S.G. \u00a7 63 (1946). That section was repealed by Section 5, Act of July 19, 1952, c. 950, 06 Stat. 815, and is now replaced by 66 Stat. 803, 35 \u00dc.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 145, 146.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-12\">. The application is Serial No. 648,766, of which appellant is assignee. Claim 23, which the parties agree is critical to the case, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A1k\">\u201c23. In a device for the dry distillation of materials: an upright combustion shaft in which fuel is adapted to be burned to provide the heat necessary for distillation; an upright retort in said combustion shaft at least the lower portion of which is embedded in the fuel in the shaft, said retort being adapted to contain material to be distilled by the heat of combustion in the shaft; and means for controlling the temperatures in the shaft and the retort to preclude attainment of temperatures therein at which sintering of the fuel and the dis-tillant takes place, said means comprising a network of ducts through which a heat absorbing fluid circulates, certain of said ducts being embedded in the fuel in the shaft and dispersed at intervals transversely of the shaft so that the influence of the heat absorbing fluid circulating through them emanates from a number of sources spaced transversely throughout the bed of fuel in the shaft, and the remaining ducts being arranged in juxtaposition to the walls of said embedded portion of the retort.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-19\">. The District Court held (1) that the application does not reveal invention over the Bergh patent, and (2) that it does not define invention \u201cover the Bergh patent in view of Edling.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b783-20\">. The main outline of Bergli\u2019s furnace is roughly similar to that of appellant. Bergh included a bar 15 which was placed below the row of retorts. The Bergh application (at column 2, line 82) says that bar 15 \u201cpreferably is constructed hollow and provided with an inlet pipe 16 and an outlet pipe 17 for air or water, in order to cool the bar.\u201d Bergh\u2019s application goes on to say \u201cThe temperature of the coke residue in the lower part of the retort can thereby be regulated within a certain range, which reacts on the distilling process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b784-14\">. The patent to Edling covered a \u201cmagazine furnace and method of burning fuel having a low sintering temperature.\u201d Edling shows a combustion chamber having walls \u201ccovered with water or steam tubes * * * or cooled by other means.\u201d (Application, column 2, line 48). Claim 4 of Edling covers \u201cthe step of circulating fluid heat absorbing medium in juxtaposition to, but not in contact with, fuel in the zone of combustion in sufficient volume and quantity to maintain the temperature of the fuel in said zone below the sintering temperature thereof.\u201d (Application, column 6, line 33). This can fairly be read on appellant\u2019s Claim 23, supra note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
