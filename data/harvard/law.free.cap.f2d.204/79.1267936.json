It operates under a non-exclusive agreement with General Motors Corporation to sell Chevrolet cars and trucks. It is supplied with new cars and trucks from an assembly plant maintained at Van Nuys, California, where all of the new cars and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>trucks purchased by respondent were assembled and the process of manufacture completed. Approximately 43 per cent of the component parts of automobiles and trucks which were shipped to the Van Nuys plant and used in the assembling and manufacturing process there carried on, were obtained from points located outside of California. All of the respondent\u2019s sales were made within California.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Upon the threshold we are confronted with the contention that the respondent is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Board. We think that the record requires an affirmance of the Board\u2019s findings of jurisdiction. In National Labor Relations Board v. Townsend, 9 Cir., 185 F.2d 378, this court found jurisdiction in respect to the activities of a local Hudson automobile dealer where it appeared that while the respondent, operating at Santa Maria, California, purchased all of his new automobiles from the Hudson Sales Corporation at Los Angeles, yet the latter organization shipped all of such automobiles into the State from outside points. The difference here, of course, is that the. Van Nuys assembly plant does not bring into the State completed automobiles but completes the assembly and manufacture there of cars and trucks but 43 per cent of whose component parts are shipped in from outside points.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We think that the difference between this and the Townsend case is one of degree only and not of substance. Another aspect present here, a circumstance not disclosed in the Townsend case, is that respondent operated under a dealer\u2019s agreement with General Motors Corporation pursuant to which the latter exercises control over the respondent\u2019s capital requirements, places of business, hours, service facilities, personnel, signs and local area advertising. The findings of the Board recite: \u201cThe Respondent is one of a limited number of dealers selling Chevrolet products, and, by virture of its contractual relationship with Chevrolet Motor Division-General Motors Corporation, is an integral part of that corporation\u2019s national system of distribution. Under the foregoing circumstances and on the basis of the entire record, we find, as did the Trial Examiner, that the respondent is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and that it will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction over the Respondent.\u201d The contractual relationship thus referred to is substantially the same as the automobile sales agreement described in National Labor Relations Board v. Ken Rose Motors, 1 Cir., 193 F.2d 769, 771, which the court said \u201cties the respondent into a vast national network of an integrated distribution system which affects commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">However, on January 20, 1953, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit handed down its decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Bill Daniels, Inc., 202 F.2d 579, which expressly disapproved the Ken Rose Motors decision. Speaking of the Board\u2019s contention based on the Ken Rose case, the court said: \u201cIn order to be an integral part of Ford these dealers would have to be either employees or agents of Ford. It is not contended that they are employees and there is no evidence in the record that the dealers are agents of Ford. The contracts in essence are contracts between vendor and purchaser. * * * The fact that they cooperate to avail themselves of the privilege of national advertising is so small an element in the operation that it does not affect the conclusion that the work done is local.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>We think that this is not' an answer to the real question here posed. For in our view the final inquiry must be whether the employer\u2019s activities bear such \u201ca close, intimate and substantial relation to trade, traffic and commerce among the states\u201d that \u201cany widespread application of the practices here charged might well result in substantially decreasing the influx of materials\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> into the state. We think that the impact of automobile sales agreements of the kind here involved upon that question is not dependent upon, whether those agreements square with common law concepts of principal and agent, or employer and employee. Rather, it seems to us, the important matter is, how does the arrangement work? Is the tie-up between respondent and General Motors Corporation, accomplished by this agreement, regardless of what it would be called under the traditional nomenclature used by lawyers, nevertheless such that the Board\u2019s finding that respondent \u201cis an integral part of that corporation\u2019s national system of distribution\u201d, has \u201c \u2018warrant in the record\u2019 and a reasonable basis in law\u201d. Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111, 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 861, 88 L.Ed. 1170.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think the answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">. Both because this court\u2019s decision in the Townsend case, supra, controls us here, and because the Board\u2019s finding on the effect of this contractual relationship on the flow of interstate commerce is one which we should not disturb, we hold that the Board\u2019s finding that the respondent was engaged in commerce within the meaning of the act must be affirmed by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>In January, 1950, the International Association of Machinists, here called the Union, initiated efforts to secure members from among the respondent\u2019s employees. Meetings were held at which Claude Leonard, one of the employees, was selected as shop steward or senior chairman. By January 31, 1950, 15 of the 28 employees in the bargaining unit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had signed cards designating the Union as their collective bargaining representative. The Union under that date wrote to the respondent claiming to be the majority representative of the employees, and asked for recognition and for a conference to discuss an agreement. On the same day the Union filed a representation petition with the Board. Respondent received the Union letter on February 1, 1950, but did not answer it because, as it now says, it in good faith doubted the Union\u2019s majority claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Following the incidents just mentioned, there occurred the acts which the Board has found constituted a violation by the respondent of \u00a7 8(a) (1), (3) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With respect to the claimed restraint and coercion and interference with the employees in the exercise of their right of self-organization, guaranteed in \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Board asserts that the respondent\u2019s president, its attorney, its service manager and the foreman of its body shop, \u201call acted to bring home to the employees the futility of their supporting the union and the advantage which would accrue to them if they kept away from it.\u201d More specifically, the Board found that respondent\u2019s president, Jackson Howell, before the election which the Board ordered on the Union\u2019s petition mentioned above, urged an employee to \u201cvote in favor of the plant\u201d, and said to him that if the employee would do so&gt;, Howell would see that the employees \u201cgot a raise in time.\u201d The Board also found that Howell had promised to other employees that if the Union were defeated the employees would receive a raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">The Board also found that one Bordeau,, respondent\u2019s service manager, likewise promised a raise in pay for the employees if the Union were defeated, and that he had stated in the presence of two employees that if the Union were victorious at the election, respondent would shut down its operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">Other statements along the same line with which the Board has charged the respondent, and on which it has made findings, against it, arc those of one Ogen who bore-the title of \u201cbody shop foreman\u201d in the respondent\u2019s organization. The testimony before the Board disclosed that when employee Leonard, who, as above stated, had. been selected as an officer of the Union,, showed up wearing his Union button, Ogen commented upon the button and made remarks to the effect that president Howell had told Ogen that the former was going to fire anybody who joined the Union; that Ogen did not want to be near Leonard while the latter wore the button because he did not want to get fired. There was also much evidence as to a number of talks which the respondent\u2019s attorney Potruch made to the employees, first when they were all assembled in one body, and later to separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>groups. In-these talks Potruch undertook to state at considerable length the views of respondent with regard to the Union\u2019s organizing activities and the forthcoming election.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In the course of his address to the employees, the attorney stated that it was the view of the respondent that because the Company was one operating solely within the State, the Board had no jurisdiction; that the respondent would contest the jurisdiction of the Board, and that perhaps it would be found that in- order to get the issue before a court, the respondent would have to do something which would cause it to be cited for an unfair labor practice. The attorney\u2019s, speech to the employees contained a lengthy discussion of the rights of the Union and of the employer under.the Act; statements that there could not be any changes in wages or working conditions during the period that was required to test the jurisdiction of the Board, and that it was the attorney\u2019s personal opinion that if he were an employee he would handle his problems not through a union but by direct dealing with the employer. The Board did not find any violation of the Act in the portions of the speech just mentioned, but it did find that at one of the group meetings which the attorney had with a number of the employees, the attorney stated that \"there would be a new deal after the first of the month\u201d, that is to say, after the election. The Board construed this to be - a promise of benefit violative of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">With respect to the charge of discrimination in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3), the Board found that the employee Leonard above mentioned, was discharged by the respondent because of his leadership in union activities among the employees. As to the refusal to bargain in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (5), the Board found that respondent\u2019s failure to respond to the Union\u2019s letter of February 1, 1950,' was not because of any good faith doubt of the Union\u2019s majority, or because it was awaiting the outcome of the representation proceeding before the Board, but that on the contrary, it was pursuant to its determination to deny the jurisdiction of the Board and to litigate that issue; that the respondent ignored the Union\u2019s request for recognition and embarked on the campaign of unfair labor practices previously mentioned, in consequence of which, the election of June 1, 1950, which the Union lost, did not represent the free and un-coerced -choice of the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">By way of remedy the Board set the election aside, ordered the reinstatement of employee Leonard with back pay, directed the respondent to cease and desist from discouraging- membership in the Union, from coercing its employees and refusing to bargain collectively with the Union, and directed the posting of certain notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Respondent contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the Board\u2019s findings of restraint and coercion. The principal attacks upon these findings relate to the testimony concerning the remarks of attorney Potruch and the conduct of foreman Ogen. Concerning Potruch, it is contended that in substance his talks amounted to no more than expressions of the views of respondent that the Board had no jurisdiction because of the local character of its business. It is said that under \u00a7 8(c) such an expression of \u201cany views, argument, or opinion * * * shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice\u201d. As for the anti-union remarks of Ogen, respondent says that his conduct is not imputable to it; that the only evidence with respect to Ogen\u2019s supervisory authority is that he was called a \u201cforeman\u201d; that there was no evidence that Ogen had any of the powers which are listed in that portion of the Act defining the term \u201csupervisor\u201d. Title 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">We find it unnecessary to resolve this controversy with respect to the effect of the statements by Potruch and by Ogen. It is apparent that the Board attached but minor significance to the remarks of the attorney; as for Ogen, his acts might well be such as to be chargeable to his employer, under the rule of International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, etc., No. 35 v. Labor Board, 311 U.S. 72, 79, 81, 61 S.Ct. 83, 85 L.Ed. 50, and of National Labor Relations Board v. Security W. &amp; Cold S. Co., 9 Cir., 136 F.2d 829, 833. But wholly apart from those considerations, it is clear that the Board\u2019s findings with respect to this aspect of the case, are supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the evidence relating to statements of the respondent\u2019s president and of its service manager, Bordean.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Respondent argues that the Board should not have followed the trial examiner in believing certain witnesses who testified that the remarks were in fact made by these men. Respondent complains bitterly because \u201cthe Board has chosen to believe Smith\u2019s version rather than the truthful version of Howell\u201d, and refers to Smith as one \u201cwhom we have shown to be a drunkard with a strong animus toward respondent; he is unworthy of belief.\u201d The Board also credited the testimony of the same witness who testified that he heard Bordeau make the statement that if the shop went union the respondent would shut its doors. Respondent argues that \u201cthe Board becomes positively ridiculous in credibility resolution\u201d, because the witness himself did not participate in the conversation but merely overheard it, and because the statement was made at a cocktail bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Of course it is not the function of this court to say that the Board and the trial examiner have believed the wrong witnesses. \u201cSo long as the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record appraised as a whole, they will not be disturbed. When supported by credible evidence, the Board\u2019s choice between two conflicting views may not be displaced, \u2018even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo.\u2019\u201d </em>National Labor Relations Board v. Nabors, 5 Cir., 196 F.2d 272, 275, and cases there cited. See also National Labor Relations Board v. Dinion Coil Co., 2 Cir., 201 F.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The same considerations must dispose of respondent\u2019s contention that there is no substantial evidence to support a finding that the employee Leonard was discharged on account of his union activities. The testimony on behalf of respondent was that Leonard, who had been assigned to do \u201cbrake work\u201d was discharged and the duties formerly performed by him were turned over to another employee Herrick who had been doing \u201cfront end and frame straightening work\u201d because the latter was better qualified to do the combined job, and the amount of work was decreasing so that there was not enough to keep both men busy. It is strenuously urged that there is no evidence that the employer was conscious of Leonard\u2019s union activities and that in any event other employees including Herrick wore their union buttons and were not discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The Board\u2019s finding of an unfair labor practice in this regard was based upon the evidence that Leonard was in fact a very competent mechanic and Lilly capable of performing not only the brake work which he had been doing but the work that Herrick was doing as well. The button which Leonard wore and to which Foreman Ogen took such violent exception, was not an ordinary union button but a shop steward\u2019s button, which indicated his leadership in the union activities. Coincident with the commencement of the organizing activities, the employer began to take work normally assigned to Leonard, who worked on a piece time basis, away from him and to give it to the men on the lubricating rack. The work of the shop, instead of falling off, increased after Leonard\u2019s discharge; Herrick\u2019s earnings nearly doubled, and he found it necessary to call in an outside worker four times in order to keep his work up. We think that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings as to the reason for Leonard\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Respondent also attacks the Board\u2019s findings as to the respondent\u2019s refusal to bargain. It says that it was not established that on January 31, 1950, when there were 29 employees in the unit, 15 of them had designated the union as their authorized representative. Proof of membership in the union was established by means of the union authorization cards which the employees signed. One of the cards received in evidence was that purporting to be signed by employee Malstrom. Respondent says that there was no testimony to prove the authenticity of the card because no one testified that Malstrom signed it. The evidence was that early on the morning of January 31, 1950, Leonard handed the card in question to Malstrom and asked him to sign it; that Malstrom said he would sign it and return it. Before 10 A.M. of the same day, Malstrom brought the card to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Leonard. Malstrom\u2019s name had been signed to the card when it was thus returned. Obviously, the contention that there was lack of authenticity is without basis for no matter who wrote Malstrom\u2019s name on the card, Malstrom clearly adopted it as his own signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">We think that the evidence abundantly supports the Board\u2019s finding that the respondent did not withhold its recognition of the Union because of a good faith doubt of the Union\u2019s majority, and that its conduct generally was motivated by a desire to gain time in which to destroy the Union\u2019s majority. The respondent had the right to question the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over its operations and to test that right in the courts. It also had the right to tell its employees of its intentions in that regard and that if the Board found against it, it would litigate that issue to the respondent\u2019s \u201clast dollar\u201d through all the courts to the Supreme Court. But it is plain that the respondent so made this undertaking its primary purpose and objective and so continuously kept its eye upon this legal issue that it overlooked its duty in good faith to bargain and prepare to bargain with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Respondent asserts that because the Union did not withdraw its representation petition and participated in the election, the Union waived the unfair labor-practices here discussed and that it was improper for the Board to set aside the election. The processing of a representation petition, however, is a matter in which the decisions to be made relate to policies which Congress has in general committed to the discretion of the Board. We think that the action of the Board was within its'discretion and within the scope of its power as set forth in Joy Silk Mills v. National Labor Relations Board, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 185 F.2d 732, 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Finally, respondent argues that it was denied a fair hearing and due process of law because of the partiality and unfairness of the trial examiner. It objects to the action of the trial examiner in frequently asking questions of witnesses and says that on those occasions the answers elicited generally aided the General Counsel. Much of the arguments upon this aspect of the case is based upon the proposition that the trial examiner must have been biased and prejudiced and that he must have predetermined the issues against respondent because he so consistently found against it and resolved questions of credibility in favor of those who testified on the other side. Respondent maintains that the trial examiner was obliged to accept as true statements made by its own witnesses when those statements were not contradicted. It says: \u201cIt is well settled law that where a witness\u2019 testimony is not contradicted, a trier has no right to refuse to accept it.\u201d This is an ancient fallacy which somehow persists despite the courts\u2019 numerous rulings to the contrary. It overlooks-the significance of the carriage, behavior, bearing, manner and appearance of a witness, \u2014 his demeanor, \u2014 when his testimony is given orally in the presence of the trier of facts. As stated by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a recent case, Dyer v. MacDougall, 201 F.2d 265, 269: \u201cMoreover, such evidence may satisfy the tribunal, not only that the witness\u2019 testimony is not true, but that the truth is the opposite of his story; for the denial of one, who has a motive to deny, may be uttered with such hesitation, discomfort, arrogance or defiance, as to give assurance that he is fabricating, and that, if he is, there is no alternative but to assume the truth of what he denies.\u201d That court took cognizance of this in National Labor Relations Board v. Dinion Coil Co., supra, a case in many respects similar to the one now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">We are unable to observe in the conduct of the trial examiner, or in his interposition to ask questions of witnesses, anything to indicate any unfairness or desire to do other than ascertain the facts. That he uniformly credited testimony favorable to the Board and uniformly discredited the testimony of the respondent is -not sufficient to warrant a conclusion that he was biased and prejudiced against respondent. Labor Board v. Pittsburg S. S. Co., 337 U.S. 656, 659, 69 S.Ct. 1283, 93 L. Ed. 1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-6\">. The Trial Examiner set forth the facts as follows: \u201cThe Chevrolet Division\u2014 General Motors Corporation \u2014 maintains a new car and truck assembly plant at Van Nuys, California, from which the Respondent obtains its new cars and trucks. For the fiscal year ending September 80, 1950, motor vehicle production parts, parts and accessories valued in excess of $5,000,000 were shipped to the said Van Nuys plant, of which amount approximately 43 per cent were shipped from points located outside the State of California. During the aforesaid fiscal year, the Respondent\u2019s purchases from Chevrolet Motor Division-General Motors Corporation \u2014 amounted to mofe than $1,500,000 but were less than $2,000,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-4\">. The quoted language is from Labor Board v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Const. Trades Council, 341 U.S. 675, 684, 71 S.Ct. 943, 949, 95 L.Ed. 1284.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\">. In that case the question was whether certain newspaper vendors were \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 151 et seq. Reversing this court\u2019s decision, 136 F.2d 608, 612, that they were independent contractors, since the word \u201cemployee\u201d must be \u201cgiven its conventional meaning as developed under the common law\u201d, the Supreme Court\" held the newsboys were \u201cemployees\u201d and said: \u201cIt will not do, for deciding this question ns one of uniform national application, to. import wholesale the traditional common-law conceptions or some distilled essence of their local variations as exclusively controlling limitations upon the scope of the statute\u2019s effectiveness. * * * Congress recognized those economic relationships cannot be fitted neatly into the containers designated \u2018employee\u2019 and \u2018employer\u2019 which an earlier law had shaped for^ different purposes. * * * In this light, the broad language of the Act\u2019s definitions, which in' terms reject conventional limitations on such conceptions as \u2018employee,\u2019 \u2018employer,\u2019 and \u2018labor dispute,\u2019 leaves no doubt that its applicability is to be determined broadly, in doubtful situations, by underlying economic facts rather than technically and exclusively by previously established legal classifications. * * * That term [employee], like other provisions, must ;be understood with reference to the purpose of the Act and the facts involved in the economic relationship. \u201cWhere all the conditions of the relation require protection, protection ought to be given.\u2019 * * * It is not necessary in this case to make a completely definitive limitation around the term \u2018employee.\u2019 That task has been assigned primarily to the agency created by Congress to administer the Act. Determination of \u2018where all the conditions of the' relation require protection\u2019 involves inquiries for the Board charged with this duty. * * * Undoubtedly questions of statutory interpretation especially when arising in the first instance in judicial proceedings, are for the courts to resolve, giving appropriate weight to the judgment of those whose special duty is to administer the questioned statute. * * * But where the question is one of specific application of a broad statutory term in a proceeding in which the agency administering the statute must determine it initially, the reviewing court\u2019s function is limited. Like the commissioner\u2019s determination under the Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Act, that a man is not a \u2018member of a crew\u2019 (South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U.S. 251, 60 S.Ct. 544, 547, 84 L.Ed. 732) or that he was injured \u2018in the course of his employment\u2019 (Parker v.

And this we must do under National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 1944, 322 U.S. 111, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170, and National Labor Relations Board v. Townsend, 9 Cir., 1950, 185 F.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Notwithstanding, I remain unconvinced that the word \u201cemployee\u201d actually means more in the Wagner Act than elsewhere (Hearst case) or that a simple business transaction within a state is interstate commerce because of a fine-spun tracing of a remotely possible and unmeasurable relation to trade across a state line (Townsend case). Judge Harrison joins me in this concurrence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
