The case went to the jury and resulted in a verdict in favor of appellee. The only question we are called upon to review on appeal is whether it was error for the court to instruct the jury on the doctrine of the last clear chance. Appellant objected that the evidence did not afford basis for such an instruction. We have considered the evidence and conclude that it made out a case for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
