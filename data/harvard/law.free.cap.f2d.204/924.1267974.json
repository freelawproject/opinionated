The defendant received a verdict in the court below. All that the plaintiff complains of here is the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury. This we have examined. Everything the judge said was literally correct and any slight possibility that the jury could have been confused into thinking that negligence was required for liability under the Boiler Inspection Act is completely eliminated by the judge\u2019s giving, at plaintiff\u2019s request, specific instruction to the effect that negligence is not necessary under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">The charge of the trial court was careful, fair and accurate. The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
