Co. v. Mechanics\u2019 Savings Bank &amp; Trust Co., 6 Cir., 72 F. 413, 422; Hartzell v. United States, 8 Cir., 72 F.2d 569, 584; Banning v.

United States, 9 Cir., 183 F.2d 391, 395; and, in view of the fact that such matters are transitory in nature and are not likely to reoccur in the same form, if at all, in the next trial, it is inadvisable for this Court to attempt to rule on such questions in advance;</p>\n<p id=\"b179-20\">And, having again considered the other matters urged upon us by appellants, and being of the opinion that it is sufficient for the purposes of the retrial to call to the attention of the Trial Judge the possibility of reversible error in communicating to the jury through the medium of a deputy marshal; Ray v. United States, 8 Cir., 114 F.2d 508, 512, 513, certiorari denied, 311 U.S. 709, 61 S.Ct. 318, 85 L.Ed. 461; Dodge v.
