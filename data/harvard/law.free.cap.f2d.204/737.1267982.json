Federal Trade Commission, 1952, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 169, 194 F.2d 346, 348. The order of the Commission forbids petitioner, a manufacturing printer, to sell in interstate commerce \u201cpush cards, puncliboards, or other lottery devices <em>which are to be used, or which, due to their design, are suitable for use </em>in the sale or distribution of merchandise to the public by means of a game of chance, gift enterprise or lottery scheme.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-24\">Petitioner urges that the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Halseth, 1952, 342 U.S. <em>277, 72 </em>S.Ct. 275, 96 L.Ed. 308, establishes that the Federal Trade Commission has no authority over the sale of lottery devices. For the reasons given by the Ninth Circuit in Lichtenstein v. Federal Trade Commission, 1952, 194 F.2d 607, 611, this contention must be rejected. Petitioner also attacks the form of the Commission\u2019s order, alleging it to be inconsistent with our decision in Hamilton Manufacturing Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, supra. As to this, we agree with petitioner. The order of the Federal Trade Commission will he amended so as to insert, in replacement of the words italicized above, the words \u201c \u2018which are designed or intended to be used\u2019 \u201d. As thus modified, the order will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-25\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-16\">. The order was issued under authority of kicciion 5 of the Federal Trade Act, 38 Stat. 719 (1914), as amended, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 45.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
