Hilton now moves to vacate that default judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. (\u201cRule\u201d) 60(b). For the reasons stated in this memorandum opinion and order, Hilton\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Though the parties have not entered into a formal stipulation of facts, for purposes of the present motion the facts are either matters of court record or undisputed. Facts in the first (court record) category are these (all dates are in 1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">1. On May 3 Passarella filed a complaint against Hilton Hotels Corporation (\u201cHilton Hotels\u201d), demanding $18,000 (plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs) for loss of a diamond ring during a stay at the Caribe Hilton Hotel (\u201cCaribe Hilton\u201d) in Puerto Rico.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">2. On May 8 this Court sua sponte dismissed the Complaint for failure properly to allege subject matter jurisdiction (diversity of citizenship).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-16\">3. On May 17 Passarella filed an amended complaint (the \u201cComplaint\u201d), this time substituting Hilton as defendant (Hilton and Hilton Hotels are wholly unrelated corporations).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-17\">4. On May 20 Hilton\u2019s Vice President and General Counsel Melvin Milligan (\u201cMilligan\u201d) was served with, and personally acknowledged receipt of, a copy of the Complaint and a summons of this District Court to answer within twenty days of service (by Jun\u00e9,\u00bf9);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-18\">5. On July 3 (no answer or other defensive pleading having been filed), this Court \u2014 acting on Passarella\u2019s motion supported by a showing of proper service \u2014 ordered a default against Hilton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-19\">6. On August 5, after a proveup hearing on damages, this Court ordered entry of judgment against Hilton for $18,000 plus interest and costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-20\">7. On August 22 Passarella filed with this District Court an affidavit for garnishment directed at Chase Manhattan Bank (\u201cChase\u201d), alleged to be Hilton\u2019s debtor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-21\">8. On September 20 attorneys for Hilton filed appearances in this District Court and moved to vacate the default judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-22\">9. On October 2 Passarella moved for conditional judgment against Chase for failure to answer this District Court\u2019s garnishment summons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>10. On October 4 this Court denied Passarella\u2019s motion for conditional judgment on the ground Chase had been improperly served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Hilton has also submitted two affidavits from Milligan, who states he was first aware of the existence of Passarella\u2019s claim on May 17, when he received a carbon copy of a letter' from counsel for Hilton Hotels to Passarella\u2019s attorney explaining Hilton Hotels had no connection to Caribe Hilton. That letter also stated \u2014 erroneously, according to Milligan \u2014 Hilton was Caribe Hilton\u2019s manager. Milligan\u2019s affidavit acknowledges receipt of the Complaint but says Milligan on May 20 \u201cprepared and directed correspondence\u201d to Adele Quiles (\u201cQuiles\u201d) of Continental Insurance Company (\u201cContinental\u201d), Hilton\u2019s liability carrier, \u201cforwarding\u201d the Complaint to Continental for defense under Hilton\u2019s liability policy. On June 3, after having received further information about the events alleged in the Complaint, Milligan \u201cprepared and directed\u201d additional correspondence to Quiles. Milligan states those two letters were sent via first class mail to Quiles\u2019 correct business address and neither was returned as undelivered. Milligan does not tender any correspondence from Continental responding to either of his letters \u2014 or even acknowledging their receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">After June 3 Milligan claims he had no further contact with Quiles or anyone else at Continental as to Passarella\u2019s claim. Instead the next voice he heard came some 15 weeks later, on September 18, when he received a telephone call from someone at Chase advising him of the pending garnishment proceeding. Milligan attempted to reach Continental that day but did not get in touch with it until the following morning. Assertedly he then learned for the first time Continental had received neither the May 20 nor the June 3 correspondence. Needless to say, Continental had taken no action on Hilton\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Quiles\u2019 affidavit says she never received Milligan\u2019s letters and was unable to locate them after a \u201cdiligent and thorough search\u201d of her office and department. She concludes \u2014 though of course that is not really a fact of which she can have actual knowledge \u2014 Continental never received either of Milligan\u2019s letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Finally, Hilton offers the affidavit of Vi Sanvenero (\u201cSanvenero\u201d), a senior liability examiner at Continental. Sanvenero states she \u201cundertook an internal investigation\u201d to determine whether Continental had received notice of Passarella\u2019s suit before Milligan\u2019s September 19 call. That investigation covered both the claims department\u2019s own records and persons employed by other Continental departments. Sanvenero says she was \u201cunable to turn up any information whatsoever regarding the existence of [Milligan\u2019s letters] or their receipt by any person at [Continental].\u201d Like Quiles, Sanvenero concludes Milligan\u2019s letters were not received by Continental.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\n<em>Rule 60(b) Standards and Their Application</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect ... or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Rule 60(b) \u201cis reserved for extraordinary relief,\u201d requiring a defendant to \u201cshow exceptional circumstances to justify overturning the default judgment.\u201d <em>Inryco, Inc. v. Metropolitan Engineering Co., </em>708 F.2d 1225, 1230 (7th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>464 U.S. 937, 104 S.Ct. 347, 78 L.Ed.2d 313 (1983). Any defendant seeking Rule 60(b) relief from a default judgment must satisfy three criteria <em>(United States v. Forty-eight Thousand, Five Hundred Ninety-five Dollars, </em>705 F.2d 909, 912 (7th Cir.1983));<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">1. Its motion must be filed within a \u201creasonable\u201d time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">2. Its default must have been the result of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">3. It must \u201cdemonstrate\u201d a \u201cmeritorious defense\u201d to the underlying action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Taking those criteria in reverse order, Hilton first and most strenuously argues it has a meritorious defense to Passarella\u2019s claim. In fact it advances three:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">1. Hilton does not own or operate Caribe Hilton.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">2. Hilton denies all the factual allegations of the Complaint as to the existence and whereabouts of Passarella\u2019s diamond ring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-17\">3. Puerto Rico\u2019s Innkeeper\u2019s Act of 1955 is a bar to Passarella\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-18\">This Court may assume arguendo that one or more of those defenses is \u201cmeritorious,\u201d though a court on a Rule 60(b) motion is not obliged actually to investigate the merits of an asserted defense. Rule 60(b) motions \u201cshould not be treated as a substitute for an appeal.\u201d <em>Inryco, </em>708 F.2d at 1230. Precisely for this reason Hilton misinterprets the import of the \u201cmeritorious defense\u201d criterion. Satisfying the court of the existence of a meritorious defense is not a factor that supplants or outweighs the other criteria. Instead it is a precondition to relief, stemming from considerations of .judicial economy. If a Rule 60(b) movant cannot demonstrate a meritorious defense, it would be a waste of time and energy to reopen the default judgment. In other words, if a defendant clearly has no defense, a default judgment against him or her could be viewed as harmless error even in the absence of unreasonable delay or inexcusable neglect. But the fact a defendant may have a dead-bang defense as opposed to a shaky one does not argue more strongly in favor of Rule 60(b) relief unless the other criteria are met too.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By demonstrating a meritorious defense, Hilton simply clears the first of three hurdles. See <em>Ellington v. Milne, </em>14 F.R.D. 241, 242 (E.D.N.C.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-19\">It clearly falls at the second. Hilton argues its failure to answer is a matter of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d It recognizes the standard of excusable neglect is one of \u201chonest mistakes rather than willful misconduct, carelessness or negligence.\u201d <em>Ell</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>ingsworth v. Chrysler, </em>665 F.2d 180, 185 (7th Cir.1981). Assuming (again arguendo) Hilton\u2019s default was not willful, Hilton has wholly failed to show it was not careless or negligent. Hilton\u2019s \u201cgood excuse\u201d (Mem. 5) is that Milligan\u2019s timely transmittal of the Complaint and summons to Continental was defeated by the Post Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">But, as Passarella correctly points out, she sued Hilton and not Continental. Hilton\u2019s indemnity contract with Continental was a matter between those two corporations and does not legally absolve Hilton from defending itself. Milligan\u2019s own affidavit says he received the papers from this District Court and merely put them in the mail to Quiles without even once following up with an inquiry after some four months of silence. Admittedly, as Hilton\u2019s vice president and general counsel Milligan was most unlikely to have filed his personal appearance in this action, but as an attorney he can scarcely claim ignorance of the obligations created by a summons and complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cNeither ignorance nor carelessness on the part of a litigant or his attorney will provide grounds for Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d <em>Bershad v. McDonough, </em>469 F.2d 1333, 1337 (7th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Thus Hilton\u2019s strenuous attempts to show Milligan\u2019s letters to Continental were lost in the mail are bootless as a legal matter. This is not (of course) to say it is careless to trust one\u2019s legal affairs to the mail. But whatever volume of litigation a business may have, the notion of its not establishing some sort of check list or follow up procedure bespeaks negligence of itself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hilton\u2019s asserted lack of negligence, considering its total inattention in the face of Continental\u2019s silence, is utterly unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Nor is this Court impressed with Hilton\u2019s assertion (R.Mem. 13) it \u201chad absolutely no reason in the world to delay going forward with this ease\u201d since its defenses are meritorious. If that contention is intended to suggest Hilton was neither negligent nor careless because it would have been irrational to be negligent or careless, that could be argued of every negligence case. Rationality or the lack of it may be probative of whether willful misconduct has taken place, but it is quite beside the mark in the present situation of inexcusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Having failed to clear the second Rule 60(b) hurdle, Hilton never even reaches the one remaining. This Court therefore need not decide whether Hilton acted \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d as Rule 60(b) requires. Once inexcusable neglect has worked its effect and led to an adverse judgment, no post-judgment diligence can transform the prior delinquency into \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">Hilton has not satisfied the requirements for relief under Rule 60(b). Its motion to vacate this Court\u2019s default judgment for $18,000 plus interest and costs in Passarella\u2019s favor is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-13\">. Counsel for both sides have spelled Passarella\u2019s first name two ways (\"Diane\u201d and \"Dianne\") in various filings. Passarella\u2019s own counsel, who might be expected to know, seems lately (though not originally) to have preferred \"Dianne.\" Passarella herself (who <em>does </em>know) appears to have signed the initial complaint with only one \"n\u201d but the amended complaint with two \u2014 and the amended complaint itself contains instances of both spellings. This Court has adopted the one-\"n\u201d alternative because the case began in that form and there has been no request for a formal order changing the case caption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Akx\">. As the later factual recital indicates, Hilton Hotels\u2019 lawyer had written Passarella's lawyer, directing him to Hilton as the proper defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. Passarella attempts to get some mileage out of (a) statements in the Quiles and Sanvenero affidavits (Quiles Aff. 1f [6]; Sanvenero Aff. fl 16) that Milligan\u2019s letters, \u201cif sent,\u201d were not received by Continental and (b) Quiles\u2019 statement (Quiles Aff. f 13) that Milligan \"purportedly\u201d sent the two letters to her. As Hilton\u2019s R.Mem. 8-9 indicates, however, those qualifications merely indicate the extent of Quiles\u2019 and Sanvenero\u2019s personal knowledge. Neither can (or does) claim any knowledge of whether the letters were sent. On the other hand, Passarella correctly observes the only potential proof the letters <em>were </em>mailed is Milligan\u2019s affidavit, and Milligan does not actually say he put the letters in the mail or saw someone do so. <em>Chandler Leasing Corp. v. UCC, Inc., </em>91 F.R.D. 81, 83 (N.D.Ill.1981) took a dim view of a third-party defendant\u2019s claim he mailed a summons to his attorneys, who failed to appear and plead in his behalf. There the third-party defendant\u2019s affidavit said he had mailed the materials, but the court pointed out his failure to submit affidavits from his attorneys stating they had not received the materials undercut his \"lost in the mail\u201d claim. Here we have the mirror-image of <em>Chandler\u2019s </em>facts, plus the additional fact of <em>two </em>mailings two weeks apart alleged to have gone astray and entered a black hole (neither in Continental\u2019s files nor returned to Hilton) \u2014 lengthening the odds of improbability astronomically. Nevertheless, as this opinion later reflects, resolution of Hilton\u2019s motion does not depend on whether Milligan is telling the truth, though if he were lying (or if there had been a double breakdown in the mailing procedures at Hilton\u2019s end) the result would be even more easily reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b482-13\">. Hilton cites a great many cases, but hardly any from our Court of Appeals. Standards for granting Rule 60(b) motions are not uniform in all circuits. Compare, e.g., <em>United Coin Meter Co. v. Seaboard Coastline Railroad, </em>705 F.2d 839, 845 (6th Cir.1983) (articulating a very different three-factor test).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b482-14\">. According to Hilton, Caribe Hilton is owned by Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company and operated under lease by Hilton International of Puerto Rico, Inc., a wholly-owned Hilton subsidiary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b482-20\"><em>. </em>Indeed, as <em>Forty-eight Thousand, Five Hundred Ninety-five Dollars, </em>705 F.2d at 912 points out, Rule 60(b) itself does not mention \"meritorious defense\u201d as a basis for granting relief. That further illustrates the principle a meritorious defense should not override the other factors by eliciting the sympathy of a court. Rule 60(b) provides a mechanism for relief based on procedural factors, not a \"substitute for appeal\u201d or a reopening of the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">. Milligan\u2019s Aff. f 7 says he sent the summons and Complaint to Quiles with \u201ccorrespondence,\u201d and his Aff. 1f 8 says on June 3 he sent \u201cdocumentation\u201d of \"more information concerning the nature of the incident alleged by [Passarella].\" Milligan is silent as to whether he informed Quiles of all facts necessary to establish Hilton\u2019s three now-asserted defenses or that Continental had such information on hand. Surely a lawyer would find it more than a trifle odd that Continental did not acknowledge receipt of either letter, let alone communicate with him at all concerning possible lines of defense. And if (like most top-level legal officers of substantial corporations) Milligan considered he could not be expected to carry in his head a mental follow-up calendar on the numerous matters that come across his desk, that would all the more reflect Hilton\u2019s negligence in failing to establish and follow an appropriate tickler system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b483-17\">. In that respect it is worth noting Sanvenero\u2019s affidavit suggests Continental has meticulous internal procedures to keep track of matters. But Milligan\u2019s affidavit displays an eloquent silence on that score as to Hilton\u2019s procedures (or more accurately the lack of them) in following up on litigated claims. And as the text has made plain, it is Hilton's \"excusable neglect\u201d vel non (and not Continental\u2019s) that is relevant as to Passarella.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
