HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">Movant-appellant Gina Tilford was married to Richard Tilford from 1981 to 2014. In 2012, Mr. Tilford pled guilty to failing to file a tax return in 2006. The Court sentenced him to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment, one year supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $453,547.00. Following the filing of the judgment, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office applied for and received a writ of garnishment targeting the property and wages of Mr. and Mrs. Til-ford. On January 22, 2014, the Tilfords finalized their divorce. Mrs. Tilford alleges that for several years prior to the official end of their marriage, Mr. Tilford was emotionally abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">The district court entered an order on March 31, 2014, directing Mrs. Tilford\u2019s employer to withhold the portion of her earnings that accrued prior to the date of the divorce, including paid time off and contributions to her 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans. Mrs. Tilford filed a Motion to Quash the Writs of Garnishment, as well as a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment. The district court denied both, and finalized the garnishment on March 24, 2015. Mrs. Tilford timely filed an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-19\">We review garnishment orders for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s interpretation of relevant statutory provisions are conclusions of law, which we review <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finally, we review the lower court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Mrs. Tilford concedes that the United States can garnish her solely-managed community property to pay restitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, the federal government can legally attach her earnings, including retirement funds, for purposes of satisfying her spouse\u2019s tax liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, Mrs. Tilford argues that the \u201cInnocent Spouse\u201d provision of the Internal Revenue Code Section 66(c) provides her with an affirmative defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The district court concluded that Mrs. Tilford does not qualify for relief under \u00a7 66(c) for two reasons. First, it held that innocent spouse relief is only available as an affirmative defense to the government\u2019s efforts to assess a tax deficiency, not when the government is enforcing a criminal judgment. Second, the district court found that Mrs. Tilford \u201cwas aware that [her husband] earned an income as an insurance broker,\u201d disqualifying her under the knowledge provision of \u00a7 66(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">Mrs. Tilford contests the district court\u2019s decision. She argues that because the innocent spouse defense protects a non-liable spouse from payment of a tax deficiency, she should also be protected from an order of criminal restitution. We disagree. By its terms, \u00a7 66 defines how the Internal Revenue Code treats community income for the collection of federal income taxes. Within that provision, \u00a7 66(c) provides tax liability relief for innocent spouses. Criminal restitution, even as a penalty for a failure to pay taxes, is not a tax. Mr. Tilford\u2019s guilty plea makes that clear \u2014 he agreed to pay restitution \u201cunder 18 U.S.C. 3663,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which is \u00e1 provision in the criminal code authorizing restitution for any number of crimes, most having nothing to do with taxes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And the' provision specifically authorizing criminal restitution in tax cases like Mr. Tilford\u2019s instructs the IRS to \u201cassess and collect the ... restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>... for failure to pay any tax ... in the same manner <em>as if such amount were such </em>tax.\"<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2022 Finally, Mrs. Tilford has not offered any statutory footing for a wider application of \u00a7 66(c), nor any cases applying the provision to criminal restitution orders. The district court correctly concluded that Mrs. Tilford cannot employ the innocent spouse defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Mrs. Tilford further argues that the district court incorrectly balanced the \u00a7 66(c) factors as applied to the facts of her case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Since Mrs. Tilford cannot invoke the innocent spouse defense, we do not reach the issues attending a weighing of the relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The district court\u2019s order denying Mrs. Tilford\u2019s Motion to Quash Writs of Garnishment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-13\">. <em>United States v.
