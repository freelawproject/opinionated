In order to prove an election by acquiescence, it is necessary to show the trustee\u2019s knowledge of the action, and such knowledge cannot be inferred from the fact that the action was pending in a court of general jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-12\">Contract, by a claim adjuster, for an agreed compensation for services, of ten per cent on all moneys received by the defendant in a certain suit against an accident insurance company above the sum of $2,000, the suit having been settled for $4,750. Writ dated February 18, 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-13\">At the trial in the Superior Court before Maynard, J., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>plaintiff testified that he went into bankruptcy on July 17, 1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-3\">At the close of the evidence the judge ruled that upon the evidence as to the bankruptcy proceedings the action could not be maintained, and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-4\"><em>J.

The present bankruptcy act under which the plaintiff was adjudicated a bankrupt vests the title to the bankrupt\u2019s property in the trustee without an assignment in fact. U. S. St. 1898, c. 541, \u00a7 70. 30 U. S. Sts. at Large, 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">It is settled that an assignment in bankruptcy is a defence to a prior action brought by the bankrupt unless it affirmatively appears that either the prior action in the name of the bankrupt is being prosecuted by the assignee or that the assignee has elected not to assume the burden of it. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>3 Gray, 392; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Kingsley, </em>11 Allen, 345; <em>Mayhew </em>v. <em>Pentecost, </em>129 Mass. 332; <em>Herring </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>146 Mass. 10; <em>Kenyon </em>v. <em>Wrisley, </em>147 Mass. 476 ; or that the property is not needed for the payment of the debts of the bankrupt, as in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>125 Mass. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention here is that the jury would have been warranted in finding that the trustee elected not to assume the chose in action now before us and that he was entitled to go to them on that issue. There was no direct evidence of an election by the trustee. The plaintiff undertakes to make out an election by showing knowledge on the part of the trustee, followed by inaction. But in our opinion there was no such knowledge shown on the part of the trustee as would warrant a finding that his inaction was an election not to assume this chose in action.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The bankrupt did not insert the claim against the defendant in his schedule, and there was no evidence that the trustee in bankruptcy has ever had actual knowledge of it. All the evidence of knowledge on the part of the trustee was this: On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>being asked on cross-examination whether he had stated that he had any claim against the defendant, the plaintiff said \u201c not in my schedule, but to the referee,\u201d and after testifying that the claim in question was covered by a general item \u201c Claims against various parties,\u201d said, \u201c I put it in,\u201d and on being asked where, \u201c To the trustee, and it was appraised there too.\u201d The \u201c claims against various parties \u201d were put down as \u201c aggregating about $2000,\u201d and \u201c probably worth $100.\u201d On the plaintiff\u2019s testimony his claim against the defendant was for $275 and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">This is not enough to make out an election by inaction. To make out an election in that way actual knowledge on the part of the person who had the right to elect must be shown. In <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Kingsley, </em>11 Allen, 345, it was held that an election by an assignee\u2019s not taking action was not made out by its being shown that he had taken the schedule of the bankrupt from the files without its being shown that the claim in question was on the schedule. In <em>Mayhew </em>v. <em>Pentecost, </em>129 Mass. 332, actual consent on the part of the assignee was proved, and in <em>Herring </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>146 Mass. 10, the assignee was in court when the case was tried, and made no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The plaintiff relies on the case of <em>Lancey </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>88 Maine, 215. That case, like this, was the case of an action pending when the assignment in bankruptcy took effect. It came up on an agreed statement of facts from which it appeared that no action had been taken by the assignee for fourteen years. The judge held that knowledge on the part of the assignee might be inferred from the fact that the \"action was a matter of public record, being upon the docket and files of a court of general jurisdiction, and directed the case to stand for trial, adding, \u201cIf, however, the defendants desire, they can have an order of notice of this action served upon the assignee which will conclude him of record.\u201d There is nothing in the cases cited in <em>Lancey </em>v. <em>Foss </em>which supports the proposition that knowledge in this connection may be inferred from the fact that the action is pending in a court of general jurisdiction, and so far as that case goes on that ground we are not prepared to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\n<em>Hxceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
