Sumner and the other by Arthur D. Sumner both against John D. Gardiner and George B. Beardsell, of Lynn, and Charles A. Ford who was made a defendant by amendment, as copartners doing business under the name of the Boston Shoe Stock Company, for certain sums alleged to be due to the respective plaintiffs for goods sold and delivered according to accounts annexed. Writs dated September 13, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">No service' of the writs was made upon Ford, but he voluntarily came into court, and filed a suggestion of bankruptcy and his discharge therein. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">The cases were tried together before <em>Wait, </em>J. The plaintiffs requested the judge to default the defendant Ford for failure to answer interrogatories filed by the plaintiffs, and for want of an answer to' the plaintiffs\u2019 declarations. As to this the judge reserved his decision, and the cases proceeded to trial against Gardiner and Beardsell only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">. The plaintiffs throughout the trial contended that, before and at the time the goods mentioned in the plaintiffs\u2019 declarations were sold, a partnership had been formed and existed between Ford and the other defendants under the name of the Boston Shoe Stock Company, or that Ford and the other defendants had held themselves' out as copartners in the business of the Shoe Stock Company, or that Gardiner and Beardsell were the principals and Ford the agent in the business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\">The defendants Gardiner and Beardsell denied that any such copartnership had ever been formed, or that they had ever held themselves out as copartners with Ford, or that he ever had acted as their agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-9\">The two postal cards and a letter, sufficiently described in the opinion, were offered in evidence by the plaintiffs and were admitted by the judge against the objection of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-10\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff Charles P.

The order in which the proof was introduced is wholly immaterial and there was evidence both circumstantial and direct from which a jury might find that the defendants Gardiner and Beardsell were doing business as Gardiner, Beardsell and Company in manufacturing the \u201c Hatch Counter \u201d ; that the Boston Shoe Stock Company sold this counter, and that the defendant Gardiner was frequently at the office on Summer Street and subsequently at the one on Lincoln Street at each of which places the Boston Shoe Stock Company and Gardiner, Beardsell and Company purported to be carrying on business. Signs were put up at each place showing in connection the names of Gardiner, Beardsell and Company and Boston Shoe Stock Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The evidence of the plaintiff Arthur B. Sumner was to the effect that prior to the order given to his firm a postal card had been received by him which was like one of those admitted in evidence stating that \u201c Gardiner, Beardsell &amp; Co., Successors to Gardiner &amp; McManus . . . Men\u2019s Department, Boston Shoe Stock Co.,\u201d were to be found at \u201c135 Summer Street, Boston. C. A. Ford, Manager.\u201d He called there at the time he obtained the order and found the defendant Gardiner \u201c sitting at the desk of the Boston Shoe Stock Company \u201d and had some talk with him about selling the counters which the plaintiffs were engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>in making, and during \"that talk the defendant Gardiner told him \u201c that he was running the men\u2019s department of the Boston Shoe Stock Company, that he was behind it,\u201d and also \u201c that Gardiner and Beardsell was behind the Boston Shoe Stock Company in the men\u2019s department, and that I should get my pay for these goods.\u201d After this conversation he received the letter written by Mr. Ford and another postal card similar to that admitted at the trial announcing the removal of Gardiner, Beard-sell and Company and the Boston Shoe Stock Company from Summer Street to Lincoln Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">This evidence tended clearly to show that the defendant Gardiner at least was doing business as claimed by the plaintiffs, e and that after the order had been given to make the counters Ford wrote the letter admitted in evidence and for aught that appears from the bill of exceptions must have obtained this information from Gardiner and it may fairly be inferred that the letter was written by his direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">It is argued by the defendants that even if the postal cards and letter are competent as admissions made by Gardiner they should not be received as evidence against the defendant Beard-sell. But George W. Folger, a witness called by the plaintiffs, among other things, testified in substance, that he was in the employment of Gardiner, Beardsell and Company and was present when Charles P. Sumner, one of the plaintiffs, met the defendant Beardsell and introduced them to each other, and at that time a conversation took place between them. \u201cMr. Beardsell says, \u2018 how do you do, I have heard of you before.\u2019 \u201d To which Mr. Sumner said \u201c I didn\u2019t connect you in any way, shape, or manner with the Boston Shoe Stock Company. I understand from Mr. Ford that you are connected, and I had no other way to prove it but by bringing suit.\u201d To this assertion Beardsell made no reply. It would be open for a jury to say whether under all the circumstances, a suit having been brought in which it was alleged that he was a partner of Gardiner and that they were doing business as the Boston Shoe Stock Company and his attention being called by one of the plaintiffs to . this contention and the direct statement made to him that he was connected with the company, he was called upon to deny the statement if such was not the fact. And his failure to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>any denial where naturally it would be expected, might cause his silence to be construed as an admission by him of the truth of the allegation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O'Brien, </em>179 Mass. 533, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">Under the instructions which carefully guarded the rights of the defendants, the jury by their verdicts must have found that the postal cards were issued and the letter written in the usual course of business and by the authority of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
