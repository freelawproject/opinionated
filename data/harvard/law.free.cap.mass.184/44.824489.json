Cary, for $841.50 paid by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate under a contract in writing by which the defendant agreed upon such payment to transfer certain shares of mining stock to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, alleging a failure of the defendant to deliver the shares as a total failure of the consideration for which the money was paid. Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated December 18,1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-10\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before Mason, C. J., without a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-11\">The contract was as follows: \u201c Dec. 17, 1898. In consideration of $841.50 each received from Messrs. Cary &amp; Hare, making $1,683 in all, I hereby agree to transfer to each of them eight thousand five hundred shares of pooling shares in the Montana &amp; Arizona Consolidated Copper Mining Company, making 17,000 in the holdings in the above company which I have acquired from J. W. Win wood. Julius Leszynsky.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was the Cary referred to in the foregoing contract. The defendant testified among other matters that at the time of the execution of the agreement Cary was vice-president .and a director of the company, and was one of the trustees and one of the parties to the pooling agreement referred to in the contract. There was evidence that there had been an overissue of the stock of the company. Cary died December 9, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The plaintiff contended that the defendant had never transferred the shares of stock to Cary, and that she was entitled to recover back the $841.50 paid for such transfer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule, as a matter of law, that upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain her action and that the defendant was entitled to a verdict. The judge refused so to rule, and found for the plaintiff in the sum of $891.15. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-6\"><em>J. JR. Murphy, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-7\"><em>B. </em>_ZV. <em>Johnson, R. P. Clapp W. 0. Underwood, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b67-8\">Barker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A96\">The bill of exceptions brings here a question as to the admissibility of evidence, and also the contention that upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">1. The exception to the admission of evidence has not been alluded to in the defendant\u2019s brief, and has no merit. It was to allowing a clerk in charge of the transfer department of the trust company which had charge of the transfer books of the mining company concerning the stock of which the action was brought to testify to matters within his personal knowledge and relevant to the issue upon trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">2. Assuming that the written agreement of December 17, 1898, because of the characterization in it of the stock which by it the defendant agreed to transfer as \u201c pooling shares \u201d impliedly contemplated a transfer only after the termination of the pooling agreement, the evidence justified a finding that the pool terminated by its own limitation on July 1,1899, more than six months before the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The evidence upon the question of the acts of the defendant looking toward a transfer of the shares in accordance with his agreement was conflicting. He testified to writing ah order for the transfer and that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate delivered this order to the secretary and that the shares thereupon were transferred. But there was other testimony that the defendant did not give such an order, that no such order was presented to the secretary, that no part of the shares was issued to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and that the defendant protested against their issue. The acknowledgment in the written agreement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the receipt by the defendant .of the price of $841.50, and the testimony both of the defendant and of another witness justified a finding that the whole sum sought to be recovered was the consideration which had in effect been paid to the defendant upon the making of the agreement, and as moving from the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. The evidence justified a finding that the defendant neglected to perform his agreement to transfer the shares. Neither the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was connected with the pool as member and trustee, or that he was an officer of the company, or that there had been an overissue of its stock, constitutes a defence to the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
