Writ as amended dated June 27, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-12\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Hardy, </em>J., it appeared, that the alleged defect consisted in a plank bridge across a gutter which the plaintiff contended was too narrow, unsuitable, and improperly guarded. The accident happened when the plaintiff was attempting to drive over this bridge in a snow storm on January 7, 1902, at about six o\u2019clock P. M. The bridge had been constructed across the gutter to connect a private driveway with the highway and was outside of the travelled portion of the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-13\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant having requested a ruling that upon all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover, the judge asked the plaintiff\u2019s counsel whether he contended that the way reached by the bridge was a public highway, and he replied that he did not. The judge ordered a verdict for the defendant, on the ground that the accident was without the limits of the highway, so far as it was wrought for public travel, and that the plaintiff was not a traveller upon the highway at the time of the accident. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-14\"><em>H. W. King O. M.
