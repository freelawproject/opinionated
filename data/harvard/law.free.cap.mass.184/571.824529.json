[Seal.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-5\">\u201c Witness to all, having first faithfully interpreted the foregoing, reading the same in the Italian language to Maria L. S. Gargano: Michele Nigro.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-6\">The case was referred to J. A. Lowell, Esquire, as master. He found that the contract was void for champerty, that the defendants Pope and Davis should be ordered to pay the plaintiff $550, and that the contract should be declared to be void and ordered to be delivered up for cancellation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-7\">The Superior Court made a decree for the plaintiff in accordance with the master\u2019s report; and the defendants Dowd and Tebbetts appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-8\">The answer of the defendants Dowd and Tebbetts referred to in the opinion contained, among other matters in the nature of a demurrer, the allegations that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, that no facts were alleged to show that the plaintiff was without a remedy at law, and that the bill set forth no grounds for equitable relief.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-9\"><em>S. S. </em>Tyng, for the defendants Dowd and Tebbetts.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-10\"><em>A. </em>_Z). <em>Sill, (S. S. Wyman </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b595-11\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACV\">The only exception to the master\u2019s report taken by the defendants Tebbetts and Dowd is that he erred in his finding of law that the agreement in question was void for champerty.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">The master\u2019s finding is as follows: \u201c Findings of Law. ... I find that the said agreement is void for champerty. It is a contract by the defendants to prosecute a suit at law for a percentage of the proceeds. There is no indication that there was to be any compensation in case of failure, and in case of success a debt for services was not in the contemplation of the parties. The provision as to lien was inserted to give the defendants a more secure hold on the proceeds.,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">The parties reduced their agreement to writing, and we agree with the master in the construction to be given to that agreement. The cases are reviewed in <em>Hadlock </em>v. Brooks, 178 Mass. 425, and nothing need be added here.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Apart from the objection that the defendants waived their demurrer (if the part of the answer relied on be taken to be a demurrer) by going to a hearing on the merits, there is nothing in the objection that the facts relied on as entitling the plaintiff to relief could have been set up as an equitable defence. That does not bar the plaintiff from obtaining relief in a court of equity if the court has jurisdiction. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>178 Mass. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">There is a jurisdiction in equity to relieve against a void contract made by a solicitor on the ground of constructive fraud, of which equity has jurisdiction. For an instance of the exercise of a similar jurisdiction see <em>Reynell </em>v. <em>Sprye, </em>1 De G., M. &amp; G. 660. See also <em>O'Brien </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>32 L. J. Ch. (N. S.) 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Since St. 1877, c. 178, now R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 1, this court has full equity jurisdiction. The cases are collected in <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>181 Mass. 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The allegation in the bill admitted by the answer \u201c that at the time of the execution of said agreement . . . [these defendants] . . . were acting as attorneys for the plaintiff in the matter of her said claim against the [other] defendants \u201d does not prevent this conclusion. The agreement covers the \u201cservices rendered and to be rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The plaintiff is not barred of her remedy as one <em>in pari delicto, </em>or who has not come into equity with clean hands. The money has not been paid to the attorneys and therefore it is not necessary to go so far as the court went in <em>Reynell </em>v. <em>Sprye, </em>1 De G., M. &amp; G. 660; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>34 Ark. 762; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>4 Cold. 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
