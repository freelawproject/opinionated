Writ dated November 15, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-13\">The declaration as amended alleged that the plaintiff being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of good reputation was nominated for the office of mayor of the city of New Bedford, and that the defendant did publicly and maliciously accuse the plaintiff of having sold his vote as a citizen at an election of the citizens of New Bedford, and thereby of having participated in the commission of the crime of bribery, by words spoken of and concerning the plaintiff substantially as follows: \u201c That\u2019s a great man \u201d (meaning the plaintiff) \u201c to nominate \u201d (meaning the plaintiff) \u201c who sold his \u201d (meaning the plaintiff\u2019s) \u201c vote \u201d (meaning thereby that the plaintiff, being a registered voter of the city of New Bedford, had sold his vote at an election of the citizens thereof). \u201cThat man Doyle sold his vote\u201d (meaning thereby the plaintiff had violated his suffrage). \u201c They\u2019ve got his name over there on the books \u201d (meaning thereby that the plaintiff had been guilty of selling his vote as an elector of New Bedford and that such sale was recorded).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">The declaration further alleged, that by reason of the publication of such false, scandalous and malicious words the plaintiff had been greatly injured in his good name and had been exposed to a prosecution for bribery, and had suffered great pain and anxiety of mind and was greatly injured in his candidacy for the office of mayor of the city of New Bedford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">The defendant demurred to the declaration, alleging, among other grounds of demurrer, that the words alleged to have been spoken did not by their natural import, or as connected with any state of facts alleged as existing at the time, charge or impute any crime or misdemeanor whatever, and were not slanderous <em>per se, </em>and that the amended declaration did not contain any sufficient allegation of special damage; also, that the amended declaration did not state a legal cause of action substantially in accordance with the rules contained in R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2Pl\">The defendant demurred to the declaration on different grounds, some of which it is unnecessary to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The declaration contains no proper averment of special damages to the plaintiff. It does not allege that the words were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>spoken of him in any office or occupation. It does not state how they caused him any special damage. When special damage is stated as a cause of action in slander, it is necessary to set forth the particulars of the damage sufficiently to enable the defendant to know what is relied on, so that he may properly prepare his defence. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>100 Mass. 194. <em>Morasse </em>v. <em>Broohu, </em>151 Mass. 567, 572. <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>5 Cush. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">As this action is not for a libel, but for a slander by spoken words, there can be no recovery in the absence of a plea and of proof of special damages, unless the words impute the commission of a crime. <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>97 Mass. 1. <em>Sillars </em>v. Collier, 151 Mass. 50. Odgers, Libel &amp; Slander, (3d ed.) 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The plaintiff is charged with having \u201c sold his vote.\u201d If we assume in his favor, without deciding, that upon the facts alleged in the declaration the words might be found to mean that he sold his vote at an election of citizens of New Bedford, we come to the question whether such a sale is a criminal offence under our laws. The plaintiff concedes that there is no statute which makes such a sale punishable in this Commonwealth. But he contends that it is a crime at common law, and that this part of the common law is still in force here.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Bribery at elections of members of parliament was an offence at common law in England, and so, probably, was bribery at municipal elections. 1 Bl. Com. 179. 1 Russ. Crimes, (6th ed.) 455. Whart. Crim. Law, \u00a7 1858. 1 Bish. Crim. Law, \u00a7 471. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>Burr. 1335. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Plympton, </em>Ld. Raym. 1377. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>73 Maine, 91. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silsbee, </em>9 Mass. 417. At common law, as well as under some of the English statutes, there seems to be no difference in liability between the giver and the taker of a bribe. Sts. 2 Geo. II. c. 24, \u00a7 7; 17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. 102. In this Commonwealth, our statutes punishing the giving of money for voting at elections have not made the receiver punishable. Pub. Sts. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 60, 61. Gen. Sts. c. 7, \u00a7 31. Assuming in favor of the plaintiff, that before the enactment of statutes on this subject, the receipt of money as an inducement to vote in a certain way at an election was punishable in this Commonwealth as a crime at common law, it becomes necessary to consider our legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">It is a recognized principle that the enactment of a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>which seems to have been intended to cover the whole subject to which it relates, impliedly repeals all existing statutes touching the subject and supersedes the common law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooley, </em>10 Pick. 37. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, 11 </em>Pick. 350. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Pick. 80. <em>Lakin </em>v. <em>Lakin, </em>2 Allen, 45, 46. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>105 Mass. 162. From time to time statutes have been enacted dealing with the subject of bribery at elections. In the later of these statutes the Legislature has attempted to cover the whole subject of elections, and especially the subject of offences in connection with elections. Chapter 11 of the Revised Laws is entitled, \u201c Of Elections.\u201d It contains four hundred and twenty-six sections covering one hundred and two pages. The general title \u201c Of Elections,\u201d is divided into forty-four sub-titles, of. which one is \u201c Corrupt Practices,\u201d one is \u201c Penalties upon Officers,\u201d one is \u201c Penalties upon Voters,\u201d and another is \u201cGeneral Penalties.\u201d Besides these, seven sections are devoted to the title, \u201c Inquests in Election Cases,\u201d which contain provisions for the discovery of violations of the law. The twenty-two sections relating to \u201c Corrupt Practices \u201d provide for the punishment of a great many differentoffences. The twenty-one sections dealing with \u201c Penalties upon Officers \u201d and \u201c Penalties upon Voters \u201d prescribe punishment by fine or imprisonment for twenty-one different offences. There are also thirty-four sections which prescribe \u201c General Penalties,\u201d each one of which creates a separate offence punishable by fine or imprisonment. Of these, \u00a7 415 is for \u201c Bribery at Elections,\u201d and \u00a7 414 is \u201c For Attempting to Influence Voter by Threats,\u201d etc. These sections prescribe punishment for one \u2022 who bribes or attempts to bribe, and for one who threatens a voter to influence his vote. The St. 1890, c. 423, from which most'of the provisions of the R. L. c. 11, relating to penalties, are taken, is entitled, \u201c An Act to revise the laws relating to elections.\u201d It seems pretty plain that the Legislature, in these statutes, intended to cover the whole subject of punishment for illegal voting and illegally influencing voting at elections, including as well improper conduct on the part of voters as improper conduct by bribery or otherwise on the part of those seeking to influence voting. After creating such a large number of punishable offences, going into such detail as to every kind of miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>duct, it is inconceivable that the Legislature intended to leave the common law in force as to any form of bribery at elections. It seems, rather, that in accordance with earlier statutes in this State, and statutes in other States, and the general practice in America, the Legislature thought it wise to deal with the purchase of votes through the prosecution and punishment of those who buy them, rather than through the punishment of the voter whose action is improperly influenced by the receipt of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We are of opinion that the statutes referred to supersede the common law in regard to bribery at elections, and that the language of the declaration does not charge the commission of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
