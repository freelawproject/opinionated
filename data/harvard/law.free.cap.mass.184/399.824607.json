[the plaintiff] with you, . . . and go right in the yard and play \u201d, the yard being shut in by a gate which was kept closed by a strong spring. After going into the yard to play, the children wandered off into the streets and the plaintiff was run over by a car of the defendant, when crossing a street on her way home. The defendant contended that there was no evidence of due care on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s sister who it contended was in charge of the plaintiff at the time of the accident. <em>Held, </em>that whether the plaintiff was under the charge of her older sister after they left the yard was at least a question for the jury, depending upon the nature of the permission given by the plaintiff\u2019s father.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\">Tort by an infant, by her father as her next friend, for personal injuries from being run over by a car of the defendant on Bedford Street in Fall River.

The father lived in a tenement to which was attached a large, roomy yard shut in by a gate which was kept closed by a strong spring. On the day in question he was at home, tapping the shoes of one of the children, and his wife was nursing the baby. After going into the yard to play, the children wandered off into the street and the plaintiff was run over by a car of the defendant while she was crossing Bedford Street on her way home.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The defendant asked the presiding judge to order a verdict for it \u201c on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury of due care on the part of Katie Mellen, [the older sister] the person who the defendant claims had the plaintiff in charge at the time of the accident.\u201d This was refused. The case was submitted to the jury under suitable instructions, to which no exception was taken and which are not set forth in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We are of opinion that it was at least a question for the jury whether, in the first place, the father exercised due care in letting the plaintiff play in the yard, and whether, in the second place, the plaintiff was under the charge of her older sister after they left the yard and went upon the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Of the first question there can be no doubt. In this case the yard was closed by a gate, and in that respect differs from <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston </em>Railroad, 180 Mass. 145, and comes within <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Quincy &amp; Boston Street </em>Railway, 163 Mass. 5. In addition, the plaintiff was put under the charge of her older sister while playing in the yard, and so the case is within cases like <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>100 Mass. 512, and <em>Collins </em>v. <em>South Boston </em>Railroad, 142 Mass. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The father testified that when the neighbor\u2019s daughter came in and asked the older sister to go and play, he said, \u201c You take Essie [the plaintiff] with you, . . . and go right in the yard and play.\u201d When the three children left the yard, it was at least a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>question for the jury whether the plaintiff continued to be under the charge of her older sister or was in the position of a child who has got out on the street without fault on the part of its parents and whose rights depend upon the exercise by it of that care which may reasonably be expected from children of its age, as in <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>158 Mass. 94; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>177 Mass. 191; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Hudner, </em>182 Mass. 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Whether the plaintiff continued to be under the charge of her sister when the children left the yard depends upon this: Did the father put the plaintiff under the charge of the older sister for the afternoon, with an injunction to stay in the yard, or was she allowed to play in the yard under the charge of the older sister? It was at least a question for the jury which was the true nature of the permission that the father gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">If the plaintiff\u2019s rights depended on the exercise by her of the care which may reasonably be expected from a child of her age, there was evidence for the jury that the plaintiff exercised due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">For these reasons we are of opinion that the plaintiff had a right to go to the jury on this ground, and for that reason the ruling requested was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
