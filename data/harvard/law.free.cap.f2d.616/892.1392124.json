JOHNSON, JR., GARZA, HENDERSON, REAVLEY, POLITZ, HATCHETT, ANDERSON, RANDALL, TATE, SAM D. JOHNSON and THOMAS A. CLARK, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<p id=\"b956-22\">BROWN, Circuit Judge, with whom TJO-FLAT, RUBIN and RANDALL, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-23\">It may seem incongruous that a thing ordinarily thought to be a procedural technicality should occupy the attention of the now 24 active Judges on this busy court or impose a like burden on certiorari to the Supreme Court. But this is much more than a question whether Special Interrogatories F.R.Civ.P. 49(a) (or their form) are to be used in preference to submission on a general verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-24\">This case is of exceptional importance because the issues it presents arise in every jury trial of a patent case. Submitting the obviousness issue to a jury for a general verdict, in the manner our previous decisions permit, appears to me to be inconsistent with the precept that \u201cthe ultimate question of patent validity is one of law.\u201d <em>Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). I, therefore, respectfully, dissent from the refusal to grant rehearing en banc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
