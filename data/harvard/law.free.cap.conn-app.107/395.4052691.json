The respondent was bom on August 14, 1982, to parents who fought often. The respondent\u2019s parents married when she was two years old and divorced when she was four years old. After her parents divorced, she lived with her mother and did not see her father again for about eleven years. The respondent\u2019s mother was very strict with her, which caused the respondent to become defiant. At age fifteen, she was admitted to Pond House, a partial hospitalization program for children at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London. She was discharged shortly thereafter due to her mother\u2019s refusal to visit with her and cooperate in a family therapy program. Before her discharge, the respondent was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was prescribed medication. After her discharge, the respondent was sent by her mother to live with her father in Florida. While in Florida, she became pregnant with Coby. The respondent reported to employees of the department of children and families (department) that she was unaware she was pregnant until twenty-one weeks into the pregnancy. Coby was bom prematurely at twenty-eight weeks and stayed in a hospital for sixty-two days. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>hospital made a referral concerning the respondent and Coby to Florida child protection services because of the respondent\u2019s young age and her limited parenting skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The respondent and Coby moved to Connecticut in August, 2000, and lived with the respondent\u2019s maternal grandparents for about thirteen months, after which the respondent obtained her own apartment. Shortly thereafter, the respondent met Michael H., and they married on November 11, 2001. In June, 2002, Michael H. ended their relationship and moved out. During a September, 2006 evaluation with Community Health Center, the respondent disclosed that Michael H. had been physically abusive toward her during their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In October, 2002, the department received a referral concerning the respondent and Coby from the New London housing authority. The referral indicated, among other things, that an inspection of the respondent\u2019s residence revealed that the premises were filthy and that numerous exotic and domestic pets were being sheltered in the home. The housing authority also reported that the family was being evicted for nonpayment of rent and serious unsanitary conditions in the home. The housing authority informed the department that there were dead animals and animal feces in the apartment, including animal feces near the crib.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The department investigated and substantiated the claims of physical neglect against the respondent. The respondent told the department that the conditions of the home were not a priority to her. Continued visits to the home by the department showed no improvement in the conditions. Specifically, on November 8 and 25, 2002, the department visited the home and found a foul order emanating from the apartment and garbage covering the apartment floor. It found Coby to be filthy and wearing a diaper that had not been changed for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>substantial period of time. The respondent thereafter refused to cooperate with the department\u2019s home visits or to remain in contact with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On December 16, 2002, a visit to the respondent\u2019s residence by the department and the Groton police department revealed deplorable conditions, which rendered the premises unsanitary and unsafe for Coby. In particular, there were dog feces on the floor near the crib as well as in other locations throughout the home, cigarette butts within Coby\u2019s reach, insufficient food in the home to make a meal and an open jar of peanut butter into which Coby had been sticking his hand and eating while the department was visiting the home. As a result of this visit, the commissioner executed a ninety-six hour hold on Coby. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">On December 19, 2002, the commissioner filed a neglect petition and a motion for an order of temporary custody due to inadequate shelter, deplorable home conditions and lack of appropriate supervision for Coby. On January 3, 2003, the motion was granted by the court on a finding that Coby was in immediate danger in his surroundings and that removal was necessary to ensure his safety. On April 23, 2003, the court adjudicated Coby neglected and committed him to the care and custody of the commissioner until further order from the court. At that time, the court found that the department had made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need to remove Coby from his home and further issued specific steps for the respondent to complete in order to facilitate the return of Coby to her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The court also ordered psychological and interactional evaluations of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On January 21,2005, the commissioner filed a petition for termination of parental rights. The petition alleged among other things that (1) the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the respondent and (2) the respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts. A contested hearing was held, and, on January 17,2007, the court granted the commissioner\u2019s petition and terminated the respondent\u2019s parental rights on the grounds alleged in the petition. It is from this judgment that the respondent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The respondent\u2019s first claim is that the court improperly found that the commissioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that she had failed to achieve the degree of rehabilitation required to avoid a termination of her parental rights. Specifically, the respondent claims that substantial compliance with four specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>steps ordered by the court and her full compliance with twelve other specific steps demonstrates that she achieved sufficient personal rehabilitation to allow her to assume a responsible position in her son\u2019s life.1 **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u201cA hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposition. ... In the adjudicatoiy phase, the trial court determines whether one of the statutoiy grounds for termination of parental rights [under \u00a7 17a-112 (j)] exists by clear and convincing evidence. If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, it proceeds to the dispositional phase. In the dispositional phase, the trial court determines whether termination is in the best interests of the child.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Sheena </em>I., 63 Conn. App. 713, 720-21, 778 A.2d 997 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u201cOn appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was legally correct and factually supported. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached . . . nor do we retry the case or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, on review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Gary B., </em>66 Conn. App. 286, 289, 784 A.2d 412 (2001). \u201cA determination by the trial court . . . that the evidence is clear and convincing that the parent has not rehabilitated herself will be disturbed only if that finding is not supported by the evidence and [is], in light of the evidence in the whole record, clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>In re Felicia D., </em>35 Conn. App. 490, 500, 646 A.2d 862, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 931, 649 A.2d 253 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u201cClear and convincing proof is a demanding standard denotfing] a degree of belief that lies between the belief that is required to find the truth or existence of the [fact in issue] in an ordinary civil action and the belief that is required to find guilt in a criminal prosecution. . . . [The burden] is sustained if evidence induces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief that the facts asserted are highly probably true, that the probability that they are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they are false or do not exist.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chernick </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>100 Conn. App. 276, 280, 917 A.2d 1042, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 919, 925 A.2d 1101 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. In applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a trial court, we keep constantly in mind that our function is not to decide factual issues de novo. Our authority, when reviewing the findings of a judge, is circumscribed by the deference we must give to decisions of the trier of fact, who is usually in a superior position to appraise and weigh the evidence. . . . The question for this court ... is not whether it would have made the findings the trial court did, but whether in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record it is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Ebony H., </em>68 Conn. App. 342, 348-49 n.4, 789 A.2d 1158 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">In the matter before us, the issue is one of personal rehabilitation by the respondent. General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u00a7 17a-112 (j) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he Superior Court . . . may grant a petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that . . . (B) the child . . . has been found by the Superior Court ... to have been neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding . . . and [the parent] has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u201cPersonal rehabilitation . . . refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent [and] requires the trial court to analyze the [parent\u2019s] rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time. . . . The statute does not require [a parent] to prove precisely when she will be able to assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life. Nor does it require her to prove that she will be able to assume full responsibility for her child, unaided by available support systems. It requires the court to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the level of rehabilitation she has achieved, if any, falls short of that which would reasonably encourage a belief that at some future date she can assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 706, 741 A.2d 873, reargument denied, 251 Conn. 924, 742 A.2d 364 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Coby was adjudicated a neglected child and was committed to the custody of the commissioner. The court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (j), ordered specific steps that the respondent must take in order to facilitate the return of Coby to her. See footnote 3. At the termination hearing, the court reviewed the respondent\u2019s compliance with the fifteen specific steps it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ordered. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent had complied with ten steps, failed to comply fully with four steps and found one step to be inapplicable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In regard to the four steps the respondent failed to complete, the court found that the respondent, prior to and after the child\u2019s commitment, failed to comply with the requirements set by or with the department, failed to participate fully in parenting and individual counseling, was discharged unsuccessfully from Integrated Behavioral Health<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> due to noncompliance with treatment, failed to maintain stable housing or stable employment and has lived a transient existence, has been unable to keep up with her rental payment and has completed virtually none of her various referrals for counseling in a timely manner. In summary, the court found that the respondent has not been available to take part effectively in her son\u2019s life due to mental health issues, gross parenting defects, poor judgment, residential instability and failure to benefit from counseling. On the basis of clear and convincing evidence, the court found that the respondent has failed to achieve rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 and that it is not foreseeable that the respondent is capable of achieving rehabilitation within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The respondent argues that she fully complied with twelve of the fifteen steps ordered by the court. She further argues that she substantially complied with the other steps and that her substantial compliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>these steps fulfills the compliance mandate. Accordingly, the respondent believes that the court\u2019s conclusion that rehabilitation has not been achieved and would not be achieved in a reasonable time is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">As we stated in the standard of review, we will not overturn a court\u2019s determination that the evidence is clear and convincing unless the finding is not supported by the evidence and is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the whole record. <em>In re Felicia D., </em>supra, 35 Conn. App. 500. In a termination of parental rights case, the court is the trier of fact. \u201cWe defer to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. The trier is the judge of the credibility of all the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, and may accept part, all or none of the testimony. . . . Where, as here, the record reveals that the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusions are supported by clear and convincing evidence, we will not reach an opposite conclusion on the basis of any one segment of the many factors considered in a termination proceeding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Victoria B., </em>79 Conn. App. 245, 262-63, 829 A.2d 855 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The court\u2019s memorandum of decision reflects a careful and extensive review of the evidence on which it relied in the adjudicatory phase of the termination proceeding. The court found, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent had failed to comply fully with four specific steps.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>memorandum of decision credits the respondent for her attempts to comply fully with the specific steps but, nevertheless, concludes that she has failed to achieve personal rehabilitation and that she is incapable of providing a safe and nurturing environment for Coby. Although there is no clear directive as to what constitutes \u201ccompliance\u201d with court-ordered steps, it is clear that the failure to comply with specific steps typically weighs heavily in termination proceedings. <em>In re Devon B., </em>264 Conn. 572, 584, 825 A.2d 127 (2003). The respondent\u2019s claim that her \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with those four steps fulfills the compliance mandate is unavailing. Her claim merely places a positive label on the court\u2019s negative findings without altering the substance of those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Whether the respondent\u2019s shortcomings are deemed substantial compliance or noncompliance, the evidence in the record as a whole supports the court\u2019s conclusion that the respondent has failed to achieve rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 and that it is not foreseeable that she is capable of rehabilitation within a reasonable time. We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s determination that the respondent\u2019s parental rights should be terminated was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The respondent\u2019s next claim is that the court\u2019s written findings were legally insufficient to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 17a-112 (k). Specifically, she claims that the written findings contain no express finding regarding Coby\u2019s disruption from his preadoptive placement and, therefore, render clearly erroneous the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was in Coby\u2019s best interest. We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Having found that a statutory ground for termination exists in the adjudicatory phase of the hearing to terminate parental rights, the court then proceeds to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>dispositional phase and decides whether termination is in the best interest of the child. See <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>39 Conn. App. 353, 360, 664 A.2d 1168 (1995). \u201cIn the dispositional phase of a termination of parental rights hearing, the trial court must determine whether it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the continuation of the parents\u2019 parental rights is not in the best interests of the child. In arriving at that decision, the court is mandated to consider and make written findings regarding seven factors delineated in General Statutes [\u00a7 17a-112 (k)].\u201d <em>In re Denzel A., </em>53 Conn. App. 827, 833, 733 A.2d 298 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The respondent does not allege that the court\u2019s written findings are deficient with regard to all seven statutory factors. The respondent\u2019s claim is limited to the fourth statutory factor and, more specifically, to that portion of the fourth factor mandating the court to make written findings regarding \u201cany person who has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (k) (4). The respondent asserts that the court was required to make a finding concerning Coby\u2019s emotional ties to his preadoptive foster family and that absent such a written finding, the court\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">At the outset, we note our agreement with the respondent that a court may, in certain instances, be required to make written findings concerning a child\u2019s emotional ties to his preadoptive family. In particular, such a finding is required when a child has developed significant emotional ties to his preadoptive family and that family has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (k) (4). We further agree with the respondent that no such written finding was made in this case. Contraiy to the claims in the respondent\u2019s brief, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>absence of a written finding regarding Coby\u2019s preadoptive foster family does not require a conclusion that the court made an unwarranted departure from the requirements of \u00a7 17a-112 (k) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The court is not required to make written findings in regard to the child\u2019s emotional ties to all persons. Section 17a-112 (k) (4) explicitly requires a written finding regarding the child\u2019s emotional ties only as to those individuals who have \u201cexercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (k) (4). The record before us, however, is inadequate to determine whether the court was required to make a written finding regarding Coby\u2019s emotional ties to his preadoptive family. Likewise, the record does not reveal the court\u2019s basis for its omission of such a written finding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">It is not our function to speculate as to why the court failed to make a written finding regarding Coby\u2019s emotional ties to his preadoptive foster family. Whatever the reason for the court\u2019s omission, the respondent failed to raise this issue with the trial court. Accordingly, the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, did not address Coby\u2019s emotional ties to his preadoptive family. The respondent also failed to file a motion for articulation with this court to rectify this omission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Under Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, this court \u201cshall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . .\u201d Although we recognize that a mother has a fundamental constitutional right to retain her relationship with her child that can be severed only in strict compliance with applicable statutory standards, \u201cwe have regularly observed that the rule of [Practice Book] \u00a7 4185 [now \u00a7 60-5] applies to constitutional claims.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Romance M., </em>229 Conn. 345, 352, 641 A.2d 378 (1994). \u201c[0]nly in [the] most exceptional circumstances can and will this court consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised and decided in the trial court. . . . Such exceptional circumstances may occur where a new and unforeseen constitutional right has arisen between the time of trial and appeal or where the record supports a claim that a litigant has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. ... An exception may also be made where consideration of the question is in the interest of public welfare or of justice between the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 352-53. In the present case, the respondent has referred us to no such exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, we decline to review the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-10\"> The parental rights of the child\u2019s father were also terminated at the same hearing.
