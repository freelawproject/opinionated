The substantial gap in time between the dissolution judgment and the rendering of the judgments that are the subject of this appeal was caused when the pro se defendant, Bonnie Rubenstein, removed herself and the parties\u2019 minor son from this jurisdiction from 1997 until 2002. In AC 28298, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) improperly entered an award of lifetime alimony because it (a) failed to consider and to apply the statutory factors set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 and (b) erroneously found that she was at fault for causing the debt of the pro se plaintiff, Jeffrey Rubenstein, and (2) was biased against her. In AC 27634, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) awarded guardian ad litem fees that were excessive and unreasonable, and (2) precluded evidence of fault during the apportionment hearing as to those fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our discussion. In March, 1996, the plaintiff filed an action seeking to dissolve the parties\u2019 three and one-half year marriage. In September, 1997, while the dissolution action was pending, the defendant removed the parties\u2019 minor son from Connecticut in derogation of the court\u2019s orders. Shortly thereafter, the court appointed attorney Susan M. Asselin-Connolly guardian ad litem for the child. A few months after the disappearance of the defendant, on December 5, 1997, the court, <em>Hon. Hadley W. Austin, </em>judge trial referee, dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage and, after finding that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>had accumulated considerable debt in the search for his son, ordered the defendant to pay alimony and child support to the plaintiff. The alimony order stated specifically that \u201c[t]he defendant shall pay to the plaintiff the amount of $50 per week as alimony, without prejudice.\u201d The whereabouts of the defendant and the child were not known until 2002, when they were discovered by federal law enforcement officers and returned to Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Following the defendant\u2019s return to the jurisdiction, both parties filed motions to modify the December, 1997 alimony and child support award. Following a July 11, 2006 hearing at which both parties testified, the court, <em>Gordon, J., </em>on November 16, 2006, filed a memorandum of decision construing the parties\u2019 motions to modify as motions for de novo review of the alimony order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court concluded that \u201c[b]oth the plaintiff and the defendant have good earning capacities, but the plaintiffs financial situation was more dire, and moreover, it was caused by the conduct of the defendant. It is only equitable that she assist his support through a continuing order of alimony. Therefore, the court [orders that] the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff, as alimony, $50 per week until the death of either party. ... All arrearages previously found are therefore still valid . . . .\u201d The defendant thereafter filed an appeal challenging the court\u2019s de novo alimony order.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Prior to the parties\u2019 motions to modify, the guardian ad litem had filed a motion seeking costs and fees and an affidavit of debt detailing an outstanding sum of $78,542.30 yet to be paid. On January 6, 2006, the court, <em>Boland, J., </em>filed interlocutory orders on fees for the attorney for the minor child and of the guardian ad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>litem in which it concluded that the guardian ad litem was entitled to fees totaling $77,208.30 but expressly left the allocation of the fees between the parties for a later determination in light of the plaintiffs bankruptcy proceedings. On March 28, 2006, an allocation hearing was held at which the court, <em>Gordon, J., </em>rendered an oral decision in which the court, inter alia, \u201c[divided] responsibility for both the attorney\u2019s fees and guardian ad litem\u2019s fees, two-thirds attributable to [the defendant], one-third attributable to [the plaintiff].\u201d The defendant subsequently filed an appeal challenging the allocation and reasonableness of the award of fees to the guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">AC 28298</p>\n<p id=\"ANK\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The defendant first challenges the de novo lifetime alimony order rendered by the court as well as the factual basis underlying that order. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding alimony and that its findings are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review. \u201cAn appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented. . . . In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s findings of fact is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review. The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>record as a whole. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivnak </em>v. <em>Rivnak, </em>99 Conn. App. 326, 328-29, 913 A.2d 1096 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u201cA fundamental principle in dissolution actions is that a trial court may exercise broad discretion in awarding alimony and dividing property as long as it considers all relevant statutory criteria. ... In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision under [an abuse of discretion] standard, we are cognizant that [t]he issues involving financial orders are entirely interwoven. The rendering of judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kunajukr </em>v. <em>Kunajukr, </em>83 Conn. App. 478, 481, 850 A.2d 227, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 903, 859 A.2d 562 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion when it failed to consider and to apply the statutory factors set forth in \u00a7 46b-82. The defendant argues that several factors were ignored and that \u201cthe factors that were considered took place after the divorce proceedings and are irrelevant and not in accordance with the alimony guidelines.\u201d The defendant also asserts that the court\u2019s consideration of the plaintiffs debt in crafting its orders was improper under the guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u201cTrial courts are vested with broad and liberal discretion in fashioning orders concerning the type, duration and amount of alimony and support, applying in each case the guidelines of the General Statutes.\u201d <em>Hartney </em>v. <em>Hartney, </em>83 Conn. App. 553, 559, 850 A.2d 1098, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 920, 859 A.2d 578 (2004). General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> describes factors a court should consider in its decisions regarding alimony. \u201cThe court must consider all of these criteria. ... It need not, however, make explicit reference to the statutory criteria that it considered in making its decision or make express finding[s] as to each statutory factor. . . . Nor need it give each factor equal weight.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Noyes-Dombrowski, </em>273 Conn. 127, 137, 869 A.2d 164 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that it \u201cconsidered all the evidence and statutory criteria contained in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 . . . .\u201d It found that \u201c[t]he plaintiff, in a search for his child, taken and hidden in contravention of court orders by the defendant, incurred monumental debt. The testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>of the defendant as to the reasons for the breakdown of the marriage is not credible. Both the plaintiff and the defendant have good earning capacities, but the plaintiffs financial situation was more dire, and moreover, it was caused by the conduct of the defendant.\u201d The court also emphasized that it was not retroactively modifying the alimony order to take into account subsequent changes in the plaintiffs financial circumstances, which would be \u201ccontrary to law,\u201d but rather reviewing the order de novo, as \u201cprovided for in the [original] judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The court is not required to make explicit reference to the statutory criteria that it considered in making its decision or to make express findings as to each statutory factor. <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Noyes-Dombrowski, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 137. Here, the court expressly noted its consideration of the statutory criteria set forth in \u00a7 46b-82 and mentioned its findings as to several of those criteria in its memorandum of decision. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s argument that the court ignored several factors is unavailing. The defendant\u2019s assertion that the court impermissibly considered the debt the plaintiff incurred in the search for his child also is without merit. The court\u2019s finding in that regard is a reflection of the court\u2019s previous December 5, 1997 finding, which it communicated at a hearing held on the same day that the original alimony order was issued.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As to any debt the plaintiff incurred after the original December, 1997 alimony order, the court specifically underscored that it was not retroactively modifying the judgment due to any substantial change in the financial circumstances of the plaintiff. The court specifically noted that its \u201creview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>must take the place of the original proceeding.\u201d Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion in crafting its alimony order when it ignored the \u201ctremendous debt [she incurred] due to the plaintiffs behavior.\u201d The defendant further argues that the court wrongfully blamed her for the plaintiffs financial situation. We interpret the defendant\u2019s argument as an invitation to review the court\u2019s finding that her testimony was not credible. We decline that invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\"><em>11 It is the sole province of the trial court to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doody </em>v. Doody, 99 Conn. App. 512, 519-20, 914 A.2d 1058 (2007). It \u201chas the advantage of viewing and assessing the demeanor, attitude and credibility of the witnesses and is therefore better equipped than we to assess the circumstances surrounding the dissolution action. \u201d <em>Palazzo </em>v. <em>Palazzo, </em>9 Conn. App. 486, 488, 519 A.2d 1230 (1987). The court is therefore free to reject testimony it does not find credible. <em>Emanuelson </em>v. <em>Emanuelson, </em>26 Conn. App. 527, 532, 602 A.2d 609 (1992). Here, we find nothing in the record to undermine our confidence in the court\u2019s fact-finding process. Therefore, we defer to the court\u2019s sound judgment in making its observations of the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses, including the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">The defendant next claims that the court was prejudiced against her when it found that she was at fault for the plaintiffs financial situation. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201cAccusations of judicial bias or misconduct implicate the basic concepts of a fair trial. . . . The appearance as well as the actuality of [partiality] on the part of the trier will suffice to constitute proof of bias sufficient to warrant disqualification. . . . Canon 3 (c) (1) provides in relevant part: A judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (A) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party .... To prevail on [his] claim of a violation of this canon, the [defendant] need not show actual bias. The [defendant] has met [his] burden if [he] can prove that the conduct in question gave rise to a reasonable appearance of impropriety.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>88 Conn. App. 246, 258, 869 A.2d 239 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The defendant has not cited anything in the record that demonstrates the court\u2019s bias against her. To support her claim, the defendant specifically refers to the court\u2019s observation that \u201c[t]hat\u2019s her fault.\u201d That statement, however, pertained to the court\u2019s discussion of the alimony arrearage and its finding that the defendant had notice of the alimony order, despite her claims to the contrary. The defendant has not met the burden of proof required to prevail on a claim of judicial impropriety, and we find no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">AC 27634</p>\n<p id=\"AX6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Before considering the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims in AC 27634, we briefly address the guardian ad litem\u2019s assertion that the defendant\u2019s appeal from the March 28, 2006 judgment is untimely. The appeal form states that the defendant is appealing from the \u201cfinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>judgment of award [to the] guardian ad litem [of] fees.\u201d The guardian ad litem claims that the appeal from that judgment is untimely because the defendant should have appealed from an earlier, November 18,2005 order granting the guardian ad litem\u2019s motion in limine for preclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The guardian ad litem, however, failed to file a motion to dismiss within ten days of the filing of the defendant\u2019s appeal, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 66-8.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, she waived her right to seek dismissal of the defendant\u2019s appeal as untimely.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Machado, </em>83 Conn. App. 183, 185 n.3, 850 A.2d 260 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly awarded guardian ad litem fees that were excessive and unreasonable. She also claims that the court improperly precluded evidence of fault during the apportionment hearing as to those fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">As we already have noted, \u201c[a]n appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Prial </em>v. <em>Prial, </em>67 Conn. App. 7, 9-10, 787 A.2d 50 (2001). \u201cThe court may order either party to pay the fees for [a] guardian ad litem pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62, and how such expenses will be paid is within the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Ruggiero </em>v. <em>Ruggiero, </em>76 Conn. App. 338, 347-48, 819 A.2d 864 (2003). \u201c[W]e may not alter an award of attorney\u2019s fees unless the trial court has clearly abused its discretion, for the trial court is in the best position to evaluate the circumstances of each case. . . . Because the trial court is in the best position to evaluate the circumstances of each case, we will not substitute our opinion concerning counsel fees or alter an award of attorney\u2019s fees unless the trial court has clearly abused its discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LaMontagne </em>v. <em>Musano, Inc., </em>61 Conn. App. 60, 64, 762 A.2d 508 (2000). \u201cAn abuse of discretion in granting [guardian ad litem] fees will be found only if [an appellate court] determines that the trial court could not reasonably have concluded as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sachs </em>v. <em>Sachs, </em>60 Conn. App. 337, 347-48, 759 A.2d 510 (2000); see also <em>Lamacchia </em>v. <em>Chilinsky, </em>79 Conn. App. 372, 375, 830 A.2d 329 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The defendant first claims that the court\u2019s award of fees to the guardian ad litem was unreasonable and excessive. She specifically challenges the guardian ad litem\u2019s claim for twenty-seven straight hours of service, the time claimed for the services of the guardian ad litem\u2019s associates, the rate charged for the guardian ad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>litem\u2019s time spent in Juvenile Court and the guardian ad litem\u2019s claims for time spent performing \u201cnonguardian ad litem legal tasks and duties . . . .\u201d The defendant also asserts that \u201csome of the guardian ad litem\u2019s time was spent wastefully and needlessly and should be disallowed.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. In its January 6, 2006 interlocutory orders on fees for the attorney for the minor child and of the guardian ad litem, the court began its resolution of the guardian ad litem\u2019s claim by detailing the extraordinary nature of this case. The court noted specifically that during the five year period that the defendant and the child were outside the jurisdiction, \u201cthe guardian ad litem made numerous attempts at locating her ward, even involving international police authorities. When the child (then eight years old) was located in Florida, she made a rapid trip there to accompany him back to this forum and [to] avoid his being treated as an abandoned child in that state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The court then made findings associated with the time ledger sheets that the guardian ad litem attached to her affidavit of debt. It noted that \u201c[h]er time sheets show that in those almost six years of service, she and her associate counsel recorded approximately 374.75 hours on the file. She filed legal pleadings; communicated with the parties and their counsel, with members of the extended family and other witnesses, and with law enforcement and child protection officials; attended court proceedings; and kept herself prepared for the multidimensional task to which this court had appointed her. The court does not find that her documentation of these efforts is exaggerated. Further, the court notes that her services were reasonably effective, as the child has been located and returned here in part due to her work.\u201d The court examined the guardian ad litem\u2019s claimed billing rate, reviewed her lodestar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>calculations<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on the basis of the rates of attorneys in her area with similar experience and reduced her claim by $1330, concluding that she was entitled to fees totaling $77,208.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The court also addressed an argument the plaintiff had raised that the guardian ad litem should be paid at lower state rates for the several hours she spent at Juvenile Court. The court found that argument unpersuasive because the guardian ad litem\u2019s appearance at Juvenile Court was a function of her appointment \u201cby this court, not a separate appointment by that tribunal.\u201d It added that \u201cthe reasonableness of her fee request should be judged by the standards typically employed in this forum, and this court has weighed her request in light of the multiple factors which our appellate court, in <em>Ernst </em>v. <em>Deere &amp; Co., </em>92 Conn. App. 572 [576, 886 A.2d 845] (2005), has recently said are pertinent in setting such fees . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Last, in response to a motion filed by the defendant for an articulation of the January 6, 2006 order, the court, <em>Boland, J., </em>issued a memorandum of decision clarifying its earlier order. In reply to the defendant\u2019s questions regarding the guardian ad litem\u2019s time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>claimed for \u201cnonlegal work,\u201d in addition to the appropriate rate to be charged for such services, the court stated that \u201chowever \u2018legal work\u2019 is defined, the court did award her an hourly rate of $200 for some of her time spent upon \u2018other than legal work.\u2019 In probably every case, even an attorney serving qua attorney does work that is not strictly \u2018legal work,\u2019 including, but not limited to, fact investigation, education about the details and significance of those facts, communication with third parties who might have a role in the case, travel to court, etc.\u201d After referencing several Superior Court cases on the subject, the court concluded that \u201cthe hourly rate approved here is well in line with the amount which other courts have awarded to other counsel serving as guardians ad litem in recent years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Our Supreme Court consistently has noted that \u201c[trial] courts have a general knowledge of what would be reasonable compensation for services which are fairly stated and described.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shapero </em>v. <em>Mercede, </em>262 Conn. 1, 9, 808 A.2d 666 (2002). Because of this general knowledge, \u201c[t]he court [is] in a position to evaluate the complexity of the issues presented and the skill with which counsel had dealt with these issues.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Kirshner, </em>225 Conn. 185, 201, 621 A.2d 1326 (1993). \u201cWhile the decision as to the liability for payment of such fees can be made in the absence of any evidence of the cost of the work performed . . . the dollar amount of such an award must be determined to be reasonable after an appropriate evidentiary showing.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Panganiban </em>v. <em>Panganiban, </em>54 Conn. App. 634, 644, 736 A.2d 190, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 920, 742 A.2d 359 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We conclude that under the circumstances of this unusual, lengthy and complicated appointment, the fees awarded to the guardian ad litem were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The court carefully considered the time sheets submitted by the guardian ad litem in relation to the services she performed, compared her billing rate to the comparable rate of attorneys of similar experience in her area and weighed her requests pursuant to \u201cthe standards typically employed in this forum . . . .\u201d After noting that this case was \u201canything but routine,\u201d the court engaged in a thorough analysis of the fees claimed before awarding an amount it deemed reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">As to the specific challenges raised by the defendant, we agree with the court\u2019s assessment that the guardian ad litem\u2019s appearance in Juvenile Court was a function of her original appointment by the court in 1997 and that the court properly rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that a lower billing rate was warranted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We likewise agree that any \u201cnonlegal work\u201d claimed by the guardian ad litem was a small portion of the total work performed and that because practically every case involves the performance of some services that are not strictly \u201clegal\u201d in nature, the court did not abuse its discretion. The defendant\u2019s other assertions concerning the guardian ad litem\u2019s allegedly questionable billing records are equally without merit. The guardian ad litem\u2019s role in this case went far beyond the role assigned in a typical child custody case and, consequently, involved significantly more effort for the guardian ad litem and any staff assisting her. Specifically, the guardian ad litem\u2019s claim as to the twenty-seven consecutive hours pertains to her flight to Florida to return the minor child to Connecticut. We agree with the court that under the circumstances of this case, such a claim was not an exaggeration. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>that the guardian ad litem was entitled to fees totaling $77,208.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The defendant claims finally that the court improperly precluded evidence of fault during the apportionment hearing as to the guardian ad litem fees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. On November 18, 2005, the court, <em>Swienton, J., </em>granted the guardian ad litem\u2019s motion to preclude evidence of postdissolution fault in the determination of the allocation of fees between the parties.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On March 28, 2006, an allocation hearing was held at which both parties submitted financial affidavits at the request of the court and testified regarding their current financial statuses and capabilities. Before the testimony began, the court, <em>Gordon, J., </em>reiterated that evidence of postdissolution fault was precluded at the hearing. The court then rendered an oral decision, on the basis of the earning capacities of each party, inter alia, \u201c[dividing] responsibility for both the attorney\u2019s fees and the guardian ad litem\u2019s fees, two-thirds attributable to [the defendant], one-third attributable to [the plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u201cThe order for payment of [guardian ad litem] fees under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 requires consideration of the financial resources of both parties and the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lamacchia </em>v. <em>Chilinsky, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 376. Section 46b-82 instructs the court to consider, inter alia, \u201cthe causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability [and the] estate and needs of each of the parties . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The additional criterion sought to be considered by the defendant, namely, postdissolution fault, is not a factor included among those enumerated in \u00a7 46b-82.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As already noted, the order for payment of guardian ad litem fees \u201crequires consideration of the financial resources of both parties and the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lamacchia </em>v. <em>Chilinsky, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 376. There is no requirement, however, to consider any additional factors or evidence deemed relevant by any of the parties. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in precluding evidence of postdissolution fault at the allocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The plaintiff likewise argues that the court\u2019s allocation of fees was improper. We decline to review the plaintiffs claim because he failed to file a cross appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-8; <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Charter Oak Terrace/Rice Heights Health Center, Inc., </em>82 Conn. App. 18, 19 n.1, 842 A.2d 601 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> Specifically, the court stated: \u201cWhile the plaintiff has filed a motion to modify the alimony award entered, the motion is mistitled in light of the relief sought, and the court therefore construes it as a motion for a de novo review of the alimony award.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\"> Intertwined with the defendant\u2019s claim concerning the application of the alimony guidelines is an argument that the court improperly limited her testimony and did not allow her to introduce some evidence showing that the plaintiff was abusive and caused the breakdown of the marriage. The record reveals, however, that the defendant was permitted to testify as to her account of the breakdown of the marriage, including the alleged abusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>conduct of the plaintiff that purportedly led to her actions in leaving the country with her son. The court did not credit her testimony in this regard, as it stated explicitly in its memorandum of decision, and we do not second-guess the trial court\u2019s assessment of credibility.
