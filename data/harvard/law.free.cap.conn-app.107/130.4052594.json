The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>claims that the court improperly (1) disbursed the proceeds of the foreclosure sale and (2) calculated the amount of deficiency judgment owed to the plaintiff. We reverse the judgment with respect to the first claim and dismiss that portion of the appeal involving the second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The roots of this appeal can be traced to a series of judgment liens obtained by the plaintiff in 1988 and 1989 against James A. Becker.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These hens attached to Becker\u2019s one-half interest in a parcel of real estate that he and his then wife, the defendant Judith Becker, owned as joint tenants. On October 30, 1992, the plaintiff filed an action to foreclose on those liens. Years of contentious litigation ensued, and not until November 13, 2004, did the foreclosure sale occur. On July 12, 2006, the court ordered disbursement of the sale proceeds. This appeal fohowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The plaintiff first claims that the court failed to disburse properly the proceeds of the November 13, 2004 foreclosure sale. He advances five separate arguments in support of this claim. He argues that the court improperly (1) deducted an attorney\u2019s fee award from the overall foreclosure sale proceeds, (2) denied his request for postjudgment interest on this attorney\u2019s fee award, (3) denied his request for an additional postjudgment attorney\u2019s fee award, (4) calculated the amount of committee fees to be deducted from the foreclosure sale proceeds and (5) disbursed a portion of the foreclosure sale proceeds to a fellow lienholder. We will review each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Disbursement of Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The plaintiff first argues that the court improperly deducted a prior attorney\u2019s fee award from the overall foreclosure sale proceeds, as opposed to solely from the defendant\u2019s portion of those proceeds. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the plaintiffs argument. On January 5, 1995, the plaintiffs foreclosure action was tried before an attorney trial referee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 7, 1995, the referee filed her report recommending foreclosure. On November 2, 1995, the court rendered judgment in accordance with the referee\u2019s recommendation. On September 13, 1996, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to intervene as a party defendant in order to grant her an opportunity to redeem the property. The court, however, specifically precluded the defendant \u201cfrom relitigating . . . any . . . matters which are the law of the case\u201d due to the fact that she had had knowledge of the case for more than two years prior to her moving to intervene. Over the course of the next two years, the plaintiff sought to effectuate the foreclosure, only to have his attempts forestalled by various defenses asserted by the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">James Becker and the defendant were divorced in 1994. In connection with their divorce, James Becker transferred his one-half interest in the subject property to the defendant. Shortly thereafter, two mortgages on the property, both superior in right to the liens of the plaintiff, were assigned to Jeanne Altschul, the mother of the attorney representing the defendant in this matter, as trustee. Following the assignments, the defendant ceased making payments on these mortgages, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Altschul began paying applicable taxes on the property. The plaintiff thereafter filed a second amended complaint,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> adding allegations of fraud and conspiracy against the defendant and Altschul.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">A second trial before an attorney trial referee was conducted between December, 2000, and January, 2001. Upon the completion of this trial, the defendant and Altschul moved to dismiss the plaintiffs second amended complaint. They claimed that because the plaintiff had failed to follow the procedures of the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-604 et seq., in recording liens awarded pursuant to a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. In his June 11, 2001 report, the attorney trial referee recommended judgment in favor of the plaintiff with respect to the fraud and conspiracy claims, as well as with respect to the motion to dismiss. The referee also recommended that the plaintiff be awarded attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-350f,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>for work performed between the time of the November 2, 1995 judgment, which had initially authorized foreclosure, and the date of the filing of the most recent attorney trial referee report. In support of this recommendation, the referee found that the litigation occurring during this time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>amounted to postjudgment procedures involving defenses advanced solely for the purpose of delay. The referee further recommended that \u201cJeanne Altschul and [the defendant] should pay [the plaintiffs] attorney\u2019s fees personally, since their defense was solely for the purpose of delay.\u201d On January 14, 2002, the court rendered judgment in accordance with the June 11, 2001 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">After the foreclosure sale occurred on November 13, 2004, the court ordered the distribution of the foreclosure sale proceeds in its July 12, 2006 memorandum of decision. In this memorandum, the court ordered that the January 14, 2002 attorney\u2019s fee award be deducted from the overall sale proceeds, rather than solely from the defendant\u2019s portion. The parties now contest the interpretation of the January 14, 2002 judgment. The defendant argues that that judgment ordered the court to deduct the attorney\u2019s fee award from the foreclosure sale proceeds in the manner in which it did; the plaintiff argues that that judgment ordered the court to deduct the attorney\u2019s fee award solely from the defendant\u2019s portion of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Our analysis involves interpretation of the January 14, 2002 judgment. \u201cThe law of judgments ... is well settled. The construction of a judgment is a question of law with the determinative factor being the intent of the court as gathered from all parts of the judgment. ... As a general rule, the court should construe [a] judgment as it would construe any document or written contract in evidence before it. . . . Effect must be given to that which is clearly implied as well as to that which is expressed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mazziotti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>240 Conn. 799, 806-807, 695 A.2d 1010 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Our review of the January 14, 2002 judgment leads us to conclude that the only reasonable interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>that judgment is that the attorney\u2019s fee award contained therein was intended to be a personal obligation of the defendant and Altschul. The January 14,2002 memorandum of decision provides in relevant part: \u201cThe attorney trial referee concluded that . . . the Beckers and Jeanne Altschul, trustee, were obligated to pay the plaintiffs legal fees . . . because the defenses interposed by those defendants were solely for the purposes of delay . . . .\u201d The memorandum further provides: \u201cThe issue of applicability of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-350f and 52-400c is resolved in favor of the plaintiff because it is the function of the trial court to determine whether the defenses presented by the defendants were solely for delay, which is a question of fact. . . . The attorney trial referee determined as a matter of fact that the defenses maintained by the defendant were solely for the purpose of delaying the plaintiff . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Despite the memorandum\u2019s reference to \u201cthe Beckers\u201d as being liable for attorney\u2019s fees, the only \u201cdefendants\u201d who had interposed postjudgment defenses, and thus would be eligible to have been taxed with an attorney\u2019s fee award pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-350f and 52-400c, were the defendant and Altschul. Furthermore, the referee unambiguously stated in his June 11, 2001 report, on which the January 14, 2002 judgment had been rendered, that \u201cJeanne Altschul and [the defendant] should pay [the plaintiffs] attorney\u2019s fees and costs personally, since their defense was solely for the purpose of delay.\u201d We therefore conclude that the only reasonable interpretation of the January 14, 2002 judgment is that the defendant and Altschul, as opposed to James Becker, were to be hable for the attorney\u2019s fee award contained therein. It follows that that award was to be deducted from the defendant\u2019s portion of the foreclosure sale proceeds. As the court failed to do so, we must reverse the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Postjudgment Interest on Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The plaintiff next argues that the court improperly denied his request to assess postjudgment interest on the attorney\u2019s fees awarded in the January 14, 2002 judgment. We decline to review this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for our analysis. After the foreclosure sale had occurred, the plaintiff requested in his November 16, 2005 motion for an order of disbursement an assessment of postjudgment interest on the January 14, 2002 attorney\u2019s fee award, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court ruled on the plaintiffs motion in its July 12, 2006 memorandum of decision. Nowhere in that July 12,2006 memorandum of decision did the court discuss, or indeed even mention, the plaintiffs request for interest on the January 14, 2002 attorney\u2019s fee award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Although \u201c[o]ur rules of practice require that the trial court state its decision on each issue in the case and its conclusion as to each issue in the case and its conclusions as to each claim of law raised by the parties . . . [i]t remains the appellant\u2019s responsibility to furnish an adequate appellate record.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cottiero </em>v. <em>Ifkovic, </em>35 Conn. App. 682, 685-86, 647 A.2d 9, cert. denied, 231 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>938, 651 A.2d 262 (1994). Thus, the failure of a litigant to file a motion for articulation upon a court\u2019s failure to rule on a claim vitiates appellate review of the claim. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5; <em>LaPenta </em>v. <em>Bank One, N.A., </em>101 Conn. App. 730, 738, 924 A.2d 868, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 905, 931 A.2d 264 (2007); <em>Cottiero </em>v. <em>Ifkovic, </em>supra, 685-86; <em>Gennarini Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Messina Painting &amp; Decorating Co., </em>5 Conn. App. 61, 66, 496 A.2d 539 (1985); W. Horton &amp; K. Bartschi, Connecticut Practice Series: Connecticut Rules of Appellate Procedure (2007 Ed.) \u00a7 66-5, authors\u2019 comments, p. 177. Such is the case here. The court failed to rule on the plaintiffs request for an award of postjudgment interest, yet the plaintiff failed to file a motion for articulation asking the court to address the overlooked matter. Accordingly, we decline to review the plaintiffs argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Postjudgment Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The plaintiff similarly argues that the court improperly denied his request for additional attorney\u2019s fees recompensing litigation expenses incurred after the January 14, 2002 judgment. The plaintiff argues that the court improperly determined that no statutory authority existed that would justify such an award. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The plaintiff, in his November 16, 2005 motion for an order of disbursement, requested an award of postjudgment attorney\u2019s fees<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-350\u00cd, 52-400c and 52-249.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court, in its July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>12, 2006 memorandum of decision ruled as follows: \u201cAlthough the plaintiffs counsel worked long and hard on this case and successfully also, there is no statutory or other authority to warrant the imposition of legal fees in addition to the $27,705 previously awarded in the January 14, 2002 memorandum of decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u201cConnecticut adheres to the American rule, which provides that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Young </em>v. <em>Vlahos, </em>103 Conn. App. 470, 479, 929 A.2d 362 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 913, 943 A.2d 474 (2008). If warranted, \u201c[t]he amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial court has abused its discretion. . . . Sound discretion, by definition, means a discretion that is not exercised arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and <em>the law.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. However, \u201canalysis of whether the court applied the correct legal standard is a question of law subject to plenary review.\u201d <em>Wieselman </em>v. <em>Hoeniger, </em>103 Conn. App. 591, 598, 930 A.2d 768, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 930, 934 A.2d 245 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We see no reason why the statutory sections relied on by the plaintiff would not authorize the attorney\u2019s fee award requested by the plaintiff, were the court to have concluded the plaintiff were so entitled upon a balancing of the equities. For the court to have failed to engage in such an analysis, simply concluding that no statutory authority existed, clearly reflects a misconception of the law. See, e.g., <em>Tsitaridis </em>v. <em>Tsitaridis, </em>100 Conn. App. 115, 916 A.2d 877 (2007) (reversing judgment on trial court\u2019s failure to apply applicable statute). Accordingly, we reverse this portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>judgment and remand for consideration of the plaintiffs claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Committee Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The plaintiff next argues that the court improperly calculated the amount of committee fees to be deducted from the foreclosure sale proceeds. We decline to review this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our analysis. On January 21, 2003, the court ordered the plaintiff to pay costs of $3557.85 incurred by the foreclosure committee in connection with the foreclosure sale that the court ordered in its January 14,2002judgment. Prior to the foreclosure sale, the defendant appealed from the court\u2019s January 14, 2002 judgment. We affirmed the judgment. <em>See Moasser </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>78 Conn. App. 305, 828 A.2d 116, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 910, 832 A.2d 70 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">After the court rendered another judgment of foreclosure by sale on October 4, 2004, the property was sold by committee on November 13, 2004. On December 23, 2004, the court ordered the committee be allowed an additional fee of $5966.40 for costs incurred in connection with this second auction. The court, in its July 12, 2006 memorandum of decision, deducted the $5966.40 committee fee from the overall foreclosure sale proceeds. The memorandum is silent with respect to the $3557.86 committee fee. The plaintiff does not now challenge the court\u2019s decision to deduct the $5966.40 committee fee from the overall proceeds but, rather, argues that the court should have \u201crequired the reimbursement to the plaintiff for this earlier incurred sum [of $3557.86 in committee expenses].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">\u201c[This] court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . . Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. ... To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>allow such a claim to be raised on appeal would be nothing more than a trial by ambuscade of the trial judge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ingels </em>v. <em>Saldana, </em>103 Conn. App. 724, 730, 930 A.2d 774 (2007). The plaintiff, in his November 16, 2005 motion for an order of disbursement, did not request reimbursement for the first $3557.85 committee fee that he had allegedly paid. Therein, the plaintiff \u201cinstead [indicated] that the defendant . . . should pay for the second committee fee, which she alone necessitated.\u201d As the plaintiff failed to present to the court his argument that the defendant should have reimbursed his payment of the first committee fee, we decline to afford it review.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Disbursement of Duel and Holland Mortgage</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The plaintiffs final argument is that the court improperly disbursed the proceeds of the foreclosure sale to Duel and Holland, a mortgagee with rights superior to those of the plaintiff. The plaintiff himself acknowledges that the court had previously ordered, in its January 14, 2002 memorandum of decision, that the sale proceeds be distributed in such a manner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff does not take issue with this initial determination, instead supporting his argument by making generalized references to subsequent judgments that he asserts \u201cmodified\u201d the court\u2019s order to satisfy the Duel and Holland mortgage via the proceeds of the plaintiffs foreclosure sale.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Unfortunately for the plaintiff, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>have scoured the record, including the judgments referenced by the plaintiff, and can find nothing that would preclude the court from treating the Duel and Holland mortgage in the manner in which it did. Accordingly, we need not address this claim further. See, e.g., <em>Ingels </em>v. Saldana, supra, 103 Conn. App. 728-29 (appellant\u2019s mischaracterization of trial proceedings precludes appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the court failed to calculate properly the amount of the deficiency judgment owed the plaintiff. We dismiss this portion of the plaintiffs appeal, as the court\u2019s decision to award a deficiency judgment does not amount to a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">In its July 5, 2005 memorandum of decision, the court clearly manifested its intent to award the plaintiff a deficiency judgment<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-14.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, as a matter of law, the plaintiff appears to be entitled to a deficiency judgment pursuant to this provision. At no point, however, did the court calculate or award the amount of the deficiency,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>instead directing counsel for the parties \u201cto agree on the amount of said deficiency judgment,\u201d and \u201cif there is any controversy about the exact numbers, the matter should be claimed to the foreclosure short calendar . . . .\u2019\u2019To the extent that the plaintiffs claim relates only to the court\u2019s determination of his liability on the deficiency, and the amount of the deficiency remains outstanding, the matter is not final. See, e.g., <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>197 Conn. 82, 84, 495 A.2d 1063 (1985) (judgment as to liability only, without determination of damages, interlocutory in character and not appealable). \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 52-263 limits appellate jurisdiction to appeals that are taken from final judgments.\u201d <em>Ingels </em>v. <em>Saldana, </em>supra, 103 Conn. App. 731. Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The judgment is reversed as to the order deducting the January 14,2002 postjudgment attorney\u2019s fee award from the overall sale proceeds and the case is remanded with direction to deduct that award from the defendant Judith Becker\u2019s portion of the sale proceeds; further, the judgment is reversed as to the denial of the plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees relative to expenses incurred after the January 14, 2002 judgment, and the case is remanded for further proceedings as to that request; the appeal is dismissed as to the challenge to the court\u2019s calculation of the deficiency judgment. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\"> James Becker is the former husband of Judith Becker, a codefendant. Judith Becker is the only defendant involved in this appeal; neither James Becker nor any of the other defendants, Jeanne Altschul, the city of Stamford, Union Trust Company, Mechanics and Farmers Savings Bank, Connecticut National Bank, Duel and Holland, and Pilar Smith, are parties to this appeal.

The plaintiff has relied, however, on the court's earlier July 5, 2005 memorandum of decision to support this assertion.

Although the plaintiff correctly reiterates the court\u2019s initial statement from that proceeding that a foreclosure buyer would purchase subject to a superior mortgage, the plaintiff fails to mention the court\u2019s later acknowledgement that in this instance, the superior Duel and Holland mortgage would actually need be satisfied at the time of the foreclosure of the inferior lien of the plaintiff because the superior Duel and Holland mortgage had been recorded pursuant to a court judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\"> Specifically, the court stated that \u201cthe plaintiff is entitled to a deficiency judgment representing the difference between the debt owed the plaintiff and the money he obtains from the [distribution of the proceeds of the foreclosure sale].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 (a) provides: \u201cAt any time within thirty days after the time limited for redemption has expired, any party to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment. Such motion shall be placed on the short calendar for an evidentiary hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen days following the filing of the motion, except as the court may otherwise order. At such hearing the court shall hear the evidence, establish a valuation for the mortgaged property and shall render judgment for the plaintiff for the difference, if any, between such valuation and the plaintiffs claim. The plaintiff in any further action upon the debt, note or obligation, shall recover only the amount of such judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\"> The plaintiffs assertion that the court calculated the amount of the deficiency judgment in its July 5, 2005 memorandum of decision again amounts to a mischaracterization of the record. Although the court calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>lated the amount of the total debt due to the plaintiff, nowhere has the court taken the next necessary step and calculated the amount of the deficiency due to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
