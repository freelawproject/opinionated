We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to the resolution of the issues on appeal. On December 13,2004, the plaintiff filed this action seeking to foreclose a judgment lien in the amount of $2500. The plaintiff alleged that she obtained a judgment against the defendant in that amount on December 21, 1993, in an action she filed against the defendant for conversion of personalty. In that case, <em>Kropelnicki </em>v. <em>Kalinowski, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Middle-sex, Docket No. CV-92-0064000-S (December 22, 1993), the court held: \u201cJudgment is entered for the plaintiff ... to recover of the defendant . . . the sum of $2500 without costs. However, the court, having taken judicial notice of the pending custody and support case, is aware of substantial arrearages therein owed by the plaintiff to the defendant ... for the support of the minor child. Said arrearages were admitted by the plaintiff to be approximately $2000. The judgment entered herein shall be first applied as a credit against the existing arrearage of approximately $2000. The balance of the judgment shall apply to current payments until the judgment is exhausted, at which time payments in the support case should proceed as ordered therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The plaintiff further alleged, in this action, that, after the defendant failed to pay the judgment, she filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>judgment lien on the land records on December 2, 2002, attaching an interest in real property owned by the defendant in Southington. The defendant filed a counterclaim indicating that he had sought a release of the judgment lien but that the plaintiff had not complied with the request and that he was, therefore, seeking statutory damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-8, 49-13 and 49-51, plus reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">On July 6, 2006, after trial, the court issued its memorandum of decision rendering judgment in favor of the defendant. The court determined that the plaintiffs foreclosure complaint was \u201cwithout merit, and if [the plaintiff] is entitled to any relief, she must seek it initially within the context of the judgment rendered ... in <em>Kropelnicki </em>v. <em>Kalinowski, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CV-92-0064000-S.\u201d On the counterclaim, the court ordered that the lien be removed from the land records and that the plaintiff pay costs plus $3000 in attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. The plaintiff filed a motion to reargue, which also was denied. The plaintiff filed this appeal, and the defendant filed a timely cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly denied her request for a judgment of foreclosure of the judgment lien. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that she presented a prima facie case for foreclosure and that the defendant did not meet his burden of proving any of his special defenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">\u201cA foreclosure action is an equitable proceeding. . . . The determination of what equity requires is a matter for the discretion of the trial court. ... In determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, we must make every reasonable presumption in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the correctness of its action. . . . Our review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of the legal discretion vested in it is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have reached the conclusion that it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Angle, </em>284 Conn. 322, 326, 933 A.2d 1143 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">It is axiomatic, however, that \u201c[a]n appellate tribunal cannot render a decision without first fully understanding the disposition being appealed. . . . Our role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the plaintiffs claims] would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Mullaney, </em>284 Conn. 673, 681, 937 A.2d 667 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In the present case, the plaintiff claims that she made a prima facie case for foreclosure and that the defendant failed to prove any of his eight special defenses. Because the court did not provide any reason for its denial of the plaintiffs request for foreclosure, we do not know whether the court denied the foreclosure on the basis of a deficiency of the evidence presented by the plaintiff or if the court credited one of the defendant\u2019s special defenses. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff should have filed a motion for articulation to preserve an adequate record for review. \u201cIt is well established that [a]n articulation is appropriate where the trial court\u2019s decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification. . . . [P]roper utilization of the motion for articulation serves to dispel any . . . ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>Stone-Krete Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eder, </em>280 Conn. 672, 685-86, 911 A.2d 300 (2006). In light of the status of the record before us, we cannot review the plaintiffs claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">On cross appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly limited his award of attorney\u2019s fees to $3000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the court should have awarded him greater attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 49-51 or should have doubled the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-568 (1). We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">In his counterclaim, the defendant sought damages and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 49-8, 49-13 and 49-51.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, the defendant also sought attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 52-568 (l).* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its memorandum of decision, after denying the plaintiffs request for foreclosure and concluding that the defendant\u2019s counterclaim was meritorious, the court \u201cin light of the evidence and totality of circumstances,\u201d ordered the plaintiff to pay attorney\u2019s fees of $3000. In response to the defendant\u2019s motion for articulation, the court found that \u201c[t]he trial of this complaint and counterclaim . . . lasted approximately two hours. Upon review of the entire record, the court is of the opinion that the award of attorney\u2019s fees of $3000 on the counterclaim is fair, just and reasonable pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-51.\u201d The court also found that there was no legal or factual basis to support the defendant\u2019s claim of double counsel fees pursuant to \u00a7 52-568.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">\u201cAn award of attorney\u2019s fees is not a matter of right. Whether any award is to be made and the amount thereof lie within the discretion of the trial court, which is in the best position to evaluate the particular circumstances of a case. ... A court has few duties of a more delicate nature than that of fixing counsel fees. The issue grows even more delicate on appeal; we may not alter an award of attorney\u2019s fees unless the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>court has clearly abused its discretion, for the trial court is in the best position to evaluate the circumstances of each case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>88 Conn. App. 806, 816, 873 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 902, 882 A.2d 670 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Our Supreme Court has long \u201cheld that there is an undisputed requirement that the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees and costs must be proven by an appropriate evidentiary showing. . . . We also have noted that courts have a general knowledge of what would be reasonable compensation for services which are fairly stated and described . . . and that [c]ourts may rely on their general knowledge of what has occurred at the proceedings before them to supply evidence in support of an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>267 Conn. 456, 471, 839 A.2d 589 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The court is permitted \u201cto assess the reasonableness of the fees requested using any number of factors, including its general knowledge of the case, sworn affidavits or other testimony, itemized bills and the like. . . . [T]he value of [reasonable attorney\u2019s fees] is based on many considerations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In support of his claim for attorney\u2019s fees, the defendant submitted an affidavit, with corresponding time sheets, claiming that his attorney spent 121.32 hours on his case, at a rate of $250 per hour. In awarding $3000, the court noted that the trial in this matter took two hours. Employing the rate of $250 per hour, we might infer, therefore, that the court awarded fees for an additional ten hours.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we defer to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>court\u2019s unique position to best evaluate the circumstances of each case, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in not awarding more attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 49-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Additionally, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s award under \u00a7 49-51 was an indication that the court determined that the lien was filed without just cause and, therefore, that the foreclosure action was, by extension, filed without probable cause, thus supporting the defendant\u2019s claim for double fees pursuant to \u00a7 52-568. Because it is not our province to make such a finding and because the court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim for double fees pursuant to \u00a7 52-568 as having no basis in fact or law, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> The plaintiff also named Freedom Mortgage Corporation as a defendant in this action. Because Freedom Mortgage Corporation is not a party to this appeal, we refer to Kalinowski as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> The plaintiff also claims that the court improperly discharged the judgment lien because the judgment remains unsatisfied. Although the court did find that the $2500 judgment had not been satisfied, the court concluded only that the defendant\u2019s counterclaim was \u201cmeritorious under the present circumstances\u201d and ordered the lien removed. Because we are unaware of the legal or factual bases for the court\u2019s conclusion, and the plaintiff did not move for an articulation seeking explanation of the court\u2019s ruling, we are unable to review this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Similarly, this court declines to review the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly denied her motion for costs pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-5 because the court provided no legal or factual basis for its denial and the plaintiff did not seek an articulation. The record is, therefore, inadequate for our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\"> The plaintiff also challenges the award of attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff contends, with no supporting analysis, that because the judgment remained unsatisfied and the defendant made no attempts to satisfy it, the lien was filed with just cause, and the court, therefore, improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 49-51. Because the plaintiffs argument rests on facts that were not found by the court, namely, that the lien was filed with just cause, her claim fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b651-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-51 (a) provides: \u201cAny person having an interest in any real or personal property described in any certificate of lien, which lien is invalid but not discharged of record, may give written notice to the lienor sent to him at his last-known address by registered mail or by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to discharge the lien. Upon receipt of such notice, the lienor shall discharge the lien by sending a release sufficient under section 52-380d, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the person requesting the discharge. If the lien is not discharged within thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>days of the notice, that person may apply to the Superior Court for such a discharge, and the court may adjudge the validity or invalidity of the lien and may award the plaintiff damages for the failure of the defendant to make discharge upon request. If the court is of the opinion that such certificate of lien was filed without just cause, it may allow, in its discretion, damages to any person aggrieved by such failure to discharge, at the rate of one hundred dollars for each week after the expiration of such thirty days, but not exceeding in the whole the sum of five thousand dollars or an amount equal to the loss sustained by such aggrieved person as a result of such failure to discharge the lien, which loss shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, whichever is greater.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b652-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-568 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who commences and prosecutes any civil action or complaint against another, in his own name or the name of others, or asserts a defense to any civil action or complaint commenced and prosecuted by another (1) without probable cause, shall pay such other person double damages . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\"> The record reveals that the parties stipulated that the hourly rate of $250 was fair and reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
