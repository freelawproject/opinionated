Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly calculated the amount of her award of attorney\u2019s fees (1) when it reduced the lodestar<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> amount of $52,699 to a fee award of $21,700, (2) when it reduced the lodestar amount of $52,699 by more than 50 percent without finding that any of the hours spent on the case were unjustified, (3) because the court had awarded her only $10,000 in damages when she sought more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>than $175,000 in damages, (4) because she had a contingent fee agreement with her attorney, and (5) because the court established the lodestar amount at $52,699 on the basis of 162 hours and not $55,025.75 on the basis of 169.31 hours. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of the plaintiffs appeal. In June, 1999, the plaintiff and Westphal read an advertisement for Brookstone Court Apartments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Interested in renting an apartment, Westphal, with the plaintiff in close proximity, called the apartment management to see if any apartments were available. After speaking with a representative of the apartment complex, the plaintiff and Westphal learned that even though there were apartments available, it would not be possible for the plaintiff to live there because she required a wheelchair for mobility.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Subsequently, in December, 2000, the plaintiff and Westphal initiated a civil rights claim against the defendants before the commission. The commission investigated the claim and held a hearing in which attorney Robert J. Kor presented the plaintiffs and Westphal\u2019s cases. On the basis of this investigation and hearing, the commission found reasonable cause that a discriminatory practice had occurred. On December 11, 2000, the defendants elected to have the commission bring a civil action in Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (d) and 46a-84.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commission, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>its complaint against the defendants, alleged that the plaintiff and Westphal were discriminated against when the defendants \u201crefus[ed] to rent, negotiate to rent, and [failed] to provide reasonable accommodations, because of the [plaintiffs] physical disabilities . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) On February 15, 2006, in its memorandum of decision in the civil rights action, the court found in favor of the plaintiff. Thereafter, in its memorandum of decision on the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees, the court iterated its findings by stating that the \u201cdefendants violated General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64c (a) (6) (A)* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>6 and (C),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the federal Fair Housing Act, \u00a7 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 (f) (1) and (3) (A) and (B).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the court awarded the plaintiff $10,000, imposed a civil penalty in favor of the state of $1000 and rendered judgment against Westphal. After reargument, on March 23, 2006, the court corrected its decision and found in favor of Westphal, awarding her $1 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">On March 3, 2006, Kor moved for attorney\u2019s fees for his work in the underlying case. The court examined General Statutes \u00a7 46a-104* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613 (c) (2)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the Fair Housing Act to determine the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of attorney\u2019s <em>fees to </em>be awarded. The court adopted the \u201creasonable\u201d attorney\u2019s fee standard and calculated the lodestar figure. The court found that Kor\u2019s hourly rate was $325 and that the amount of time he spent on the case was 162 hours, which resulted in the lodestar figure of $52,699.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court considered factors such as success of the claims, the novelty and difficulty of the question, the skill requisite to perform the legal services properly, the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney and whether the fees were fixed or contingent. The court found that \u201c[tjaking into account all of the circumstances of this case, and all of the factors stated [previously],\u201d the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for Kor\u2019s work was $25,000. The court, however, reduced this figure to $21,700 because Kor had a contingent fee arrangement with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Subsequently, on October 5, 2006, the plaintiff moved to reargue the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. On October 26, 2006, the court denied the plaintiffs motion to reargue. In its memorandum of decision denying the plaintiffs motion to reargue, the court stated that it \u201cconsidered all the factors relating to the award of counsel fees in th[e] case and properly exercised its discretion to allow the plaintiffs attorney a reasonable fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">On November 13, 2007, the plaintiff filed an appeal with this court. In the interim, on March 1, 2007, the plaintiff moved for an articulation, requesting that the court clarify the factual and legal bases on which the court relied when it reduced the award by the $3300 contingent fee amount and on which it relied to calculate the lodestar amount using 162 hours, as opposed to the 169.31 hours claimed by the plaintiff. The court denied the plaintiffs motion for articulation on March 13, 2007.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff asserts five separate claims, previously recited, that essentially allege the same issue, namely,' whether the court improperly determined the plaintiffs award for attorney\u2019s fees. These claims will be addressed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Our standard of review for a challenge to the award of attorney\u2019s fees is well settled: \u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. . . . This standard applies to the amount of fees awarded. . . . and also to the trial court\u2019s determination of the factual predicate justifying the award. . . . Under the abuse of discretion standard for review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>[w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . [Thus, our] review of such rulings is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and reasonably could have reached the conclusion that it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 252-53, 828 A.2d 64 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">As a threshold matter, the plaintiff and the commission contend that the court improperly applied the governing law on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, the plaintiff objects to the court\u2019s consideration of federal precedent for its award of attorney\u2019s fees. In opposition, the defendants contend that the court correctly applied the governing law because the court found that the defendants had violated both state and federal law, and it was appropriate for the court to turn to federal precedent in the present case. Moreover, the commission, in its brief, maintains that although the commission\u2019s petition did mention federal law, it was only to the extent that the federal law was enforced through state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In the present case, the court found that the defendants violated \u00a7 46a-64c (a) (6) (A) and (C) and the federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 (f) (1) and (3) (A) and (B). Our Supreme Court has stated: \u201c[I]n addressing claims brought under both federal and state housing laws, we are guided by the cases interpreting federal fair housing laws; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3601 through 3631; despite differences between the state and federal statutes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 557, 591, 775 A.2d 284 (2001). Thus, the court correctly considered federal precedent in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The plaintiff claims that the court improperly reduced her award of attorney\u2019s fees from the lodestar amount of $52,699 to $25,000.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff maintains that the court improperly reduced this award (1) without finding that any of the 162 hours spent on the case were unjustified, (2) because the plaintiff was awarded only $10,000 rather than the $175,000 she sought in her posttrial brief and (3) when it calculated the lodestar amount on the basis of 162 hours rather than 169.31 hours worked on the case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Essentially, these claims boil down to one issue: whether the court improperly determined the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The plaintiff and the commission assert that the court improperly calculated her attorney\u2019s fees award when it imprudently relied on <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1992).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Farrar, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>United States Supreme Court suggested that a plaintiff who seeks compensatory damages but receives no more than nominal damages is often a prevailing party who should receive no attorney\u2019s fees. Id., 115 (\u201c[i]n a civil rights suit for damages . . . the awarding of nominal damages . . . highlights the plaintiffs failure to prove actual, compensable injury\u201d). The plaintiff first argues that the court should not have considered the <em>Farrar </em>decision in determining its award of attorney\u2019s fees. According to the plaintiff, <em>Farrar </em>should not be considered in light of our recent Supreme Court case, <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Chaisson, </em>277 Conn. 319, 890 A.2d 548 (2006), which holds that <em>Farrar </em>is not binding on a Connecticut court exercising its discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a state statute. Although this general statement of the case holds true, the plaintiff misconstrues the <em>Simms </em>court\u2019s discussion of <em>Farrar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The plaintiff maintains that the trial court substantially relied on <em>Farrar </em>when it reduced her award of attorney\u2019s fees. The court, in its memorandum of decision on the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees, stated that <em>Farrar </em>permits a court to take into account other factors, such as the degree of successful recovery obtained. The court then engaged in an analysis of the other factors that are considered to determine a reasonable fee. In the court\u2019s memorandum of decision on the plaintiffs motion to reargue, the court did not mention to what extent it relied on <em>Farrar, </em>if at all. Rather, it simply distinguished <em>Farrar </em>from <em>Simms</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nonetheless, the plaintiff argues that these references to <em>Farrar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>indicate that the court relied on <em>Farrar </em>to reduce the award. Yet, it is unclear to what extent the corut actually reduced the amount of the fee award from $52,699 to $25,000 on the basis of <em>Farrar </em>because the court stated that it considered all the relevant factors for the consideration of attorney\u2019s fees. Furthermore, in <em>Farrar, </em>the court did not award the plaintiff any attorney\u2019s fees because the plaintiff achieved only a de minimis victory in relation to each of \u201cthe relevant indicia of success\u2014 the extent of relief, the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed, and the public purpose served . . . .\u201d <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>supra, 506 U.S. 122. Here, even though the plaintiffs award was substantially less than the amount sought, the court appropriately exercised its discretion and awarded fees in the amount of $25,000, and further reduced that figure by the contingent fee amount to $21,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Additionally, a thorough reading of <em>Simms </em>belies the plaintiffs contention that <em>Farrar </em>does not apply in the present case. In <em>Simms, </em>our Supreme Court was faced with the question of \u201cwhether the trial court abused its discretion in awarding substantial attorney\u2019s fees under General Statutes \u00a7 52-571c (b)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to plaintiffs who recovered only nominal damages.\u201d <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Chaisson, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 320. There, the trial court awarded the plaintiffs a substantial amount of attorney\u2019s fees over the defendant\u2019s objection and in light of the <em>Farrar </em>precedent. Id., 323. Although our Supreme Court held that <em>Farrar </em>was not controlling, it also explained that <em>Farrar </em>\u201cdoes not establish a firm rule that the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>appropriate fee is no fee when the prevailing party recovers nominal damages and [does] not create a per se bar against awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party who recovers only nominal damages.\u201d Id., 328. The court further explained that \u201cthe [United States] Supreme Court noted that the primary consideration in awarding fees under 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1988 was a comparison of the amount of damages awarded with the amount sought. . . . Thus, the court\u2019s conclusion would allow for a substantial award of fees where the damages sought and the recovery were roughly corresponding in amount, including where both were minimal in size.\u201d <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Chaisson, </em>supra, 328. Accordingly, the court concluded that although <em>Farrar </em>\u201cdoes not prohibit the award of attorney\u2019s fees to a plaintiff recovering only nominal damages, it does [however] narrow a court\u2019s discretion to award a substantial fee under \u00a7 1988.\u201d Id., 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On the basis of our Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of <em>Farrar </em>in the <em>Simms </em>case, which is distinguishable from this case, and because the court in the present case was faced with both state law and federal law, <em>Farrar </em>is applicable to the present case. <em>Simms </em>is distinguishable from the present case because the court in <em>Simms </em>relied on \u00a7 52-571c (b), which is based on intimidation and bigotry, which are characterized as invidious discrimination. In the present case, the court relied on a different statute. Therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the court improperly relied on <em>Farrar </em>in light of <em>Simms, </em>fails. Additionally, from the record before us, it is unclear to what extent the court relied on <em>Farrar </em>when it determined the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Furthermore, the plaintiff argues that the court improperly reduced the lodestar figure by 50 percent and that it should have calculated the lodestar figure on the basis of 169.31 hours rather than the 162 hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>it applied in its calculations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that \u201c[i]n the absence of the trial court identifying any specific time spent in the litigation by [the] plaintiff[\u2019s] counsel as being unreasonable, the sweeping reduction of the \u2018lodestar\u2019 amount suggests that the trial court believed that only eighty hours of counsel\u2019s time was reasonable and that the 169 hours actually spent was somehow excessive for six years of litigation at both the commission and at the Superior Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">There are two deficiencies with the plaintiffs argument. In the first instance, the plaintiff argues that the lodestar figure should be the beginning and the end of the inquiry. This is simply not true. \u201c[T]he <em>initial estimate </em>of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee is properly calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate. . . . The courts may then adjust this lodestar calculation by other factors.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Laudano </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>58 Conn. App. 819, 822-23, 755 A.2d 907 (2000); see <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bergeron, </em>489 U.S. 87, 93, 109 S. Ct. 939, 103 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1989); see also <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983). Here, the court properly listed the factors to be considered in awarding attorney\u2019s fees. Second, to the extent that the plaintiff argues that the court did not sufficiently explain the weight it gave to particular factors, we know of no law, nor has the plaintiff cited any, that requires the court to ascribe to any of the factors a particular weight. Furthermore, to the extent that the record is unclear, the plaintiff is responsible for providing the court with an adequate record.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u201cIt is axiomatic that the appellant must provide this court with an adequate record for review. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-10.\u201d <em>Narumanchi </em>v. <em>DeStefano, </em>89 Conn. App. 807, 815, 875 A.2d 71 (2005). \u201c[W]here a party is dissatisfied with the trial court\u2019s response to a motion for articulation, he may, and indeed under appropriate circumstances he must, seek immediate appeal of the rectification memorandum to this court via the motion for review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>High-gate Condominium Assn. </em>v. <em>Watertown Fire District, </em>210 Conn. 6, 21, 553 A.2d 1126 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Upon receiving the response to her motion for articulation, which the plaintiff considered inadequate, she could have filed a motion for review with this court, requesting that the trial court provide an explanation of its reasons for the fee award. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 66-5 and 66-7. The plaintiff is responsible for providing this court with an adequate record for review and has failed to do so. On the basis of the court\u2019s recitation of the factors it considered and the inadequate record, we must defer to the substantial discretion of the trial court. Because we cannot say that the court abused its discretion or improperly applied the law, we affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\"> Westphal is not a party to the present appeal. Therefore, for the purposes of this appeal, we refer to Sanchez as the plaintiff. In their original complaint to the commission, the plaintiff and Westphal named only Brookstone Court, LLC.

thus, \u00a7 46a-104 does not apply. Rather, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 (c) applies, which provides in relevant part: \u201cIn addition to any other action taken hereunder, upon a finding of a discriminatory practice prohibited by section 46a-58, 46a-59, 46a-64, 46a-64c, 46a-81b, 46a-81d or 46a-81e, the presiding officer shall determine the damage suffered by the complainant, which damage shall include, but not be limited to, the expense incurred by the complainant for obtaining alternate housing or space, storage of goods and effects, moving costs and other costs actually incurred by him as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of such discriminatory practice and <em>shall allow reasonable attorney\u2019s fees </em>and costs.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Even though the court relied on \u00a7 46a-104, when it should have relied on \u00a7 46a-86 (c), the result of this case does not change. The plaintiff, in her motion for attorney\u2019s fees, requested relief pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-86 (c) and 46a-104, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613 (c) (2). The court then referenced \u00a7 46a-104 in its analysis for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Furthermore, the commission, in its brief, asserted that the court analyzed the attorney\u2019s fee request under the incorrect statute. The commission claimed that the main difference between these two statutes is that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) mandates the court to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. We need not address the differences in the construction of these statutes because we find that the court did calculate an award and, thus, whether it \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmay\u201d have done so is irrelevant. Thus, even though the court evaluated the claim under the wrong statute, we find that no harm resulted. See generally <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>84 Conn. App. 395, 400, 853 A.2d 621, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 927, 859 A.2d 582 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\"> Section 3613 (c) (2) of title 42 of the United States Code provides in relevant part: \u201cIn a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs. The United States shall be hable for such fees and costs to the same extent as a private person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> On October 5, 2006, in her motion to reargue, the plaintiff claimed that Kor earned attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $55,025.75 on the basis of 169.31 hours of work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> The court calculated that on the basis of the plaintiffs recovery on the underlying claim, Kor was entitled to $3300 under the parties\u2019 contingent fee agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\"> Although the court denied the plaintiffs motion for articulation, it did state the following: \u201c(1) The fee arrangement of attorney Kor with his client entitled him to one third of the $10,000 recovery; whether or not he got paid, it is irrelevant,\u201d and, \u201c(2) [wjhether attorney Kor claimed $52,699 or $55,025.75 would not have changed the court\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\"> Originally, the plaintiff moved for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $48,282. Then she filed a supplemental motion for attorney\u2019s fees, claiming $52,699.50 in fees, and filed a second supplemental motion for attorney\u2019s fees, claiming $55,025.75 in fees. The court determined the lodestar amount to be $52,669, apparently awarding the value of $325 an hour for 162 hours. On the basis of this lodestar figure, the court awarded $25,000 and further reduced it by $3300, the amount to which counsel was entitled from the contingent fee award. Thus, except when we refer to the reduction on the basis of the contingent fee setoff, we use the amount found by the court: $25,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> The plaintiff also argues that the court improperly reduced her award of attorney\u2019s fees because of her contingent fee agreement. The plaintiff does not offer any legal authority to support this contention. Furthermore, the plaintiff offers legal authority that discusses only whether a court can enhance the attorney\u2019s fees award when there is a contingent fee agreement. Therefore, the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the court abused its discretion in reducing the award by the contingent fee amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> In <em>Farrar, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the plaintiff was not entitled to any attorney\u2019s fees when she was awarded nominal damages of $1. The court stated: \u201c[W]hen a plaintiffs victory is purely technical or de minimis, a district court need not go through the usual complexities involved in calculating attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>supra, 506 U.S. 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">In addition to her legal arguments, the plaintiff also asserts a public policy argument, claiming that the court\u2019s decision will ipjure future civil rights plaintiffs by discouraging counsel to represent such clients. Although we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>recognize the importance of this argument, it does not comport with the fact that the attorney was awarded more than $21,000 for his work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> In its memorandum of decision on the plaintiffs motion to reargue, the court rebuffed the plaintiffs introduction of the <em>Simms </em>case for the first time in her motion to reargue. The court relies on <em>Opoku </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>63 Conn. App. 686, 778 A.2d 981 (2001), for the proposition that a party cannot introduce new cases in a motion to reargue just to have a second bite of the apple. The court in <em>Opoku </em>stated: \u201c[T]he purpose of a reargument is . . . to demonstrate to the court that there is some decision or some principle of law which would have a controlling effect, and which has been overlooked, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>or that there has been a misapprehension of facts.\u201d Id., 692. Thus, <em>Simms </em>was properly introduced before the court through the plaintiffs motion to reargue. It, however, is distinguishable from the present case and therefore has no impact on the resolution of the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-571c (b) provides: \u201cIn any civil action brought under this section in which the plaintiff prevails, the court shall award treble damages and may, in its discretion, award equitable relief and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b376-5\"> The plaintiff is not challenging the use of the lodestar figure; rather, she is challenging how the court calculated the figure and the reasons for the reduction applied to that figure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\"> The plaintiff is aware of the inadequate record when she writes in her brief that \u201c[t]he trial court failed to explain why it appears to have given no consideration to the plaintiffs supplemental motion for attorney\u2019s fees, dated April 23, 2006, which sought an additional [seven and one-quarter] hours for a total of 169.31 hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The plaintiff argues that the court \u201cmust state the reasons for excluding those hours \u2018as specifically as possible.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff reads the court\u2019s decision as if it did not focus on the hours spent on the case but, instead, focused solely on the amount of the award obtained. The court did state, however, that it considered all of the relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">A reading of the court\u2019s memorandum of decision on the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees, the court\u2019s memorandum of decision on the plaintiffs motion to reargue and the court\u2019s holographic notes written on the plaintiffs motion for articulation do not disclose or clarify the court\u2019s reasons for reducing the lodestar amount by half or why the court used 162 hours to calculate the lodestar amount rather than 169.31 hours. It is the responsibility of the plaintiff, however, to ensure that the record is adequate for review. Practice Book \u00a7 61-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
