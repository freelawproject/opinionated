On appeal, the defendant, Stephen L. Crews, claims that the trial court improperly (1) failed to enforce the terms of the parties\u2019 antenuptial agreement (agreement), (2) ordered him to maintain a life insurance policy in the amount of $1.5 million, (3) ordered him to make certain periodic payments and (4) made clearly erroneous factual findings. We agree that the court improperly failed to enforce the agreement and thus reverse, in part, the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The plaintiff, Melinda Crews, initiated this action in May, 2004. In her one count complaint, the plaintiff alleged the date of the parties\u2019 marriage, that there were two minor children of the marriage and that the marriage had broken down irretrievably, in addition to the necessary jurisdictional allegations. In her prayer for relief, the plaintiff asked for a dissolution of marriage, alimony, child support, sole custody of the minor children, assignment of the defendant\u2019s interest in 3 Fairview Drive, Westport (marital home), an equitable division of the marital assets, attorney\u2019s fees and such other relief as the court deemed fair and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The defendant filed an answer and a two count cross complaint on April 18, 2005. The defendant admitted all of the allegations of the plaintiffs complaint. The allegations of count one of the defendant\u2019s cross complaint essentially mirrored the allegations of the plaintiffs complaint. In count two, the defendant alleged that the parties validly and voluntarily had entered into the agreement on June 24, 1988, following full disclosure of their individual financial affairs. He also alleged that at the time the agreement was signed, each of the parties was represented by independent counsel. Furthermore, he alleged that the circumstances of the parties at the time of dissolution were not so beyond their contemplation on June 24,1988, that enforcement of the agreement would cause an injustice. With respect to count one, the defendant sought a dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, joint custody of the minor children, an assignment of so much of the plaintiffs estate as the court deemed reasonable and proper and such other relief consistent with equity and good conscience. As to court two, the defendant prayed for a dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, joint custody of the parties\u2019 minor children and enforcement of the agreement. The plaintiff admitted in her answer to the cross complaint that the parties had signed the agreement but denied the remainder of the allegations of count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">After the parties presented evidence in June, 2005, the court recounted the following evidence relevant to the issues on appeal. The parties met at a corporate outing when they both were employed by the General Electric Corporation (General Electric). At the time, the defendant was the divorced father of three children. The plaintiff had not been married previously. The defendant holds a bachelor\u2019s degree; the plaintiff has bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. The defendant was then residing in the future marital home, a house that he had purchased from his mother in an arm\u2019s-length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>transaction on December 31, 1986. The plaintiff owned a condominium unit in Bridgeport. At the time, each of the parties had bank accounts, pension plans and investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The parties became engaged in January, 1988, and were married on June 25, 1988. About one year prior to their wedding, the defendant raised the subject of an antenuptial agreement. The defendant believed he had been \u201cburned\u201d in his previous divorce and declared: \u201cNo agreement; no wedding!\u201d The plaintiff told the defendant that she was \u201cno fan, but agreed with him in concept.\u201d The defendant described the agreement as a precondition to the wedding itself and presented the plaintiff with a draft of the agreement on May 31, 1988. The parties signed the agreement on June 24,1988, one day before they were married.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Following their marriage, the parties resided in the marital home and had two children, a daughter born in May, 1989, and a learning disabled son bom in May, 1992. Both parties were employed during their marriage, and initially each of them traveled extensively in connection with his or her employment. At the time of trial, the defendant had been employed by General Electric for thirty-nine years, where he earned an annual base salary of $131,000<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and regularly received annual bonuses. His annual net income was $98,540 at the time of dissolution. The court made no finding that the nature of the defendant\u2019s employment changed during the marriage from what it had been prior to the marriage. During the marriage, he also acquired General Electric stock and stock options, some of which was encumbered by margin loans. He also participated in two executive compensation plans in the 1990s.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The plaintiff was fifty-three at the time of dissolution. From 1981 through 1986, she was a technical writer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>for General Electric, earning $50,000 per year. She left General Electric to join Practice Media and later the NYNEX Coiporation. She worked steadily during the marriage, except for a three month maternity leave she took following the birth of each child. After the birth of the parties\u2019 children and an automobile accident, the plaintiff decided that corporate travel was too much for her in addition to her responsibilities at home. In 1993, she formed her own business known as M. Crews &amp; Company, LLC, which she operated out of the marital home until just prior to trial. The value of the plaintiffs business then was about $96,000, and she had an annual net income of $69,056.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The court found that the parties drifted apart over time and that both of them contributed to the disintegration of the marriage, but that the defendant bore a greater share of the blame for the breakdown because he \u201cset the tone\u201d for the marriage. He set the tone <em>\u201cstarting with the antenuptial </em>agreement\u201d; (emphasis added); segregating assets, particularly the marital home, and by imposing a \u201cheavy double burden\u201d on the plaintiff to obtain gainful employment and to maintain the household, including primary responsibility for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The court rendered judgment of dissolution by way of a memorandum of decision filed August 16, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to a motion to open, reargue and clarify filed by the defendant on August 25, 2005, the court issued an amendment to the memorandum of decision on September 19, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $1000 per month as nonmodifiable periodic alimony until the death of either party, the remarriage of the plaintiff or August 31, 2010, whichever occurred first, as well as $1439 monthly child support until the older child reached the age of eighteen at which time child support was to be adjusted in accordance with the child support guidelines or as the court may direct. The defendant also was ordered to maintain and pay for health insurance for each of the minor children as long as he is obligated to pay child support for the child. The court awarded the defendant exclusive possession of the marital home as of November 1,2005, but ordered him to pay the plaintiff $450,000, nontaxable to her, for her contribution to the appreciation of the family home and a portion of his General Electric and SunW stock acquired since the time of the marriage. The defendant was ordered to maintain $1.5 million of existing life insurance, naming the plaintiff and the minor children as equal beneficiaries as long as he is obligated to pay alimony or child support. In addition, the court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $25,000 for attorney\u2019s fees related to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The court awarded the plaintiff a portion of the defendant\u2019s pension, deferred income and investment programs and permitted her to retain all of her own investments and pension plans, as well as her business and condominium. The parties retained their personal bank accounts. Additional facts will be discussed where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Although it is a creature of statute, generally speaking, a dissolution action is equitable in nature. See <em>Loughlin </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>280 Conn. 632, 641, 910 A.2d 963 (2006). \u201cThe power to act equitably is the keystone to the court\u2019s ability to fashion relief in the infinite variety of circumstances which arise out of the dissolution of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>marriage. . . . [I]n the exercise of its inherent equitable powers it may also consider any other factors [besides those enumerated in the statutes pertaining to dissolution] which may be appropriate for a just and equitable resolution of the marital dispute. . . . [I]n . . . questions arising out of marital disputes, this court relies heavily on the exercise of sound discretion by the trial court. ... A less deferential standard applies, however, when the decision of the trial court is based not on an exercise of discretion but on a purported principle of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cAn antenuptial agreement is a type of contract and must, therefore, comply with ordinary principles of contract law.\u201d <em>McHugh </em>v. McHugh, 181 Conn. 482, 486, 436 A.2d 8 (1980). \u201c[A]ntenuptial agreements are to be construed according to the principles of construction applicable to contracts generally. The basic purpose of construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court improperly failed to enforce the terms of the agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The following facts are relevant to this issue. The court found, on the basis of the testimony of the parties and the attorneys who represented them at the time the agreement was signed, that the defendant raised the subject of an antenuptial agreement at least one year before the parties\u2019 wedding. He presented the plaintiff with a draft of the agreement on or about May 31,1988. The plaintiff sent a copy of the draft agreement to her attorney, Candace Page, prior to going on a business trip to Singapore, indicating that she would meet with Page when she returned. Page met with the plaintiff on June 21, 1988, and strongly recommended that the plaintiff not sign the agreement.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5Although the plaintiff was uncomfortable with the agreement, she said that she signed it the day before the wedding because she \u201c \u2018made a commitment.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Moreover, the court found that at the time the parties signed the agreement, each of them had had the benefit of independent counsel of his or her own choosing, the defendant had disclosed his significant assets, the plaintiff had failed to disclose her assets and liabilities, and each party had ample opportunity to discover the financial circumstances of the other party and, in fact, knew of the other\u2019s financial circumstances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found that other than the usual stress of a wedding, there was no coercion or duress imposed on the plaintiff. The court further found that the agreement contains no provision that either shocks the conscience or violates public policy and that it was enforceable at the time of its execution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The court found, however, that the economic circumstances of the parties had \u201cchanged dramatically\u201d between the time the agreement was signed and the dissolution, particularly the economic circumstances of the defendant, due in substantial part to the plaintiffs efforts. In view of the substantial financial and nonfinancial contributions the plaintiff made from her employment outside of the home and her parenting and homemaking efforts, the court concluded, citing <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 482, that it would be inequitable to enforce the terms of the agreement. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>rendering its judgment, the court awarded the plaintiff alimony, attorney\u2019s fees and a portion of the defendant\u2019s assets. The court awarded the plaintiff time limited alimony on the basis of statutory factors, namely, the age, education, earnings and employment history of the plaintiff. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82. The court also ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff a lump sum distribution of $450,000 and portions of his investments and pension plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The defendant claims that the court\u2019s financial orders violated the agreement. When an appellant\u2019s claim alleges that the facts found by the court were insufficient to support its legal conclusions, we are presented with a mixed question of fact and law to which the plenary standard of review applies. See <em>Friezo </em>v. <em>Friezo, </em>281 Conn. 166, 180, 914 A.2d 533 (2007); <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>McCue, </em>91 Conn. App. 721, 726, 882 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 922, 888 A.2d 91 (2005). Our task is to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record. See <em>Friezo </em>v. <em>Friezo, </em>supra, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">First, we examine the relevant sections of the agreement. Because the agreement is a contract, the principles of contract law apply. <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 486. \u201cIn giving meaning to the terms of a contract, the court should construe the agreement as a whole, and its relevant provisions are to be considered together. . . . The contract must be construed to give effect to the intent of the contracting parties. . . . This intent must be determined from the language of the instrument and not from any intention either of the parties may have secretly entertained. . . . [I]ntent ... is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>language is clear and unambiguous, however, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>101 Conn. App. 65, 74, 922 A.2d 1100 (2007). Neither party contends that any of the terms of the agreement are ambiguous, and the court made no such finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The preamble to the agreement sets forth the puipose of the agreement, i.e., to make provision in the event of a dissolution of marriage. The parties desired to segregate their individual property owned prior to and during their marriage and to affirm their individual abilities to hold gainful employment then and in the future. See footnote 3. As noted, the court awarded the plaintiff time limited alimony, attorney\u2019s fees, a lump sum property settlement of the marital home and portions of the defendant\u2019s investments and pension plans. Section 3.1 of the agreement addresses the issue of alimony in the event of a dissolution of marriage, stating in relevant part that \u201cneither party shall seek for himself or herself, or accept from the other, any cash or other property, whether as pendente lite or permanent alimony . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Article III anticipated the possibility of an action for the dissolution of marriage. Section 3.2 states in relevant part that \u201ceach party shall be entitled to receive, as and for a property settlement, his or her share of the Marital Property (as defined below) in proportion with his or her contribution to the Marital Property, and all of his or her Separate Property (as defined below).\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Given the plain meaning of the relevant terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of the parties\u2019 agreement, we conclude that the court\u2019s awarding the plaintiff time limited <em>alimony, </em>attorney\u2019s fees, a lump sum property settlement and portions of the defendant\u2019s assets is contrary to the terms of the agreement, unless one of the <em>McHugh </em>factors dictates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u201cThe validity of an antenuptial contract depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. . . . Ante-nuptial agreements relating to the property of the parties, and more specifically, to the rights of the parties to that property upon the dissolution of the marriage, are generally enforceable where three conditions are satisfied: (1) the contract was validly entered into; (2) its terms do not violate statute or public policy; and (3) the circumstances of the parties at the time the marriage is dissolved are not so beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into as to cause its enforcement to work injustice. <em>[McHugh v. McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 485-86].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>McCue, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 725. The court found that the agreement conformed to the first two prongs of <em>McHugh, </em>but concluded that, under the third prong, it would be inequitable to enforce the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u201c[A]n antenuptial agreement will not be enforced where the circumstances of the parties at the time of the dissolution <em>are so far beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time the agreement was made as to make enforcement of the agreement work an injustice. . . . </em>Thus, where a marriage is dissolved not because it has broken down irretrievably, but because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>fault of one of the parties, an antenuptial waiver of rights executed by the innocent party may not be enforceable, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case and the language of the agreement. . . . Likewise, <em>where the economic status of parties has changed dramatically between the date of the agreement and the dissolution, literal enforcement of the agreement may work injustice. </em>Absent such unusual circumstances, however, antenuptial agreements freely and fairly entered into will be honored and enforced by the courts as written.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">On the basis of our review of the evidence at trial, we conclude that the only <em>McHugh </em>factor on which the court decided not to enforce the agreement was its finding that there was a dramatic change in the economic circumstances of the parties between the time they signed the agreement and the dissolution of their marriage. This conclusion is not supported by the facts in the record or the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. We conclude as well that the court\u2019s finding that the changed circumstances were beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time they signed the agreement also is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The agreement states in relevant part that \u201ceach party affirms to the other his or her respective ability now and <em>in the future to be gainfully employed </em>and/or their respective ability and obligation to protect themselves from involuntary or voluntary termination of employment including long term disability.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Article IV of the agreement also indicates that the parties contemplated having children at the time it was signed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By signing the agreement, the plaintiff also recognized that the defendant desired to segregate all of his property from any interest she may have had in it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The evidence demonstrates that the parties contemplated the possibility of a divorce proceeding and incorporated provisions in the agreement to cover such an eventuality and agreed on how to protect their respective assets.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that the parties\u2019 financial circumstances at the time of dissolution, relatively speaking, were anything other than what they contemplated when they signed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The issue essentially, as stated by the court, is that the value of the defendant\u2019s assets at the time of dissolution was greater than that of the plaintiffs. Although the absolute value of the defendant\u2019s assets increased, the evidence does not suggest that the increase was due to anything other than the defendant\u2019s maintaining his employment pursuant to the terms of the agreement and the appreciation in the value of his assets over time. The plaintiff has not argued that the appreciation of the defendant\u2019s assets was not in keeping with the economy\u2019s growth during the marriage. Furthermore, not only was the value of the defendant\u2019s assets greater than the plaintiffs when the agreement was signed, but also the plaintiffs income and assets increased during the marriage, as well. As the court found, her income rose over time, and she acquired equity in her business. In his brief, the defendant argues that the gross income of both of the parties increased about two and one-half times over the course of the marriage. That argument appears to be consistent with the court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff makes much of the fact that she and the defendant negotiated the family budget in such a way that she paid for the day-to-day expenses and he paid the mortgage. See footnote 16. Although the defendant\u2019s equity in the marital home may have increased during the marriage if he paid the mortgage, the court found that the value of the marital home had appreciated, which is a different matter entirely. As to the family budget, the plaintiff agreed to that financial arrangement knowing full well that the defendant owned the marital home and that the agreement permitted him to retain it and the rest of his assets should a divorce occur. The plaintiff also presumably was aware of the status of her investments and pension.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the court found that \u201cboth parties made significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>contributions to the acquisition, maintenance and preservation of the family assets,\u201d including the marital home.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">At the time the parties signed the agreement, the defendant had been employed by General Electric for more than twenty-two years and had acquired certain pension and stock option benefits. The parties had known one another for several years prior to their marriage and, in fact, had resided together for some months before their wedding. The defendant\u2019s employment required him to travel a great deal, a fact the plaintiff knew before she married him. The plaintiff has highlighted no facts that the nature of the defendant\u2019s employment at the time of the dissolution was different from what it was at the time the parties married. At the time of dissolution, the defendant had been employed by General Electric for almost forty years. The plaintiff has not brought to our attention any evidence that the nature of the defendant\u2019s employment changed or that his salary and benefits changed in any fashion other than what one might expect for someone in his position. The plaintiff has failed to distinguish the parties\u2019 financial circumstances from those that were at issue in <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>McCue, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The reality of the parties\u2019 situation was explained in <em>Winchester, </em>in which those parties contemplated that the husband would continue working. \u201c[I]t must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>been contemplated by the parties that the defendant would continue working in the corporate arena and that, over the course of years, his income would increase as well as his retirement benefits and investments. These circumstances do not constitute the type of dramatic or unusual circumstances contemplated by <em>McHugh.\u201d </em>Id., 731.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We also cannot agree that the plaintiffs efforts alone contributed to the increased value of the parties\u2019 finances. In its memorandum of decision, the court discussed the evidence before it. Pursuant to the agreement, the plaintiff agreed to work throughout the marriage. She changed employment several times, eventually starting the business that she operated from the marital home, which is owned by the defendant. The court found that although the defendant was not in favor of the plaintiffs leaving the corporate world, he gave the plaintiff considerable assistance by keeping the books and developing a business plan for the plaintiffs company. The plaintiffs financial contributions from her employment therefore were not the result of her efforts alone. In addition, the plaintiff testified that she had not been as helpful to the defendant\u2019s career as she could have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">It is apparent that the court, in rendering its judgment, was moved by equitable considerations codified in our statutes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court concluded that although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>agreement was valid at the time it was executed, the evidence supported a finding that the economic circumstances of the parties had \u201cchanged dramatically,\u201d particularly those of the defendant and, given the length of the marriage, the birth of two children and the plaintiff s substantial financial and nonfinancial contributions, that it would be inequitable to enforce the agreement. Those observations, however, have no bearing on whether the agreement should be enforced. See <em>Dornemann </em>v. <em>Dornemann, </em>48 Conn. Sup. 502, 850 A.2d 273 (2004). The agreement required the court to adjudicate a contract action in which the traditional notions of equity are not germane because there was an agreement; see <em>Friezo </em>v. <em>Friezo, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 207-208 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting); and the evidence does not support a finding that there was a dramatic change in the parties\u2019 financial circumstances. See <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 485. In other words, whether the trial court or this court thinks the agreement was a good bargain for the plaintiff does not enter into the analysis of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u201cWhether provident or improvident, an agreement moved on calculated considerations is entitled to the sanction of the law . . . and even though a party might prefer to have the court decide the plain effect of his contract contrary to the expressed intention set forth in the agreement, it is not within the power of the court to make a new or different agreement.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>164 Conn. 369, 375, 321 A.2d 444 (1973). \u201cCourts of law must allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>parties to make their own contracts. With the wisdom or desirability of the provision they themselves have agreed upon the court is not concerned.\u201d <em>Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>148 Conn. 192, 201, 169 A.2d 646 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Pursuant to <em>McHugh </em>and <em>Winchester, </em>which make it clear that the threshold for a finding of dramatic change in circumstances is high, we conclude that not only does the evidence not support the court\u2019s conclusion that there was a dramatic change in the financial circumstances of the parties between the time of their marriage and its dissolution but also that the financial circumstances that existed at the time of dissolution were well within the contemplation of the parties when they signed the agreement, i.e., that is why the defendant wanted the plaintiff to sign the agreement. Moreover, the agreement itself anticipated the type of dramatic change in circumstances that might render the agreement unenforceable, shedding light on the parties\u2019 understanding of what they were agreeing to.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Section 5.9 of the agreement states, in part, that \u201c[i]n the event of any radical changes in the personal circumstances of a party hereto (including, by way of example, but not limited to, development of a <em>disabling </em>physical or mental condition reasonably anticipated to be permanent or of a long duration), then the party whose circumstances have so changed shall have the right to seek a modification of this Agreement . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The dramatic financial change found by the court evolved during the parties\u2019 marriage and was within their control. The record does not reflect why the parties agreed to use her income to pay for the daily living expenses of the family and permitted the defendant to increase the equity in the marital home that she knew he owned. Whatever the reason, it does not fall within the category of radical changes contemplated by <em>McHugh </em>or the parties themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>In sum, we conclude that the enforcement of the agreement is required under <em>McHugh </em>and that enforcement will not work an injustice on the parties. We therefore reverse that portion of the judgment requiring the defendant to pay the plaintiff time limited alimony, attorney\u2019s fees, a lump sum property settlement and a portion of his pension and investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The defendant claims that the court improperly ordered him to maintain $1.5 million in life insurance because (1) the court lacked jurisdiction to order him to maintain life insurance for the benefit of an adult child and lacked evidence of his insurability and the cost of such insurance, and (2) the amount ordered is excessive. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The defendant\u2019s claim concerns the following order of the court: \u201cThe [defendant] shall maintain $1.5 million of the <em>existing </em>life insurance, and shall name the [plaintiff] and children as equal beneficiaries thereof for so long as he has an obligation to pay alimony and/ or child support under the terms of this decree. The foregoing notwithstanding, upon the termination of the [defendant\u2019s] alimony obligation to the [plaintiff], he may reduce his life insurance to $1 million, naming each child as equal beneficiary thereof for so long as he has a child support obligation to either one and/or so long as he has an obligation under an educational support order entered pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56c.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim, implicates General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56c, 46b-82 and 46b-84.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Construction of a statute calls for the plenary standard of review. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>86 Conn. App. 719, 724, 862 A.2d 326 (2004). \u201cIn fashioning its financial orders [however] the court has broad discretion, and [j]udicial review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of [this] broad discretion . . . is limited to the questions of whether the . . . court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have concluded as it did. ... In making those determinations, we allow every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the correctness of [the trial court\u2019s] action. . . . That standard of review reflects the sound policy that the trial court has the unique opportunity to view the parties and their testimony, and is therefore in the best position to assess all of the circumstances surrounding a dissolution action, including such factors as the demeanor and the attitude of the parties.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>93 Conn. App. 809, 812, 890 A.2d 581 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The defendant claims that it was improper for the court to order him to maintain existing life insurance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>naming his children as beneficiaries, as long as he has an obligation to pay child support and provide educational support pursuant to \u00a7 46b-56c. The claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The defendant first argues that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order him to maintain his life insurance for the benefit of his children because it constitutes postmajority support in violation of the rule set out in <em>Broaca </em>v. Broaca, 181 Conn. 463, 435 A.2d 1016 (1980). <em>Broaca, </em>however, did not concern an educational support order. In that case, our Supreme Court held that a parent ordered to pay child support pursuant to \u00a7 46b-84 was not required to secure his or her child support obligations by means of a life insurance policy after the child had reached the age of eighteen, the age at which a child reaches majority. Id., 465-66. The defendant also argues that a parent cannot be required to name his or her children who are older than eighteen as the irrevocable beneficiaries of a life insurance policy, citing <em>Arseniadis </em>v. <em>Arseniadis, </em>2 Conn. App. 239, 242-43, 477 A.2d 152 (1984). <em>Arseniadis </em>was decided pursuant to Public Acts 1977, No. 77-488, \u00a7 1, then General Statutes \u00a7 46-49, now General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66, not \u00a7 46b-56c.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The defendant relies, as well, on <em>Loughlin </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>93 Conn. App. 618, 889 A.2d 902, aff'd, 280 Conn. 632, 910 A.2d 963 (2006), to support his claim. \u201cAs a general matter, [t]he obligation of a parent to support a child terminates when the child attains the age of majority, which, in this state, is eighteen. General Statutes \u00a7 1-ld .... The statutory grant of jurisdiction to the Superior Court in matters relating to child support incident to the dissolution of a marriage likewise expressly circumscribes the court\u2019s jurisdiction to orders involving only minor children.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Loughlin </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>supra, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The defendant contends, however, that the statutory exceptions to the general rule cited in <em>Loughlin </em>do not apply to the facts of this case. \u201cAdditional statutory provisions may apply, however, to modify this general rule. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 (a), a court in a dissolution proceeding may enter an order providing for postmajority child support when the parties have agreed in writing to the terms of that order. Under a more recently enacted provision, upon motion of a party and after making certain subsidiary findings, a court may issue an educational support order for college age children. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56c (b), (c), (e) .... Such an order may require one or both parties to a dissolution action to provide support to a child, until the child reaches the age of twenty-three, for certain enumerated educational expenses. In the absence of a statute or agreement providing for postmajority assistance, however, a parent ordinarily is under no legal obligation to support an adult child.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Loughlin </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 635-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In this case, the parties stipulated that had the family been intact at the time the children were of an age to attend college, they would have sent their children to college, and the court found that the stipulation brought the issue within the ambit of \u00a7 46b-56c. The court complied with \u00a7 46b-56c (c) by finding \u201cthat it is more likely than not that the parties would have provided support for their [children\u2019s] college education had the family remained intact.\u201d See also <em>Sander </em>v. <em>Sander, </em>96 Conn. App. 102, 115-16, 899 A.2d 670 (2006). Because the statutory scheme anticipates that a dissolution may occur in advance of the time postsecondary educational decisions appropriately can be made, it provides a mechanism for the court to retain jurisdiction for the purpose of ordering educational support for adult children. In its orders, the court reserved jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>enter an educational support order pursuant to \u00a7 46b-56c (b) at an appropriate time.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The defendant next argues that at the time the court issued the order requiring him to maintain life insurance for the benefit of his children, no educational support order was in effect and that it may come to pass that such an order is never entered. Although an educational support order may never be entered, speculation of that nature is not germane to the decision to be made here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>We note that decisions about postsecondary education usually occur at about the time a person becomes eighteen years of age. The defendant does not argue that the court abused its discretion by requiring him to maintain life insurance for the benefit of his children while they are minors. The court did not abuse its discretion, therefore, by issuing a financial order that would secure any educational support order that might be entered in the future, at about the time the children become eighteen and are making decisions about their educational futures. It is often said that common sense is not left at the courthouse door. See <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>40 Conn. App. 107, 113, 669 A.2d 616, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 915, 673 A.2d 1142 (1996). As a matter of judicial economy, it would not be practical to require the defendant to maintain life insurance for the benefit of a minor child, terminate it when the child becomes eighteen and reinstitute it some months later when the adult child matriculates at a postsecondary educational institution as the beneficiary of an educational support order. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56c (g) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Our analysis is guided by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sander </em>v. <em>Sander, </em>supra, 96 Conn. App. 102.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court in <em>Sander </em>ordered the sale of the parties\u2019 Vermont vacation home and that $75,000 of the proceeds of sale be held in trust for the education of the parties\u2019 daughter pursuant to \u00a7 46b-56c. Id., 115. The plaintiff challenged the propriety of that order on appeal. Id. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56c (h) provides in relevant part that \u201can educational support order may be modified or enforced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>in the same manner as is provided by law for any support order.\u201d See <em>Sander </em>v. <em>Sander, </em>supra, 120. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84 (f) concerns a parent\u2019s obligation to provide maintenance for a minor child. It provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court shall make and enforce the decree for the maintenance of the child as it considers just, and may direct security to be given therefor .... Similarly, \u00a7 46b-82 (a), relating to alimony, provides in relevant part that [t]he order may direct the security be given therefor on such terms as the court may deem desirable .... As a court may enforce these support orders by requiring that security be given, a court similarly may enforce an educational support order by requiring that security be given.\u201d <em>Sander </em>v. <em>Sander, </em>supra, 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u201cIn making its [financial] orders ... a trial court is afforded a wide latitude of discretion. . . . The creation of a trust to fund an educational support order fits well within that latitude of discretion. ... In <em>Louney </em>v. <em>Louney, </em>13 Conn. App. 270, 274-75, 535 A.2d 1318 (1988), this court upheld an order in a dissolution action requiring that funds held in joint accounts be used for the designated purpose of the education of the parties\u2019 minor children. Here, the court similarly established a trust to hold the parties\u2019 money for the express purpose of their daughter\u2019s college education pursuant to \u00a7 46b-56c.\u201d <em>Sander </em>v. <em>Sander, </em>supra, 96 Conn. App. 121. This court concluded that the trial court had exercised authority within its discretion to establish a trust as an appropriate means to secure an educational support order. Id., 121-22. We therefore conclude that the court in this case properly exercised its authority by requiring the defendant to maintain $1 million in existing life insurance to secure any future educational support order that may be entered for the benefit of the parties\u2019 children.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly ordered him to provide life insurance for the benefit of the parties\u2019 children in the absence of evidence of his insurability, cost and amount. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u201cOur standard of review in a domestic relations case is well settled. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court and will not disturb an order of the trial court absent an abuse of discretion or findings lacking a reasonable basis in the facts. ... An order for life insurance is very often an appropriate and necessary component of a judgment of dissolution of marriage. . . . Such an order, however, must have a reasonable basis in the evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Quindazzi </em>v. <em>Quindazzi, </em>56 Conn. App. 336, 338, 742 A.2d 838 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">In <em>Michel </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>31 Conn. App. 338, 624 A.2d 914 (1993), this court reversed the judgment of dissolution after the trial court had ordered the plaintiff to secure his alimony and support obligations with life insurance without any evidence of the cost or availability of the insurance to the plaintiff. Id., 340-41. \u201c[OJrders requiring the maintenance of life insurance have been approved on numerous occasions by our courts. . . . [In cases in which it has been approved] it is important to note that the life insurance policy was in existence at the time of judgment.\u201d Id., 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">In this case, the court ordered the defendant to maintain $1.5 million of <em>existing </em>life insurance. The defendant\u2019s financial affidavit indicates that at the time of the dissolution, he had life insurance in excess of $1.7 million. This court has held that \u201cwhere a life insurance policy is in existence [at] the time of the judgment, the court has available to it all of the information necessary to craft an appropriate order regarding such insurance. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>61 Conn. App. 791, 805, 769 A.2d 725 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>(2001).\u201d <em>Bee </em>v. <em>Bee, </em>79 Conn. App. 783, 794, 831 A.2d 833, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 932, 837 A.2d 805 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The defendant also claims that it was inappropriate for the court to order that the children be the beneficiaries of the policy rather than the educational institutions they may attend. This argument finds no support in \u00a7 46b-56c (g), which provides that payments under an educational support order are to be made to a parent to be forwarded to an institution of higher education, to the institution or \u201cotherwise as the court determines to be appropriate.\u201d We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s order was not improper on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">In addition to his claim that he cannot be ordered to provide life insurance to secure an educational support order after his children reach the age of eighteen, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s order would require him to maintain the life insurance policy as long as he is required to pay alimony, which could be until August 31, 2010. In part I, we concluded that the court improperly awarded the plaintiff alimony. In the event that the defendant is not obligated to pay the plaintiff alimony, the court\u2019s order reduced the amount of life insurance he was required to maintain to $1 million for the benefit of each of his children equally. The court, however, did not ground its life insurance order in alimony only. To the extent that the defendant has an obligation to pay child support, the court acted within its discretion to secure that obligation by requiring the defendant to maintain $1.5 million of life insurance payable to the plaintiff, his daughter and son in equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">We agree with the defendant that the language of the life insurance order as to duration is ambiguous and may require him to provide insurance for the benefit of one of his children who reaches the age of majority and is not the beneficiary of an educational support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>order. The court\u2019s order as to life insurance states that the defendant \u201cmay reduce his life insurance to $1 million, naming each child as equal beneficiary thereof so long as he has a child support obligation to either one and/or so long as he has an obligation under an educational support order . . . .\u201d The defendant is not obligated to support either one of his children after she or he reaches the age of eighteen, unless it is pursuant to an educational support order. See <em>Loughlin </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 635-36. To the extent that the court\u2019s order requires the defendant to maintain $500,000 of life insurance for the benefit of either one of his children, if that child is eighteen or older and not benefiting from an educational support order, it constitutes an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u201cAlthough we recognize that often [t]he rendering of a judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Lowe, 47 </em>Conn. App. 354, 358, 704 A.2d 236 (1997); we conclude that this is not such a case. The issue of life insurance is separate and distinct from the court\u2019s other financial orders. A remand for a review of all of the court\u2019s financial orders is, therefore, not necessary. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Because the court\u2019s order may require the defendant to maintain life insurance to secure an alimony obligation and support of a child who has reached the age of eighteen and who is not the beneficiary of an educational support order, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for clarification. The court\u2019s order regarding life insurance is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court improperly ordered periodic payments to be made from income that would be eliminated when the defendant complied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>with the court\u2019s property distribution and fee orders. Because we concluded in part I that the court improperly ordered the defendant to make a lump sum property award to the plaintiff as well as time limited alimony payments, attorney\u2019s fees and a portion of the defendant\u2019s investments and pensions, we need not consider this claim. To the extent that the court ordered the defendant to make child support payments to the plaintiff for the benefit of the parties\u2019 minor children, the court\u2019s award is affirmed. The defendant has failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s child support order does not conform to the statutory scheme or the child support guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that two of the court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous, specifically that he bore the greater responsibility for the breakdown of the parties\u2019 marriage and that the plaintiffs income was a minimum of $100,000. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u201cWe have long held that a finding of fact is reversed only when it is clearly erroneous. ... A factual finding is clearly erroneous when it is not supported by any evidence in the record or when there is evidence to support it, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. . . . Simply put, we give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>70 Conn. App. 735, 736-37, 799 A.2d 331 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The defendant claims that the court\u2019s finding that he bore a greater responsibility for the breakdown of the parties\u2019 marriage was clearly erroneous. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>argues that the court\u2019s finding was predicated on the court\u2019s looking on the agreement with disfavor. See footnote 18. The defendant\u2019s argument, however, does not encompass the whole of the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The court found that \u201cthe marriage of the parties has broken down irretrievably, and that ample evidence exists that both parties have contributed to said breakdown. However, the court finds that after considering all the evidence and hearing the testimony of the parties, that the [defendant] must bear a disproportionately greater share of responsibility for the breakdown, since it was he [who] set the tone, starting with the antenuptial agreement, the segregation of assets, particularly the marital home, as well as the heavy double burden imposed upon the [plaintiff] to obtain gainful employment and to maintain the household, including the responsibility for rearing the two children, one of whom had learning disabilities. The evidence supports the court\u2019s observation that, during the early years, the marriage was a partnership between two hardworking, career oriented people with demanding jobs and that when the children came along, the [plaintiff] assumed the primary homemaking duties as well and literally wore herself to a frazzle, with little help and virtually no appreciation of her efforts by the [defendant]. Things have been going inexorably downhill since.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court\u2019s finding is supported by the evidence cited by the court in its memorandum of decision. Among the specific causes of the breakdown, the plaintiff cited the defendant\u2019s viewing of pornography, his temper and drinking, his not being there for her and their frequent disputes over finances. She also claimed that the defendant did not participate in family life. The defendant did not share his travel itinerary with her, requiring the plaintiff to communicate with him through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>his secretary. The plaintiff admitted that she contributed to the breakdown of the marriage because she was not emotionally available to the defendant and that she was not helpful to his career. She accompanied him on some, but not all, business trips, when she was invited. The defendant complained that for days after he returned from a business trip, the plaintiff gave him the cold shoulder. The plaintiff responded to the defendant, \u201cthat\u2019s just me; deal with it.\u201d Both prior to and during the course of their marriage, the parties engaged in counseling.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The plaintiff entered counseling during the marriage because she did not like the way the defendant treated her or the children.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The defendant stopped going to counseling. The court found that the defendant\u2019s longtime sexual relationship with a business colleague, which began in about 1993, was not the cause of the breakdown of the marriage, which was \u201cdying by inches.\u201d The affair was an indirect cause of the breakdown and was evidence of the defendant\u2019s less than total commitment to the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that he should not bear responsibility for the tone of the marriage and the agreement because the plaintiff signed the agreement and the parties abided by it. He also argues that antenuptial agreements further the public policy of the state by encouraging spouses to order their affairs to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>acrimonious dissolution litigation. As is often stated, we do not reverse the factual findings of the trial court unless they are clearly erroneous and find no support in the evidence. See <em>Weinstein </em>v. Weinstein, 104 Conn. App. 482, 487, 934 A.2d 306 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 911, 943 A.2d 472 (2008). We cannot say that the challenged finding is clearly erroneous because we cannot conclude that the court based its decision solely, or even principally, on its purported hostility toward antenuptial agreements. Moreover, regardless of whether the plaintiff signed the agreement, the court found facts indicating that she carried a disproportionate burden during the marriage of maintaining the home and rearing the children. Over time, the agreement, which the defendant insisted at trial was \u201c \u2018the deal,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>took its toll physically and emotionally on the plaintiff and ultimately the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The defendant also claims that the court should have found that the plaintiffs annual income was $145,467 on the basis of the testimony of his expert witness. He further claims that the court found the plaintiffs annual income to be a minimum of $100,000. The defendant\u2019s claim mischaracterizes the court\u2019s finding, for which there is support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In its amendment to its memorandum of decision, the court found that \u201cthe testimony and evidence support a finding by the court that the [plaintiffs] earnings from her employment [are] a minimum of $100,000 per annum; that she receives an additional $1200 per annum in net rental income; and that her net income is $69,056 per annum.\u201d On the basis of our review of the evidence, it appears that the court rejected the plaintiffs evidence that she earned just $75,000 a year and the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert.

The plaintiff herself admitted that she contributed to the breakdown of the marriage.

Because this case concerns an antenuptial agreement entered into by the parties prior to the passage of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-36a to 46b-36j, it is governed by common-law principles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>181 Conn. 482, 436 A.2d 8 (1980), our Supreme Court set forth those principles, which are used by trial courts in determining the enforceability of such antenuptial agreements in this state. That decision is the controlling law for pre-1995 agreements, binding on trial courts and on this court. In today\u2019s decision, the majority concludes that the only basis on which the trial court determined that the parties\u2019 antenuptial agreement should not be enforced was the finding that the economic circumstances of the parties had changed dramatically from the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>parties had entered into the agreement. It then concludes that the facts in the record do not support such a finding and that, therefore, the court should have enforced the antenuptial agreement. My reading of the trial court\u2019s decision is not so limited. First, I believe that the court\u2019s determination not to enforce the agreement was based on a variety of findings, and a change in economic circumstances was but one of those findings. Second, I believe that there is evidence in the record to support the facts as found by the court. Moreover, even if there were insufficient facts in the record to support the court\u2019s finding that there was a dramatic change in the economic circumstances of the parties, the court made other findings of fact that are sufficient to support its conclusion not to enforce the antenuptial agreement. I, therefore, dissent from that portion of the majority opinion that holds that the court incorrectly determined that the parties\u2019 antenuptial agreement was unenforceable. I concur with the remainder of the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In McHugh, our Supreme Court articulated a three-pronged test for determining the enforceability of ante-nuptial agreements. Only the third of those prongs is relevant to this appeal. \u201cAntenuptial agreements relating to the property of the parties, and more specifically, to the rights of the parties to that property upon the dissolution of the marriage, are generally enforceable where . . . the circumstances of the parties at the time the marriage is dissolved are not so beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into as to cause its enforcement to work injustice.\u201d Id., 485-86. That third prong requires a court considering the enforceability of an antenuptial agreement to take into account two things: whether the circumstances of the parties had changed since their entry into the agreement and, if so, whether its enforcement would work an injustice. The <em>McHugh </em>court set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>forth a number of circumstances that could preclude the enforcement of antenuptial agreements. It concluded by stating: \u201cFinally, an antenuptial agreement will not be enforced where the circumstances of the parties at the time of the dissolution are so far beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time the agreement was made as to make enforcement of the agreement work an injustice. . . . Thus, where a marriage is dissolved not because it has broken down irretrievably, but because of the fault of one of the parties, an antenuptial waiver of rights executed by the innocent party may not be enforceable, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case and the language of the agreement. . . . Likewise, where the economic status of parties has changed dramatically between the date of the agreement and the dissolution, literal enforcement of the agreement may work injustice.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The majority narrows the <em>McHugh </em>analysis by focusing solely on a change in the <em>economic </em>circumstances between the signing of the agreement and the dissolution of the marriage, rather than the broader analysis of change in circumstances mandated by <em>McHugh </em>and correctly employed by the trial court. It does so because it concludes that the court\u2019s finding that there was a dramatic change in the economic circumstances of the parties was the only <em>\u201cMcHugh </em>factor\u201d on which the court based its decision not to enforce the agreement. That analysis, however, ignores the other factual findings made by the court, and detailed in its memorandum of decision, that support a finding of a change in circumstances such that enforcement of the antenuptial agreement would work an injustice. <em>McHugh </em>stands for the proposition that an antenuptial agreement will be enforced unless there are changes in the circumstances of the parties that would make its enforcement at the time of the dissolution inequitable. Change in economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>circumstances is only one such change in circumstance, and the only one requiring a \u201cdramatic\u201d change. <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">I begin my analysis with a discussion of the appropriate standard of review. In this appeal, our task is to determine whether the court properly concluded that the antenuptial agreement was unenforceable. That determination, being an order from the family court, is one that should be subject to the abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Ranfone </em>v. <em>Ranfone, </em>103 Conn. App. 243, 246, 928 A.2d 575, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 940, 937 A.2d 698 (2007); see also <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>280 Conn. 764, 774-75, 911 A.2d 1077, after remand, 104 Conn. App. 482, 934 A.2d 306 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 911, 943 A.2d 472 (2008). Nevertheless, the majority states that the court\u2019s conclusion is a mixed question of law andfact and, as such, should be subject to plenary review. See <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>McCue, </em>91 Conn. App. 721, 726, 882 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 922, 888 A.2d 91 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even under the plenary standard of review, however, this court\u2019s duty is to decide whether the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion is legally and logically correct and finds support in the facts that appear in the record. See id. The only legal conclusion made by the court was its determination not to enforce the antenuptial agreement in accordance with the test set out in <em>McHugh. </em>Whether the parties\u2019 financial circumstances had changed since they entered into the agreement is a question of fact that this court will overturn only if the trial court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. See <em>Brycki </em>v. <em>Brycki, </em>91 Conn. App. 579, 589, 881 A.2d 1056 (2005). \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous when it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>supported by any evidence in the record or when there is evidence to support it, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. . . . Simply put, we give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. If there is any evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s findings of fact, they must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In the present case, in concluding that it would be inequitable to enforce the antenuptial agreement, the court made various factual findings. The court found that \u201cthe marriage has broken down irretrievably, and that ample evidence exists that both parties have contributed to said breakdown. However, the court finds that the [defendant, Stephen L. Crews] must bear a disproportionately greater share of responsibility for the breakdown, since it was he [who] set the tone, starting with the antenuptial agreement [and] the segregation of assets, particularly the marital home . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court also found that the defendant placed a \u201cheavy double burden . . . upon the [plaintiff, Melinda Crews] to obtain gainful employment and to maintain the household, including the responsibility for rearing the [parties\u2019] two children, one of whom had learning disabilities.\u201d Moreover, the court found that the evidence supported a finding \u201cthat, during the early years, the marriage was a partnership between two hardworking, career oriented people with demanding jobs and that when the children came along, the [plaintiff] literally wore herself to a frazzle, with little help and virtually no appreciation of her efforts by the [defendant].\u201d Finally, the court found that \u201cthe economic circumstances of the parties have changed dramatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>between the date of the agreement and the dissolution, in particular the economic circumstances of the [defendant], due in substantial part to the efforts of the [plaintiff].\u201d Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention that these findings have no bearing on whether the agreement should be enforced, taken together, these facts satisfy the <em>McHugh </em>test for determining that the circumstances of the parties had changed so far beyond their contemplation at the time the agreement was made that enforcement of the antenuptial agreement would work an injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">These factual findings are supported by the record. There was evidence in the record that the plaintiff testified that her day began at 2 a.m. and ended well into the following evening; that she was responsible for the defendant\u2019s hunting dogs and took the family trash to the dump; that the defendant traveled 60 to 70 percent of the time; that the defendant provided the plaintiff little help with the primary household duties and child rearing; that the defendant insisted that the plaintiff communicate through his secretary while he was away and did not share his travel itinerary with her; that the defendant had a longtime sexual relationship with a business colleague; that the defendant viewed pornography both on video and on the Internet; and that the defendant had a temper and drank. In addition, the court heard testimony regarding the finances of both the plaintiff and the defendant, including the value of the marital home, their respective incomes and investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">After making its findings, the court concluded that \u201cgiven the length of the marriage, the birth of two children, and the substantial financial and nonfinancial contributions of the [plaintiff] from employment outside of the home to her parenting and homemaking efforts, it would be inequitable to enforce the terms of the prenuptial agreement of the parties. \u201d Although the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>did not use the words found in <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 485-86, that the changes were \u201cso beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into,\u201d in concluding that it would be inequitable to enforce the antenuptial agreement, it necessarily found that the circumstances of the parties were not within their contemplation at the time they entered into the antenuptial agreement. \u201cThe fact that the trial court did not utter the talismanic words . . . does not indicate that it did not make such a determination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 731, 631 A.2d 288 (1993). To conclude otherwise is to elevate form over substance. Because the court necessarily had to find that the changed circumstances were so far beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the agreement in order to find that enforcement of the antenuptial agreement was inequitable, I conclude that, in substance, the court made this necessary finding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Affording the necessary deference that our law requires, I would conclude that because there was support in the record for the court\u2019s factual findings, they were not clearly erroneous. As such, the court did not abuse its discretion when it determined, on the basis of those findings, that the enforcement of the antenuptial agreement would work an injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion that holds that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>incorrectly determined that the parties\u2019 antenuptial agreement was unenforceable. I concur with the remainder of the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36j provides: \u201cNothing in sections 46b-36a to 46b-36j, inclusive, shall be deemed to affect the validity of any premarital agreement made prior to October 1, 1995.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> Although in <em>Winchester v. McCue, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 721, a case also involving a pre-1995 antenuptial agreement, this court applied a plenary standard of review to an issue it characterized as a mixed question of law and fact, our Supreme Court has not definitively addressed the standard of review to be applied when reviewing a court\u2019s determination not to enforce an antenuptial agreement according to <em>McHugh.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> The majority reads this finding by the court to mean that the court did not find either party at fault for the marital breakdown. We are not free, in my view, to pick and choose among the trial court\u2019s factual findings to bolster our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> After the judgment, but prior to the appeal, the defendant filed a motion for articulation, requesting that the court explain the unforeseen nature of the change the court had found in the economic circumstances of the parties. As there was no appeal filed, the court declined to articulate its decision at that time but stated that it would grant a motion for articulation if and when an appeal was filed. The defendant subsequently filed his appeal but failed to request an articulation from the court. To the extent that the court\u2019s decision is ambiguous in this regard, it was the defendant\u2019s responsibility to seek to have it clarified. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 61-10 and 66-5. \u201c[W]e read an ambiguous record, in the absence of a motion for articulation, to support rather than to undermine the judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zabaneh </em>v. <em>Dan Beard Associates, LLC, </em>105 Conn.
