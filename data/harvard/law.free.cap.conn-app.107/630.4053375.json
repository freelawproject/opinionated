He did not request a postponement, and the matter proceeded as scheduled in his absence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b656-9\">PELLEGRINO, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiU\">In this consolidated appeal, the defendant, Domingos Cameiro, appeals from orders made regarding the custody and support of the parties\u2019 minor children. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) improperly determined his earning capacity to be $75,000, (2) improperly issued a supplemental support order applicable to his future commissions, (3) abused its discretion in awarding sole legal custody of his three minor children to the plaintiff, Bertha Gentile, (4) improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff and (5) improperly calculated his modified support obligation. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. The plaintiff and the defendant engaged in a three and one-half year relationship that produced three children. The plaintiff and the parties\u2019 three children currently live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>in Arizona,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>while the defendant resides in Connecticut. The parties are not, and never have been, married to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">On August 17, 2004, the plaintiff filed a complaint for sole custody, support and other relief for her three minor children bom of the defendant. Protracted discovery ensued, and, on September 20, 2006, the court held its final hearing on the plaintiffs complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that hearing, the plaintiff and the defendant testified and also offered the testimony of one witness each.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">On September 28,2006, the court issued its memorandum of decision. The court found that beginning in 1989, the defendant operated his own carting business, known as D.C. Carting, Inc. (D.C. Carting). During the years 2001 through 2004, his net personal income from his carting business fluctuated from $80,000 to $278,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ***On December 31, 2005, D.C. Carting went out of business, and the defendant did not thereafter engage in other full-time employment. On the basis of the defendant\u2019s background and experience, the court imputed to him an earning capacity of at least $75,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The court found that the plaintiff has three children from a prior marriage and currently lives in Arizona with her husband and six children. Her only sources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>of income are the pendente lite child support payments received from the defendant and $157 weekly child support received from her previous husband. The plaintiff is not employed and is a homemaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The court then made twelve separate orders, four of which are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. Specifically, the court ordered that (1) the plaintiff shall have sole legal and physical custody of the minor children, (2) the defendant shall pay $350 per week to the plaintiff for current child support, (3) the defendant shall pay, within ninety days, $6125 toward the plaintiffs counsel fees and (4) the defendant shall pay, within ninety days, $5000 toward costs incurred by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">On October 3, 2006, the defendant filed a motion to reargue, claiming, in part, that he has three additional minor children who are not the issue of the plaintiff and who were not accounted for in the court\u2019s ruling. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to reargue limited to the issues regarding the actual number of children that the defendant has and the amount of the child support award. On October 23, 2006, before the parties reargued the case, the defendant filed an appeal, with the docket number AC 28165, in which he challenged the court\u2019s September 28, 2006 ruling. On November 6, 2006, after the parties reargued the case, the court modified its weekly child support order to $346, retroactive to the date of its initial support order, to account for the defendant\u2019s three additional children.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The next day, November 7, 2006, the defendant filed a motion for modification of the court\u2019s support order on the basis of a substantial change in circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The defendant claimed that his income was substantially lower than the $75,000 earning capacity the court imputed to him. On November 21,2006, before the court ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion for modification, he filed a second appeal, with docket number AC 28270, which raised the same issues that were raised in AC 28165. On January 18, 2007, the court held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">On February 21, 2007, the court issued its ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for modification. The court found that the defendant currently is employed by Associated Carting, doing collections, sales dispatch and solicitation of new accounts. His gross weekly income from his employment is $600, and his net weekly income is $508. In addition to his weekly income, the defendant is entitled to a commission on an annualized basis. His commission is equal to one sixth of the value of all new accounts he solicits that continue to do business with Associated Carting for at least one year, minus $2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">On the basis of the defendant\u2019s net weekly income of $508, the court ordered the defendant to pay $207 per week as child support. The court also issued a supplemental order requiring the defendant to pay as additional child support 50 percent of the first $20,000 in aggregate commissions that he is entitled to receive and 25 percent of any aggregate commissions in excess of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>On March 12, 2007, the defendant filed an amended appeal in AC 28165, claiming that the court improperly calculated the weekly support order of $207 and challenging the court\u2019s supplemental support order. Subsequently, AC 28165 and AC 28270 were consolidated under Practice Book \u00a7 61-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The defendant\u2019s consolidated appeal challenges both factual findings and legal conclusions of the court. Specifically, the defendant claims that the court (1) improperly determined that his earning capacity was $75,000, (2) improperly issued a supplemental order applicable to his future commissions, (3) abused its discretion in awarding sole legal custody of the children to the plaintiff, (4) improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff and (5) improperly determined his modified support obligation of $207 per week. We disagree with all the defendant\u2019s claims except the one pertaining to the court\u2019s supplemental order.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">At the outset, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cAs has been repeatedly stated by this court, judicial review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of its broad discretion in domestic relations cases is limited to the questions of whether the [trial] court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have concluded as it did. . . . Our function in reviewing such discretionary decisions is to determine whether the decision of the trial court was clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record. . . . With respect to the financial awards in a [child support matter], great weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of its opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence. . . . For that reason, we allow every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the correctness of [the trial court\u2019s] action.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brent </em>v. <em>Lebowitz, </em>67 Conn. App. 527, 529-30, 787 A.2d 621, cert. granted on other grounds, 260 Conn. 902, 793 A.2d 1087 (2002) (appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>withdrawn April 25, 2002). Mindful of these principles, we turn to the issues at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly imputed to him an earning capacity of $75,000. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the record. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">In its September 28, 2006 support order, the court made the following findings: \u201cThe defendant is forty-four years of age. He was bom in Portugal. He lived there until age eight when he came to Bridgeport .... He has lived in Connecticut ever since. He attended public schools and completed the tenth grade. At [age] sixteen, he dropped out of school and went to work full-time. He has no other formal education. He worked various menial jobs until he was employed by the city of Bridgeport as a driver. After thirteen to fourteen years, he left the employ of the city of Bridgeport in 1995 to engage full-time in his own carting business known as D.C. Carting .... He started the business in 1989 and has engaged in it part-time while working full-time for the city of Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s business receipts to D.C. Carting . . . were largely in the form of cash payments. He took numerous and large loans from his solely owned business to pay his personal expenses. During the years 2001 through 2004, the defendant\u2019s net personal income from his carting business fluctuated from $80,000 to $278,000 per year. On December 31, 2005, D.C. Carting went out of business, and the defendant has not engaged in full-time employment since then. . . . Since December 31, 2005, the defendant has not made a significant or good faith effort to find regular employment. . . . He knows people who will hire him when he is ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>to work full-time, but he is not ready yet to work full-time.\u201d The court then concluded that the defendant is able to work a minimum of forty hours per week and, on the basis of his background and experience, has an earning capacity of at least $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\u201c[T]he court may base financial awards on earning capacity rather than actual earned income of the parties. . . . While there is no fixed standard for the determination of an individual\u2019s earning capacity ... it is well settled that earning capacity is not an amount which a person can theoretically earn, nor is it confined to actual income, but rather it is an amount which a person can realistically be expected to earn considering such things as his vocational skills, employability, age and health.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carasso </em>v. <em>Carasso, </em>80 Conn. App. 299, 305, 834 A.2d 793 (2003) , cert. denied, 267 Conn. 913, 840 A.2d 1174 (2004) . \u201c[T]he court may consider earning capacity from employment when the evidence shows that the reported amount of earnings is unreasonable. Thus, for example, when a person is, by education and experience, capable of realizing substantially greater earnings simply by applying himself or herself, the court has demonstrated a willingness to frame its orders on capacity rather than actual earnings.\u201d <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, 87 </em>Conn. App. 699, 706, 867 A.2d 111 (2005), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 280 Conn. 764, 911 A.2d 1077, after remand, 104 Conn. App. 482, 934 A.2d 306 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 911, 943 A.2d 472 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">On appeal, the defendant has failed to demonstrate how the court\u2019s finding that he has an earning capacity of $75,000 per year was clearly erroneous. Although the defendant claims that imputing to him an earning capacity of $75,000 is unrealistic given his limited education and vocational skills, he does not challenge the court\u2019s findings that his net personal income fluctuated from $80,000 to $278,000 per year between the years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>2001 and 2004. Furthermore, the court heard expert testimony that estimated the defendant\u2019s income in 2005 to be $79,000. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the court\u2019s imputing an earning capacity of $75,000 to the defendant has no reasonable basis in fact. The court\u2019s finding that the defendant has an earning capacity of $75,000, therefore, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the court\u2019s order impermissibly deviated from the child support and arrearage guidelines (guidelines).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims that the court (1) failed to include his commissions as a part of its current support order and (2) issued a supplemental support order that is not generally consistent with the guidelines. We agree with the latter portion of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of these issues. The court found that in addition to his weekly salary from Associated Carting, the defendant is entitled to a commission on an annualized basis. His commission is equal to one sixth of the value of all new accounts he solicits and that continue to do business with Associated Carting for at least one year, minus $2000. Since November 1, 2006, the defendant solicited on average three new accounts per month and believes he can continue to solicit \u201cat least\u201d three new accounts each month. The value of these accounts ranges from $80 to $240.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>On the basis of its findings, the court issued a supplemental order requiring the defendant to pay a percentage of his future commissions as child support in addition to his basic weekly support obligation of $207. Under the supplemental order, the defendant is required to pay 50 percent of the first $20,000 in aggregate commissions that he is entitled to receive and 25 percent of any commission in excess of $20,000 that he is entitled to receive. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court was required to include his commissions in the figure used to calculate his basic weekly support obligation rather than make them subject to a supplemental order. He also claims that if a supplemental order was proper, the court\u2019s order was not of a percentage that is generally consistent with the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Resolution of this issue requires us to interpret the statutory scheme that governs child support determinations in Connecticut and, therefore, is a question of law. See <em>Unkelbach </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>244 Conn. 350, 357, 710 A.2d 717 (1998). The standard of appellate review governing questions of law dictates that \u201c[wjhere the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cWhen the question of law involves statutory interpretation, that determination is guided by well settled principles.\u201d Id. In construing statutes, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Moreover, our rules of statutory construction apply to administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>regulations. <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Marcinek, </em>226 Conn. 737, 744 n.8, 629 A.2d 350 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Our examination of the guidelines leads us to conclude that the court properly subjected the defendant\u2019s commissions to a supplemental order but that the court\u2019s order impermissibly deviated from the guidelines. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The first portion of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the court improperly issued a supplemental order applicable to his future commissions. The defendant claims that the guidelines define gross income as including commissions, and, therefore, his future commissions must be included as part of his basic support obligation and not part of a supplemental order. We disagree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Although it is true that our regulations define \u201cgross income\u201d as \u201cthe average weekly earned and unearned income from all sources before deductions, including but not limited to the items listed in subparagraph (A)\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-l (11); and sub-paragraph (A) includes \u201ccommissions, bonuses and tips\u201d; id., \u00a7 46b-215a-l (11) (A) (iii);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>make clear that only income with a reasonably ascertainable value may be included in gross income. See Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines, preamble, \u00a7 (g), p. ix.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s future commissions are of an unknown amount and, therefore, may not be included in his gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The guidelines effective August 1, 2005, provide that the court may, in appropriate cases, enter a supplemental support order requiring a parent to pay a percentage of a future lump sum payment of an unknown amount that he expects to receive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-2b.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The guidelines explain that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201c[w]hile the expected amount may be substantial, the indeterminate nature of such payment precludes its inclusion in the gross income of the parent expected to receive it.\u201d Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines, preamble, \u00a7 (g) (6), p. ix. A supplemental order treats the unknown future lump sum payment separately from the basic current support order and is intended to account only for those instances in which \u201cthe parties have knowledge of an anticipated future lump sum payment of an unknown amount, such as a bonus.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In the present case, it is undisputed that the defendant\u2019s future commissions are of an indeterminate amount.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court was permitted to craft a supplemental support order to account for these future lump sum payments of an unknown amount. The court, therefore, was not required to include the defendant\u2019s commissions in his gross income, and this portion of the defendant\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The next portion of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the court\u2019s supplemental support order is not generally consistent with the guidelines and, therefore, is invalid. We agree with the defendant, albeit for differing reasons, and conclude that the court (1) impermissibly based its supplemental order on his gross commissions, rather than his net commissions, and (2) improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ordered him to pay an excessive percentage of his future commissions as supplemental support.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We note at the outset that the legal issue that confronts us is mor\u00e9 easily stated than resolved. After a court determines that a supplemental order is appropriate because a parent expects to receive a future payment of an indeterminate amount, the court may enter an order that the parent pay a percentage of that future payment as supplemental support upon receipt of the payment. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-2b (c) (1) (B). The regulations provide that the percentage must be <em>generally consistent </em>with the schedule in subsection (f) of the guidelines. Id. In the present case, the court ordered the defendant to pay 50 percent of the first $20,000 in aggregate commissions that he is entitled to receive and 25 percent of any commission in excess of $20,000 that he is entitled to receive. Our task, therefore, is to determine whether the court\u2019s supplemental order is of a percentage that is generally consistent with the schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The guidelines neither define nor provide express guidance on what the phrase \u201cgenerally consistent\u201d means. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cgenerally,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cin a general manner\u201d and \u201cas a whole.\u201d The word \u201cconsistent\u201d means \u201cmarked by harmony, regularity, or steady continuity throughout . . . showing no significant change, unevenness, or contradiction.\u201d Id. A supplemental order, therefore, is generally consistent with the schedule when it is of a percentage that, as a whole, is in harmony with the schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The schedule itself is a seven page table listing the basic child support obligation for parents of varying income levels. See Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines, pp. 10-17. The left column contains rows listing the parents\u2019 combined net weekly income, beginning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>with $50 and increasing in $10 increments to $4000. The other six columns provide the support obligation for parents supporting from one to six children. To determine a parent\u2019s basic child support obligation, the guidelines instruct a user to find the block in the schedule that corresponds to the combined net weekly income of the parents and the number of children whose support is being determined. The element that corresponds to the parents\u2019 combined net weekly income and their number of children provides the presumptive current support obligation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The schedule expresses the support obligation as both a dollar figure and a percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We conclude that the court\u2019s supplemental order is not generally consistent with the schedule for two reasons. First, the court\u2019s order is based on the defendant\u2019s gross commissions, rather than his net commissions. Second, the court\u2019s supplemental order unfairly burdens the defendant with too high a percentage support obligation. We address each of these conclusions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Although the unique variables involved in crafting a supplemental order make defining the contours of \u201cgenerally consistent\u201d elusively difficult, \u201c[i]t is well settled that a court must base its child support and alimony orders on the available net income of the parties, not gross income. <em>Collette </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>177 Conn. 465, 469, 418 A.2d 891 (1979).\u201d <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>95 Conn. App. 200, 204, 895 A.2d 274, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 902, 907 A. 2d 90 (2006). To that end, the schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>used to determine a parent\u2019s child support obligation is based on the parents\u2019 combined net weekly income, rather than gross weekly income.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In the present case, the court\u2019s order required the defendant to pay a percentage of his aggregate yearly commissions but did not permit him to subtract from this amount any allowable deductions. The result is that the court\u2019s supplemental order was based on the defendant\u2019s gross commissions. Although an order incorporating a percentage of any commission payment is certainly the scenario contemplated by the commission for child support guidelines in drafting the regulations, the use of the defendant\u2019s gross commissions is not generally consistent with the schedule in subsection (f). Because this issue will likely arise on remand, we take this opportunity to comment on the net value of a future payment of an indeterminate amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Net income is defined in the regulations as gross income minus allowable deductions. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-l (17); see also id., \u00a7 46b-215a-l (1) (A) through (J) (listing allowable deductions). Similarly, the net value of a future payment of an indeterminate amount is equal to the payment\u2019s gross value minus allowable deductions. We believe that for a supplemental order to be of a percentage that is generally consistent with the schedule, potential allowable deductions must be accounted for in a meaningful way. A court\u2019s use of gross income to calculate a supplemental order renders the supplemental order invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">When crafting a supplemental order, a court should be mindful that a supplemental order is a tool of convenience that is intended to account for future payments of an unknown amount before the payments are received. Absent a supplemental order, each time a future payment of an unknown amount was received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>by a parent, the parties would have to return to court to modify the current support order to reflect the parent\u2019s receipt of additional income. A supplemental order saves the parties from having to return to court by accounting for a future payment of an unknown amount before the payment\u2019s receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">It is difficult, however, for a court to determine the exact value of allowable deductions before knowing the exact value of a future lump sum payment. The very nature of many allowable deductions renders their value unknown until the value of the future payment becomes known.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A supplemental order, however, need not account exactly for all of a parent\u2019s allowable deductions\u2014the regulations mandate only that the order be of a percentage that is generally consistent with the schedule. A court may fulfill this mandate by approximating what deductions will be allowable from a future lump sum payment and then tailoring its order accordingly.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although we decline to dictate how a court should account for allowable deductions, we believe that, in some instances, it may be appropriate to issue a supplemental order that preserves the ratio of net income to gross income found in the current support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In the present case, the court\u2019s supplemental order fails to account for any allowable deductions that the defendant may take from his future gross commissions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The court\u2019s failure to account for allowable deductions burdens the defendant with a support obligation that is not generally consistent with the schedule. Accordingly, the court\u2019s supplemental order is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">A valid supplemental order must account for a parent\u2019s declining percentage support obligation that accompanies an increase in income. The court\u2019s two tiered supplemental order is not of a percentage that is generally consistent with the schedule because it burdens the defendant with an excessive percentage support obligation at all income levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The guidelines are based on the premise that a parent with a high net income pays a lower percentage of his income for child support as compared to an obligor with a lower net income.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The preamble explains that \u201c[i]n general, the economic studies have found that spending on children declines as a proportion of family income as that income increases . . . .\u201d Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines, preamble, \u00a7 (d), p. iii. Toward this end, the schedule imposes a declining percentage support obligation on a parent as his income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>increases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The percentage support obligations listed in the schedule range from between 41.67 percent for parents with a combined net weekly income of $330 to 17.16 percent for parents with a combined net weekly income of $4000.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The guidelines also contain provisions for those instances in which an obligor\u2019s income exceeds the range of the schedule. See Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines, preamble, \u00a7 (e) (6), p. vi (\u201cthe amount of support prescribed at the $4,000 level is presumed to be the minimum that should be ordered in such cases\u201d). In light of the mandate contained in the regulations that a supplemental order must be of a percentage that is generally consistent with the schedule; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-2b (c) (1) (B); we believe that a supplemental order must account for the schedule\u2019s inverse relationship between a parent\u2019s net income and his weekly support obligation, while also accounting for those instances in which a future payment of unknown amount exceeds the range of the schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In the present case, the court\u2019s supplemental order required the defendant to pay 50 percent of the first $20,000 in aggregate commissions that he is entitled to receive and 25 percent of any commission in excess of $20,000 that he is entitled to receive. Although the court\u2019s two tiered methodology attempted to account for the schedule\u2019s inverse relationship between net income and an obligor\u2019s weekly support obligation, we cannot say that the supplemental order is generally consistent with the schedule. No matter how large or small the defendant\u2019s commission, he is obligated to pay as supplemental support 50 percent of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>$20,000 and 25 percent of any amount over $20,000. We conclude that the court\u2019s order excessively burdened the defendant by obligating him to pay too high a percentage of his future commissions as supplemental support. No matter what the actual value of the defendant\u2019s future commission, he will always be obligated to pay as support a higher percentage than what the schedule mandates. This is an impermissible deviation from the income allocation that the legislature has decided is appropriate. See <em>Unkelbach </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 357-58 (inteipretation of guidelines must seek to preserve allocation of resources that legislature decided appropriate). Furthermore, the supplemental order did not account for those instances in which the defendant\u2019s commissions exceed the range of the schedule. Accordingly, we conclude that the court\u2019s supplemental order is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">On remand, the court should craft a supplemental order that requires the defendant to pay a declining percentage of supplemental support as the future lump sum payment increases while also accounting for those instances in which the future lump sum payment exceeds the range of the schedule. The percentages in the court\u2019s order should be within the range utilized by the schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The final component of the defendant\u2019s claim requires us to determine whether on remand the court must reconsider all of its financial orders. Financial orders concerning child support obligations are often described as \u201centirely interwoven\u201d and as \u201ca carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>249 Conn. 265, 277, 752 A.2d 1023 (1999) (citing cases). \u201cConsequently, when an appellate court reverses a trial court judgment based on an improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>alimony, property distribution, or child support award, the appellate court\u2019s remand typically authorizes the trial court to reconsider all of the financial orders. . . . Every improper order, however, does not necessarily merit a reconsideration of all of the trial court\u2019s financial orders. A financial order is severable when it is not in any way interdependent with other orders and is not improperly based on a factor that is linked to other factors.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In the present case, the court determined its supplemental order apart from its other financial orders. As a result, reversing the judgment only insofar as it relates to that order does not undermine the other financial orders because its impropriety does not place the correctness of the other orders in question. See id., 279. We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s supplemental order is severable from all the other financial orders made by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court abused its discretion in awarding the plaintiff sole legal custody of the parties\u2019 three minor children.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Specifically, he claims that the evidence in the record does not support the court\u2019s ruling. Because we find the record inadequate, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">In its memorandum of decision, the court ordered that the plaintiff shall have sole legal and physical custody of the minor children and that the defendant shall have reasonable rights of visitation. Although the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>made numerous findings of fact regarding both the plaintiff and the defendant, the court did not state the factual basis for its custody award. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (b) provides that the court in making or modifying custody orders shall consider the rights and responsibilities of both parents and shall enter orders that serve the best interests of the children. \u201cThe controlling principle in a determination respecting custody is that the court shall be guided by the best interests of the child.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>68 Conn. App. 173, 187, 789 A.2d 1104, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 910, 796 A.2d 556 (2002). The record before us is silent as to the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\u201cIt is the appellant\u2019s burden to supply us with a record adequate to provide a proper review, and, [w]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is unclear, proper utilization of the motion for articulation serves to dispel any such ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ashton </em>v. <em>Ashton, </em>31 Conn. App. 736, 741, 627 A.2d 943, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 901, 634 A.2d 295 (1993). \u201cOur role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court, either on its own or in response to a proper motion for articulation, any decision made by us respecting this claim would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westfall v. Westfall, </em>46 Conn. App. 182, 184, 698 A.2d 927 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">It was the defendant\u2019s burden, as the appellant, to file a motion for articulation that would clarify the trial court\u2019s basis for and reasoning behind its awarding sole legal and physical custody to the plaintiff. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5; <em>Gelormino </em>v. <em>Liberman, </em>36 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>153, 154 n.1, 649 A.2d 259, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 946, 653 A.2d 826 (1994). Without such an articulation, it is unclear how the court determined that awarding sole custody to the plaintiff was in the children\u2019s best interests. There is no adequate record permitting review of this claim, and the defendant failed to file a motion for articulation. Therefore, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that the court improperly awarded $6125 in counsel fees and $5000 in costs to the plaintiff. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 vests in the trial court the discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees in custody proceedings.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court has included within the definition of attorney\u2019s fees allowable under \u00a7 46b-62 certain costs of litigation, including expert witness fees. <em>See Eslami </em>v. Eslami, 218 Conn. 801, 819-21, 591 A.2d 411 (1991); <em>Medvey </em>v. <em>Medvey, </em>98 Conn. App. 278, 287, 908 A.2d 1119 (2006). The criteria to be considered in determining whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees is appropriate include \u201cthe age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability [and] estate and needs of each of the parties . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82. We review the court\u2019s awarding of attorney\u2019s fees under the abuse of discretion standard. See <em>Medvey </em>v. <em>Medvey, </em>supra, 287-88. The ultimate issue in our review, therefore, is whether the court reasonably could have concluded as it did. Id., 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">In the present case, the court reasonably could have concluded as it did. The record supports the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>finding that the plaintiff had no income other than the child support she received from the defendant and her previous husband, and that the defendant was five weeks in arrears and owed the plaintiff $1750 in past due child support. There also is ample evidence in the record demonstrating the defendant\u2019s financial status and earning capacity. On the basis of those considerations, it was reasonable for the court to have determined that counsel fees of $6125 and expert witness fees of $5000 should be allowed. Furthermore, the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that the defendant pay the award within ninety days. The court found that the defendant had liquid assets that he did not disclose on his financial affidavit and, on that basis, reasonably could have concluded as it did. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion when awarding the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The defendant\u2019s fifth claim is that the court improperly failed to follow the guidelines in ruling on his motion for modification. Specifically, the defendant claims that the order requiring him to pay $207 per week in child support is an impermissible deviation from the guidelines. We will not review this claim because the defendant failed to submit a child support guidelines worksheet as required by Practice Book \u00a7 25-30 (e).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">In a motion for modification proceeding, the parties have an affirmative obligation to submit to the court certain sworn statements concerning income, expenses, assets and liabilities, as well as a child support guidelines worksheet. See Practice Book \u00a7 25-30. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Favrow </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>231 Conn. 1, 29, 647 A.2d 731 (1994), our Supreme Court stressed adherence by the trial court to observe the procedures set out in the child support guidelines to facilitate appellate review. Recently, in <em>Bee </em>v. <em>Bee, 79 </em>Conn. App. 783, 787-88, 831 A.2d 833, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 932, 837 A.2d 805 (2003), we concluded that a party who fails to submit a child support guidelines worksheet is precluded from complaining of the alleged failure of the trial court to comply with the guidelines and that we will not review such a claim.\u201d <em>Kunajukr </em>v. <em>Kunajukr, </em>83 Conn. App. 478, 485, 850 A.2d 227, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 903, 859 A.2d 562 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Although the record before us contains financial affidavits that each party filed with the court on January 18, 2007, our review of the record fails to reveal the defendant\u2019s child support guidelines worksheet.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The defendant has failed to provide any meaningful distinction between this case and <em>Bee. </em>Accordingly, we decline to review his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The judgment is reversed only as to the supplemental child support order and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\"> At the time the complaint was filed, the three minor children were residents of Connecticut.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b657-10\"> The facts of this case reveal that the defendant failed to comply with many of the plaintiffs discovery requests. In addition, on four separate occasions, the court ordered the defendant to provide the plaintiff with certain financial documents that were requested by her accountant and needed to value his business. The defendant failed to comply fully with the court\u2019s orders. The record also reveals that the plaintiff filed fourteen motions for contempt against, the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-15\"> The court, also found that the defendant had income and assets that he failed to disclose on his financial affidavit. In particular, the court found that the defendant receives additional cash income from garbage pickups that he makes but cannot provide accurate, reliable or credible figures as to how much cash he receives in this manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) permits the court to modify child support orders in two alternative circumstances. Pursuant to this statute, a court may not modify a child support order unless there is first either \u201c(1) a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or (2) a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines . . . .\u201d <em>Santoro </em>v. <em>Santoro, </em>70 Conn. App. 212, 218, 797 A.2d 592 (2002). \u201cBoth the substantial change of circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>and the substantial deviation from child support guidelines provision establish the authority of the trial court to modify existing child support orders to respond to changed economic conditions. The first allows the court to modify a support order when the financial circumstances of the individual parties have changed, regardless of their prior contemplation of such changes. The second allows the court to modify child support orders that were once deemed appropriate but no longer seem equitable in the light of changed social or economic circumstances in the society as a whole . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Syragakis </em>v. <em>Syragakis, </em>79 Conn.

Contrary to the plaintiffs assertions, however, the defendant\u2019s claim is justiciable because it is capable of resolution on the merits by judicial action.

See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-3. Because we find that the court properly issued a supplemental order, the court did not deviate from the guidelines.
