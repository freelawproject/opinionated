On appeal, the petitioner claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that the court improperly granted the motion in limine of the respondent state\u2019s attorney<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to preclude certain out-of-court statements from the hearing on his petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s appeal. After a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of felony murder, robbery in the first degree and five counts of tampering with a witness. This court affirmed his conviction on appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>77 Conn. App. 778, 825 A.2d 835, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 906, 832 A.2d 73 (2003). In that case, this court set forth the following facts concerning the underlying events. In January, 1999, at the petitioner\u2019s request, Nicole Harris drove to Danbury and picked up the petitioner and his cousin, Tommie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>L. Martin. Id., 781. Harris then drove the petitioner and Martin to a gasoline station located next to Gallo\u2019s Hi-Way Package Store in Danbury. Id. The petitioner and Martin subsequently entered the store, fatally shot Robert Gallo, took money from the cash register and took two bottles of brandy. Id. The petitioner subsequently told Harris that he and Martin were involved in the robbery and shooting. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Two days later, the petitioner called Harris and told her to come to his apartment to pick up something. Id. When she arrived, the petitioner handed Harris a shoebox containing a .25 caliber handgun wrapped in a towel. Id., 782. In March, 1999, Harris turned the gun over to the police, and ballistics tests confirmed that it had been used to fire the bullets that killed Gallo. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Prior to a hearing on the petition for a new trial, the Danbury police department obtained and executed a search warrant for the residence shared by the petitioner and Martin. Id. The police seized a sawed-off shotgun, a box of .25 caliber ammunition, a .22 caliber firearm and a magazine for a .22 caliber firearm. Id. Subsequent laboratory analysis of the bullets recovered from the victim\u2019s body and those in a box of .25 caliber cartridges found at the petitioner\u2019s apartment revealed their chemical elements to be indistinguishable. Id. They all had come from that box of ammunition. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 and Practice Book \u00a7 42-55, the petitioner instituted the present action by filing a petition for a new trial dated March 29, 2001, in which he requested a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. Specifically, he alleged that while incarcerated, Terrell Stanton had made statements to a third party exculpating the petitioner and incriminating himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Prior to a hearing on his petition for a new trial, the petitioner deposed former prison inmate Douglas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Mayne. Mayne testified that he had been incarcerated with Stanton in the same dormitory facility for two to four months. He testified that prior to their incarceration together, he \u201cknew of\u2019 Stanton but did not \u201chang out\u201d with him. According to Mayne\u2019s testimony, Stanton specifically told him that he had hidden under a house in Danbury a .25 caliber revolver, which Stanton stated was the handgun that was used in the Gallo murder. Mayne testified that Stanton told him, \u201c[i]f they find that gun, I\u2019m going to jail for life.\u201d Mayne also testified that in reference to the Gallo murder, Stanton stated: \u201cI did it . . . .\u201d Mayne testified on cross-examination that although he made it appear to Stanton that he could be trusted, they were not friends. Mayne further testified on cross-examination that prisoners are known to exaggerate their crimes to gain respect in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">On August 8, 2005, the respondent filed a motion in limine to preclude the petitioner from admitting that portion of Mayne\u2019s testimony recounting what Stanton allegedly had said to him. After reviewing Mayne\u2019s deposition, the court granted the respondent\u2019s motion in limine. It reasoned that Stanton\u2019s statements did not satisfy the trustworthiness component necessary for the admission of statements against penal interest under \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. The court thereafter denied the petition for a new trial and granted certification to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly granted the respondent\u2019s motion in limine. More specifically, the petitioner claims that the precluded portion of Mayne\u2019s testimony was admissible as a statement against penal interest and thus fell under an exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to \u00a7 8-6 (4). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">\u201c[I]n order to admit a third party statement against penal interest, the trial court must determine first, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the declarant is unavailable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, the trial court must find that the declarant\u2019s out-of-court statement was trustworthy by considering the following factors in the context of the totality of the circumstances: (1) the time of the declaration and the party to whom the declaration was made; (2) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case; and (3) the extent to which the declaration is against the declarant\u2019s penal interest.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>254 Conn. 309, 316, 757 A.2d 542 (2000); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). \u201cNo single factor in the test for determining trustworthiness is necessarily conclusive . . . the factors are reflective of the fact that there can be no precise formulation of the proof which would constitute sufficient evidence of the trustworthiness of such declarations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>L\u2019Minggio, </em>71 Conn. App. 656, 666, 803 A.2d 408, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 902, 810 A.2d 270 (2002). \u201c[T]he determination whether a third party declaration against penal interest is trustworthy lies in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 155, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">A review of the factors considered by the court when weighing the trustworthiness of Stanton\u2019s statements leads us to conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the statements. First, the court properly considered the time of the declaration and the party to whom the declaration was made. Mayne testified that he and Stanton had no relationship prior to being incarcerated together for two to four months in the same dormitory facility. Statements made by a declarant to fellow inmates have been considered untrustworthy. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 453, 426 A.2d 799 (1980) (declarations against penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>interest untrustworthy when, inter alia, confessions made to fellow inmate); <em>Morant </em>v. <em>State, </em>68 Conn. App. 137, 172, 802 A.2d 93 (exclusion of third party confession proper when, inter alia, declarant confided not in close friends but in fellow inmate), cert. denied, 260 Conn. 914, 796 A. 2d 558, overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Conn. 811, 830 n.13, 792 A.2d 797 (2002). The fact that the statements allegedly made by Stanton were made to a fellow inmate, with whom Stanton did not have a close relationship, weighs against their trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The timing of Stanton\u2019s statements further detracts from their reliability. \u201cIn general, declarations made soon after the crime suggest more reliability than those made after a lapse of time where a declarant has a more ample opportunity for reflection and contrivance. . . . [See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>277 Conn. 42, 70-72, 890 A.2d 474, cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1197, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006)] (statements made within couple of weeks of homicide trustworthy); see also <em>[State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>268 Conn. 351, 370, 844 A.2d 191 (2004)] (statements made within five months trustworthy).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Camacho, </em>282 Conn. 328, 361, 924 A.2d 99, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 956, 128 S. Ct. 388, 169 L. Ed. 2d 273 (2007). The court found that Stanton\u2019s statements occurred approximately twenty-two months after the murder, well into or after the petitioner\u2019s trial. This significant lapse of time suggests a lack of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We next examine whether there is corroborating evidence in the case. \u201cThe corroboration requirement . . . is significant and goes beyond minimal corroboration.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>218 Conn. 239, 249, 588 A.2d 1066 (1991). \u201cThird party statements exculpating an accused are [especially] suspect . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Morant </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 171. Stanton\u2019s out-of-court statements, in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>allegedly asserted that he had murdered Gallo, exculpate the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Our examination of the record reveals that the court properly found that Stanton\u2019s statements were not only not significantly corroborated by other evidence but were significantly contradicted. According to Mayne\u2019s testimony, Stanton relayed to him few details concerning the murder other than to confess that he \u201cdid it . . . .\u201d Mayne testified that Stanton identified the murder weapon as a \u201csmall caliber\u201d revolver and stated that it was hidden under a house in Danbury. This is in contradiction to the uncontroverted evidence at trial, which was that the murder weapon was a .25 caliber semiautomatic Titan handgun that Harris had turned over to the police as evidence approximately three months after the murder. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 806-14. Later ballistics tests confirmed that it had been used to fire the bullets that killed Gallo. Id., 782. Subsequent laboratory analysis of the box of .25 caliber cartridges found at the petitioner\u2019s apartment revealed that the bullets recovered from the victim\u2019s body had come from that box of ammunition. Id. The murder weapon was admitted as an exhibit in the petitioner\u2019s trial. Consequently, the second consideration also counsels strongly against the admission of Stanton\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Although Stanton\u2019s statement that he \u201cdid it\u201d is against his penal interest, the first two factors support the court\u2019s determination that Stanton\u2019s statements were untrustworthy. \u201cNo single factor in the test for determining trustworthiness is necessarily conclusive . . . the factors are reflective of the fact that there can be no precise formulation of the proof which would constitute sufficient evidence of the trustworthiness of such declarations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>L\u2019Minggio, </em>supra, 71 Conn. App. 666. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>discretion in granting the respondent\u2019s motion in limine to preclude Stanton\u2019s statements against penal interest on the ground that they were untrustworthy. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\"> The respondents are Walter D. Flanagan, the former state\u2019s attorney for the judicial district of Danbury, and the secretary of the state, who adopted Flanagan\u2019s answer to the petition for a new trial. We refer in this opinion to Flanagan as the respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\"> Apparently, the court\u2019s granting of the respondent\u2019s motion in limine eliminated all or most of the petitioner\u2019s evidence. The petitioner stated at oral argument before this court that the only evidence that he wanted to introduce at the hearing on his petition for a new trial was precluded by the court\u2019s granting of the respondent\u2019s motion. After the court granted the respondent\u2019s motion in limine, the petitioner asked for the court\u2019s ruling on the petition for a new trial, and the court subsequently denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The petitioner also claims on appeal that the court improperly denied his petition for a new trial. Because we conclude that the statements properly were precluded, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying the petition. See, e.g., <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>State, </em>88 Conn. App. 572, 577, 870 A.2d 1109 (\u201cThe standard that governs the granting of a petition for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is well established. The petitioner must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) the proffered evidence is newly discovered, such that it could not have been discovered earlier by the exercise of due diligence; (2) it would be material on a new trial; (3) it is not merely cumulative; and (4) it is likely to produce a different result in a new trial. ... It is within the discretion of the trial court to determine, upon examination of all the evidence, whether the petitioner has established substantial grounds for a new trial, and the judgment of the. trial court will be set aside on appeal only if it reflects a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert. denied, 274 Conn. 902, 876 A.2d 11 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\"> We note that at the hearing on the respondent\u2019s motion in limine, both parties stipulated that Stanton was unavailable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-16\">See footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
