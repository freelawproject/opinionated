His offense level was enhanced by sixteen under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a conviction of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft, which was determined to be a crime of violence (\u201cCOV\u201d). Morales-Mota ultimately received a forty-six-month sentence, which was at the bottom of the advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-18\">Morales-Mota challenges the enhancement, contending that Texas\u2019s burglary-of-a-habitation offense falls outside the generic, contemporary definition of burglary and thus does not constitute a COV. Because Morales-Mota did not raise that objection in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497-99 (5th Cir.2012). To succeed under that standard, Morales-Mota must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights, but even so, we generally will exercise our discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>fect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) provides for an increase of sixteen to a base offense level if the defendant was previously deported after being convicted of a COV. <em>Among </em>the enumerated COVs listed in the guideline commentary is burglary of a dwelling. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)). To determine whether a particular conviction is for an enumerated COV, we compare the generic, contemporary definition of the enumerated crime with the conduct described in the statute of conviction. <em>United States v. Lopez-DeLeon, </em>513 F.3d 472, 474 (5th Cir.2008). If the statute\u2019s definition of an offense is broader than the generic definition, that offense cannot serve as a predicate for the adjustment. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>667 F.3d 555, 561 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The generic, contemporary definition of burglary of a dwelling is the unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building, structure, tent, or vessel used for human habitation, with intent to commit a crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute of conviction \u2014 Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) \u2014 makes it a crime to enter into a habitation or building not open to the public, without consent of the owner, intending to commit a felony, theft, or assault. Morales-Mota\u2019s argument hinges on the definition of \u201cowner,\u201d which under Texas law includes a person who has \u201ca greater right to possession of the property than the actor.\u201d Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 1.07(35)(A). According to Morales-Mota, because a person can be convicted of burglary of a habitation even if he has a legitimate right to possess the property, the Texas statute is broader than the generic definition of burglary of a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">In <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), we held that burglary of a habitation under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes burglary of a dwelling and supports an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2, but we did not address Morales-Mota\u2019s contention. Recently we rejected a materially indistinguishable argument in <em>United States v. Joslin, </em>487 Fed.Appx. 139, 142-44, No. 11-40863, 2012 WL 3488717, at *3-*4 (5th Cir. Aug. 14, 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished), deciding that Texas\u2019s definition of \u201cowner\u201d did not bring its burglary-of-a-habitation statute outside the generic definition of burglary for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">In <em>Joslin, </em>we relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that Congress listed burglary as an enumerated offense in the ACCA because of its \u201c \u2018inherent potential for harm to persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 2012 WL 3488717 at *3 (quoting <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 588, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). \u201cMerely maintaining an inferior possessory interest in a habitation does not extinguish the potential violence that may result when a person enters a habitation with intent to commit theft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 2012 WL 3488717 at *4. Though <em>Joslin </em>is unpublished and thus not precedential, it is instructive, its reasoning persuasive. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5.4; <em>Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 401 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the enhancement in this ease was proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\">. <em>See United States v.
