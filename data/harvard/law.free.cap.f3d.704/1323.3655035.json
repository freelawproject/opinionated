Specifically, Appellants argue that the district court abused its discretion when it calculated damages based on the net revenue, rather than the profits, Appellants received during the time they controlled the offending enterprise. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-16\">The facts leading up to this appeal are detailed in full in the district court\u2019s April 23, 2012 order. <em>FTC v. Wash. Data Res., </em>856 F.Supp.2d 1247 (M.D.Fla.2012). We recount only those facts pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-17\">Appellants were each involved in the same mortgage loan modification enterprise (the Enterprise), which solicited financially distressed homeowners and offered the possibility of relief through either a loan modification or bankruptcy. The Enterprise caught the eye of the FTC and in 2009, the FTC filed a complaint against Appellants, three other individual defendants, and three corporate defendants. The complaint alleged that Appellants violated section 5(a) of the FTC Act and the TSR, \u00a7\u00a7 310.1-.9, by engaging in deceptive activities relating to their sale and marketing of mortgage relief and home foreclosure services. Following a bench trial in April 2011, Appellants were found liable for violating both section 5(a) and the TSR. In an order dated April 23, 2012, the district court found Bishop and McDaniel jointly and severally liable for $1,974,270, and Caldwell liable for $644,704. The only issue before us today is whether the district court abused its discretion when it ordered Appellants to pay damages equal to the net revenues they received during the period they controlled the Enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-19\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting equitable monetary relief for abuse of discretion. <em>Commodity Futures </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number><em>Trading Comm\u2019n v. Wilshire Inv. Mgmt., </em>531 F.3d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination, or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>In re Red Carpet Corp. of Panama City Beach, </em>902 F.2d 883, 890 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its application of law to facts <em>de novo.\u201d Wilshire Inv. Mgmt., </em>531 F.3d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">Appellants first argue that the district court improperly awarded damages based on consumer losses. Appellants are correct that here, a damages award based on consumer losses would be improper. \u201cThe equitable remedy of restitution does not take into consideration the plaintiffs losses, but only focuses on the defendant\u2019s unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1345. But the district court did not award damages based on consumer loss. The district court awarded damages based on Appellants\u2019 unjust gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">Because each Appellant was liable for a violation of section 5(a) and the TSR, the FTC was entitled to seek relief under both section 13(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53(b), and section 19(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 57b, of the FTC Act. In the district court, the FTC conceded that the record lacked evidence to accurately determine consumer loss and chose not to establish consumer loss. The FTC sought only to disgorge Appellants\u2019 net revenue and thus proceeded to seek relief under section 13(b). Section 13(b) provides \u201can unqualified grant of statutory authority\u201d to issue \u201cthe full range of equitable remedies,\u201d including disgorgement, which considers only the defendants\u2019 unjust gain and ignores consumer loss. <em>FTC v. Gem Merck. Corp., </em>87 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996). Said another way, section 13(b) permits disgorgement measured by the Appellants\u2019 unjust enrichment but prohibits disgorgement measured by consumer loss. Here, the district court properly measured disgorgement by Appellants\u2019 unjust gains, not consumer loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-9\">Appellants further contend that here, \u201cnet revenue is tantamount to consumer loss\u201d because the total net revenue and the total consumer loss is the same.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This argument fails. The district court expressly calculated Appellants\u2019 unjust gains as the measure of equitable relief. <em>See Wash. Data Res., </em>856 F.Supp.2d at 1281. As the Second Circuit found in <em>FTC v. Verity Intern., Ltd., </em>443 F.3d 48, 68 (2nd Cir.2006), \u201cin many cases in which the FTC seeks restitution, the defendant\u2019s gain will be equal to the consumer\u2019s loss because the consumer buys goods or services directly from the defendant.\u201d Thus, it is of no consequence that the measure of Appellants\u2019 unjust gains happens to equal the amount of consumer loss. The district court ultimately\u2014and properly\u2014 based its calculation of damages on Appellants\u2019 unjust gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-11\">Lastly, Appellants aver that the district court erred when it considered the net revenue (gross receipts minus refunds) when it calculated damages. They contend that the district court should have instead considered Appellants\u2019 profits (net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>revenue minus expenses) when it calculated damages. Appellants are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">Other circuits have been presented with this issue and have found a damages award based on net revenue rather than profit proper under Section 13(b). <em>See FTC v. Bronson Partners, LLC, </em>654 F.3d 359, 375 (2d Cir.2011) (holding that defendant was \u201cnot entitled to deduct its expenses from the restitutionary baseline\u201d); <em>FTC v. Direct Mkg. Concepts Inc., </em>624 F.3d 1, 14-16 (1st Cir.2010) (finding no error when district court \u201crest[ed] its damages determination on Defendants\u2019 gross receipts rather than their net profits\u201d); <em>FTC v. Febre, </em>128 F.3d 530, 536 (7th Cir.1997) (upholding district court\u2019s acceptance of magistrate\u2019s finding the appropriate measure of restitution was consumers\u2019 net payments to defendants rather than defendants\u2019 profits.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">We agree with our sister circuits and today hold that the amount of net revenue (gross receipts minus refunds), rather than the amount of profit (net revenue minus expenses), is the correct measure of unjust gains under section 13(b). We echo the Second Circuit\u2019s sentiment that \u201cdefendants in a disgorgement action are not entitled to deduct costs associated with committing their illegal acts.\u201d <em>Bronson Partners, LLC, </em>654 F.3d at 375. Accordingly, the district court did not err when it considered Appellants\u2019 net revenues, instead of their profits, in its calculation for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1342-7\">. The FTC claimed that $3,941,588 was both the Enterprise's net revenue and the consumers' injury. <em>Wash. Data Res., </em>856 F.Supp.2d at 1281. The FTC, however, conceded below that the record lacked evidence to accurately determine consumer loss, chose not to establish consumer loss, and stated that \"consumer losses far exceed Defendants' net revenue. The FTC seeks only to disgorge that net revenue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
