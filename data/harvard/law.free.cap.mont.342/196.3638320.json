We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b62 The State charged Weaver by information on April 21,2005, with Count I, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (\u201cDUI\u201d), fourth or subsequent offense, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 and -731, MCA, and Count II, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-308, MCA. The facts underlying these offenses occurred on or about April 7, 2005. In support of the felony DUI charge, the State alleged that Weaver had been convicted of DUI on four prior occasions: August 5,1994, in Juab County Justice Court, Nephi, Utah; November 20, 1996, in Missoula County Justice Court; June 18, 1997, in Missoula County District Court; and July 15, 1998, in Missoula County Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u00b63 Weaver pleaded not guilty to both counts and thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the DUI charge. He asserted that two of his alleged prior DUI convictions-specifically, the 1994 and 1996 convictions-were invalid and could not be used as the basis for a charge of felony DUI (i.e., fourth or subsequent offense) in this case. (He did not dispute the 1997 or 1998 convictions.) In responding to Weaver\u2019s motion, the State elected not to verify the validity of the 1994 conviction, instead taking the position that the evidence of the 1996,1997, and 1998 convictions was sufficient to charge Weaver with felony DUI \u201cregardless of whether the most recent charge constitutes a fourth or fifth offense.\u201d The District Court ultimately ruled in Weaver\u2019s favor on the 1994 conviction, and the State has not challenged this ruling. Accordingly, only the 1996 conviction is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">\u00b64 In his briefs in support of his motion to dismiss, Weaver observed that he was charged with DUI, first offense, on April 19,1996, and was tried on this charge on November 20, 1996, in absentia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Weaver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>pointed out that under \u00a7 46-16-122(2), MCA (1995), a court could try a defendant in absentia on a misdemeanor charge only after finding that the defendant had knowledge of the trial date and was voluntarily absent. Weaver asserted that there was no such finding in the record and that he in fact did not have knowledge of the trial date and was not voluntarily absent. In addition, Weaver asserted that he had a constitutional right to be present at all criminal court proceedings and that any waiver of this right had to be knowing, voluntary, and specific. On these grounds, Weaver maintained that the 1996 conviction was constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b65 In response to Weaver\u2019s arguments, the State produced Missoula County Justice Court records, which indicated that Weaver failed to appear in court on the scheduled trial date but that he was represented by a public defender at the time and his counsel appeared on that date, at which time the trial was held in Weaver\u2019s absence. The State asserted that Weaver, by and through his counsel, had requested continuances of two earlier trial settings; that notice of the November 20,1996 trial date had been given to the Public Defender\u2019s Office; and that the court had ordered Weaver to maintain contact with his counsel. Thus, the State concluded, Weaver either had sufficient notice of the trial date or was unaware of the trial date because he failed to follow the court\u2019s order to maintain contact with counsel. Either way, the State argued, Weaver \u201cwaived his right to be present at trial.\u201d In this regard, the State quoted the following language from <em>Brewer v. Raines, </em>670 F.2d 117 (9th Cir. 1982): \u201cBrewer\u2019s failure to know of the continued dates of his trial and his date of sentencing is directly attributable to his failure to keep in contact with the court and his attorney. A defendant cannot be allowed to keep himself deliberately ignorant and then complain about his lack of knowledge.\u201d <em>Brewer, </em>670 F.2d at 119. Based on the 1997 and 1998 convictions, which Weaver did not challenge, and on the records it had produced supporting the 1996 conviction, the State contended that the charge of DUI, fourth or subsequent offense, is correct in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b66 The District Court held a hearing on Weaver\u2019s motion on October 4, 2005, at which time Weaver testified on his own behalf. The State cross-examined Weaver but did not call any witnesses. Thereafter, on November 9, 2005, the court entered its order denying Weaver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>motion. With respect to the 1996 conviction, the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apd\">The record indicates that the Defendant was arrested on April 19, 1996, and was required to appear on or before April 22,1996. The back of the citation indicates that on April 22, Weaver appeared, a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea was entered, and the Public Defender\u2019s office was appointed to represent the Defendant. An omnibus form dated May 30, 1996, indicates that a bench trial was set for July 18, 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">On July 8,1996, Weaver\u2019s appointed counsel, Margaret Borg, moved to vacate and continue the trial date due to a conflict. The court thereafter noticed up the trial for August 30, 1996. On the date scheduled for trial, Ms. Borg again moved to continue trial \u201cfor the reason that Defendant is experiencing health problems.\u201d On September 4th, the court noticed the new trial date for November 20th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">The docket minutes indicate that the court advised Mr. Weaver at his April 22 appearance that he had been appointed Ms. Borg, and that he was to stay in contact. It reiterates this in the condition # 4 where it states that Weaver is to stay in biweekly contact with his attorney. It is clear that Weaver did stay in contact sufficiently to have Ms. Borg request a later trial date due to injuries Weaver had suffered. At hearing, Weaver surmised that the injury might have been a burnt hand while employed at Stone Container.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">It was the duty, as clearly propounded by the lower court, for Mr. Weaver to remain in contact with his attorney. He knew who his appointed attorney was, as shown by the final motion to continue. Mr. Weaver indicated that he began shuttling between residences in October of that year. That did not relieve him of his obligation to remain in contact with his counsel or the court. When Mr. Weaver failed to appear, the court, based upon the clear indications that he had been previously in contact with his lawyer, determined that Mr. Weaver knew of the date and was willfully absent. Nothing presented by the Defendant causes this Court to dispute that determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On this basis, the District Court concluded that \u201cthe November 20, 1996 conviction is determined valid, and may therefore be used as a prior conviction for purposes of enhancement in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b67 Weaver and the State thereafter entered into a plea agreement, wherein Weaver agreed to plead guilty on Count I and the State, in return, agreed to dismiss Count II and to recommend a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sentence on Count I. Weaver specifically reserved his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling on the 1996 conviction. The court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced Weaver in accordance with the agreement. The court entered written judgment on March 28, 2006. Weaver now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b68 The sole issue raised by Weaver is whether the District Court erred in concluding that the 1996 conviction could be used as a prior conviction to support a charge of felony DUI in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b69 As a general rule, the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal proceeding is a question of law, which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct. <em>See State v. Luckett, </em>2007 MT 47, \u00b6 6, 336 Mont. 140, \u00b6 6, 152 P.3d 1279, \u00b6 6. In the case at hand, however, the District Court first had to make a number of factual findings, based on oral and documentary evidence, concerning the circumstances surrounding Weaver\u2019s 1996 conviction. We review findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>State v. Burt, </em>2000 MT 115, \u00b6 6, 299 Mont. 412, \u00b6 6, 3 P.3d 597, \u00b6 6; <em>see also United States v. Houtchens, </em>926 F.2d 824, 826 (9th Cir. 1991) (\u201cThe judge\u2019s factual finding that a defendant has knowingly and voluntarily failed to appear at trial is reviewable for clear error.\u201d). A trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 17, 340 Mont. 10, \u00b6 17, 171 P.3d 731, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6 23, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u00b610 The interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law, which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation and construction of the statute is correct. <em>See Miller v. District Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 22, 337 Mont. 488, \u00b6 22, 162 P.3d 121, \u00b6 22; <em>Thompson v. State, </em>2007 MT 185, \u00b6 14, 338 Mont. 511, \u00b6 14, 167 P.3d 867, \u00b6 14. Likewise, the district court\u2019s application of controlling legal principles to its factual findings is a mixed question of law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>fact, which we review de novo. <em>See Warclub, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21, 23.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The Procedural Bar Asserted by the State</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b611 As a preliminary matter, we note the State\u2019s argument that Weaver should not be allowed to challenge the validity of the 1996 conviction in the first place. In <em>State v. Okland, </em>283 Mont. 10, 941 P.2d 431 (1997), this Court observed that \u201c[i]n Montana, it is well established that the State may not use a constitutionally infirm conviction to support an enhanced punishment.\u201d <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 15, 941 P.2d at 434. We also held that \u201cin Montana, a [rebuttable] presumption of regularity attaches to prior convictions during a collateral attack\u201d and that \u201ca defendant who challenges the validity of his prior conviction during a collateral attack has the burden of producing direct evidence of its invalidity.\u201d <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436. Once the defendant has made such a showing, \u201cthe burden then shifts to the State to produce direct evidence and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior conviction was not entered in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b612 Notwithstanding this procedural mechanism, the State suggests (based on <em>Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 121 S. Ct. 1578 (2001), and <em>Lackawanna County Dist. Attorney v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 121 S. Ct. 1567 (2001)) that we adopt a rule under which a prior conviction is regarded as \u201cconclusively valid\u201d if the defendant failed to pursue a direct appeal or a collateral challenge in post-conviction proceedings while these remedies were available or if the defendant pursued these remedies unsuccessfully. The State would allow for exceptions where the conviction was obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel or where there was \u201ccompelling evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>of actual innocence.\u201d Otherwise, under the State\u2019s proposed rule, if the prior conviction were later offered by the State to enhance a criminal sentence, the defendant would not be able to challenge the enhanced sentence on the ground that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained. Applying this rule here, the State points out that Weaver was represented by court-appointed counsel throughout the 1996 proceedings, that Weaver did not appeal the 1996 conviction, and that Weaver did not timely attack the validity of that conviction in post-conviction proceedings. Thus, the State asserts, the conviction \u201cbecame final upon the expiration of the time for appeal following the sentencing hearing, and any collateral attack brought nine years later would ordinarily be time-barred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b613 As the State appropriately acknowledges, however, \u201c[tjhis rationale for rejecting Weaver\u2019s claim was not presented to the district court.\u201d The State is well aware that this Court generally will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See State v. </em>Vaughn, 2007 MT 164, \u00b6 44, 338 Mont. 97, \u00b6 44, 164 P.3d 873, \u00b6 44; <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 12, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Brown, </em>1999 MT 133, \u00b6\u00b6 17-20, 294 Mont. 509, \u00b6\u00b6 17-20, 982 P.2d 468, \u00b6\u00b6 17-20; <em>State v. Schaff, </em>1998 MT 104, \u00b6 26, 288 Mont. 421, \u00b6 26, 958 P.2d 682, \u00b6 26; <em>but see State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 76, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 76, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 76; <em>State v. Reeder, </em>2004 MT 244, \u00b6 4, 323 Mont. 15, \u00b6 4, 97 P.3d 1104, \u00b6 4. It is particularly troubling that the State is raising this procedural-bar issue for the first time on appeal, given that the State consistently faults defendants for doing precisely the same thing. Accordingly, we will not consider the State\u2019s proposed new rule any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Weaver\u2019s Position on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b614 Section 46-16-122, MCA (1995), provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">(1) In a misdemeanor case, if the defendant fails to appear in person, either at the time set for the trial or at any time during the course of the trial and if the defendant\u2019s counsel is authorized to act on the defendant\u2019s behalf, the court shall proceed with the trial unless good cause for continuance exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">(2) If the defendant\u2019s counsel is not authorized to act on the defendant\u2019s behalf as provided in subsection (1) or if the defendant is not represented by counsel, the court, in its discretion, may do one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">(a) order a continuance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">(b) order bail forfeited;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>(c) issue an arrest warrant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">(d) proceed with the trial after finding that the defendant had knowledge of the trial date and is voluntarily absent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b615 Weaver observes that although Margaret Borg was his original counsel, another public defender, Janna Gobeo, appeared on his behalf at the November 20, 1996 trial. Under \u00a7 46-16-122(1), MCA, if Ms. Gobeo was \u201cauthorized to act on [Weaver\u2019s] behalf,\u201d the Justice Court was required to proceed with the trial unless good cause for a continuance existed. Weaver does not assert explicitly that Ms. Gobeo was not authorized to act on his behalf; however, this appears to be his position, given that he focuses on \u00a7 46-16-122(2)(d), MCA, and argues that he did not have sufficient notice of the trial date and was not voluntarily absent. Accordingly, we will proceed on the premise that the validity of the 1996 conviction depends on a correct application of \u00a7 46-16-122(2)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b616 We note Weaver\u2019s assertion that a criminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to be present at all stages of a criminal proceeding. <em>See State v. McCarthy, </em>2004 MT 312, \u00b6 30, 324 Mont. 1, \u00b6 30, 101 P.3d 288, \u00b6 30. However, Weaver acknowledges that a defendant can waive his right to be present at trial. <em>See McCarthy, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>State v. Clark, </em>2005 MT 169, \u00b6 15, 327 Mont. 474, \u00b6 15, 115 P.3d 208, \u00b6 15; <em>United States v. Houtchens, </em>926 F.2d 824, 826 (9th Cir. 1991). Moreover, Weaver presents no argument that \u00a7 46-16-122(2)(d), MCA, does not sufficiently safeguard a defendant\u2019s right to be present at trial in a misdemeanor case. Accordingly, we will proceed on the additional premise that if Weaver \u201chad knowledge of the trial date and [was] voluntarily absent,\u201d \u00a7 46-16-122(2)(d), MCA, then he effectively waived his right to be present. <em>Cf. Houtchens, </em>926 F.2d at 826-27 (\u201c[A] defendant may be tried in absentia when, after sufficient notice, he or she knowingly and voluntarily fails to appear for trial. To hold otherwise, would allow an accused at large upon bail to immobilize the commencement of a criminal trial and frustrate an already overtaxed judicial system until the trial date meets, if ever, with his pleasure and convenience.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b617 Given these two premises, we now consider the merits of Weaver\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\u00b618  As noted above, the procedural mechanism set forth in <em>Okland </em>for determining whether a prior conviction may be used to enhance punishment on a current charge is as follows: (1) a rebuttable presumption of regularity attaches to the prior conviction, (2) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>defendant who challenges the validity of his or her prior conviction has the burden of producing direct evidence of its invalidity, and (3) once the defendant has made such a showing, the burden then shifts to the State to produce direct evidence and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior conviction was not entered in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436; <em>accord State v. Kvislen, </em>2003 MT 27, \u00b6 10, 314 Mont. 176, \u00b6 10, 64 P.3d 1006, \u00b6 10. Weaver contends that the District Court erred by not shifting the burden to the State to prove by direct evidence that the 1996 conviction was not entered in violation of his rights. He relies on <em>Kvislen, </em>\u00b6 11, for the proposition that he presented sufficient direct evidence of a constitutional infringement of his rights to rebut the presumption of regularity and shift the burden to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b619  In <em>Kvislen, </em>the defendant submitted an affidavit which stated that he did not receive notice of his trial and was not advised of his right to a court-appointed attorney in the event that he could not afford one. We held that the affidavit was \u201cdirect evidence of a constitutional infringement in the 1990 proceedings\u201d and was \u201csufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity and to shift the burden of proof to the State.\u201d <em>Kvislen, </em>\u00b6 11. Similarly, in the case at hand, Weaver gave sworn testimony on direct examination that he did not have notice of the November 20, 1996 trial date. This was direct evidence of a constitutional infringement in the 1996 proceedings and was sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity and shift the burden of proof to the State. Thus, we agree with Weaver that the burden was on the State to produce direct evidence and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the 1996 conviction was not entered in violation of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Whether the State Met Its Burden</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">\u00b620 Under \u00a7 46-16-122(2)(d), MCA(1995), the Missoula County Justice Court was authorized to proceed with the November 20, 1996 misdemeanor trial in Weaver\u2019s absence, but only \u201cafter finding that the defendant had knowledge of the trial date and is voluntarily absent.\u201d Weaver argues that the Justice Court\u2019s finding, with which the District Court agreed, that he knew of the trial date and was voluntarily absent is clearly erroneous. As support for this position, Weaver contends that the documentary evidence produced by the State was insufficient to prove that he had knowledge of the trial date. Indeed, Weaver asserts that the record is \u201cvoid\u201d of any evidence that he had knowledge of the trial date. Weaver also relies on his testimony that he was \u201csure\u201d he was not notified of the court date. Finally, he argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>that failure to maintain contact with one\u2019s attorney is not equivalent to a knowing waiver of the right to be present at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b621 In response, the State contends that the Missoula County Justice Court records produced by the State and the testimony elicited from Weaver on cross-examination were sufficient to sustain its burden. The State points out that there was evidence Weaver was in touch with Ms. Borg at least through August 30, 1996, when she moved to continue the trial \u201cfor the reason that Defendant is experiencing health problems.\u201d Furthermore, based on the surrounding circumstances-including the facts that Weaver\u2019s counsel appeared for the November 20, 1996 trial and that Weaver had previously been in contact with his attorney to request a continuance due to health problems-the State argues that the Justice Court properly inferred that Weaver had knowledge and notice of the trial date. Alternatively, the State points out that Weaver admitted he was living at different residences in the late summer and early fall of 1996 and that he did not maintain weekly contact with his attorney during this period. The State argues that if Weaver in fact did not know of the trial date, \u201cit was his own fault because he changed residences and did not stay in touch with his attorney as ordered by the justice court.\u201d The State contends that Weaver effectively waived his right to be present at trial by keeping himself ignorant of the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b622  Having reviewed the record in light of the parties\u2019 arguments, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s findings that Weaver appeared in Justice Court on April 22, 1996, and entered a plea of not guilty; that a public defender was appointed at this time to represent Weaver; that Weaver stayed sufficiently in contact with counsel to have Ms. Borg move to continue the August 30, 1996 trial setting \u201cfor the reason that Defendant is experiencing health problems\u201d; and that Weaver either knew of the November 20, 1996 trial date and was willfully absent therefrom or kept himself deliberately ignorant of that trial date. In this regard, we agree with the sentiment expressed by the Ninth Circuit <em>in Houtchens, </em>926 F.2d at 827-28, that where a defendant\u2019s failure to know of a continued trial date is directly attributable to his efforts to keep himself deliberately ignorant of that date, he will not be heard later to complain about his lack of knowledge-particularly where he is the one who requested the continuance in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b623 As noted above, Weaver\u2019s sworn testimony on direct examination that he did not have notice of the trial date was sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity in the 1996 conviction and shift the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>to the State to prove that the conviction was not entered in violation of Weaver\u2019s rights. However, this is not an all-or-nothing rule. In other words, producing direct evidence sufficient to shift the burden to the State does not preclude the State from attempting later to undermine the credibility of that evidence. In this regard, the transcript of the District Court hearing reflects that on cross-examination of Weaver, the State called into serious question his ability to recall accurately significant details related to the 1996 proceedings. For instance, Weaver was not sure whether he appeared in Justice Court on April 22, 1996. He could not remember whether he was ever contacted by a public defender regarding the DUI charge. He could remember that he had health problems in mid-1996, but he could not remember what they were (he opined that they might have been due to an accident at work). He claimed that he did not know what the motion to continue the second trial setting was about. He did not remember talking to Ms. Borg about not being able to make the second trial setting due to health problems. He could not remember Ms. Borg as his attorney at all, and he testified that he did not know he had an attorney then. He had \u201cno idea\u201d how Ms. Borg knew that he had health problems. Notwithstanding his inability to remember all of these details, Weaver testified that he was \u201csure\u201d he was not notified that his trial had been rescheduled for November 20,1996. Yet, he acknowledged that he was \u201cgoing through some hectic times\u201d and that \u201c[i]t was kind of mayhem\u201d during this period. It also appears at one point during his testimony that Weaver confused the 1996 DUI case with the 1997 DUI case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b624  The District Court had the responsibility of weighing all of the evidence presented and ascertaining Weaver\u2019s credibility in light of all of the testimony. <em>See In re </em>2007 MT 216, \u00b6 23, 339 Mont. 28, \u00b6 23, 168 P.3d 629, \u00b6 23. It is clear from the record that the District Court ultimately found Weaver\u2019s assertions concerning his lack of knowledge not to be credible. Weaver has presented us with no basis for concluding that this finding was clearly erroneous. Likewise, he has not demonstrated that the ultimate finding that he knowingly and voluntarily failed to appear at trial on November 20, 1996, thereby waiving his right to be present, is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b625  The State presented sufficient oral and documentary evidence in the District Court to support the conclusion that the 1996 conviction was not entered in violation of Weaver\u2019s right to be present at the November 20, 1996 trial. We hold, therefore, that the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>correctly ruled that the 1996 conviction could be used as a prior conviction to support a charge of felony DUI in the case at hand. Accordingly, we also hold that the District Court did not err in denying Weaver\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\"> According to the Missoula County Justice Court\u2019s minutes, the State called one witness and the defense called no witnesses. The State\u2019s witness, an officer with the Missoula County Sheriffs Office, testified that he stopped Weaver for various traffic infractions; that he smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage and noticed that Weaver\u2019s speech was slurred; and that he placed Weaver under arrest for DUI following the administration of an HGN test. The court indicated that it viewed a videotape, admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>as an exhibit, of Weaver failing both the \"walk and turn\u201d maneuver and the one-leg stand at the Missoula police station following his arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> In <em>Warclub, </em>we may have suggested that the factual findings underlying a court\u2019s mixed question determination are accorded \u201ca presumption of correctness.\u201d <em>See Warclub, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 32. We did so, however, in the context of discussing <em>Lambert v. Blodgett, </em>393 F.3d 943 (9th Cir. 2004), which in turn addressed the standard of review applicable in federal habeas corpus proceedings (see <em>Lambert, </em>393 F.3d at 976). Under that standard, \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct\u201d and the federal habeas petitioner has \u201cthe burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Our clearly erroneous standard does not involve such a presumption. Rather, as stated above in \u00b6 9, the appellant\u2019s burden is to show that the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence or that the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or to convince us on the record that a mistake definitely has been made.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
