He now appeals, raising an issue related to one of the jury instructions given at his trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b62 At approximately midnight on February 15, 2006, Yellowstone County Deputy Sheriff Patrick Korb observed a pickup being driven irregularly on Second Avenue North in Billings, Montana. At one point, the driver, who Korb later ascertained was Miller, weaved to the right and nearly struck a car parked on the side of the street. Korb turned on his in-car video camera and followed the pickup as it turned south on 22nd Street and then east on Montana Avenue. When Miller drove straight through an intersection while in a right-tum-only lane on Montana Avenue, Korb initiated a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b63 Upon making contact with Miller, Korb observed that Miller was having difficulty sorting through some paperwork he had retrieved out of his glove box. Miller initially gave a number of unresponsive answers to Korb\u2019s questions about where he was coming from and where he was headed, but Miller eventually stated that he had just come from Andy\u2019s Beit, where he had drunk roughly a pitcher of beer. Korb noticed that Miller\u2019s speech was slurred, that his eyes were red and glossy, that he seemed unable to concentrate, and that his motor skills were diminished. Miller was unable to provide proof of liability insurance. In addition, a records check revealed that Miller\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b64 Korb had Miller step out of the pickup, at which point Korb smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage on Miller\u2019s breath. He asked Miller to attempt a number of field sobriety tests and observed that Miller swayed from side to side, had difficulty following Korb\u2019s instructions, and had difficulty maintaining his balance. Midway through the second test (the walk and turn), Miller stated that he did not want to continue with these tests. Korb then asked Miller to take a preliminary breath test, but Miller declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b65 Based on Miller\u2019s driving, slurred speech, inability to concentrate, lack of balance, inability to follow Korb\u2019s instructions, and statements about drinking at Andy\u2019s Bar, Korb placed Miller under arrest for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (\u201cDUI\u201d) and transported him to the Yellowstone County Detention Facility\u2019s DUI Center. While there, Miller declined to reattempt any of the field sobriety tests. Korb advised Miller of Montana\u2019s implied consent law <em>(see </em>\u00a7 61-8-402, MCA) and asked him to take a breath test, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>but Miller again refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b66 The State charged Miller by information on February 17, 2006, with DUI, fourth or subsequent offense, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA (Count I); driving while license suspended or revoked, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA (Count II); and driving a motor vehicle without a valid policy of liability insurance in effect, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 61-6-301, MCA (Count III). Miller pleaded not guilty, and the case proceeded to trial on November 28, 2006, concluding the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b67 At the close of all the evidence, the District Court read 17 instructions to the jury. At issue on this appeal is Instruction No. 12, which was offered by the prosecution and stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">Refusal of a Breath or Blood Test or Physical Test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">If a person refuses to submit to a physical test or a test of their breath or blood for alcohol concentration, such a refusal is admissible evidence. You may infer from the refusal that the person was under the influence. The inference is rebuttable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b68 Miller objected to this instruction on the ground that it violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Miller explained that in his view, this instruction undermined the other instructions regarding the State\u2019s burden of proof and placed on Miller the burden of having to prove his innocence by giving a breath test. In response, the prosecutor argued that the instruction derived from \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, and was not unconstitutional in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Great Falls v. Morris, </em>2006 MT 93, 332 Mont. 85, 134 P.3d 692. The court ultimately overruled Miller\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\u00b69 The jury found Miller guilty on all three counts, and the District Court sentenced him on January 8, 2007. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">\u00b610 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in overruling Miller\u2019s objection to Instruction No. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">\u00b611  District courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions. <em>State v. Archambault, </em>2007 MT 26, \u00b6 25, 336 Mont. 6, \u00b6 25, 152 P.3d 698, \u00b6 25. However, that discretion is ultimately restricted by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>Archambault, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>see also State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 16, 342 Mont. 244, \u00b6 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>180 P.3d 636, \u00b6 16. Jury instructions that relieve the State of its burden to prove every element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>Carella v. California, </em>491 U.S. 263, 265, 109 S. Ct. 2419, 2420 (1989) (per curiam); <em>see also State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 24,322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 24, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 24. The issue of whether a defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated is a question of law. <em>McCaslin, </em>\u00b6 14. Our review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is de novo; we determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law were correct. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 119, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6 119, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b612 Under \u00a7 61-8-404(1), MCA, the following may be admissible in a DUI trial: evidence of any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol and drugs in the defendant at the time of a test, as shown by an analysis of the defendant\u2019s blood or breath; a report of the facts and results of one or more tests of the defendant\u2019s blood or breath; and a report of the facts and results of a physical, psychomotor, or physiological assessment of the defendant. The statute places a number of conditions on the admissibility of such evidence. In addition, and of particular relevance here, \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(a), MCA, limits the use of a blood or breath test result as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">A positive test result does not, in itself, prove that the person was under the influence of a drug or drugs at the time the person was in control of a motor vehicle. A person may not be convicted of a violation of 61-8-401 based upon the presence of a drug or drugs in the person unless some other competent evidence exists that tends to establish that the person was under the influence of a drug or drugs while driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b613 Section 61-8-404(2), MCA, in turn, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">If the person under arrest refused to submit to one or more tests as provided in this section, proof of refusal is admissible in any criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public, while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol and drugs. The trier of fact may infer from the refusal that the person was under the influence. The inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>is rebuttable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b614 In <em>City of Great Falls v. Morris, </em>2006 MT 93, 332 Mont. 85, 134 P.3d 692, this Court analyzed \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">Analyzing this statute as a whole, we conclude that subsection (2) must be read as requiring the production of other competent corroborating evidence of a DUI. In light of the fact that subsection (l)(a) requires corroborating evidence when a person actually takes a drug test, to interpret subsection (2) as not requiring corroborating evidence when a person refuses to take the test would create an absurd result. In this case, the State presented corroborating evidence that Morris was driving while under the influence, including testimony from law enforcement that Morris exhibited erratic driving, slurred speech, red eyes and the odor of alcohol on his breath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">Moreover, we note that the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s refusal to take a breathalyzer test presupposes other competent evidence in the form of probable cause to make the arrest in the first instance-in this case, poor driving, slurred speech, red eyes and the odor of alcohol. Although Morris provides an explanation for his behavior and appearance, he has not challenged the probable cause to make the arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\"><em>Morris, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. We thus held that the district court did not err in instructing the jury on the provisions of \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u00b615 In the District Court, Miller asserted that <em>Morris </em>was \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d Again on appeal, Miller suggests that while <em>Morris </em>provides \u201ca better understanding\u201d of \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, this statute \u201cremains to be unconstitutional on its face.\u201d However, Miller offers no argument whatsoever in support of this contention, i.e., he offers no argument addressed to the reasoning of <em>Morris </em>and why he believes that reasoning is incorrect. The conclusory assertion that \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, is \u201cunconstitutional on its face\u201d is a wholly inadequate presentation of an issue to this Court. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4) (2005), <em>superseded by </em>M. R. App. P. 12(1)f. (effective October 1, 2007<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) (\u201cThe argument [section of the appellant\u2019s brief] shall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d); <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 6, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 6 (\u201cThis Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>repeatedly held that we will not consider unsupported issues or arguments. Similarly, this Court is under no obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>cf. State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 66, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 66, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 66 (observing that Rosling\u2019s one-paragraph argument, with citation to inapt authority, \u201cis too undeveloped to undertake a distinctive application of state constitutional principles\u201d); <em>State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 51, 342 Mont. 244, \u00b6 51, 180 P.3d 636, \u00b6 51 (declining to revisit <em>Morris </em>based on Michaud\u2019s argument, which was the same argument, under the same basic facts, that we had considered and rejected in <em>Morris). </em>Accordingly, we will not consider Miller\u2019s contention in this regard any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b616 Alternatively, Miller presents an argument that Instruction No. 12 was inadequate under our holding in <em>Morris. </em>As noted above, a positive blood or breath test result does not, in itself, prove that the defendant was under the influence of a drug or drugs at the time he or she was in control of a motor vehicle; and a person may not be convicted of a DUI under \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, based upon the presence of a drug or drugs in the person unless \u201csome other competent evidence exists that tends to establish that the person was under the influence of a drug or drugs while driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state.\u201d Section 61-8-404(l)(a), MCA. In <em>Morris, </em>we construed \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, in light of \u00a7 61-8-404(l)(a), MCA, and held that the former likewise requires the production of \u201cother competent corroborating evidence of a DUI.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>accord Michaud, </em>\u00b6 54 (\u201c[T]he trier of fact must be [ ] presented with \u2018other competent evidence\u2019 that a defendant is driving while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d). In other words, proof of the defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood, breath, physical, psychomotor, or physiological test does not, in itself, prove that the defendant was under the influence of a drug or drugs at the time he or she was in control of a motor vehicle; other competent corroborating evidence of a DUI must be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b617 Citing this requirement, Miller contends that Instruction No. 12 \u201cwas inadequate because it did not inform the jury that the State was required to provide other competent corroborating evidence, per <em>Morris, </em>in order to convict Miller of DUI.\u201d Miller acknowledges that the State provided corroborating evidence at his trial, but he opines that \u201c[i]t is a possibility that the jury ignored the corroborating evidence because the jury was never instructed that the State was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>present corroborating evidence, in order to convict Miller of DUI. Therefore, it is reasonable that Miller could have been convicted on the refusal to take a breath test alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b618 The force of Miller\u2019s position is somewhat undercut by the fact that when the District Court overruled his objection to Instruction No. 12, he did not then ask the court to supplement the instruction with the requirement that he now cites from <em>Morris, </em>i.e., with language to the effect that proof of Miller\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood, breath, physical, psychomotor, or physiological test does not, in itself, prove that he was under the influence. Nevertheless, given our standard of review, we will consider whether Instruction No. 12 fully and fairly instructed the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>Archambault, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Michaud, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b619 The crux of Miller\u2019s position is that the District Court failed to instruct the jury that the State had to produce \u201cother competent corroborating evidence of a DUI,\u201d <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 21, and this failure had the effect of transforming the permissive inference allowed by \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, into a mandatory presumption that he was under the influence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Miller, this mandatory presumption, in turn, effectively shifted the burden of proof to him on this element of the offense, thereby violating his right to due process and the presumption of innocence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b620  In <em>Michaud, </em>we held that \u201cthe inference language in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, allows the trier of fact-whether a judge or a jury-to accept or reject the inference. Additionally, it expressly allows the defendant to rebut the inference.\u201d <em>Michaud, </em>\u00b6 54. Furthermore, we concluded that the inference permitted by \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, \u201cdoes not violate due process in that there is a rational connection between driving while intoxicated and refusing to take a sobriety test.\u201d <em>Michaud, </em>\u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b621  Here, Instruction No. 12 instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIf a person refuses to submit to a physical test or a test of their breath or blood for alcohol concentration, such a refusal is admissible evidence. You <em>may </em>infer from the refusal that the person was under the influence. The inference is rebuttable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nothing about this instruction <em>required </em>the jury to infer from Miller\u2019s refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>that he was under the influence. To the contrary, the jurors were told that they \u201cmay\u201d infer from his refusal that he was under the influence. Thus, Instruction No. 12 was consistent with our interpretations of \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, in <em>Morris </em>and <em>Michaud.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b622 Furthermore, as the State points out, the District Court provided the following instructions in addition to Instruction No. 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">* \u201cYou are not to single out any sentence or any individual point or instruction, and ignore the others. You are to consider all of the instructions as a whole, and are to regard each in the light of all the others.\u201d (Instruction No. 1.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">* \u201cThe State of Montana has the burden of proving the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Instruction No. 6.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">* \u201cThe defendant is presumed to be innocent of the charge against him. This presumption remains with him throughout every stage of the trial and during your deliberations on the verdict. It is not overcome unless from all the evidence in the case you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. The defendant is not required to prove his innocence or present any evidence.\u201d (Instruction No. 6.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">* \u201cTo convict the Defendant of the offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, the State must prove the following elements: That the Defendant: 1. was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle[,] 2. upon the ways of this state open to the public[,] and 3. while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. If you find from your consideration of the evidence that all of these elements have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then you should find the Defendant guilty. If, on the other hand, you find from your consideration of the evidence that any of these elements has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt then you should find the Defendant not guilty.\u201d (Instruction No. 8; paragraph breaks omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u00b623  Reviewing the instructions as a whole, as the court specifically directed the jury to do, we conclude that they fully and fairly instructed the jury regarding the applicable law and did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to Miller. Of particular significance here, the jurors were instructed that Miller \u201cis presumed to be innocent of the charge against him,\u201d that this presumption \u201cremains with him throughout every stage of the trial,\u201d and that the presumption \u201cis not overcome unless from <em>all the evidence </em>in the case you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty\u201d (emphasis added). Furthermore, the jurors were instructed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\u201c[t]he defendant is not required to prove his innocence or <em>present any evidence\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b624  Based on these instructions, we conclude that while Instruction No. 12 did not inform the jurors that proof of Miller\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood, breath, physical, psychomotor, or physiological test does not, in itself, prove that he was under the influence of a drug or drugs at the time he was in control of a motor vehicle, the other instructions sufficiently compensated for this omission by requiring the jury to consider \u201call the evidence\u201d and by instructing them that Miller was not required to present any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A9aI\">\u00b625 Aside from the instructions, we also note Deputy Korb\u2019s testimony concerning the reasons he requests preliminary breath tests: \u201cThe breath test is to support any suspicions I may have, whether a person is under the influence or also whether they\u2019re not. If it\u2019s a situation where the [field sobriety] tests are close, I can use that to help support my beliefs whether they are intoxicated or not.\u201d With respect to this particular case, Korb testified that based on Miller\u2019s driving, slurred speech, inability to concentrate, lack of balance, inability to follow some of the field-sobriety-test instructions, and admissions about drinking that night, \u201cI believed he was very intoxicated and I wanted to confirm it.\u201d Thus, Korb\u2019s own testimony suggested to the jury that the breath test was not, by itself, conclusive on the question of whether Miller was under the influence of alcohol but, rather, was only a tool to aid Korb in ascertaining whether this was, in fact, the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b626  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Instruction No. 12, in conjunction with the other 16 instructions given by the District Court, fully and fairly instructed the jury regarding the applicable law. We further hold that \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, as applied to Miller in this case, did not -unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> The briefs in this appeal were filed prior to October 1, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\"> A permissive inference, also termed \u201cpermissive presumption,\u201d is \u201c[a] presumption that a trier of fact is free to accept or reject from a given set of facts.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1224 (Bryan A.
