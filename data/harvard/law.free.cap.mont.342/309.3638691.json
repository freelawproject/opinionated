We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when, pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, it added as a condition to LaFreniere\u2019s probation that he successfully complete Phase II of a sex offender treatment program?</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">\u00b64 On October 25, 1984, LaFreniere was charged with one count of sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-503(3), MCA (1983). LaFreniere, who had a prior rape conviction, pled guilty to the charge pursuant to a plea agreement. The District Court subsequently sentenced him to a term of forty years in the Montana State Prison with twenty years suspended. However, no conditions for the suspended portion of his sentence were set forth in the written sentencing order and a transcript of the sentencing hearing is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">\u00b65 On August 24,2006, Cascade County Attorney, Brant Light, filed a petition to set conditions of LaFreniere\u2019s probation pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, asking the court to impose, among others, a condition that LaFreniere complete sex offender treatment, and asserting that to \u201crelease this Defendant on probation without any conditions would put our community at risk.\u201d The court set a hearing for September 6, 2006. LaFreniere filed a pro se response to the petition, arguing that because \u201cthere [were] not rules, conditions, or stipulations for probation to commencet,] none now should be forthcoming from a hearing.\u201d LaFreniere appeared at the hearing without counsel, and the court then ordered the public defender\u2019s office to represent him. The hearing was reset for September 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">\u00b66 LaFreniere appeared with counsel, Betty Carlson, and objected to three of the proposed conditions. Specifically, LaFreniere objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the condition that he complete Phase II of an approved sex offender treatment program (Condition 13). LaFreniere had twice completed Phase I of sex offender treatment while he was incarcerated in the Montana State Prison but failed to complete Phase II, despite repeated enrollment. At the hearing, LaFreniere\u2019s counsel objected to imposition of Condition 13 on the basis that LaFreniere \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d After consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments and pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, the court imposed fifteen conditions on LaFreniere\u2019s probation, including completion of an approved Phase II sex offender treatment program. In regard to LaFreniere\u2019s concern that he could not afford the treatment, the court explained that LaFreniere was required to \u201cmake a good faith effort to make those arrangements,\u201d meaning that \u201cthis is number one on the list\u201d of things to spend money on. LaFreniere appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b67 Our review of questions regarding constitutional law is plenary. <em>State v. Ellis, </em>2007 MT 210, \u00b6 10, 339 Mont. 14, \u00b6 10, 167 P.3d 896, \u00b6 10. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law regarding application of a statute to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the statute is correct as a matter of law. <em>State v. Allum, </em>2005 MT 150, \u00b6 14, 327 Mont. 363, \u00b6 14, 114 P.3d 233, \u00b6 14. In cases challenging the legality or propriety of probation conditions, we first review sentencing conditions for legality. <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6 9. Because sentencing conditions must be \u201creasonable,\u201d we then review the reasonableness of such conditions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when, pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, it added as a condition to LaFreniere\u2019s probation that he successfully complete Phase II of a sex offender treatment program?</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\u00b69 LaFreniere argues that the District Court erred when it imposed Condition 13 as a condition to his probation. LaFreniere asserts that \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, as applied, violates the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution. In response, the State contends that LaFreniere waived the <em>ex post facto </em>argument by failing to raise it in the District Court. In the alternative, the State argues that retroactive application of \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, does not violate the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>laws because it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cincrease the punishment for LaFreniere\u2019s crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b610 At the time LaFreniere was sentenced, \u00a7 46-23-1011(1), MCA (1983), stated: \u201cThe department shall supervise persons during their probation period in accord with the conditions set by a court.\u201d In 2001, \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA (2001), was amended to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">The department shall supervise probationers during their probation period in accord with the conditions set by a sentencing judge. <em>If the sentencing judge did not set conditions of probation at the time of sentencing, the court shall, at the request of the department, hold a hearing and set conditions of probation. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Consequently, \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, was amended to authorize a court to impose probationary conditions at a later time if they were not set at the initial sentencing hearing. It is this change which LaFreniere contends violates the constitutional ban on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. Specifically, LaFreniere contends that the retroactive application of \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, violates the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>laws because the addition of probationary conditions \u201cultimately changefs] the legal consequences of LaFreniere\u2019s 1984 crime....\u201d Pursuant to the two-part test in <em>State v. Leistiko, </em>LaFreniere argues that imposition of probationary conditions under \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, violates his constitutional protections because (1) the law is retrospective and (2) it disadvantages him. 256 Mont. 32, 36-37, 844 P.2d 97, 100 (1992). In support of the second prong LaFreniere\u2019s argument is two fold. First, LaFreniere argues that the District Court violated his \u201cconstitutional right to his property interest\u201d by requiring him to pay for Phase II sex offender treatment. Second, LaFreniere argues that imposition of Condition 13 \u201chas effectively increased and made more burdensome [his] punishment for his 1984 crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b611 However, as a threshold inquiry we must determine whether LaFreniere\u2019s claim was preserved for appeal. We have repeatedly held that we consider issues presented for the first time on appeal to be untimely and will not consider them. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 38, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 38, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 38. This includes new arguments and changes in legal theory. <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 38. We have reasoned that \u201cit is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 12, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b612  Additionally, we have held that an \u201cobjection must be specific in order to preserve the issue for appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Huerta, </em>285 Mont. 245, 261, 947 P.2d 483, 493 (1997) (relying on <em>State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>460, 479, 914 P.2d 592, 603-04 (1996)). An objection that is \u201cvery general in nature and which does not specify what authority, rule, statute, or constitutional provision might be violated by the court\u2019s decision, is insufficient to preserve that issue on appeal.\u201d <em>Huerta, </em>285 Mont. at 261, 947 P.2d at 493; <em>see also State v. Weeks, </em>270 Mont. 63, 85, 891 P.2d 477, 490 (1995) (stating \u201cbroad general objections do not suffice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b613 Here, a review of the record reveals that LaFreniere failed to preserve for appeal the argument that \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, violates the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. At no time did LaFreniere argue before the District Court the issue of an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. While LaFreniere\u2019s response to the State\u2019s petition for a hearing states that the law \u201cused by the County Attorney should not be retroactive since it was [a] 2005 enactment[,]\u201d the response does not provide any other argument or authority in support of the proposition. In fact, the response does not reference any constitutional provision and, consequently, it is unclear what LaFreniere meant by this statement. However, even assuming that LaFreniere meant to reference <em>ex post facto </em>protections, his generalized objection to \u201cretroactivity\u201d is not enough to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Huerta, </em>285 Mont. at 261, 947 P.2d at 493. Neither was the issue raised during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b614  In his reply brief, LaFreniere contends that his argument in the District Court necessarily preserved the <em>ex post facto </em>issue, considering that \u201c[t]he inability to pay for the required sex offender treatment goes hand-in-hand with LaFreniere\u2019s position that the probation condition objected to was <em>applied </em>in an <em>ex post facto </em>manner ... because the condition is more burdensome ....\u201d (Emphasis in original.) However, this \u201chand-in-hand\u201d argument only further demonstrates LaFreniere\u2019s failure to properly raise the issue before the District Court. An argument which merely implies a constitutional violation does not sufficiently alert the court of the issue and consequently does not reserve the issue for appeal. <em>See Huerta, </em>285 Mont. at 261, 947 P.2d at 493. Accordingly, we conclude that LaFreniere waived the argument that application of \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA, violates the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution. Therefore, we do not reach the constitutional merits of LaFreniere\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, MORRIS, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
