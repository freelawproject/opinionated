We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court properly denied certification of Ferguson\u2019s proposed class.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u00b63 Ferguson was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident on December 14,1999, in which she incurred property damage losses and bodily injuries. Ferguson was insured by Safeco Insurance Company of America (Safeco), which paid for the total loss of her vehicle less her deductible. Safeco also paid for a portion of the rental car expenses that Ferguson incurred and some of Ferguson\u2019s medical bills under her med-pay coverage. There were other items of property damage that Safeco did not pay for.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\u00b64 In December 2000, Safeco subrogated against the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier, recovering some of the amounts it paid for property damage pursuant to Ferguson\u2019s collision coverage. Ferguson was not reimbursed for the amount of subrogation recovery that Safeco received from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">\u00b65 On September 23, 2004, Ferguson initiated this action claiming that she was not made whole prior to Safeco subrogating against her recovery. She alleged that Safeco never provided her with any notice that it would seek subrogation; never investigated, inquired or made a determination as to whether Ferguson was made whole for her losses; and never reimbursed Ferguson for her unrecovered losses including her deductible, her unpaid rental car expenses, and her attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">\u00b66 In her Complaint, Ferguson sought damages for violation of Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act, breach of the insurance contract, constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. She also sought a declaratory ruling that the members of her proposed class are entitled to be made whole before Safeco is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>subrogation; that Safeco breached the insurance contracts by seeking excessive subrogation; that Safeco violated the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing; and that Safeco violated Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b67 On May 3, 2005, Ferguson moved the District Court for an order certifying this action as a class action under M. R. Civ. P. 23(b). In her Motion for Class Certification, Ferguson defined the class for whom she sought certification as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">persons, including natural individuals and business entities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">a. Who were insured under an auto insurance policy issued by Safeco Insurance Company of America or any of the Safeco Companies in Montana;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">b. Who, as a result of an auto accident, suffered expenses covered by such policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">c. Who received payments under the coverages of such policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">d. With respect to whom Safeco Insurance Company of America and the Safeco Companies recovered from a third party subrogation for some or all of such payments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">e. Whose claim arose not more than eight (8) years preceding the filing of the Complaint in this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">\u00b68 The District Court denied class certification upon the rationale that this Court\u2019s establishment in <em>Swanson v. Hartford Ins. Co. of Midwest, </em>2002 MT 81, 309 Mont. 269, 46 P.3d 584, of the legal duty for insurers taking subrogation eliminated the common issue, and upon the belief that this action required fact-specific determinations of \u201cmade-whole\u201d entitlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">\u00b69 Ferguson appeals the District Court\u2019s order denying her motion for certification of her lawsuit as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">\u00b610  This court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to certify unless there is an abuse of discretion. <em>Sieglock v. Burlington Northern Ry. Co., </em>2003 MT 355, \u00b6 8, 319 Mont. 8, \u00b6 8, 81 P.3d 495, \u00b6 8 <em>(citing McDonald v. Washington, </em>261 Mont. 392, 396, 399, 862 P.2d 1150, 1152, 1154 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court properly denied certification of Ferguson\u2019s proposed class.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">\u00b612 The District Court denied Ferguson\u2019s motion for class certification concluding that Ferguson had not met her burden for bringing this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>case within the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 23(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">Prerequisites to a class action. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Specifically, the court determined that Ferguson failed to meet the requirement set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) regarding commonality because the common issue proposed by Ferguson has already been answered by this Court in <em>Swanson. </em>Thus, the court concluded that there are no remaining substantial questions of either law or fact common to all the members of Ferguson\u2019s proposed class.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b613 The District Court also determined that Ferguson failed to meet the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 23(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">Class actions maintainable. An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition: (1) the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">(B) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1O\">Specifically, the court determined that Ferguson failed to identify an issue of law or fact common to the members of the proposed class that predominates over any questions affecting only individual members. Thus, the court determined that Ferguson failed to meet the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b614 The District Court also concluded that this action would require fact-specific determinations of \u201cmade-whole\u201d entitlements, thus it was not suitable for a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b615 Ferguson argues that the District Court erred in denying class certification under Rule 23(a)(2), because all of the class members share common questions of fact (if not law) arising out of the allegation that Safeco is not abiding by the established rule of law. Ferguson also argues that the District Court erred in applying the \u201cpredominance\u201d requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) because class certification requires satisfaction of only one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) and this case is appropriately certified under Rule 23(b)(2) where predominance is not an issue. Finally, Ferguson argues that, contrary to the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions, while this action seeks to compel Safeco to apply the \u201cmade-whole\u201d rule, it does not seek to adjudicate any individual \u201cmade-whole\u201d entitlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>Commonality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b616 Class certification requires satisfaction of all four of the prerequisites in Rule 23(a): numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. Alba Conte &amp; Herbert B. Newberg, <em>Newberg on Class Actions, </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 4:1, 3 (4th ed., West 2002). In this case, the District Court concluded that Ferguson failed to satisfy the commonality requirement in Rule 23(a)(2) which provides that class litigation must present a common issue of law <em>or </em>fact. We have previously held that, regardless of differences among class members, this element is met if a single issue is common to all. <em>McDonald v. Washington, </em>261 Mont. 392, 401, 862 P.2d 1150, 1155 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b617 Ferguson maintains that the common issue in this case is whether the proposed class of Montana insureds is entitled to relief for Safeco\u2019s taking of subrogation recoveries without an investigation into and determination of whether these insureds have been made whole. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>District Court denied class certification to Ferguson concluding that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Swanson </em>regarding an insurer\u2019s legal duty for taking subrogation eliminated the common issue. While the District Court is correct that this Comet\u2019s ruling in <em>Swanson </em>established that an insurer may not collect subrogation without first determining that its insurer has been made whole, <em>Swanson </em>did not establish whether Safeco is violating that legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b618 In <em>Swanson, </em>the United States District Court for the District of Montana certified three questions to this Court. The question pertinent to the instant case is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">Is it the public policy in Montana that an insured must be totally reimbursed for all losses as well as costs, including attorney fees, involved in recovering those losses before the insurer can exercise any right of subrogation, regardless of contract language to the contrary?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We answered this question in the affirmative in <em>Swanson, </em>stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atl\">\u201c[w]hen the sum recovered by the Insured from the Tortfeasor is less than the total loss and thus either the Insured or the Insurer must to some extent go unpaid, <em>the loss should be borne by the Insurer for that is a risk the Insured has paid it to </em>assume.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzA\"><em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 19 <em>(quoting Skauge v. Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>172 Mont. 521, 528, 565 P.2d 628, 632 (1977) (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b619  Thus, we established in <em>Swanson </em>that an insurer has a duty to first determine whether the insured has been made whole before the insurer may collect subrogation. <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 28. In so holding, we followed the law well-established in Montana since our decision 25 years earlier in <em>Skauge. </em>Nevertheless, the existence of a well-established duty does not eliminate the common fact issue of whether Safeco has programmatically breached that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b620 As Ferguson points out in her brief on appeal, under the District Court\u2019s rationale, there could be no recourse to class litigation where the legal duty to be enforced has been established by clear legal precedent. Only in cases where the existence of a legal duty was in question would there be a common issue within the meaning of Rule 23(a)(2). However, our case law indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u00b621 We held in <em>McDonald </em>that the common issue for class certification was whether the defendant breached a duty owed to all class members. In <em>McDonald, </em>past and present consumers of water brought an action against the water company and the sole shareholder alleging failure to provide adequate water and service. The defendants argued that there was no commonality because the consumers lived in different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>areas and their water sources may have differed from other class members. They also contended that consumers suffered varying health effects from the water, so that the injuries suffered from one putative plaintiff to another were so different that there were not sufficient questions of law or fact common to the class. <em>McDonald, </em>261 Mont. at 400-01, 862 P.2d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b622 We concluded in <em>McDonald </em>that the commonality requirement was satisfied because all counts stemmed from the alleged failure of the water company to provide potable water and adequate service, and that the primary cause and common theory of these claims was the same, i.e., an antiquated and poorly repaired water system. <em>McDonald, </em>261 Mont. at 401, 862 P.2d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b623 Moreover, in the instant case, the District Court failed to recognize the common issues of fact arising from Safeco\u2019s subrogation program. In <em>Sieglock v. Burlington Northern Ry. Co., </em>2003 MT 355, \u00b6 5, 319 Mont. 8, \u00b6 5, 81 P.3d 495, \u00b6 5, the trial court denied certification concluding that there were no common questions of law. This Court reversed on the rationale that the trial court failed to consider whether the plaintiff class presented a common question of fact. <em>Sieglock, </em>\u00b6 18. We stated in <em>Sieglock </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">[cjommonality is satisfied when the question of law linking class members is substantially related to resolving the litigation, even though individuals may not be similarly situated. Similarly, commonality will also be satisfied when there is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies within the class. The nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is directly relevant in determining whether the matters in controversy are individual or suitable as a class action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\"><em>Sieglock, </em>\u00b6 11 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u00b624 In <em>Sieglock, </em>the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF) published a list of names of the top 300 overtime wage earners in its track department. The list included personal information about these employees including their city and state of residence, and their social security numbers. Several BNSF employees filed a class action against BNSF claiming damages resulting from the release and circulation of the list. They claimed that BNSF tortiously invaded their reasonable expectations of privacy when it negligently and intentionally published private facts and breached its fiduciary duty for safe keeping of private facts. They also sought an injunction prohibiting BNSF from continuing any other business practices which would encourage or condone publication of the information. <em>Sieglock, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u00b6\u00b6 2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b625 BNSF contended that because the alleged torts occurred in a wide geographic area (over 24 states), resolution of the claims would require the application of differing tort laws from varying jurisdictions, thus plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of showing that the potential class members shared sufficient common issues of law. <em>Sieglock, </em>\u00b6 13. However, we noted in <em>Sieglock </em>that the requirements of Rule 23(a)(2) are disjunctive, thus, the party seeking class certification must have either common questions of law or common questions of fact. <em>Sieglock, </em>\u00b6 11. We held that it did not appear that the trial court considered whether plaintiffs shared a common core of salient facts, irrespective of the court\u2019s decision that there was no commonality of law. Thus, we reversed and remanded to the District Court for such consideration. <em>Sieglock, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b626 [3] In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the existence of a well-established duty does not eliminate the common fact issue of whether Safeco has programmatically breached that duty. In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">[t]he commonality requirement is not a stringent threshold and does not impose an unwieldy burden on plaintiffs. In fact, as a general rule, all that is necessary to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) is an allegation of a standardized, uniform course of conduct by defendants affecting plaintiffs. Plaintiffs need only show a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative facts\u201d to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIC\"><em>LaBauve v. Olin Corp., </em>231 F.R.D. 632, 668 (S.D.Ala. 2005) (internal citations and parentheticals omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b627 In a case directly on point with the case before us on appeal, the federal district court of Florida held that the insurer\u2019s practice of not applying Florida\u2019s \u201cinsured-whole\u201d rule created a common issue for insureds within the State of Florida. <em>Powers v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>192 F.R.D. 313, 317, 320 (S.D.Fla. 1998). In <em>Powers, </em>an insured brought suit against her automobile insurer seeking recovery of the full amount of the deductible she paid on a collision claim from the amount which the insurer recovered on its subrogation claim. <em>Powers, </em>192 F.R.D. at 315-16. In granting the plaintiffs motion for class certification, the <em>Powers </em>court stated that \u201c[w]here a common scheme of deceptive conduct is alleged, common questions of law and/or fact will exist.\u201d <em>Powers, </em>192 F.R.D. at 317 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u00b628  Like the plaintiff in <em>Powers, </em>Ferguson alleges in the instant case that Safeco engaged in \u201ca common scheme of deceptive conduct,\u201d by taking subrogation recoveries without an investigation into and determination of whether the insureds have been made whole. In addition to this main issue, Ferguson alleges that this case raises many other common issues of fact and/or law, including whether Safeco has a duty to retroactively apply <em>Swanson </em>by returning subrogation recoveries taken before the <em>Swanson </em>decision, otherwise, similarly situated insureds will get no more relief from this case than Ferguson got from <em>Swanson. </em>We agree with Ferguson and conclude that these are questions common to all members of the putative class. \u00b629 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in determining that there were no common questions of law or fact in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\n<em>Predominance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b630 Rule 23(b) provides three distinct routes to class certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ5\">Rule 23(b)(1) classes are designed to avoid prejudice to the defendant or absent class members if individual actions were prosecuted in contrast to a class suit yielding a unitary adjudication. Classes under Rule 23(b)(2) are proper when injunctive relief is appropriate because the defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class. Finally, Rule 23(b)(3) makes class actions suitable when a class action is superior to other available methods for adjudication of the controversy and common questions predominate over individual ones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\"><em>Newberg, </em>\u00a7 4:1, 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b631 In this case, the District Court reasoned that Ferguson failed to demonstrate that any common issues predominate over any questions affecting only individual members as required by Rule 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b632 Ferguson moved for certification in the District Court under Rule 23(b)(2), or, alternatively, under Rules 23(b)(1) or 23(b)(3). Ferguson now argues on appeal that the District Court erred in reasoning that predominance is required, because the class claims in this case can and should be certified under Rule 23(b)(2), which does not require that the common issue predominate.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u00b633 By its terms, Rule 23(b)(2) applies to cases where the defendant\u2019s conduct is \u201cgenerally applicable to the class\u201d and a remedy is sought through declaratory or injunctive relief. Here, Ferguson seeks a judicial declaration that Safeco has breached its insurance contract and adjustment duties by a programmatic assertion of subrogation without first investigating and determining whether the insureds have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>received their \u201cmade-whole\u201d rights. In addition to Ferguson\u2019s prayer for class-wide declaratory relief, she requested that the court issue an injunctive order compelling the return of subrogation amounts until such time as adjustments under the \u201cmade-whole\u201d standard have been completed by Safeco.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b634 The challenge here is not to an error in Safeco\u2019s application of the \u201cmade-whole\u201d rule to any given insured. Rather, this case challenges the procedures of a program of subrogation which systematically deprives all class members of any consideration of their \u201cmade-whole\u201d rights. Thus, as Ferguson points out in her brief on appeal, her class claims do not seek a determination of entitlements for each class member and the payment of damages; rather, her class claims seek a declaratory ruling that will be enforced to compel Safeco to follow the legal standard in its subrogation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b635 In <em>Lebrilla v. Farmers Group, Inc., </em>119 Cal. App. 4th 1070,16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 25 (2004), the class claim sought declaratory relief to remedy an auto insurance company\u2019s common practice of specifying inferior imitation crash parts for all repairs to class members\u2019 vehicles. The trial court denied certification, and on appeal, Farmers reasoned that the action raised individualized fact questions regarding each class member\u2019s entitlement to original, non-imitation parts. <em>Lebrilla, </em>119 Cal. App. 4th at 1086, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 38-39. The appellate court reversed the order denying class certification and expressly rejected the contention that a class-wide remedy could not efficiently be administered by declaratory relief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">The onus of complying with the policy as judicially construed falls on Farmers. <em>There will be no analysis for the court to do.... It will be left to Farmers to adjust insurance claims in accordance with claims procedures already in place ... </em>[and] it will be up to Farmers to ensure that each class member receives the coverage required under the policy. These obligations are fairly placed on Farmers because adjusting claims is squarely within Farmers\u2019 expertise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\"><em>Lebrilla, </em>119 Cal. App. 4th at 1086,16 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 39 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u00b636 As in <em>Lebrilla, </em>the instant case does not require the court to analyze any individual insured\u2019s amount of loss or recovery. Rather, the relief sought by Ferguson on behalf of the class is an order compelling Safeco to properly perform its statutory adjustment duties.</p>\n<p id=\"ABj\">\u00b637 In <em>Dubray v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>2001 MT 251, \u00b6\u00b6 13,16,307 Mont. 134, \u00b6\u00b6 13,16, 36 P.3d 897, \u00b6\u00b6 13,16, this Court reaffirmed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>approval of declaratory judgment actions \u201cas a means for compelling advanced payment of medical expenses\u201d and held that the district court erred in dismissing DuBray\u2019s claim for a declaratory ruling forcing payment of those medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b638 Based on the foregoing, we hold that the District Court erred in concluding that predominance is required for class certification in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>\u201cMade-whole\u201d entitlements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b639 Ferguson argues that while this action seeks to compel Safeco to apply the \u201cmade-whole\u201d rule, it does not seek to adjudicate any individual \u201cmade-whole\u201d entitlements. Ferguson maintains that the need for the efficient remedy of class-wide declaratory relief is especially appropriate where the size of the average claim is so small that relief for the average class member is not economically available outside class litigation. Ferguson points out that Safeco\u2019s attorney revealed in this case, that for subrogation on med-pay claims alone, there are at least 239 Montana insureds with subrogation recoveries totaling $332,000.00. Thus, the typical class member would only have $1,400.00 at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u00b640 We observed in <em>Murer v. State Comp. Mut. Ins.
