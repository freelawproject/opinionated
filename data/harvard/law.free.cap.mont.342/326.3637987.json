After treatment and achieving maximum medical improvement (MMI), Harrison and Stillwater entered into a settlement agreement under which medical benefits were reserved. Subsequently, Harrison went to work for Derek Brown Construction Company (Derek Brown). He suffered an industrial injury in April 2004. Derek Brown\u2019s insurer, Liberty Northwest Insurance Corporation (Liberty), paid Harrison\u2019s medical benefits including the necessary spinal surgery under a reservation of rights. In January 2005 Harrison filed a Petition in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (WCC) to determine whether Stillwater or Derek Brown was responsible for his medical claim. The WCC determined that Stillwater was liable. Stillwater appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the WCC erred in concluding that Stillwater was responsible for payment of Harrison\u2019s medical costs and disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">\u00b63 Harrison worked for Stillwater as an underground equipment operator from May 2000 until July 2003. On November 13, 2002, he reported to his employer that he was suffering from lower back and neck pain as a result of his job duties. Shortly thereafter Harrison saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>a physician, Dr. McDowell, and reported that he was experiencing lower back pain, radicular leg pain, neck discomfort, and some tingling and numbness in his arms. He told the doctor he had been experiencing these symptoms for approximately six months and attributed them to his work at Stillwater. On December 3, 2002, Stillwater accepted Harrison\u2019s claim under the Occupational Disease Act and provided him temporary total disability benefits. In January 2003, upon Dr. McDowell\u2019s recommendation, Harrison began seeing a neurologist named Dr. Quenemoen. He saw Quenemoen on several occasions between January and June 2003 for tests and treatment. In May 2003 Quenemoen told Stillwater that Harrison had reached maximum medical improvement. In July Quenemoen restated that Harrison was at MMI with a total whole person impairment of 5 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b64 After Harrison left his job at Stillwater he moved to Helena, Montana, to enroll in the September 2003 term at Helena College of Technology (HCT) for vocational re-training. Also in September 2003 the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI) Employment Relations Division approved a settlement agreement between Harrison and Stillwater. Under this agreement Stillwater paid Harrison $20,339 and Harrison reserved further medical and hospital benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b65 Harrison did not complete vocational re-training at HCT but rather left Helena and moved to Fort Benton, Montana, for family reasons in October 2003. While in Fort Benton, Harrison worked for a builder for approximately one month doing residential construction, remodeling, carpentry, drywall, and some concrete work. After about a month in Ft. Benton, Harrison returned to Helena and worked various short term construction, equipment maintenance and carpentry jobs until he began working for Derek Brown in mid-April 2004. During the time between his jobs at Stillwater and Derek Brown, his back pain subsided but he continued experiencing numbness and tingling in his legs and he occasionally took the medications prescribed by Quenemoen. On April 23, 2004, Harrison suffered a back injury while running a vibrator machine during a concrete pour at a Derek Brown work site. He submitted a claim for compensation to Derek Brown on April 29, 2004. On the claim form, Harrison indicated that he believed that he had aggravated his low back condition by performing the heavy concrete work.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u00b66 In May 2004 Harrison began seeing Dr. Varnavus, a neurosurgeon, for diagnosis and treatment. In June 2004 Liberty, Derek Brown\u2019s insurer, denied Harrison\u2019s injury claim but in July 2004 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>agreed to cover the claim. Varnavus indicated in a September 2004 letter to Liberty that he believed Harrison\u2019s condition was directly connected to the injury Harrison incurred while working for Stillwater. After extended but unsuccessful treatment, Varnavus recommended spinal surgery. In October 2004 Liberty refused to authorize the recommended surgery and in November Liberty notified Harrison that it was terminating payment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\">\u00b67 On January 10, 2005, Harrison filed a Petition for an Emergency Hearing with the WCC. On January 11, 2005, then-WCC Judge McCarter held a telephone conference with counsel for Harrison, Liberty and Stillwater, at the conclusion of which Liberty agreed to pay Harrison\u2019s reasonable medical expenses including surgical expenses subject to a claim for indemnification from Stillwater. Harrison\u2019s surgery was performed in July 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b68 On May 12, 2006, WCC Judge Shea issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment. The court made numerous findings pertaining to Harrison\u2019s various physicians\u2019 tests, diagnoses and treatments. The WCC concluded, among other things, that (1) Liberty had the burden of proving, by a more-probable-than-not standard, that Stillwater was the responsible party; (2) Varnavus was the only treating physician to offer an opinion as to whether Harrison\u2019s injury while working at Derek Brown arose from his earlier injury at Stillwater; (3) Harrison and Stillwater, at the time they entered into their settlement agreement, were operating under the mutual and material mistake of fact that surgery would not be required for Harrison\u2019s injury; (4) such a mutual mistake warrants the reopening of the settlement agreement; and (5) Stillwater must indemnify Liberty for the payments Liberty made to Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b69 Stillwater filed a timely appeal of the WCC\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u00b610 The standard of review we employ for this type of case was set forth in detail in <em>Gamble v. Sears, </em>2007 MT 131, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 337 Mont. 354, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 160 P.3d 537, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22. As this detailed standard is applicable to the case before us, we repeat it in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u00b611 We conduct de novo review of the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law in order to determine whether they are correct. <em>Flynn v. Uninsured Employers\u2019Fund, </em>2005 MT 269, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 122, \u00b6 11, 122 P.3d 1216, \u00b6 11. As for the WCC\u2019s findings of fact, however, our review is both deferential and limited in scope. We simply review the WCC\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>substantial credible evidence. <em>In re Abfalder, </em>2003 MT 180, \u00b6 10, 316 Mont. 415, \u00b6 10, 75 P.3d 1246, \u00b6 10. We have stated that substantial credible evidence is that which a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Simms v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 175, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 511, \u00b6 11, 116 P.3d 773, \u00b6 11. Indicating the high level of deference this Court accords to the WCC\u2019s factual findings, we have stated that evidence will be considered substantial even if it is contradicted by other evidence, even if it is somewhat less than a preponderance, and even if it is inherently weak. <em>EBI/Orion Group v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>249 Mont. 449, 453, 816 P.2d 1070, 1073 (1991); <em>Simms, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Wolfe v. Webb, </em>251 Mont. 217, 230, 824 P.2d 240, 248 (1992). However, it must be more than a mere \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence and it must rise above the level of \u201ctrifling or frivolous.\u201d <em>Simms, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>EBI/Orion Group, </em>249 Mont. at 453, 816 P.2d at 1073. As for the scope of our review, we do not resolve conflicts in the evidence, and we do not consider whether evidence supports findings that are different from those made by the WCC; rather, we confine our review to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the findings actually made by the WCC. <em>Kloepfer v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>276 Mont. 495, 498-99, 916 P.2d 1310, 1312 (1996); <em>Montana State Fund v. Murray, </em>2005 MT 97, \u00b6 19, 326 Mont. 516, \u00b6 19, 111 P.3d 210, \u00b6 19; <em>In re Abfalder, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"A15\">\u00b612 The \u201csubstantial credible evidence\u201d standard of review is further defined by rules regarding our consideration of witness testimony. As for witnesses who testify in person at trial, we defer to the WCC\u2019s findings concerning credibility and the weight to be accorded to this testimony. <em>Kuntz v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>1998 MT 5, \u00b6 35, 287 Mont. 142, \u00b6 35, 952 P.2d 422, \u00b6 35; <em>Wilson v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins., </em>273 Mont. 313, 319, 903 P.2d 785, 787-88 (1995). It is the WCC\u2019s job to resolve any inconsistencies in a witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Walls v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>281 Mont. 106, 111, 931 P.2d 712, 716 (1997). Ultimately, because an assessment of testimony is best made upon observation of the witness\u2019s demeanor and consideration of other intangibles that are only evident during live testimony, we will not substitute our judgment for the WCC\u2019s judgment regarding credibility and the weight accorded to live witness testimony. <em>Wilson, </em>273 Mont. at 319, 903 P.2d at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b613 Conversely, we are in as good a position as the WCC to assess testimony presented at trial by way of deposition. <em>McIntyre v. Glen Lake Irr. Dist., </em>249 Mont. 63, 67, 813 P.2d 451, 454 (1991); <em>White v. Ford, Bacon &amp; Davis Texas, Inc., </em>256 Mont. 9, 13, 843 P.2d 787, 789 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>(1992). Therefore, we conduct de novo review of deposition testimony. <em>White, </em>256 Mont. at 13, 843 P.2d at 789. However, this independent review of deposition testimony is only one component of our task on appeal. We must then consider the deposition testimony in the context of the other relevant evidence in order to properly assess the factual findings at issue. <em>McIntyre, </em>249 Mont. at 67-68, 813 P.2d at 454; <em>White, </em>256 Mont. at 13, 843 P.2d at 789. As we have stated, even where we conduct de novo review of deposition testimony, we are ultimately restricted to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s findings. <em>Weber v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>270 Mont. 239, 245, 890 P.2d 1296, 1299 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b614 <em>Issue: Did the WCC err in concluding that Stillwater was responsible for payment of Harrison\u2019s medical costs and disability benefits?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b615 In resolving this issue we first address whether the WCC\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial credible evidence. Our review of the record reveals that the WCC received testimony from Harrison and from two of Harrison\u2019s treating physicians. Harrison testified in person before the WCC judge as well as by deposition while Vamavus and Quenemoen provided testimony by deposition alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b616 Stillwater does not expressly challenge any of the WCC\u2019s declared factual findings; however, it does challenge the conclusion of law set forth below, which contains factual elements. Therefore, we will review the factual component of this conclusion to determine if it is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b617 Stillwater challenges the following legal conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">Vamavus is the only treating physician to offer an opinion as to whether [Harrison\u2019s] injury while working at Derek Brown arose from [Harrison\u2019s] earlier injury at Stillwater. Dr. Varnavus opined that it did. When Dr. Quenemoen was asked whether or not the Derek Brown injury was attributable to the earlier Stillwater injury, Dr. Quenemoen responded that he did not know. Therefore, the [c]ourt is left with the uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Vamavus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b618 Stillwater disputes the \u201cuncontroverted\u201d characterization of Vamavus\u2019s opinion that the injury Harrison experienced while working at Derek Brown was attributable to the earlier Stillwater injury. Stillwater maintains that because both Harrison and Quenemoen provided testimony that refuted Vamavus\u2019s opinion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>WCC\u2019s \u201cconclusion\u201d to the contrary is not supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b619 Liberty counters that the WCC justifiably gave greater weight to Vamavus\u2019s expert opinion testimony than it did to Harrison\u2019s recollection testimony. The insurer notes that Varnavus testified from written medical notes taken during Harrison\u2019s treatment whereas Harrison testified only from his own memory. Citing the Commission Comment to M. R. Evid. 803(4), Liberty opines that Harrison\u2019s description of his symptoms when he visited Varnavus was accurate because Harrison was motivated to obtain proper diagnosis and treatment; therefore, if Harrison\u2019s current testimony based on recollection conflicts with Vamavus\u2019s testimony based on written contemporaneous notes, Varnavus\u2019s testimony as to Harrison\u2019s complaints is entitled to the greater weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b620 Additionally, Liberty argues that Quenemoen acknowledged that he was unfamiliar with the term used by Varnavus in diagnosing Harrison with \u201csegmental instability.\u201d Liberty asserts that because Quenemoen could not properly diagnose Harrison\u2019s condition, Vamavus\u2019s testimony once again was properly given greater weight. \u00b621 Lastly, Liberty argues that if Varnavus and Quenemoen presented conflicting testimony, it is the WCC\u2019s role to resolve such conflicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b622 As indicated above, the WCC is responsible for resolving conflicting testimony and assigning the weight to be given to witness testimony. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21. While Quenemoen\u2019s testimony conflicted with Vamavus\u2019s and may have supported different findings leading to different conclusions, the WCC accorded greater weight to Vamavus\u2019s testimony, as it was entitled to do. Our review of the record confirms that the WCC\u2019s factual findings, whether they are included in the fact-finding or the legal conclusion section of the WCC\u2019s Order, are supported by substantial credible evidence; therefore we will not disturb its conclusions based on those findings. Lastly, we disagree with the court\u2019s characterization that Varnavus\u2019s testimony is \u201cuncontroverted,\u201d but conclude that this erroneous description does not change the fact that there was substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b623 We next determine whether the WCC correctly applied the \u201ccausal\u201d standard as opposed to the \u201caggravated\u201d standard in determining Stillwater\u2019s liability. Stillwater maintains that the WCC erred in its determination that Harrison\u2019s Derek Brown injury arose from his earlier Stillwater injury, and argues that the Derek Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>injury was an intervening injury and a permanent aggravation of the Stillwater injury, relieving it of liability. Stillwater provides extensive legal authority for its position; however, its argument is irreconcilable with Varnavus\u2019s unequivocal testimony that Harrison\u2019s Stillwater injury and evolving degenerative spinal condition were the causes of the Derek Brown injury. In many of the cases upon which Stillwater relies, the WCC had to determine whether the second injury was a new \u201cpermanent aggravation\u201d or a \u201crecurrence of symptoms\u201d of the initial occupational disease or injury. E.g., <em>Caekaert v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>268 Mont. 105, 885 P.2d 495 (1994); <em>Liberty N.W. Ins. v. Champion Intern., </em>285 Mont. 76, 945 P.2d 433 (1997). In <em>Caekaert, </em>we explained that \u201c[a] later injury is compensable by the original carrier if it is a direct and natural result of a compensable primary injury and not the result of an independent intervening cause attributable to the claimant.... If the original injury or occupational disease was the cause of the current condition, the [original carrier] is liable.\u201d <em>Caekaert, </em>268 Mont. at 112, 885 P.2d at 499. In making this determination, the court had to rely on the medical evidence presented, resolve any conflicting testimony and assign weight to the testimony. Again, in the case before us, the WCC did just that, and after weighing the evidence, concluded that Varnavus\u2019s testimony was credible and convincing. As determined above, because the record supports the court\u2019s findings, we will not disturb the court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\">\u00b624 Lastly, we determine whether the WCC erred in re-opening the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. As we explained in <em>Gamble, </em>a settlement agreement is a contract; therefore, we apply contract law to determine whether the agreement is valid and enforceable. <em>Gamble, \u00b6 </em>24 (citation omitted). At the time of settlement, the WCC determined that Stillwater and Harrison did not believe Harrison\u2019s injury would require surgery and therefore the settlement terms did not include consideration of this possibility. As a result, the parties were operating under a material mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b625 Stillwater\u2019s argument that the WCC\u2019s conclusion is incorrect is based on its continued assertion that Harrison\u2019s condition was aggravated by the Derek Brown injury rather than the Derek Brown injury stemming from the Stillwater injury. Having determined that the WCC\u2019s finding to the contrary is supported by the record, we analyze only whether the circumstances allowing for re-opening a settlement agreement are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b626  Again, as we stated in <em>Gamble, </em>a \u201cmaterial\u201d fact is \u201ca vital fact upon which [the parties] based their bargain,\u201d and a mutual mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>regarding a material fact is a mistake that is \u201cso substantial and fundamental as to defeat the object of the parties in making the contract.\u201d <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 27. Additionally, we have determined previously that a settlement agreement must be re-opened if, when the parties entered into it, they were mutually mistaken regarding a fact that was material to the agreement. <em>Kienas v. Peterson, </em>191 Mont. 325, 328-30, 624 P.2d 1,2-3 (1980); <em>Weldele v. Medley Development, </em>227 Mont. 257, 260, 738 P.2d 1281,1283 (1987); <em>Kimes v. Charlies Fam. Din. &amp; Donut Shop, </em>233 Mont. 175, 177, 759 P.2d 986, 988 (1988); <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 26. Moreover, we have determined that the nature and extent of a claimant\u2019s physical condition is a fact that is material to an agreement settling an injury claim. <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont. at 330, 624 P.2d at 3; <em>Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 261, 738 P.2d at 1283; <em>Kime, </em>233 Mont. at 178, 759 P.2d at 988; <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b627  Here, prior to execution of the settlement agreement, Harrison had been diagnosed with early degenerative changes in his lumbar spine but had been told by both McDowell and Quenemoen that surgical intervention was not indicated at that time. The diagnoses and prognoses of both McDowell and Quenemoen are undisputed. Subsequently, a more comprehensive diagnosis was made, and it was medically determined that corrective surgery was in fact required. This fact, coupled with the WCC\u2019s conclusion that the operable condition stemmed from the earlier Stillwater injury, demonstrates that there was a material misunderstanding of the nature and extent of Harrison\u2019s condition at the time of the settlement. Therefore, we conclude that the court did not err in concluding that a re-opening of the settlement agreement was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b628 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the WCC\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment imposing liability for Harrison\u2019s medical costs and disability benefits on Stillwater.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
