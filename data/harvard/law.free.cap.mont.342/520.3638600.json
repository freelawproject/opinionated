The District Court denied DuBray\u2019s petition. DuBray appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u00b62 The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court properly deny DuBray\u2019s claim that his</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">trial counsel were ineffective because they introduced prejudicial matter into the trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court properly deny DuBray\u2019s claim that his trial counsel were ineffective because one of his attorneys had a conflict of interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court properly deny DuBray\u2019s claim that his trial counsel were ineffective because they did not assure DuBray\u2019s presence at all critical stages of his trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court properly deny DuBray\u2019s claim that his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective because he failed to raise the issues concerning attorney conflict of interest and DuBray\u2019s absence at critical stages of trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court properly deny DuBray\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b68 In 1999, a jury found DuBray guilty of robbery, felony theft and the deliberate homicide of Suzette Pritchard in a 1986 Great Falls convenience store robbery. Three attorneys provided DuBray\u2019s defense during the month-long trial. After the District Court entered judgment, DuBray appealed. We affirmed. <em>See State v. DuBray, </em>2003 MT 255, 317 Mont. 377, 77 P.3d 247 <em>(DuBray I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b69 DuBray petitioned for postconviction relief in December of 2004, claiming trial counsel and counsel on direct appeal provided him ineffective assistance. Specifically, DuBray claimed one of his trial counsel had a conflict of interest, his trial team introduced prejudicial comments and references to other crimes and wrongs, and his trial team failed to protect his right to be present at all critical stages of the proceedings and to object to the State of Montana\u2019s introduction of highly damaging testimony vouching for the credibility of government witnesses. DuBray also claimed his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise, on direct appeal, trial counsels\u2019 conflict of interest, introduction of prejudicial evidence, and failure to challenge improper vouching. Finally, DuBray claimed he had new evidence requiring a new trial. The State filed a response to DuBray\u2019s petition, with supporting affidavits and other documents.</p>\n<p id=\"AeS\">\u00b610 The District Court denied most of DuBray\u2019s claims based on the briefs and supporting materials filed. The court held a hearing on DuBray\u2019s claims that his trial counsel introduced evidence of prior crimes and failed to object or seek other relief regarding vouching for the credibility of government witnesses. The court ultimately denied those claims as well. DuBray appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b611 Our general standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief is whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Morgan, </em>2003 MT 193, \u00b6 7, 316 Mont. 509, \u00b6 7, 74 P.3d 1047, \u00b6 7 (citations omitted). Counsel's reasonable trial tactics and strategic decisions are entitled to great deference when reviewed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we rarely grant relief if evidence supports the strategic nature of trial counsel's decisions. <em>Hartinger v. State, </em>2007 MT 141, \u00b6 45, 337 Mont. 432, \u00b6 45, 162 P.3d 95, \u00b6 45 (citations omitted). The question is whether the tactics and strategy were reasonable under the circumstances-the question is not whether we would have made the same decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u00b612 To prevail on a motion for a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence, the defendant must satisfy the five-part test set forth in <em>State v. Clark, </em>2005 MT 330, \u00b6 34, 330 Mont. 8, \u00b6 34, 125 P.3d 1099, \u00b6 34. The same test is applied when a defendant requests a new trial in a postconviction proceeding. <em>See Crosby v. State, </em>2006 MT 155, \u00b6 20, 332 Mont. 460, \u00b6 20, 139 P.3d 832, \u00b6 20. We review a trial court\u2019s findings in applying the test for clear error; when a district court has exercised its discretion in applying the third, fourth and fifth elements, we review those decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b613 Did the District Court properly deny DuBray\u2019s claim that his trial counsel were ineffective because they introduced prejudicial matter into the trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b614 DuBray contends his trial counsel twice introduced highly prejudicial matter into the trial. The first instance purportedly occurred during the opening statement for the defense by DuBray\u2019s counsel Eric Olson. Olson told the jury the evidence presented at trial may cause them to be glad DuBray was going back to prison when trial was over, but it would not convince them DuBray committed the crimes of which he was accused. The District Court did not address this claim in its order denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u00b615 In an affidavit submitted in response to the petition for postconviction relief, defense counsel Carl Jensen, Jr., stated that, prior to trial, defense counsel were aware the evidence presented at trial would lead to an inference that DuBray already was incarcerated, and that many of the witnesses had personal animosities toward DuBray. Jensen stated counsel were concerned that DuBray \u201clacked any positive presence with the jury.\u201d Jensen\u2019s statements indicate that Olson\u2019s challenged remarks during the opening statement were made for strategic reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b616 The second instance in which DuBray contends his counsel introduced prejudicial matter into the trial occurred during cross-examination of State witness Thelma Weatherwax. During that cross-examination, defense counsel Jensen elicited Weatherwax\u2019s testimony that she suspected DuBray was guilty of another, unrelated, homicide in the Great Falls area.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u00b617 In analyzing this claim, the District Court employed the two-part test for evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims outlined in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), and adopted in <em>Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 10, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 10: whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, if so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>whether the deficient performance was prejudicial. The court determined counsel\u2019s reference to the other homicide was a tactical decision which was objectively reasonable and stemmed from informed, professional deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b618 Jensen\u2019s affidavit in response to the petition for postconviction relief stated the trial theory of the defense was that the State\u2019s case was based on what they wanted the evidence to be, and not on any real proof that DuBray had committed the crimes of which he was accused. Jensen stated the defense was aware prosecution witness Weatherwax believed DuBray had murdered Patty Young Running Crane-the victim of the separate, -unrelated homicide-but the team also was aware that someone else had been charged with Running Crane\u2019s death and DuBray was not a suspect. Jensen averred the defense team discussed bringing up Weatherwax\u2019s beliefs regarding Running Crane as a way of discrediting Weatherwax\u2019s testimony and reinforcing the idea that the State\u2019s case was based on what the State wanted the evidence to be, not on actual proof. At the District Court\u2019s hearing on this issue, Olson testified the defense team wanted to elicit this testimony from Weatherwax to refocus the jury on the facts of the case, rather than on beliefs about DuBray\u2019s background or other events in which he was rumored to have been involved. Jensen\u2019s affidavit and Olson\u2019s testimony support the strategic basis for questioning Weatherwax regarding her beliefs concerning the Running Crane homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b619  Given our high standard of deference to trial tactics and strategic decisions, we hold DuBray has not established that his trial counsels\u2019 performance was deficient in relation to either the defense opening statement or the Weatherwax cross-examination. Consequently, because both parts of the <em>Strickland </em>test must be met to establish ineffective assistance, we need not address the prejudice part. <em>See Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 63, \u00b6 22, 153 P.3d 601, \u00b6 22 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b620 We hold the District Court did not err in denying this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\u00b621 Did the District Court err in denying DuBray\u2019s claim that his trial counsel were ineffective because one of his attorneys had a conflict of interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\u00b622  DuBray\u2019s trial attorney Jeff Lynch had a prior attorney-client relationship with convenience store owner David Keith, who testified for the State. In his petition for postconviction relief, DuBray contended this was a conflict of interest which resulted in Lynch\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ineffective cross-examination of Keith. The District Court noted that Lynch\u2019s alleged conflict of interest was clearly revealed within the trial record and, therefore, was procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. \u00b623 DuBray asserts error in this regard but advances no argument or authority as required by M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f). We hold DuBray has not established that the District Court erred in denying this claim as procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b624 Did the District Court err in denying DuBray\u2019s claim that his trial counsel were ineffective because they did not assure DuBray\u2019s presence at all critical stages of his trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b625  In his petition for postconviction relief, DuBray asserted his trial counsel were ineffective because they did not insure that he was present during the court\u2019s discussions with the jury foreman during the jury\u2019s deliberations. The District Corut determined that this issue is procedurally barred in a postconviction proceeding because it could have been raised on direct appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b626 DuBray asserts error, but does not advance argument or authority as required by M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f). We hold he has not established that the District Court erred in denying this claim as procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u00b627 Did the District Court err in denying DuBray\u2019s claim that his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective because he failed to raise the issues concerning attorney conflict of interest and DuBray\u2019s absence at critical stages of trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">\u00b628 DuBray asserts that, had his counsel on direct appeal raised the issues set forth under Issues 2 and 3 above, his direct appeal would have resulted in \u201cautomatic reversal\u201d of his conviction. As discussed above, the District Court determined DuBray\u2019s claims under those issues were procedurally barred from consideration in this postconviction relief proceeding. Nevertheless, the court discussed the merits of both and determined DuBray had not established ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on either.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">\u00b629 DuBray reasserts his substantive arguments regarding his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise on appeal trial counsel\u2019s purported conflict of interest and failure to assure his presence at all critical stages of trial. He also argues that because the District Court considered an affidavit provided by his counsel on direct appeal-which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>affidavit was outside the tried record-the court should have held a hearing regarding counsel\u2019s failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b630 We first address DuBray\u2019s claim that the District Court erred in failing to hold a hearing on this issue. Although M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f) requires the appellant to provide citations to the authorities relied on, DuBray has cited no authority requiring a court to hold a hearing whenever it considers written materials filed in support of or in response to a petition for postconviction relief. It is not this Court\u2019s function to conduct legal research on the parties\u2019 behalf or to develop their legal analysis for them. <em>State v. Zakovi, </em>2005 MT 91, \u00b6 28, 326 Mont. 475, \u00b6 28, 110 P.3d 469, \u00b6 28 (citation omitted). DuBray has failed to establish that the District Court was required to hold a hearing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b631 We now turn to the merits of DuBray\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The criteria for establishing ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are the same as those used to establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel: whether counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and, if so, whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the petitioner would have prevailed on appeal. <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 147, 301 Mont. 135, \u00b6 147, 10 P.3d 49, \u00b6 147 (citations omitted). We observe that counsel has no constitutional obligation to raise every non-frivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 754, 103 S. Ct. 3308, 3314 (1983). The presumption of effective assistance of counsel will be overcome only when ignored issues are clearly stronger than those presented. <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 287-88, 120 S. Ct. 746, 765 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b632 In his affidavit filed in response to DuBray\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, appellate counsel stated he considered 38 issues when drafting the appeal, but ultimately chose and briefed only the strongest 13 of those. Counsel stated the contentions DuBray faults him for failing to raise \u201care not well supported in the record, and would have distracted from the arguments made.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b633 To prevail on a conflict of interest claim, a defendant must show that (1) counsel actively represented conflicting interests; and (2) an actual conflict of interest adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance. <em>State v. Deschon, </em>2002 MT 16, \u00b6 18, 308 Mont. 175, \u00b6 18, 40 P.3d 391, \u00b6 18. In support of his argument that his appellate counsel should have raised a conflict of interest claim, DuBray established that trial counsel Lynch had previously represented State witness Keith on an unrelated matter. DuBray contends this resulted in inadequate cross-examination of Keith by Lynch. However, DuBray did not establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>that Lynch represented him and Keith concurrently, or that Lynch represented Keith on any matter which related in any way to DuBray\u2019s criminal trial. Moreover, Olson\u2019s affidavit in response to the petition for postconviction relief states the defense team discussed Lynch\u2019s prior representation of Keith with DuBray, who told them he did not wish to discharge Lynch merely because Lynch had previously represented Keith.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b634 In asserting that his appellate counsel should have argued he was deprived of his right to be present at all critical stages of the proceedings, DuBray advances <em>State v. Musgrove, </em>178 Mont. 162, 582 P.2d 1246 (1978). In that case, the defendant was not present when the jury was taken to the place where the charged events had taken place. The controlling statute, \u00a7 95-1912, RCM (1947), provided that no person could speak or otherwise communicate with the jury on any subject in connection with the trial at a jury view. During the viewing in that case, the county attorney answered several questions by jurors concerning subjects such as the location of witnesses and the victim\u2019s body. We reversed, based on the occurrence of proceedings which amounted to the taking of testimony at the jury view. <em>Musgrove, </em>178 Mont. at 170, 582 P.2d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b635 In the present case, during the jury\u2019s deliberations, the jury foreman approached the bailiff to report that one of the jurors claimed to be psychic. The District Court met with counsel and the foreman, who told the court there was no problem with any of the jurors and the juror who had informed two other jurors that she was a psychic was not the reason the jury had yet to reach a verdict. The court then conferred with counsel outside the foreman\u2019s presence, and finally met with counsel and the foreman again, instructing the foreman to return to the jury room and allow deliberations to move forward. <em>DuBray I, </em>\u00b6 118. DuBray\u2019s counsel waived DuBray\u2019s presence at these discussions, which were on the record. DuBray has not alleged proceedings occurred outside his presence which amounted to the taking of testimony and, therefore, <em>Musgrove </em>does not support his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b636 More recently, in <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, 327 Mont. 196, 113 P.3d 281, a defendant alleged the district court violated his right to be present at all critical stages of trial-under both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution-by speaking with two jurors outside his presence. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 42. The defendant based his arguments on the right to be present under both the federal and the Montana constitutions. We discussed at some length the importance of the constitutional right to be present at critical stages of criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>proceedings. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46-52. We reasoned, however, that the defendant had made no persuasive claim of prejudice arising out of the episodes at which he was not present. We noted that the interactions between the judge and jurors were brief interludes in a complex trial, the defendant had no role to play at either, and, in each instance, defense counsel was consulted and consented to the court\u2019s approach. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 54 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b637 Similarly, here, the trial record establishes that interactions between the court and the jury foreman concerning the alleged psychic juror were brief interludes in a complex, month-long trial, and defense counsel consented to the court\u2019s approach in addressing the foreman\u2019s concerns. While DuBray claims that, had he been present, he might have demanded that his attorneys act differently, such a claim is pure speculation, especially in light of the fact that he does not contest Olson\u2019s record statement that DuBray deferred to him on such matters anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b638  We hold DuBray has not established error in the District Court\u2019s denial of his claim that his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective in failing to raise the issues concerning attorney conflict of interest and DuBray\u2019s absence at critical stages of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b639 Did the District Court properly deny DuBray\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u00b640 DuBray contends a letter he received in 2003 from John Cameron, the lead detective in the underlying case which resulted in his 1999 convictions, constitutes new evidence entitling him to a new trial. He attached a copy of the letter to his petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"Ann\">\u00b641 The five-part test for whether a new trial should be granted based on newly-discovered evidence is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">(1) The evidence must have been discovered since the defendant\u2019s trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">(2) The failure to discover the evidence sooner must not be the result of a lack of diligence on the defendant\u2019s part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">(3) The evidence must be material to the issues at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">(4) The evidence must be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-13\">(5) The evidence must indicate that a new trial has a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-14\"><em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u00b642 We observe that the primary thrust of Cameron\u2019s letter to DuBray was to obtain any information DuBray was willing to share on another, unsolved, case. Cameron also wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">I always wanted to sit down with you when this mess was done, and pick your brain.... I really wanted to hear the real story of what happened that night in 1986. I know that I got some of it right but there is always more to the story and I would love to hear it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">DuBray contends this letter impeaches Cameron in that Cameron \u201cwants the real story because he only got some of it right.\u201d The District Court determined Cameron\u2019s letter does not satisfy parts (4) and (5) of the <em>Clark </em>test for a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b643 The only use of Cameron\u2019s letter in a retrial would have been to impeach Cameron\u2019s confidence in his investigation. Furthermore, given that the defense conducted a lengthy attack on Cameron\u2019s objectivity at trial and advanced a trial theory that DuBray was charged based on rumor and innuendo, the letter would have been merely cumulative. Finally, Cameron\u2019s letter merely asks DuBray to fill -in missing details surrounding the crimes. Nothing in the letter indicates or suggests in any way that a new trial in which the letter was admitted as evidence would have a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u00b644  We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying DuBray\u2019s motion for a new trial based on new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u00b645 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
