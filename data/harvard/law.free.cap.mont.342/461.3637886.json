We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">\u00b63 Did Clark file an untimely notice of appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">\u00b64 Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence when it failed to award credit for time spent on house arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">\u00b65 Did the District Court impose unreasonable conditions on Clark\u2019s bond?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">\u00b66 The State charged Clark with aggravated assault, a felony, on April 27, 2006. The District Court set Clark\u2019s bail at fifty thousand dollars, and Clark was incarcerated at the Flathead County Detention Center (FCDC). Following his arrest, Clark moved the District Court to authorize a chemical dependency evaluation and to set a hearing to consider whether to release Clark on his own recognizance. The District Court granted both motions. The State and Clark then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>submitted several stipulations to the District Court to allow Clark to await trial on formal house arrest, rather than at FCDC. The stipulations required, among other things, that Clark observe a curfew, enroll in and complete a chemical dependency treatment program, submit to the control of a detective agency, refrain from consuming alcohol or controlled substances, and maintain no contact with the victim or witnesses. The District Court adopted the State\u2019s and Clark\u2019s stipulations and ordered that Clark be released to formal house arrest. In total, Clark remained incarcerated at FCDC for a total of forty-one days, from April 27, 2006, until June 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b67 On January 18, 2007, Clark pleaded nolo contendere to aggravated assault, pursuant to a plea agreement. The District Court conducted a sentencing hearing on March 8,2007, and, after reviewing the pre-sentence investigation report and hearing testimony, sentenced Clark to fifteen years, with ten years suspended, at Montana State Prison. The District Court\u2019s Judgment and Sentence was filed with the clerk of court on March 27, 2007. In addition to the prison term, the District Court ordered Clark to pay surcharges, costs associated with the pre-sentence investigation, restitution, and a fine. The District Court credited Clark fifty dollars for each of the forty-one days that Clark spent incarcerated at FCDC. The District Court awarded Clark no credit for the time spent on formal house arrest. Clark appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b68 We review a criminal sentence for legality only; that is, whether the sentence falls within the statutory parameters. <em>State v. Mingus, </em>2004 MT 24, \u00b6 10, 319 Mont. 349, \u00b6 10, 84 P.3d 658, \u00b6 10.  A sentence that falls within the statutory parameters constitutes a legal sentence. <em>Mingus, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b69 I. Did Clark file an untimely notice of appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u00b610 As an initial matter, the State asserts that Clark failed to file his notices of appeal within the time allotted under the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure. In criminal cases, a party must appeal from a judgment entered pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-116, MCA, within sixty days following the entry of judgment. M. R. App. P. 4(5)(b). Absent extraordinary circumstances that amount to a \u201cgross miscarriage of justice,\u201d we refuse to grant out-of-time appeals. M. R. App. P. 4(6). \u00b611 The District Court issued a written judgment that described the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>details of Clark\u2019s sentence and granted Clark credit for the time he served at FCDC prior to his nolo contendere plea. The written judgment was dated March 23, 2007, and it was filed with the clerk of court on March 27, 2007. Clark filed a notice of appeal on May 23, 2007, and an amended notice of appeal on May 25, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b612 The State maintains that both of Clark\u2019s notices of appeal are untimely because they were filed more than sixty days after the March 23,2007, entry of judgment. We disagree. Although the District Court signed the written judgment on March 23,2007, the judgment actually was entered on March 27, 2007, when the clerk of court filed the judgment and entered it into the record. Thus, Clark filed his first notice of appeal fifty-seven days after the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment and his amended notice of appeal fifty-nine days after the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment. We conclude that Clark\u2019s appeal properly is before us because Clark\u2019s notices of appeal fall within the sixty-day timeframe allotted under the rules of appellate procedure. M. R. App. P. 4(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b613 II. Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence when it failed to award credit for time spent on house arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b614 Clark argues that \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, requires the District Court to credit Clark for the time he spent on house arrest and that the District Court\u2019s failure to do so amounts to an illegal sentence. Clark acknowledges that he failed to \u201cspecifically object\u201d regarding house-arrest credit, but claims that he \u201cimplicitly raised the issue\u201d through testimony at the sentencing hearing. Additionally, Clark asserts that he may challenge his sentence for the first time on appeal based on our decision in <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b615 We generally refuse to address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 49, 322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 49, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 49. The <em>Lenihan </em>decision, however, provides an exception to our well-established rule and permits appellate review of a criminal sentence that is allegedly illegal or that exceeds statutory mandates, even if the defendant failed to object at the district court. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u00b616 A sentence that falls within the statutory parameters constitutes a legal sentence. <em>Mingus, </em>\u00b6 10. For example, in <em>State v. Swoboda, </em>we concluded that a fifteen-year sentence was neither illegal nor in excess of the statutory mandates because the offense carried a maximum punishment of fifty years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. 276 Mont. 479, 482, 918 P.2d 296, 298 (1996). In this case, the State charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Clark with aggravated assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA. Aggravated assault carries a maximum sentence of twenty years in state prison and a fine of $50,000. Section 45-5-202(2), MCA. Clark pleaded nolo contendere to aggravated assault, and the District Court sentenced him to Montana State Prison for fifteen years, with ten years suspended and credit for time served while incarcerated. Clark\u2019s sentence falls within the statutory parameters of \u00a7 45-5-202(2), MCA, and thus, his sentence constitutes a legal sentence. <em>Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 482, 918 P.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b617  Nonetheless, Clark argues that \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, statutorily requires the District Court to award him credit for the time he served on house arrest prior to sentencing and that the District Court\u2019s failure to award him this credit amounts to an illegal sentence. A sentencing court\u2019s failure to abide by certain statutory requirements may result in an objectionable sentence; however, an objectionable sentence is not necessarily an illegal sentence. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 20, 906 P.2d 663, 668 (1995). In this case, Clark\u2019s sentence does not even amount to an objectionable sentence because \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, does not require the courts to award credit for house arrest served while released on bond. We previously addressed this issue in <em>State v. Gulbranson, </em>2003 MT 139, 316 Mont. 163, 69 P.3d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b618 In <em>Gulbranson, </em>we held that \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, did not require the district court to credit Gulbranson\u2019s sentences for time spent on house arrest and that the district court acted within its discretion when it elected not to award credit for time served on house arrest. <em>Gulbranson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13. In <em>Gulbranson, </em>the district court granted Gulbranson\u2019s motion for bond reduction and release provided that he remained on \u201c \u2018informal\u2019 house arrest\u201d while awaiting a revocation hearing. <em>Gulbranson, </em>\u00b6 12. Like Clark, Gulbranson asserted that \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, required the district court to award credit for his house arrest. We observed that Gulbranson\u2019s motion for bail reduction was not a petition requesting that he be sentenced to house arrest and that Gulbranson\u2019s informal house arrest was a condition of his bond release, not a condition of his suspended sentences. <em>Gulbranson, </em>\u00b6 12. We further stated that Gulbranson\u2019s informal house arrest did not amount to \u201chouse arrest\u201d as contemplated under Title 46, Chapter 18, Part 10 of the Montana Code Annotated, the section which allows an offender to petition the court for house arrest. <em>Gulbranson, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b619 Clark maintains that the formality of his house arrest distinguishes his case from <em>Gulbranson </em>and that his formal house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>arrest rises to the level governed by statute. Consequently, Clark argues, the District Court was required to award him credit for the time he served on house arrest awaiting trial, under \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b620 Section 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\"><em>If a suspended or deferred sentence is revoked, </em>the judge shall consider any elapsed time and either expressly allow all or part of the time as a credit against the sentence or reject all or part of the time as a credit. The judge shall state the reasons for the judge\u2019s determination in the order. Credit must be allowed for time served in a detention center or home arrest time already served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">(Emphasis added.) The defendant in <em>Gulbranson </em>had his suspended sentences revoked and was placed on informal house arrest while awaiting his revocation hearing. Thus, we examined the nature of Gulbranson\u2019s motion and subsequent house arrest because the revocation of Gulbranson\u2019s suspended sentences potentially implicated \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA. We determined that Gulbranson\u2019s house arrest fell short of \u201chouse arrest\u201d as contemplated in Title 46, Chapter 18, Part 10 of the Montana Code Annotated because it was a condition of his release on bond and because the district court entered no order for house arrest as detailed in \u00a7 46-18-1002(3), MCA. <em>Gulbranson, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"A2I\">\u00b621  Although we agree that Clark\u2019s house arrest was more formal than that presented in <em>Gulbranson, </em>no statute requires or authorizes a district court to award credit for time served on house arrest prior to conviction or while released on bond, regardless of the formal nature of the house arrest. Clark was conditionally released to house arrest to await trial for an offense, not as a condition of a suspended or deferred sentence; thus, \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, which requires courts to credit time for house arrest already served, is inapplicable to Clark\u2019s sentence under the plain language of the statute. Moreover, Montana law specifically provides that a person convicted of aggravated assault is not eligible for house arrest. Accordingly, Clark is ineligible to serve any portion of his sentence on house arrest. Sections 46-18-1004 and 46-18-1001(5), MCA. The District Court was not statutorily required to award Clark credit for time served on house arrest. Clark\u2019s sentence falls within the statutory parameters for aggravated assault, and thus, the District Court did not impose an illegal sentence. <em>Mingus, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b622 III. Did the District Court impose unreasonable conditions on Clark\u2019s bond?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u00b623 Clark argues that if he was not entitled to credit for time served on house arrest then the conditions that the District Court imposed on Clark\u2019s bond were unreasonable. Specifically, Clark challenges the condition requiring that he complete a chemical dependency treatment program and the condition requiring that he be supervised by a detective agency. Clark asserts that the District Court exceeded its statutory authority when it imposed these conditions and that these conditions are unconstitutional. Clark acknowledges that he agreed to these conditions, but argues that he did so because he believed he would receive credit for time served on house arrest. Clark argues that the lack of credit, in part, makes these conditions unreasonable for bond purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b624 Clark challenges the bond conditions for the first time on appeal. We refuse to consider issues raised for the first time on appeal because it is fundamentally unfair to fault the district court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it never had the opportunity to consider. <em>McCaslin, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b491-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
