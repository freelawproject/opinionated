(Serena Vista) is a Wyoming limited liability company registered to do business in Montana. It owns real property in Ravalli County, Montana, and holds established water rights associated with the property. The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC), the agency authorized to regulate water rights in Montana, alleged that Serena Vista had created a \u201cplace of storage\u201d on the property that had not been permitted by the DNRC. The agency demanded that Serena Vista cease its storage activities and seek an application to change its water rights. Serena Vista filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment in the Twenty-First Judicial District Court arguing that DNRC had not promulgated a rule defining \u201cplace of storage.\u201d The District Court dismissed the Petition with prejudice. Serena Vista appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">\u00b63 Did the District Court erroneously dismiss with prejudice Serena Vista\u2019s Petition for Declaratory Judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">\u00b64 Serena Vista owns five water rights associated with its ranching operation in the Bitterroot Valley in Ravalli County, Montana. In February 2006 DNRC received a complaint from other riparian rights\u2019 owners alleging that Serena Vista had created a storage pit on its property and that the change in Serena Vista\u2019s water activities was adversely affecting their water rights. In March 2006 DNRC notified Serena Vista in writing of the complaint and ordered that, \u201c[i]f the alleged activities are occurring they must cease immediately.\u201d The agency also indicated that it would meet with the principals of Serena Vista on the property for an on-site investigation on March 28, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"AMs\">\u00b65 In April 2006 DNRC issued a letter to Serena Vista requesting additional information pertaining to water activity concerns it identified during its on-site visit. After reviewing the information provided by Serena Vista, the agency found that Serena Vista had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>changed a point of diversion without notifying DNRC, and had created a \u201cplace of storage\u201d without DNRC authorization-both in violation of DNRC regulations. Serena Vista disputed the agency\u2019s allegations and requested statutory and regulatory support for them. In June 2006 DNRC explained in writing its underlying legal authority. In July 2006 Serena Vista filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment arguing that DNRC\u2019s finding were \u201cmade upon unlawful procedure,\u201d were arbitrary and capricious, and were an unwarranted exercise of DNRC\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b66 In September 2006 DNRC moved to dismiss Serena Vista\u2019s Petition on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (hereinafter Rule 12(b)(6)) and as a result the District Court did not have jurisdiction. DNRC also argued that the agency\u2019s letter notifying Serena Vista of water violations was not \u201ca proper subject for a declaratory judgment,\u201d and that Serena Vista had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. Serena Vista opposed the motion to dismiss but in November 2006 the District Court determined that Serena Vista had not exhausted its administrative remedies, and therefore the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act. It dismissed the Petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b67 Serena Vista filed a timely appeal from the dismissal of its Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u00b68 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Rule 12(b)(6) allows a defendant to move for dismissal of a claim on the ground that the petitioner/plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) has the effect of admitting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint. In considering the motion, the complaint is construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and all allegations of fact contained therein are taken as true. <em>Plouffe v. State, </em>2003 MT 62, \u00b6 8, 314 Mont. 413, \u00b6 8, 66 P.3d 316, \u00b6 8 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u00b69 The issue before us is whether the District Court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>dismissing Serena Vista\u2019s Petition for Declaratory Judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Serena Vista presents several arguments on appeal including a challenge under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA) alleging that DNRC had unlawfully failed to properly promulgate a \u201crule\u201d but nonetheless concluded that Serena Vista had violated this \u201crule.\u201d Serena Vista argues, and it is undisputed, that in 2006 the term \u201cplace of storage\u201d was not defined by Montana statute or rule. However, DNRC concluded that Serena Vista violated applicable rules by creating a \u201cplace of storage\u201d without DNRC approval. DNRC cites Admin. R. M. 36.12.1901(1), which requires that an \u201capplication to change a water right ... must be filed when an applicant desires to change the point of diversion, place of use, purpose of use, or <em>place of storage </em>of a water right.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b610 As noted above, upon notice from DNRC that it was in violation of water rights regulations, Serena Vista asked for the legal authority upon which DNRC based its conclusion. In addition to providing specific legal authority for its position, DNRC addressed the \u201cplace of storage\u201d issue in its June 2006 letter by stating that it \u201chas long considered a pumping pit as providing that volume of water necessary to supply the immediate need of the pump capacity. Quantities larger than this are deemed storage.\u201d Serena Vista maintains that this pronouncement in DNRC\u2019s letter amounted to, or \u201cconstituted a rule as defined by statute.\u201d It insists that because this \u201crule\u201d was not lawfully promulgated under MAPA, it is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b611 Premised upon its determination that DNRC\u2019s June 2006 letter actually constituted an unlawfully created rule, Serena Vista invokes \u00a7 2-4-506(4), MCA (of MAPA), and the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, \u00a7 27-8-201 through -331, MCA, as authority for its declaratory judgment action, arguing these statutes authorize it to seek a judicial determination of the validity and application of the ostensible \u201crule.\u201d It posits that the \u201c[determination of the validity of an administrative rule is a matter of legal interpretation for the judiciary to decide rather than a regulatory determination requiring agency expertise and exhaustion of agency administrative remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b612 The State responds that, in all likelihood, this matter will be moot by the time this Court reaches its decision because, by that time, DNRC will have a properly promulgated rule defining \u201cplace of storage,\u201d and Serena Vista has already agreed \u201cto comply with all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>statutes and regulations.\u201d In fact, DNRC promulgated a regulatory definition of \u201cplace of storage\u201d in Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(48) (effective February 1,2008). \u201cPlace of storage\u201d is now defined as a \u201creservoir, pit, pit-dam, or pond.\u201d As a result, Serena Vista\u2019s claim that DNRC relied upon an improperly promulgated rule to prohibit Serena Vista from continued use of what it refers to as its \u201cirrigation pumping pit,\u201d is, therefore, arguably moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b613 Serena Vista replies that should such a rule be properly promulgated before our ruling we should nonetheless address its issues on the merits. It maintains that the agency or other State agencies could once again \u201cevade MAPA rule-making requirements by simply implementing ad hoc rules and only properly promulgating rules when the agency\u2019s actions are judicially challenged\u201d; therefore, it argues because the agency\u2019s actions are capable of repetition, we should address this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b614 A justiciable controversy must exist for this Court to adjudicate a dispute. <em>Clark v. Roosevelt County, </em>2007 MT 44, \u00b6 11,336 Mont. 118, \u00b6 11, 154 P.3d 48, \u00b6 11. We do not render advisory opinions, and we limit our rulings to those matters in which we can grant effective relief. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 11. Mootness is a threshold issue which must be resolved before addressing the underlying dispute. <em>Grabow v. Montana High School Ass\u2019n, </em>2000 MT 159, \u00b6 14, 300 Mont. 227, \u00b6 14, 3 P.3d 650, \u00b6 14 (citing <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>1999 MT 21, \u00b6 17, 293 Mont. 188, \u00b6 17, 974 P.2d 1150, \u00b6 17). This Court has consistently held that \u201ca moot question is one which existed once but because of an event or happening, it has ceased to exist and no longer presents an actual controversy.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Lewis and Clark, </em>1999 MT 106, \u00b6 12, 294 Mont. 310, \u00b6 12, 980 P.2d 1049, \u00b6 12 (citation omitted). Moreover, a case will become moot for the purposes of an appeal \u201cwhere by a change of circumstances prior to the appellate decision the case has lost any practical purpose for the parties, for instance where the grievance that gave rise to the case has been eliminated....\u201d <em>Matter of T.J.F., </em>229 Mont. 473, 475, 747 P.2d 1356, 1357 (1987) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b615 Given the current circumstances, dismissal of Serena Vista\u2019s Petition is appropriate unless as argued by Serena Vista this issue is capable of repetition. This exception to the mootness doctrine recognizes that the amount of time inherent in the litigation process renders it potentially impossible in some cases for a final judicial decision to be reached before the case is rendered moot. In such circumstances, because application of the mootness doctrine would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>effectively deny the remedy of appeal, a court may agree to issue a decision even after the actual controversy has been resolved. <em>Billings High Sch. Dis. v. Billings Gazette, </em>2006 MT 329, \u00b6 14, 335 Mont. 94, \u00b6 14, 149 P.3d 565, \u00b6 14 (citations omitted). However, a party seeking to invoke the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine bears the burden of establishing both that the challenged action is too short in duration to be litigated fully before its cessation and that there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subject to the same action again. <em>Billings High School, </em>\u00b6 14. <em>Accord Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864. Serena Vista has failed to establish or even argue that there is a reasonable expectation that it will again be the victim of DNRC\u2019s failure to properly implement new water regulations. As a result, we decline to review the merits of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b616  Accordingly, we conclude that the grievance that gave rise to this case-the failure of DNRC to properly implement a rule defining \u201cplace of storage\u201d-has lost any practical purpose for the parties and is thus moot for the purposes of appeal. Because we hold that this issue is moot, we conclude the District Court reached the correct outcome, albeit for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b617  We further conclude that the fact that the District Court\u2019s dismissal was \u201cwith prejudice\u201d-a determination to which Serena Vista objects-is, in light of our disposition here, of no consequence to Serena Vista, because we have resolved this matter on grounds of mootness. This being so, there is no prospect that the same issue will again be presented to the District Court. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Serena Vista\u2019s Petition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\"> Notably, Serena Vista does not raise here the question of whether its pit does or does not constitute a \u201cplace of storage\u201d as defined by DNRC.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
