We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">\u00b62 On February 14, 2006, Stephenson, represented by counsel, entered into a plea agreement wherein Stephenson agreed to plead guilty to the offenses of two counts of partner or family member assault, misdemeanors, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of tampering with witnesses and informants, a felony, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u00a7 45-7-206, MCA, committed on or about August 15, 2005, and September 6 through December 13,2005. In exchange for Stephenson\u2019s plea of guilty, the State agreed that, on the charge of tampering with witnesses and informants, Stephenson would be sentenced to the Montana State Prison for three years, all suspended, and on the two counts of partner or family member assault, Stephenson would be sentenced to twelve months in the Missoula County jail, with all but time served since the date of his arrest suspended. The sentences were to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b63 The parties agreed to a number of conditions of probation and to any probation conditions recommended by the probation/parole officer in the presentence investigation report, but there was no agreement that the court would impose any particular fine. However, in the \u201cACCEPTANCE\u201d paragraph immediately preceding the signatures of Stephenson, his counsel, and the prosecutor, Stephenson acknowledged the following: \u201cI am agreeing to undertake certain financial obligations such as restitution, fines, court costs, fees. By accepting this agreement, I state that I will be able to meet these obligations over the period of time that I am on probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b64 The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) was filed with the court on April 6, 2006. In the section of the PSI captioned \u201cEVALUATION/RECOMMENDATION,\u201d the probation/parole officer listed \u201cthe conditions contained in the plea agreement, along with those I recommend for any period of community supervision.\u201d Of relevance to this appeal, one of the recommended conditions stated as follows: \u201cThe Defendant shall pay a fine of $85.00 to the Community Service Program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b65 On December 19, 2006, Stephenson, his counsel, and the prosecutor appeared in court for sentencing. The minute entry of that date recites that the court had received and reviewed the PSI. At the outset of the hearing, the District Court stated that it would follow the plea agreement. Thereafter, at the court\u2019s invitation, defense counsel objected to certain recommended conditions of probation that counsel claimed were not included in the plea agreement, including the $85 fine to the community service program. The transcript of the sentencing hearing reflects the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, [the condition] is a fine to the community service program. It\u2019s not in the plea agreement. We\u2019d object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">THE COURT: What community service fee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: There is nothing in the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>agreement talking about an $85 community service fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">THE COURT: Okay, what else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And that\u2019s it, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">THE COURT: Did you have anything you what [sic] to add?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Well, I\u2019m trying to find a copy of the plea agreement. I believe-I know in my plea agreements, the $85 fine to community service is included, and I copied that from [another deputy county attorney], so I\u2019m confused why that wouldn\u2019t be in here as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">THE COURT: The one I\u2019ve got, at least, I\u2019m not finding it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: As to all of his concerns, those are all standard rules of probation that are applied in all cases, and he\u2019s certainly aware of what those are in every case. He\u2019s in a position to advise his client what the traditional conditions of probation are. As the Court\u2019s noted, these are all standard conditions and they\u2019re imposed in every case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">\u00b66 The court then proceeded to impose a three-year suspended sentence on Count III and two six-month suspended sentences on Counts I and II, all to run concurrently. In addition, the court imposed certain conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">The conditions that will be imposed are those that are listed on pages 7 and 8 of the presentence report with the following exceptions: Condition 6 is deleted since there are no fines being imposed in this case. I will, however, impose all of the normally imposed surcharges and-although, I guess it\u2019s denominated the fine of $85 to the community service program, I view that more in the nature of the surcharge fee. I will impose that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">The court also deleted or amended certain other conditions that are not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">\u00b67 After the court imposed the sentence, defense counsel addressed the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, Judge, he would move to withdraw his guilty plea based on the fact of the imposition of the fine of $85 to the community service program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\">THE COURT: Denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">\u00b68 On January 2, 2007, the court entered its written judgment, which set forth various terms and conditions of probation, including Condition No. 10, which stated as follows: \u201cThe Defendant shall pay a fine to go to the community service program in the amount of EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS ($85).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u00b69 Stephenson timely filed his notice of appeal on February 28,2007. In due course, he filed his opening brief on appeal, articulating the following issue: Did the District Court err in not allowing the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea, given that the court imposed a fine not included in the plea agreement and that the State did not support the plea agreement? The State filed its response brief, arguing against the merits of Stephenson\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b610 Then, nearly seven months later (on January 11,2008), the State filed a \u201cNotice of Concession and Waiver of $85 Fine for Community Service Program.\u201d The State\u2019s Concession and Waiver document stated that, after consultation with the Missoula County Attorney, the State was acknowledging and conceding that the $85 fine was \u201cimproperly imposed\u201d and the State was waiving its enforcement in this case. However, the State explicitly did not concede that Stephenson should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea. Rather, the State asserted that because of its concession and waiver of enforcement of the improperly imposed $85 fine, the issue of Stephenson\u2019s withdrawal of his guilty plea \u201cis moot.\u201d The State noted that Stephenson did not agree to dismiss this appeal by stipulation on the grounds of the State\u2019s concession. The State concluded its notice requesting that this Court, \u201cwith or without entertaining the merits of the issues already briefed in this appeal,\u201d remand this case to the District Court for the limited purpose of striking Condition No. 10 from Stephenson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b611 Given that this case had been briefed for some seven months and had already been submitted to the Court for decision three days prior to the State\u2019s filing its Notice of Concession and Waiver, given that Stephenson did not agree to dismiss this appeal by stipulation on the grounds of the State\u2019s concession, given that the State does not concede that Stephenson should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea (the relief that Stephenson requests in this appeal), and given the State\u2019s equivocal request that we proceed \u201cwith or without entertaining the merits of the issues already briefed in this appeal,\u201d we conclude that it is appropriate to address the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in not allowing Stephenson to withdraw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>his guilty plea, given the court\u2019s imposition of the $85 fine/surcharge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> payable to the community service program and the State\u2019s alleged failure to support the plea agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b613 With respect to appeals from denials of motions to withdraw guilty pleas, we review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous and the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 24, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6 24, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b614 Here, Stephenson claims that the plea agreement did not contemplate the imposition of an $85 fine and that there was no statutory authority for the District Court to impose an $85 surcharge fee payable to the community service program. Thus, he argues, by imposing this fine/surcharge, the court did not follow the plea agreement, the State did not support the plea agreement, and the court, therefore, should have allowed him to withdraw his plea pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b615 Accordingly, inasmuch as Stephenson\u2019s argument goes to the District Court\u2019s authority to impose the $85 fine/surcharge and the court\u2019s failure to follow the affirmative mandates of \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA, we review the sentence imposed by the court and, more specifically, Condition No. 10 for legality only, confining our review to determining whether the court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, and whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. This determination is a question of law and, as such, our review is de novo. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6\u00b6 174-75, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6\u00b6 174-75, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6\u00b6 174-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">I. Whether the District Court Rejected the Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">\u00b616 In this case, the parties\u2019 plea agreement was one in which the State agreed to a specific sentence as the appropriate disposition of the case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-12-2 ll(1)(b), MCA. The transcript of the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>hearing reflects that the court accepted the plea agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">THE COURT: Yes. And for whatever it\u2019s worth, since I\u2019m not going to let you withdraw your guilty plea [pursuant to a prior motion to withdraw guilty plea not at issue here], I will follow the plea agreement you entered into.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b617  Under \u00a7 46-12-211(3), MCA, if the court accepts a plea agreement, the court \u201cshall inform the defendant that it will embody in the judgment and sentence the disposition provided for in the plea agreement.\u201d Here, although the court did not explicitly inform Stephenson as required by the statute, this omission did not lessen the court\u2019s obligation to \u201cembody in the judgment and sentence the disposition provided for in the plea agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b618 Under \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA, if the court rejects a plea agreement of the type at issue here (one under \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(b), MCA), the court \u201cshall, on the record,\u201d do the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">inform the parties of this fact and advise the defendant that the court is not bound by the plea agreement, afford the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea, and advise the defendant that if the defendant persists in the guilty or nolo contendere plea, the disposition of the case may be less favorable to the defendant than that contemplated by the plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Here, nothing in the transcript of the sentencing hearing indicates that the court rejected the plea agreement or provided Stephenson the notice required by \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b619 Stephenson\u2019s argument, therefore, is as follows. First, he argues that the plea agreement did not contemplate the imposition of any fines and that there is no statutory authority for an $85 surcharge fee payable to the community service program. Thus, by imposing the $85 fee/surcharge, the District Court effectively rejected the agreement. Stephenson maintains that under \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA, he was entitled to withdraw his guilty plea. Second, Stephenson argues that the prosecutor did not support the plea agreement and that he, therefore, should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and proceed to trial. <em>See State v. Munoz, </em>2001 MT 85, 305 Mont. 139, 23 P.3d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj8\">\u00b620 We are not persuaded on the record before us that the District Court rejected the plea agreement thus entitling Stephenson to withdraw his plea. The transcript of the sentencing hearing reflects clearly that the court accepted the plea agreement. Furthermore, Stephenson agreed in the plea agreement to the imposition of any probation conditions recommended by the probation/parole officer in the PSI. The $85 fine/surcharge payable to the community service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>program was recommended in the PSI, and the court imposed that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b621 Accordingly, we do not agree with Stephenson\u2019s contention that the District Court rejected the plea agreement. Nor do we agree with Stephenson that the State failed to support the plea agreement. The critical issues, therefore, are whether requiring the payment of an $85 fine/surcharge to the community service program is lawful and, if it is not, whether that fact entitles Stephenson to withdraw his guilty plea. We turn, then, to the legality of the $85 fine/surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">II. The Legality of the $85 Fine/Surcharge</p>\n<p id=\"Az4\">\u00b622 Stephenson points out that a sentencing court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority. <em>See State v. Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029 (1993). Thus, unless the District Court had specific statutory authority to impose the $85 fine/surcharge payable to the community service program, the fine/surcharge is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b623 As noted above, in its Notice of Concession and Waiver of $85 Fine for Community Service Program, the State conceded that the $85 fine/surcharge was \u201cimproperly imposed.\u201d However, the State provided no insight as to why, having argued in its brief on appeal that the fine/surcharge was lawfully imposed, the State subsequently concluded that the fine/surcharge was improperly imposed. In its brief on appeal, the State argued that Stephenson \u201cbargained for the benefit of an ordinary suspended sentence\u201d and agreed, \u201cwithout limitation,\u201d to any probation condition recommended in the PSI, therefore including the $85 fine/surcharge. The State reached this conclusion based on the following language in the plea agreement: \u201cAny condition of probation recommended by Probation and Parole, including, but not limited to . . . .\u201d The State characterized the $85 fine/surcharge as \u201ca standard condition of probation, normally imposed \u2018for any period of community supervision.\u2019 \u201d The State also pointed out that the PSI recommending the $85 fine/surcharge was provided to Stephenson before sentencing. Accordingly, the State maintained that Stephenson should have contemplated the $85 fine/surcharge, that he bargained for a sentence that includes the $85 fine/surcharge, and, as a result, that the District Court correctly denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Yet, notwithstanding these arguments, the State now concedes-without any rationale or explanation-that the $85 fine/surcharge was improperly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b624 Given Stephenson\u2019s arguments and the State\u2019s unexplained change of position in this appeal, we conclude that it is appropriate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>address the legality of the $85 payable to the community service program either as \u201ca fine\u201d (as it was characterized in the court\u2019s written judgment) or \u201cin the nature of [a] surcharge fee\u201d (as it was characterized by the court at the sentencing hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">A. The $85 as a \u201cFine\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b625 The community service program is a program which operates under the Montana Community Service Act. <em>See </em>Title 90, Chapter 14, Part 1, MCA. The Act was adopted in 1993 and amended in 1999 and 2007. Its purpose is to encourage volunteer service to the state in a variety of projects and programs. <em>See </em>\u00a7 90-14-103, MCA. The programs under the Act are not operated by the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b626 Section 46-18-231, MCA, provides authority for a sentencing court to impose a fine in a felony or misdemeanor case. Section 46-18-232, MCA, provides authority for the court to require a convicted defendant in a felony or misdemeanor case to pay certain costs. Section 46-18-233, MCA, provides authority for the court to make the payment of fines and costs imposed under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-231 and -232, MCA, a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b627 Of significance here, \u00a7 46-18-235, MCA, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">Except as provided in 61-8-726, the money collected by a court as a result of the imposition of fines or assessment of costs under the provisions of 46-18-231 and 46-18-232 must be paid:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">(1) by the clerk of district court to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">(a) the department of revenue for deposit into the state general fund; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">(b) if the fine was imposed for a violation of Title 45, chapter 9 or 10, and at the court\u2019s discretion, the drug forfeiture account maintained under 44-12-206 for the law enforcement agency that made the arrest from which the conviction and fine arose; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">(2) by a justice\u2019s court pursuant to 3-10-601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">\u00b628  In this case, there is no question that the court had authority to impose a fine by reason of Stephenson\u2019s plea of guilty to partner or family member assault, <em>see </em>\u00a7 45-5-206(3)(a)(ii), MCA, and tampering with witnesses and informants, <em>see </em>\u00a7 45-7-206(2), MCA. However, we have found no statutory authority for the court to impose a fine and then direct the disposition of the money collected from that fine to the community service program. Under \u00a7 46-18-235, MCA, any fine imposed by the court in this case was required to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this statute. Accordingly, the court\u2019s disposition of the $85, when considered as a \u201cfine\u201d payable to the community service program, is patently illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>B. The $85 as a \u201cSurcharge Fee\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b629 Various Montana statutes authorize the imposition of fees and surcharges on defendants at sentencing. For example, \u00a7 46-18-111, MCA, provides for a $50 fee payable to the Department of Corrections at the time the presentence investigation report is completed; \u00a7 3-1-317, MCA, provides for a $10 user surcharge payable to the Department of Revenue for deposit in the state general fund to be used for funding court information technology; and \u00a7 46-18-236, MCA, provides for the imposition of various charges upon conviction. No statute, however, authorizes an assessment \u201cin the nature of [a] surcharge fee\u201d to be paid to the community service program.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">C. The $85 Fine/Surcharge is Illegal</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b630  \u201cIt is well-established that a district court\u2019s authority to impose sentences in criminal cases is defined and constrained by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Blackwell, </em>2001 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 306 Mont. 267, \u00b6 6, 32 P.3d 771, \u00b6 6 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \u201c[w]e have long held that a district court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\u201d <em>Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. at 346, 846 P.2d at 1029 (citing <em>State v. Stone, </em>40 Mont. 88, 105 P. 89 (1909), and <em>State v. Openshaw, </em>172 Mont. 511, 565 P.2d 319 (1977)). Whether one characterizes the $85 in this case as a \u201cfine\u201d or a \u201csurcharge fee\u201d payable to the community service program, the imposition is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b631 We recently disapproved this sort of creative sentencing in <em>State v. Krum, </em>2007 MT 229, 339 Mont. 154, 168 P.3d 658. Krum was convicted of two counts of felony sexual assault, and the district court sentenced him to the Department of Corrections for 20 years, with all but 2 years suspended. The sentence was subject to a number of terms and conditions, including the successful completion of an approved sex-offender treatment program and payment of restitution to the victim\u2019s family. <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 7. In addition, the court imposed the following condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">The defendant has sufficient funds to pay a $5,000.00 assessment to the Park County Court Automation Fund, $2,500.00 to the TriCounty Network for Domestic Violence, and $2,500.00 to Park County Big Brothers and Sisters, all to give back to society and those who assist and help others who are victims of these type of offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\"><em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">\u00b632 Stating that a court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority and that a sentence not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>on statutory authority is an illegal sentence, <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 11, we held that the assessments imposed by the district court could not be considered as \u201cfines\u201d authorized by \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA (the sexual-assault statute), <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 15. Moreover, we considered whether \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, authorized the district court\u2019s imposition of the assessments. This section provides that the sentencing judge may impose \u201cany other limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d We concluded that \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, did not provide the necessary statutory authority for imposing the assessments because the assessments were not \u201climitations\u201d on Krum\u2019s conduct but, rather, were affirmative duties to make donations to community entities. We also determined that the assessments could not be characterized as restitution because the money was being paid to community entities rather than to the victim. <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b633 Similarly, here, the District Court\u2019s imposition of the $85 as a \u201cfine\u201d or \u201csurcharge fee\u201d payable to the community service program also fails. As in <em>Krum, </em>imposition of an $85 fine/surcharge payable to the community service program is not authorized by statute and is, therefore, illegal. <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 26. Having reached that decision, we next turn to the appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">III. Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b634 As we observed in <em>Krum, </em>the remedy for an illegal sentence varies. Where the illegal portion of the sentence is a condition of a suspended sentence, we have typically remanded with instructions to strike the offending portion. Where the illegal portion of the sentence affects the entire sentence, or where this Court is unable to ascertain what action a sentencing court would have taken under a correct application of the law, remand for resentencing is the preferred remedy. <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b635  Here, the illegal portion of Stephenson\u2019s sentence (Condition No. 10) is only one of several conditions placed on his probation. Without the illegal $85 fine/surcharge, he will still be subject to various fees and surcharges authorized by statute and he will still have to comply with other terms and conditions of probation that are not at issue here. Moreover, were we to strike the illegal assessment, the rest of the sentence would not be affected. <em>Cf. Krum, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-25. Accordingly, we conclude that the appropriate remedy is to reverse this portion of Stephenson\u2019s sentence and remand with instructions to strike Condition No. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b636 We reject Stephenson\u2019s contentions that the District Court rejected the plea agreement and that the State did not support the plea agreement, and we hold that Stephenson is not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea on these grounds. However, we conclude that the objected-to $85 fine/surcharge payable to the community service program is not statutorily authorized and, thus, is illegal. We hold that this portion of Stephenson\u2019s sentence must, therefore, be stricken. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of Condition No. 10 and remand this matter to the District Court with instructions to strike that condition from Stephenson\u2019s sentence. We affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b637 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-13\"> All statutory references are to the 2005 Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-11\"> Although the court characterized the $85 payable to the community service program as \u201cmore in the nature of the surcharge fee\u201d at the sentencing hearing, the court later characterized it as \u201ca fine\u201d in its written judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b95-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AlY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u00b638 I dissent. The Court has glossed over the issue raised by the defendant in order to address an issue of its own making.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u00b639 As the Court notes, the PSI contained recommendation No. 11 that \u201cthe Defendant shall pay a fine of $85.00 to the Community Service Program.\u201d Stephenson objected to this fine, stating: \u201cIt\u2019s not in the plea agreement. We\u2019d object to that.\u201d When the trial court imposed a suspended sentence along with the above condition, Stephenson moved to withdraw his plea \u201cbased on the fact of the imposition of the fine of $85 to the community service program.\u201d The court, stating that it viewed the condition as a \u201csurcharge fee,\u201d denied the motion to withdraw the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">\u00b640 On appeal Stephenson raises one issue: \u201cDid the district court err in not allowing the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea when the district court imposed a fine not included in the parties\u2019 appropriate disposition plea agreement and the State did not support the plea agreement?\u201d Stephenson\u2019s prayer for relief states: \u201cStephenson would respectfully request this Court reverse and remand this case to the district court granting Mr. Stephenson the statutory and case law right to withdraw his guilty plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">\u00b641 From sentencing through appeal, Stephenson has consistently taken the position that since the District Court imposed a condition not contemplated by the plea agreement, the court should have advised him that it was rejecting the plea agreement and allowed him to withdraw his plea under \u00a7 46-12-211(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u00b642 This Court appropriately concludes that the trial court did not reject the plea agreement and thus Stephenson is not entitled to withdraw his plea. Having so concluded, the only issue raised on appeal is resolved, and the judgment should be affirmed. The Court, however, goes on to address an issue not raised by Stephenson-i.e., whether, independently of a plea agreement, a sentencing court can, by way of a fine or a surcharge fee, direct that the defendant pay money to the community service program.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b643 Although Stephenson does argue that since the plea agreement did not contemplate imposition of any fines, the court had no authority to simply recharacterize the PSI\u2019s recommended $85 \u201cfine\u201d as a \u201csurcharge fee,\u201d he does not advance the broader argument that the court had no authority -under the rubric of either a fee or a fine to direct that the defendant pay money to the community service program.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b644 Given that Stephenson did not raise this issue at sentencing or on appeal, I would simply conclude (as does the Court) that since the sentencing court did not reject the plea agreement, Stephenson is not entitled to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b645 Finally, it should also be noted that the State, on appeal, filed a concession and waiver of the $85 fine. Thus, the Court\u2019s insistence on addressing the legality of the fine is doubly gratuitous in that the issue was not raised by Stephenson and, to the extent it was relevant, was mooted by the State\u2019s waiver.</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-7\">JUSTICE RICE and JUSTICE MORRIS join in the dissent of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b96-8\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AY0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u00b646 I join in Justice Leaphart\u2019s dissent and would end this matter after reaching the conclusion that Stephenson is not entitled to withdraw his plea. Further, even if I were to reach the merits, I would disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that a sentencing court is without authority to impose a surcharge or a fee related to a probationer\u2019s participation in a community service program. The Court\u2019s reasoning-that no statute allows for a charge \u201cin the nature of a surcharge fee\u201d-is a forced and artificial premise which directly conflicts with a sentencing court\u2019s broad statutory authority to construct probationary sentences in the interests of rehabilitation, restitution and the protection of society.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
