We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it limited counsels\u2019 voir dire time to fifteen minutes?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b64 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing police officer testimony pertaining to the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b65 Does the inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, whereby a jury may infer that a defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol from his refusal to take a sobriety test, violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b66 Does the inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, deny a defendant his right to counsel at a critical stage of the prosecution or violate a defendant\u2019s right not to be compelled to give testimony against himself?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\u00b67 On August 20, 2005, a motorist observed a truck being driven erratically along Highway 200 near Missoula, Montana. After following the truck for some distance, the motorist called 911 to notify authorities. Officer Johnson responded to the call and upon seeing a vehicle that matched the description given by the motorist began to follow the vehicle. According to the Officer\u2019s report, he saw the truck cross the white fog line repeatedly and noticed that the license plate was blocked and the truck was missing a driver side mirror. Before Johnson executed a stop, the truck, subsequently determined to be driven by Michaud, pulled off the road and into a parking lot. At that time, Johnson activated his vehicle\u2019s overhead emergency lights and pulled in behind Michaud.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">\u00b68 At trial, Johnson explained that he approached the vehicle and when speaking to Michaud, noticed the truck smelled of alcohol. Johnson\u2019s incident report also indicated that he smelled alcohol on Michaud\u2019s breath. When Michaud opened the door to get in the back of the truck for his wallet, the officer saw a beer can in the truck cab. Johnson testified that Michaud had difficulty maintaining his balance when he got out of the truck and needed to use his truck to stabilize himself. Michaud volunteered that there was an outstanding warrant on him but denied drinking when Johnson asked him. Shortly thereafter, however, he confessed that he had been drinking earlier in the day while tubing on a river. Johnson asked Michaud to perform three field sobriety tests-the HGN, the walk and turn, and the one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>legged stand. Michaud did not perform well on any of these tests. After informing Michaud of the consequences of refusing to take a breath test, Johnson asked Michaud to take a portable breath test. Michaud refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b69 Johnson arrested Michaud on the outstanding warrant and for driving while under the influence of alcohol and transported him to the Missoula County jail. Upon arrival Johnson had Michaud take the three field sobriety tests again and again Michaud failed these tests. Johnson also asked Michaud to take the breath test and again Michaud refused. Michaud was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b610 Michaud was convicted in Justice Court in November 2005 for second offense misdemeanor driving under the influence. He appealed this conviction immediately to the Fourth Judicial District Court in Missoula County where a jury trial was held on April 28,2006. At the commencement of proceedings, the District Court judge informed the attorneys that each attorney would have fifteen minutes to voir dire the jury. He also indicated that it was his practice to ask a standard set of questions during voir dire as well. Michaud objected to the fifteen-minute limitation but the District Court overruled the objection. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury convicted Michaud of misdemeanor driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b611 Michaud filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b612 Additional facts will be presented as needed for our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u00b613 It is well established that \u201c[ajbsent an abuse of discretion ... the trial judge has great latitude in controlling voir dire.\u201d <em>State v. LaMere, </em>190 Mont. 332, 339,621 P.2d 462, 466 (1980). We therefore review the District Court\u2019s imposition of a time limit on voir dire to determine whether this limitation constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">\u00b614 We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence, including oral testimony, under an abuse of discretion standard. We leave the determination of the relevancy and admissibility of evidence to the sound discretion of the trial judge and we will not overturn it absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 12, 328 Mont. 276, \u00b6 12, 119 P.3d 1194, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">\u00b615 Statutes enjoy a presumption of constitutionality; therefore the party making the constitutional challenge bears the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statute is unconstitutional, and any doubt must be resolved in favor of the statute. When reviewing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>question of constitutional law, including the issue of whether a defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated, we review the district court\u2019s conclusion to determine whether its interpretation of the law was correct. <em>Shammel v. Canyon Resources Corp., </em>2007 MT 206, \u00b6 7, 338 Mont. 541, \u00b6 7, 67 P.3d 886, \u00b6 7; <em>City of Great Falls v. Morris, </em>2006 MT 93, \u00b6 12, 332 Mont. 85, \u00b6 12, 134 P.3d 692, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AfI\">\u00b6 16 Lastly, we review jury instructions in a criminal case to determine whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. Further, we recognize that a district court has broad discretion when it instructs a jury, and we therefore review a district court\u2019s decision regarding jury instructions to determine whether the court abused that discretion. <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 32, 337 Mont. 326, \u00b6 32, 160 P.3d 511, \u00b6 32 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b617 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it limited counsels\u2019 voir dire time to fifteen minutes?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b618 Michaud argues that the District Court denied him a fair trial before an impartial jury by limiting his right to voir dire the jury to fifteen minutes. He asserts that the limited time made it impossible for him \u201cto examine a 12 person jury panel for possible bias and prejudice,\u201d to determine if jurors should be excused for cause, and to exercise peremptory challenges \u201cintelligently.\u201d He argues that \u00a7 46-16-114(2), MCA, allows a trial court to limit voir dire only \u201cif the examination is improper.\u201d He opines that because the court imposed a time limit before questioning began, there was no opportunity for such impropriety to occur, and therefore the court abused its discretion. Michaud further maintains that the court limited the time for voir dire for purely expeditious reasons, which is contrary to this Court\u2019s observation in <em>State v. Nichols, 225 </em>Mont. 438, 734 P.2d 170 (1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b619 The State counters that the court offered adequate time for voir dire, in light of the court\u2019s examination of prospective jurors. It points to extra-jurisdictional cases holding that courts have the discretion to set reasonable limits and that Michaud was not deprived of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>constitutional right. It proposes that we adopt a four-prong test used by the Oregon Supreme Court in determining whether a trial court had abused its discretion by placing time limits on voir dire. Under the circumstances of this case, we need not adopt this test to reach a resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b620 As a six-person jury was required to hear this misdemeanor case, twelve prospective jurors were seated initially for voir dire. The District Court indicated, prior to voir dire and outside the presence of potential jurors, that each side would have fifteen minutes to conduct voir dire after the court had conducted its voir dire. The judge noted that, prior to trial, he had invited each side to offer written voir dire questions but that neither counsel had accepted the invitation. The court explained that the time spent on a \u201cfor cause\u201d challenge would not be counted nor would time spent with individual prospective jurors discussing relevant \u201cprivacy\u201d issues be counted against the fifteen-minute limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b621 At this time, Michaud\u2019s counsel objected to the time limit based on <em>Nichols </em>and the amount of publicity generally given to \u201cdrinking and driving\u201d concerns. The court remarked that it was unaware of any specific publicity surrounding this case but that it would pursue that concern in its voir dire. The judge indicated multiple times that he would \u201cremain flexible throughout the [voir dire] process\u201d but believed it was necessary that they were \u201ccognizant of the amount of time that jurors spend in these cases and the need to keep cases moving.\u201d He agreed to ask additional questions presented by counsel so that counsel could preserve their fifteen minutes for other questions. Neither Michaud\u2019s lawyer nor the State\u2019s attorney presented questions for the judge to ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b622 The court asked the prospective jurors questions pertaining to the following matters: (1) whether all were Missoula County residents; (2) had any been convicted of malfeasance in office or a felony or other high crime; (3) whether any knew the attorneys or the defendant, and if so, would any existing relationship affect how the juror viewed the case or weighed the evidence or the juror\u2019s ability to be fair; (4) if any relationships among the prospective jurors would prevent them from working together; (5) whether any were employed by law enforcement or had a close relationship with someone in law enforcement, and if so, whether this would affect the juror\u2019s ability to listen and evaluate testimony in this case; (6) whether any had experience with DUI in their personal lives or the lives of a close friend or family member, and if so, if such experience would predispose them to one side in this case; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>(7) whether any had previously served on a jury, and if so, what kind of case, what was the outcome and whether there was anything about this prior service that would affect their ability to be a fair and impartial juror; (8) if they understand the concepts of \u201cpresumed innocent,\u201d \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the State\u2019s burden, and the right of the defendant to refrain from testifying; (9) whether any were members of the Fully Informed Jury Movement or wished to be; (10) whether any had heard about the defendant and this offense; (11) whether any had had previous experience with the justice system that might affect their ability to meaningfully participate in this proceeding; and (12) whether any had any particular life experience or issue that would divert them from the case. During private discussions with individual jurors conducted during the court\u2019s voir dire, both counsel were able to ask specific questions of the jurors that allowed the attorneys to exercise cause and peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b623 Following the court\u2019s voir dire, the prosecutor conducted voir dire within the allotted fifteen minutes. Subsequently Michaud\u2019s counsel conducted voir dire. Michaud\u2019s attorney questioned prospective jurors about the possibility of bias toward the State\u2019s less experienced attorney and the need to hold the State to its burden of proof. He questioned the jury pool about the existence of bias against criminal defense lawyers in general and prejudice derived from aggressive advertising campaigns against drinking and driving. Counsel also queried whether the jurors believed that erratic driving could be caused by something other than drinking, such as talking on a cell phone, and whether they could believe someone could be innocent even though charged with a crime. His closing questions to the jury pool addressed reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b624 At thirteen minutes, the court notified counsel that he had two minutes remaining in his voir dire. At fifteen minutes, counsel was told that his time was up. He enquired whether he had asked an improper question, was told that he had not, and pressed for additional time. The court allowed him to ask two more questions and upon completion, counsel passed the panel for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b625 During the voir dire process, two jurors were excused for cause and each side challenged three jurors apiece, all of whom were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b626  The purpose of voir dire in a criminal case is to determine the existence of a prospective juror\u2019s partiality. As such, adequate questioning in voir dire enables counsel to properly raise a challenge for cause and to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>Lamere, </em>2005 MT 118, \u00b6 15, 327 Mont. 115, \u00b6 15, 112 P.3d 1005, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted). However, it is also the responsibility of the trial court to oversee the administration of trials and proceedings. <em>In re Marriage of Weber, </em>2004 MT 206, \u00b6 14, 322 Mont. 324, \u00b6 14, 95 P.3d 694, \u00b6 14 (citations omitted); <em>Hegwood v. Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>2003 MT 200, \u00b6 16, 317 Mont. 30, \u00b6 16, 75 P.3d 308, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted). While we do not encourage courts to impose time limits on voir dire in the name of expeditiousness, we conclude that under the circumstances here, the court did not abuse its discretion in imposing reasonable time limits on voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b627 This was a misdemeanor DUI case. While this fact alone may not justify a time limitation, it is a relevant factor. More importantly, the District Court engaged in a comprehensive voir dire before turning the jury over to counsel; thus, many of the areas of inquiry which counsel would otherwise normally explore were covered in advance by the court. In addition, counsel had the opportunity to engage in a colloquy with the jurors regarding potential bias and prejudice as well as the jury\u2019s understanding of the concepts of \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d \u201cinnocent until proven guilty,\u201d and \u201cburden of proof.\u201d For these reasons, we conclude the District Cotut did not abuse its discretion in imposing a fifteen-minute limit on counsels\u2019 voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b628 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing police officer testimony pertaining to the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b629 Michaud argues that the District Cotut abused its discretion when it allowed the arresting officer to testify as to how he administered the HGN test to Michaud and the results, or inferences, from the test. He maintains that the State did not establish a proper foundation upon which Johnson, a non-expert, could offer this evidence. The State acknowledges that it failed to lay a proper foundation and that it did not establish a scientific basis for the reliability of the test results; it argues, however, that the admission was harmless error because it constituted cumulative evidence of Michaud\u2019s guilt. We first determine whether the District Court abused its discretion by admitting the HGN evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b630 The HGN test is a field sobriety test frequently administered by law enforcement. As we explained in <em>City of Missoula v. Robertson, </em>2000 MT 52, 298 Mont. 419, 998 P.2d 144,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">[Njystagmus is the involuntary jerking of the eyeball resulting from the body\u2019s attempt to maintain balance and orientation. Nystagmus may be aggravated by central nervous system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>depressants such as alcohol or barbiturates. Furthermore, the inability of the eyes to maintain visual fixation as they are turned to the side is known as horizontal nystagmus. Thus, the test is conducted by instructing a person to focus on an object, such as a pen, while the officer moves the object back and forth horizontally, and observes the person\u2019s eye movements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The test is scored by counting the number of \u201cclues\u201d of intoxication exhibited by each eye with a maximum score of six (6), meaning each eye exhibited the three clues for which the examiner was looking. Michaud scored six on the HGN, indicating impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b631 We first addressed the admissibility of HGN evidence in <em>State v. Clark, </em>234 Mont. 222, 762 P.2d 853 (1988), when we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">The admission of this type of evidence is a matter of first impression in this jurisdiction. Several states ... have allowed its admission as one method of indicating impairment. We adopt the position of these courts in allowing the admission of the tests. The pivotal question now becomes one of proper foundation (internal citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\"><em>Clark, </em>234 Mont. at 226, 762 P.2d at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\u00b632 We determined in <em>Clark </em>that M. R. Evid. 702 governed admissibility of expert testimony, and held that courts should admit all relevant scientific evidence in the same manner as other expert testimony and allow its weight to be attacked by cross examination or refutation. We implied, rather than expressly held, that expert testimony regarding scientific reliability was required to establish a proper foundation. Ten years later, we clarified our position in <em>Clark </em>with <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75, wherein we expressly stated the requirements of a proper foundation for the admissibility of HGN evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\u00b633 In <em>Hulse, </em>we stated that before an arresting officer may testify to HGN test results, the evidence must show that the arresting officer was properly trained to administer the HGN test and that he or she administered it in accordance with that training. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 70. We also required introduction of evidence regarding the underlying scientific basis for the HGN test. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 70. We concluded that although the arresting officer was trained to administer the HGN test, and administered the test according to his training, nothing in the evidence established that the arresting officer had special training, education, or adequate knowledge qualifying him as an expert to explain the correlation between alcohol consumption and nystagmus, the underlying scientific basis of the HGN test. Accordingly, we concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>there was insufficient foundation for the admission of evidence concerning the HGN test, and that the district court abused its discretion when it summarily denied Hulse\u2019s motion in limine and allowed the officer to testify as to Hulse\u2019s HGN test results. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 72. See <em>also Bramble v. State, Dept. of Justice, MVD, </em>1999 MT 132,294 Mont. 501, 982 P.2d 464, and <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 28, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 28, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b634 The State acknowledges that it failed to establish the necessary foundation for admission of Johnson\u2019s testimony on the HGN results or the inference he drew from these results; therefore, under <em>Hulse, </em>we conclude the District Court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence. We next determine, however, whether this was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b635 In <em>Van Kirk, </em>we set forth a test for determining whether an error prejudices a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and is therefore reversible. The first prong of the test requires us to assess whether an error is \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201ctrial\u201d error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. Structural error is error that \u201caffects the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. On the other hand, trial error is error that typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Further, as we noted in <em>Van Kirk, </em>trial error is \u201camenable to qualitative assessment by a reviewing court for prejudicial impact relative to the other evidence introduced at trial.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b636 We conclude that the error complained of by Michaud is trial error and therefore \u201cis not presumptively prejudicial and ... is not automatically reversible.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Because this is trial error, our analysis proceeds to <em>Van Kirk\u2019s </em>second step-a determination of whether the admission of the HGN evidence was harmless or prejudicial. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 41. In <em>Van Kirk </em>we explained that we must determine if the evidence is \u201ccumulative\u201d or \u201cnon-cumulative. \u201d If the tainted evidence is the <em>only </em>evidence presented to establish a certain fact, in other words it is nora-cumulative, we then look to see if the evidence was presented to prove an element of the charged crime. If the only evidence tending to prove an element of the crime is tainted, inadmissible evidence, then reversal is compelled. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 45. If, however, the non-cumulative evidence was not presented as proof of an element of the charged crime, the State has the opportunity and the burden to demonstrate that there was no possibility that the tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u00b637 On the other hand, if the tainted evidence is cumulative, meaning other evidence to prove the same fact was presented, then the State must show that admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence was presented to the fact-finder and that the quality of the tainted evidence when compared to the properly-admitted evidence would not have contributed to the conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"AhR\">\u00b638 In the case before us, the State argues that the HGN test result was cumulative evidence tending to show that Michaud was intoxicated as charged. It presented the following evidence of proof of Michaud\u2019s intoxication: (1) the failing results of Michaud\u2019s two field sobriety tests-the walk and turn and the one-legged stand; (2) Michaud\u2019s refusal to take the breathalyzer test; (3) the odor of alcohol coming from inside Michaud\u2019s car when the officer was speaking to Michaud; (4) a beer can inside the cab of Michaud\u2019s truck; and (5) Michaud\u2019s admission that he had drunk a couple of beers earlier that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b639 Under these circumstances, we must determine whether the State met its burden in demonstrating that the quality of the HGN evidence was such that it did not contribute to the jury\u2019s conviction of Michaud. We conclude the State failed to meet this burden because it failed to present an argument. Rather, it made the following conclusory statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">Regardless of the HGN test, and as noted above, the record demonstrates Michaud also failed two other field sobriety tests. Thus, the jury could have easily concluded that failure of either the one-legged stand or the walk and turn field sobriety tests demonstrated Michaud was under the influence of alcohol while driving that day. The results of the HGN test was [sic] not necessary for the jury to conclude the State had met its burden of proof that Michaud was driving while under the influence of alcohol when Deputy Johnson stopped him on August 22, 2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqE\">\u00b640 This statement does not constitute a demonstration that \u201cthere was no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46. As we have noted in the past, evidence that is scientific in nature, such as the HGN, is likely to be accorded more weight by a jury than more subjective evidence, such as officer testimony or less scientific field sobriety tests. <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2003 MT 118, 315 Mont. 480, 68 P.3d 848; <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 334, \u00b6 43, 324 Mont. 173, \u00b6 43, 103 P.3d 503, \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u00b641  Having determined that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the HGN evidence and that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that this admission was harmless, we reverse the jury verdict in favor of the State and remand this matter to the District Court for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b642 <em>Does the inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, whereby a jury may infer that a defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol from his refusal to take a sobriety test, violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b643 Although we are reversing Michaud\u2019s conviction, we deem it appropriate to address, the remaining issues Michaud raises, as they are bound to be presented again upon retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b644 Michaud challenges the constitutionality of the inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(1) the inference denies a defendant due process because it shifts the burden of proof from the State to the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">(2) the inference denies a defendant due process because it is not rationally related to a defendant\u2019s refusal to take a breath test;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">(3) the inference denies the accused the right to counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">(4) the inference compels a defendant to give evidence against himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Based on these claims of perceived unconstitutionality, Michaud argues that the District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury as to this inference constitutes an error warranting reversal of his conviction. Michaud\u2019s constitutional arguments appear to be based upon a belief that a defendant could be convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol based solely upon evidence of the defendant\u2019s refusal to take a breath test. We address this misconception in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">\u00b645 The statute Michaud is challenging, \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-13\">61-8-404. Evidence admissible - conditions of admissibility. (1) Upon the trial of a criminal action or other proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by a person in violation of 61-8-401, 61-8-406, 61-8-410, or 61-8-805:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-14\">(a) evidence of any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol and drugs in the person at the time of a test, as shown by an analysis of the person\u2019s blood or breath, is admissible. A positive test result does not, in itself, prove that the person was under the influence of a drug or drugs at the time the person was in control of a motor vehicle. A person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>may not be convicted of a violation of 61-8-401 based upon the presence of a drug or drugs in the person unless some other competent evidence exists that tends to establish that the person was under the influence of a drug or drugs while driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">(2) If the person under arrest refused to submit to one or more tests as provided in this section, proof of refusal is admissible in any criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public, while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol and drugs. <em>The trier of fact may infer from the refusal that the person was under the influence. The inference is rebuttable. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b646 The jury instruction to which Michaud objected provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">If the person under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol refused to submit to one or more tests for alcohol concentration, proof of refusal is admissible in any criminal action or proceedings arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\"><em>The trier of fact may infer from the refusal that the person was under the influence. The inference is rebuttable. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atk\">\u00b647 Michaud contends that the inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, deprives a defendant of his due process rights because (1) it relieves the State of its burden to prove a critical element of the offense, i.e., that a person was actually driving under the influence, and shifts the burden to a defendant to prove that he was not driving \u25a0under the influence, and (2) the inferred conclusion that a defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol does not rationally follow from the fact that he refused to take a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b648 The State counters that this issue was resolved in <em>Morris, </em>wherein we held that \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof and did not violate Morris\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u00b649  In <em>Morris, </em>we explained that when construing a challenged statute, we \u201cwill read and interpret the statute as a whole, without isolating specific terms from the context in which they are used by the Legislature.\u201d We also noted that \u201call statutes carry with them a presumption of constitutionality, and we construe statutes narrowly to avoid an unconstitutional interpretation if feasible.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 19 (citation omitted). We explained that when interpreting statutes, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u201cgive effect to the legislative will, while avoiding an absurd result.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 19. Analyzing \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, as a whole, \u201cwe conclude[d] that subsection (2) must be read as requiring the production of other competent corroborating evidence of a DUI,\u201d given that subsection (l)(a) requires corroborating evidence when a person actually takes a drug test. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 21. We observed that an officer must have \u201cprobable cause\u201d to arrest a driver suspected of driving while under the influence of alcohol and the evidence to support this probable cause, such as erratic driving, slurred speech, or an odor of alcohol. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b621. Such evidence safeguards against the possibility that a defendant could be convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol based solely upon the defendant\u2019s refusal to take the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b650 As did Michaud, Morris also objected to the district court\u2019s jury instruction on the statutory inference. Reviewing the jury instructions, we concluded that based on \u201cthe instructions as a whole\u201d the burden of proof did not unconstitutionally shift to Morris. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 18. We noted that the court directed the jurors to view the instructions as a whole and instructed jurors that Morris was \u201cnot required to prove his innocence or present any evidence.\u201d Moreover, the instructions charged the jury as to the elements of the offense, the State\u2019s burden of proof, and the presumption of innocence, among other things. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 18. As in the case before us, the <em>Morris </em>district court also told the jury that the trier of fact <em>may </em>infer from the refusal that the person was under the influence but that this inference is rebuttable. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 15. Under this analysis, we concluded that the district court in <em>Morris </em>did not err in instructing the jury on the provisions of \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b651  Michaud presents the same argument, under the same basic facts, asserting that <em>Morris </em>was wrongly decided. We decline to revisit <em>Morris. </em>The analysis in <em>Morris </em>is wholly applicable to the case at bar. The District Court issued the same instructions to Michaud\u2019s jury as the court issued in <em>Morris. </em>Therefore, based on <em>Morris, </em>Michaud\u2019s claims that the statute unconstitutionally shifts the burden to the defendant and the court\u2019s jury instruction was erroneous, fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b652 Michaud also argues that the statute is unconstitutional because the inferred conclusion that a defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol does not rationally follow from the fact that he refused to take a breath test. Again, Michaud asserts that the jury instruction on the inference requires reversing his conviction. Michaud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>notes that only \u201cpermissive presumptions\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are allowed in criminal cases, and opines that under various federal cases, the inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, is not an inference allowed in criminal trials. He maintains that \u201cthere is nothing within the fact of the refusal of a breath test which leads to a rational connection to actually being under the influence of alcohol,\u201d and that a person may refuse to take a breath test for several reasons, not merely out of fear of failing. Relying on <em>Leary v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 6, 89 S. Ct. 1532 (1969), Michaud argues that the \u201ctest\u201d for rationality of an inference is whether \u201cit can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u201d <em>Leary, </em>395 U.S. at 36, 89 S. Ct. at 1548. \u00b653 While we have not been asked previously to determine whether the inference in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, is a permissive inference or whether it satisfies the \u201crational connection\u201d test stated in <em>Leary, </em>we have nonetheless applied the <em>Leary </em>test in <em>State, etc. v. District Court, etc., </em>180 Mont. 548, 558-59, 591 P.2d 656, 662 (1979) and <em>State v. Leverett, </em>245 Mont. 124, 129, 799 P.2d 119, 122 (1990), in our consideration of other statutory inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b654 We conclude the statutory inference before us is a permissive inference. In <em>Leverett, </em>we noted that the inferences presented to the jury in the jury instructions were mandatory inferences in that they required that \u201cit <em>shall he </em>presumed,\u201d and \u201cthe trier of fact <em>must </em>find.\u201d It is apparent that the inference language in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, allows the trier of fact-whether a judge or a jury-to accept or reject the inference. Additionally, it expressly allows the defendant to rebut the inference. Moreover, as discussed above in \u00b6 44, the trier of fact must be is presented with \u201cother competent evidence\u201d that a defendant is driving while under the influence of alcohol. Section 61-8-404, MCA; <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b655  Applying the <em>Leary </em>test to this inference, we conclude that as a permissive inference, it does not violate due process in that there is a rational connection between driving while intoxicated and refusing to take a sobriety test. Michaud had the opportunity to present evidence or argument to rebut the presumption but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b656 <em>Does the inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, deny a defendant his right to counsel at a critical stage of the prosecution or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>violate a defendant\u2019s right not to he compelled to give testimony against himself?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b657 Building upon the above-noted arguments, Michaud insists that a defendant can be convicted of driving under the influence based solely upon his refusal to take the sobriety test and as such, is deprived of the right to counsel at the critical time he must make this decision. He also posits that this \u201cinference of guilt\u201d constitutes testimony against oneself in violation of federal and state constitutional protections. Michaud\u2019s arguments fail for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b658 First, driving in Montana is a privilege, not a right. Throughout our statutes and relevant cases, we regularly encounter the phrase \u201cdriving privileges\u201d or \u201cdriving while the privilege to do so was suspended.\u201d E.g., <em>State v. Turbiville, </em>2003 MT 340, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 451, \u00b6 21, 81 P.3d 475, \u00b6 21; \u00a7 61-2-302(9)(b)(ii), MCA; \u00a7 61-5-105(2), MCA. Additionally, \u00a7 61-8-402(1), MCA, expressly states that a person who operates a vehicle on Montana\u2019s public roadways is \u201cconsidered to have given consent to a test or tests of the person\u2019s blood or breath for the purpose of determining any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol....\u201d If a person wishes to enjoy the benefits of this privilege, he must accept the concomitant responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b659  Second, as indicated above, competent and credible evidence was presented upon which the jury could find that Michaud was intoxicated; thus, the inference was not the sole issue before the jury. \u00b660 Moreover, it is established in Montana that prior to taking a breath test, a defendant has no right to counsel. <em>State v. Armfield, </em>214 Mont. 229, 234, 693 P.2d 1226, 1229 (1984), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, 318 Mont. 150, 79 P.3d 270. A breath test does not constitute a \u201ccritical stage event\u201d; therefore, no right to counsel exists. <em>Armfield, </em>214 Mont. at 234, 693 P.2d at 1230, citing <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 87 S. Ct. 1926 (1967); <em>Meyer v. State, </em>229 Mont. 199, 202, 745 P.2d 694, 696 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b661 Finally, we have previously addressed the constitutional concern of self-incrimination based upon admission of a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to testing in <em>City of Missoula v. Forest, </em>236 Mont. 129, 769 P.2d 699 (1989), wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">This Court has long adhered to the rule that neither the results of the breathalizer test nor a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to the breathalizer test are communications protected by the Fifth Amendment. <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 338, 672 P.2d 255, <em>citing South Dakota v. Neville </em>(1983), 459 U.S. 553, 103 S.Ct. 916, 74 L.Ed.2d 748; <em>State v. Armfield </em>(1984), 214 Mont. 229, 693 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>P.2d 1226. Therefore, our discussion of the principle will remain brief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">As a part of the program to deter drinkers from driving, Montana has enacted an Implied Consent Law. The statute declares that any person who operates a motor vehicle within the State shall be deemed to have given his consent to a chemical test to determine the alcohol content of his blood if arrested by a police officer for driving under the influence of alcohol. Section 61-8-402(1), MCA. The test is not compelled, yet refusal results in attendant penalties, including an immediate seizure of one\u2019s driver\u2019s license, \u00a7 61-8-402(3), MCA, and the admissibility of the refusal upon trial for DUI. Section 61-8-404(2), MCA....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">... The Fifth Amendment affords no protection against the prosecutor\u2019s use of fingerprints, measurements, handwriting, voice identification or blood tests; all constitute \u201cphysical or real\u201d evidence. <em>Schmerber v. California </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908. Similarly, appellant\u2019s claim of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination by the admission of his refusal to submit to the blood-alcohol test is foreclosed by the <em>Neville </em>decision, which defined the refusal as non-testimonial conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\"><em>Missoula, </em>236 Mont. at 133-34, 769 P.2d at 701-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b662 While the cases discussed above pre-date the 2003 version of the statute in which the Legislature added the challenged inference, because evidence of the inference alone is insufficient to result in a conviction these cases remain relevant and applicable to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u00b663  We conclude the inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, did not violate Michaud\u2019s constitutional rights to due process, right to counsel or protection from self-incrimination. Furthermore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury regarding this statute and its inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">\u00b664 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand this matter to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-12\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> In <em>Nichols, </em>we stated, \u201cThe voir dire process, especially in cases given a great amount of publicity, is essential to ensure that defendant is adjudged by fair and impartial jurors.

Section 1-2-101, MCA. Here, the plain language of the statute provides that the court may limit the examination of prospective jurors \u201cif the examination is improper.\u201d There is nothing in the statute that allows the court to set arbitrary time limits on counsel\u2019s voir dire examination-at least absent counsel asking improper questions. This right of voir dire belongs to the defendant and may not be arbitrarily fettered by the trial judge. More to the point, there is no evidence in this case that defendant\u2019s counsel asked any \u201cimproper\u201d questions of the prospective jurors. If, because of intolerably crowded court dockets, the time has come in Montana to require that the trial judge conduct the voir dire (as in the federal courts) or to allow the court to arbitrarily impose time limits on counsel\u2019s voir dire, then the Legislature should enact that change, not the judiciary. I would apply \u00a7 46-16-114(2), MCA, as it is written and hold that the trial court erred in imposing arbitrary time limits on counsel\u2019s voir dire. I would reverse and remand for a new trial on that issue also.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b668 I concur with Issue 2; I dissent from Issues 1, 3 and 4.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b285-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AYA\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u00b669 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on the second issue, which reverses the District Court\u2019s admission of the officer\u2019s HGN testimony. I join Justice Nelson\u2019s dissent on the first issue and would reverse the District Court\u2019s limitation of time for voir dire as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u00b670 I also respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion on the issues of whether the rebuttable inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, violates Michaud\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and to not incriminate himself. I would reverse and remand on those issues and overrule the Court\u2019s contrary holding on the identical due process issue in Morris-a case in which I did not participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">\u00b671 Driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) is-as it should be-a strict liability offense in Montana. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-401(7), MCA. Here, however, it is my view that the Legislature has gone too far in its zeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>to convict persons suspected of DUI. Agreeing wholeheartedly with the Court that statutes are presumed constitutional and a challenger bears a heavy burden, I would hold that the rebuttable statutory inference a jury may draw-that a person who refused a blood or breath test for alcohol concentration was in fact under the influence of alcohol-together with the language that the inference is rebuttable, cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b672 The elements of the strict liability DUI offense are straightforward. It is unlawful for a person under the influence of alcohol to drive or be in physical control of a vehicle on the ways of this state open to the public. Section 61-8-401(1)(a), MCA. \u201cUnder the influence\u201d means that, as a result of taking alcohol into the body, a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a vehicle has been diminished. Section 61-8-401(3)(a), MCA. It cannot be disputed that the State carries the burden of proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"AgWp\">\u00b673 Frequent readers of this Court\u2019s opinions-whether trial judges, legal practitioners or lay Montanans-know that questions about whether the accused was driving or in physical control of a vehicle, or whether the vehicle was traveling on the ways of this state open to the public, generally are not the focal point of DUI cases. The element of the offense most often at issue is whether the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was \u201cunder the influence\u201d of alcohol. It is my opinion that the statutory inference and the statutory \u201crebuttable\u201d language shift the burden away from the prosecution, thereby violating Michaud\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b674 This Court first addressed the statutory inference at issue here in <em>Morris. </em>It properly relied on <em>State v. Leverett, </em>245 Mont. 124, 127, 799 P.2d 119, 120-21 (1990), for the proposition that-in construing evidentiary presumptions (and implicitly, inferences) in a criminal case-the reviewing court must focus on the particular language used to charge the jury and determine how a reasonable juror would understand it. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 17. Having done so, the Court noted the usual \u201cpresumption of innocence,\u201d \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and defendant \u201cnot required to ... present evidence\u201d instructions were given, and concluded the instruction containing the \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, rebuttable inference did not impermissibly shift the burden. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 18. It is my view that the Court erred there and repeats the same error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b675 Neither in <em>Morris </em>nor the present case was the jury-a group of lay people-instructed as to the meaning of an inference or how it could possibly harmonize the various instructions. Of course, it is easy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>simply assume that jurors hear and understand every word in instructions, thus leaving them consciously aware that they may-but need not-use Michaud\u2019s refusal to take the breath test to establish that he was \u201cunder the influence\u201d absent rebuttal evidence from Michaud. Even if one were willing to make such an assumption, however, it is my view that no \u201cpresumption of innocence,\u201d \u201cState\u2019s burden\u201d and \u201cdefendant need not produce evidence\u201d instructions could ever remove the taint of the instructional and statutory language \u201c[t]he inference is rebuttable.\u201d At the very least, the latter language creates a stark and clear inconsistency between and among the instructions. I would hold that the statutory rebuttable inference impermissibly shifts the burden to the defendant and, therefore, violated Michaud\u2019s constitutional right to due process. Instead, the Court simply relies on <em>Morris, </em>mentioning several times that the \u201cinference is rebuttable\u201d but without ever explaining why it is permissible to require a defendant in a criminal case to produce evidence. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b676 The Court then moves on to the portion of <em>Morris </em>discussing our obligation to interpret \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, to avoid unconstitutionality if feasible. The <em>Morris </em>Court listed a handful of different rules of statutory construction, including \u201cconstrue statutes narrowly,\u201d \u201cgive effect to the legislative will\u201d and others. <em>See Morris, </em>\u00b6 19. One of the most basic rules of statutory construction is missing from the list, however, and it is the rule that it is our job \u201cnot to insert\u201d language not contained in a statute. The <em>Morris </em>Court simply imported into subsection (2) of \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, the language the Legislature included in subsection (l)(a)-requiring corroborating evidence of \u201cunder the influence\u201d-when a person takes, rather than refuses, the test. Since it is clear that the Legislature knew how to include such language when it intended to do so, I cannot see how rewriting the statute in that manner ascertains the Legislature\u2019s will or does anything other than insert language the enacting branch of government did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b677 Moreover, it is one thing to say that this Court has imported the \u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d portion of \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(a), MCA, into \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA. It is quite another thing for the jury to know of that critical requirement. Here, the jury, having not been instructed as to what an inference is, also was not instructed of the critical requirement that corroborating evidence was required before the State could meet its burden of proving the elements of the DUI offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00b678 In the present case, the evidence of \u201cunder the influence\u201d is sketchy at best and may not have been accepted by the jury as sufficient to corroborate anything more than that Michaud\u2019s vehicle was missing a mirror, its license plate was obstructed from some perspectives, and Michaud admitted he had consumed a few drinks earlier in the day and, in the officer\u2019s view, had \u201cdifficulty\u201d with his balance. The question is not whether there was corroborating evidence that Michaud had a drink. The question is whether there was corroborating evidence that he was driving a vehicle \u201cunder the Influence\u201d of alcohol; that is, whether Michaud\u2019s ability to safely drive a vehicle had been diminished by taking alcohol into his body. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-401(3)(a), MCA. Finally, even if the Court\u2019s statutory construction in <em>Morris </em>and here were correct, the taint of instructing the jury that Michaud could rebut the refusal, and thereby try to keep it from inferring from the refusal itself that he was under the influence, remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b679 I also must note that in both <em>Morris </em>and here, the Court follows the State\u2019s lead in falling back on the \u201cred herring\u201d of the absence of a challenge to the probable cause needed for an arrest. I daresay that most television viewers in this country understand that probable cause to arrest is a much lesser standard than proving each element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. That proposition needs no citation to authority. I am concerned and mystified about the Court\u2019s insertion of that concept here-when, indeed, it is not raised. Stating, as the Court does in \u00b6 44, that evidence sufficient to support probable cause \u201csafeguards against the possibility that a defendant could be convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol based solely upon the defendant\u2019s refusal to take the test\u201d turns the administration of criminal justice on its head. It also is contrary to other fundamental constitutional principles such as the presumption of innocence and the State\u2019s burden to prove every element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b680 I observe, in relation to this issue, that the Court does not address at all Michaud\u2019s argument that the inference the jury can draw from a refusal to take the test does not meet statutory requirements for an inference. Section 26-1-502, MCA, requires that an inference be founded on a fact legally proved and \u201con such a deduction from that fact as is warranted by a consideration of the usual propensities or passions of men <em>...\u201d </em>In this case, the predicate fact legally proved is that Michaud refused to take the test. Clearly, that refusal could have been based on a concern that results of the test would show an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>elevated blood alcohol concentration. In my view, however, the refusal could have been based on a simple lack of willingness to cooperate with law enforcement, a belief that such a test would be an invasion of privacy or other reasons. Thus, in my view, the deduction of \u201cunder the influence\u201d from a refusal to take the test is not-under \u00a7 26-1-502, MCA-warr anted.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b681 On the second issue, I would hold that the inference does not meet the statutory requirements for an inference and, much more importantly, that the rebuttable inference contained in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, and included in the jury instructions, violated Michaud\u2019s due process rights by shifting the burden to him to come forward and rebut evidence regarding an essential element of the DUI offense the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b682 I also dissent from the Court\u2019s analysis and holding that the statutory inference does not violate Michaud\u2019s right not to be compelled to give testimony against himself. The Court begins its analysis, at \u00b6 53, with the long-established and undisputed principles that driving in Montana is a privilege and not a right and that, pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(1), MCA, each person who drives a vehicle in Montana has impliedly consented to a blood or breath test for determining the presence of alcohol in the person\u2019s body. It is critical to note, however, that \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, is the statute providing for the seizure and suspension of a driver\u2019s license. Thus, because driving is a privilege, and implied consent to the test has been given in exchange for the exercise of that privilege, a refusal of the test logically and constitutionally results in the loss of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b683 That logic and rationale, however, is a far different matter from the statute defining the criminal offense of DUI, the constitutional requirement that the State prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt, and the constitutional right not to be compelled to testify against oneself. If Michaud is presumed innocent, need not put on a defense and can hold the State to its proof without being required to incriminate himself, how can a simple \u201cNo\u201d in response to a request for the test-or mere silence, taken as a refusal-be substantively different from refusing to talk to law enforcement in other criminal case contexts? Stated differently, if the State cannot comment on a defendant\u2019s silence-and our cases on that point are legion-how can the State be allowed to use a defendant\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d or silence, to prove an essential element of the case, especially when a jury is simultaneously told that the defendant can undo or at least try to undo such use merely by putting on evidence, something he cannot constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>be required to do? I submit that, constitutionally, this cannot be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b684 In this regard, the Court relies on <em>Forest </em>and <em>Armfield </em>as holding that the right against self-incrimination is not violated when a DUI defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to testing is admitted as evidence. I question whether these somewhat dated cases were correctly decided. Leaving those questions aside, however, it is my view that admitting evidence that a defendant refused the test does not begin to rise to the constitutional magnitude of admitting the evidence as an inference of the essential \u201cunder the influence\u201d element and telling the jury the defendant can rebut the inference. While the bare introduction of the refusal may not be testimonial, pursuant to <em>Forest </em>and <em>Armfield, </em>I believe use of the denial as substantive evidence that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol changes the nature of the evidence entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b685 For all the stated reasons, I would reverse the District Court and remand for further proceedings. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b290-6\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing concurring and dissenting opinion of CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
