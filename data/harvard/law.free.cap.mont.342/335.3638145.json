Swift cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s partial denial of its summary judgment motion. We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">\u00b63 I. Did the District Court err by partially denying Swift\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and concluding that Swift owed Fisher a duty of care as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">\u00b64 II. Did the District Court err in partially granting summary judgment to Swift on the issue of causation, and concluding that Fisher\u2019s injury was unforeseeable as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">\u00b65 An unseasonably severe storm hit the Sieben Flats area on April 28, 2004. Wade Fisher, an officer with the Montana State Highway Patrol, was called to respond to an accident on Interstate 15. The storm had created white-out conditions on the highway. Many motorists were forced to stop their vehicles in the middle of the highway, due to the slick, snow-packed roads, high winds, and extremely poor visibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">\u00b66 Fisher approached the accident scene near mile marker 213 in the southbound lane. Michael Mlekush, a deputy from the Lewis and Clark County Sheriffs office, was already on the scene. Fisher parked his car diagonally across the highway lanes, parallel to Mlekush\u2019s car, but staggered a fair distance behind it to increase visibility of the accident scene. Both cars had their emergency lights flashing to warn oncoming traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">\u00b67 Fisher proceeded to investigate the crash, which was caused by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Pepsi semi-truck that had side-swiped two passenger vehicles parked on the side of the highway. About twenty minutes later, another semi-truck (owned and operated by Swift) approached the accident scene. Mlekush watched as the trailer slowly slid into Fisher\u2019s car. The semi\u2019s trailer struck Fisher\u2019s vehicle, as well as a passenger car parked behind it. Fisher could not investigate this second accident, since it involved his own patrol car. He called in Sergeant Larry Irwin to respond to the Swift accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b68 J &amp; D Truck Repair Inc. (\u201cJ &amp; D\u201d) was called to the scene to remove the wreckage from the second accident. Irwin directed the J &amp; D employees to get the Swift trailer away from the two cars it had impacted. The J &amp; D employees positioned the wrecker in the passing southbound lane next to the Swift truck. They rigged the winch line from the wrecker to the Swift trailer, and winched the line. Then they lifted the Swift trailer away from the two cars, and set it about four or five feet away from Fisher\u2019s patrol car. Without alerting anyone else, the J &amp; D employees unhooked the winch line from the Swift truck. \u00b69 During the winch operation, Fisher was seated in the passenger side of his car, completing his paperwork for the first accident involving the Pepsi truck. Once the trailer was lifted and after the winch was unhooked, one of the J &amp; D employees directed Fisher to back his car out and away from the accident scene. Fisher got out of his vehicle, and walked around to the driver\u2019s side to inspect the damage. At that moment, the Swift trailer slid back across the ice towards Fisher\u2019s car, and pinned him between the trailer and the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><em>\u00b610 </em>The J &amp; D wrecker team quickly re-attached the winch, and managed to pull the trailer away from the car within several minutes. Fisher was freed and carried to the side of the road, where he waited for an ambulance. He was treated at a nearby hospital for crush-type injuries and released later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b611 Fisher brought suit against Swift and J &amp; D to recover for damages he sustained as a result of their alleged negligence. Swift moved for summary judgment, arguing that it owed no duty to Fisher, and that its driver\u2019s conduct was not the cause of Fisher\u2019s injuries. The District Corut partially granted and partially denied Swift\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court rejected Swift\u2019s argument that it owed no duty to Fisher and found that Fisher was a foreseeable plaintiff as a matter of law. However, the court found in favor of Swift on the issue of causation, and held that the injuries that Fisher sustained were unforeseeable as a matter of law. Pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b), the District Court certified this issue for appellate review. Fisher\u2019s claims against J &amp; D remain in the District Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>awaiting trial. Fisher appeals the District Court\u2019s partial grant of summary judgment in favor of Swift. Swift cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s partial denial of its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Eklund v. Trost, </em>2006 MT 333, \u00b6 20,335 Mont. 112, \u00b6 20,151 P.3d 870, \u00b6 20. Summary judgment is only appropriate when no genuine issues of material fact exist, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party bears the burden of establishing that no genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 21. Once the moving party meets that burden, then the non-moving party must provide substantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact in order to avoid a grant of summary judgment in favor of the movant. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 21. All reasonable inferences will be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 21. Since negligence actions ordinarily involve questions of fact, they are generally not susceptible to summary judgment. <em>Hinkle v. Shepherd School Dist. </em># <em>37, </em>2004 MT 175, \u00b6 23, 322 Mont. 80, \u00b6 23, 93 P.3d 1239, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b613 Fisher appeals the District Court\u2019s partial grant of summary judgment in favor of Swift, and argues that the District Comb erred in concluding that the Swift driver\u2019s negligence was not a proximate cause of Fisher\u2019s injury, since the injury was unforeseeable as a matter of law. Swift cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s partial denial of its summary judgment motion and the District Court\u2019s finding that Fisher was a foreseeable plaintiff as a matter of law. To maintain an action in negligence, the plaintiff must prove four essential elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 32. Without duty, and a breach of that duty, no negligence can exist. <em>See e.g. Jacobs v. Laurel Volunteer Fire Dept., </em>2001 MT 98, \u00b6 13, 305 Mont. 225, \u00b6 13, 26 P.3d 730, \u00b6 13. Thus, we will consider Swift\u2019s cross-appeal first.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b614 I. Did the District Court err by partially denying Swift\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and concluding that Swift owed Fisher a duty of care as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b615 A. Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\u00b616  At the most basic level, we all share the common law duty to exercise the level of care that a reasonable and prudent person would under the same circumstances. <em>See e.g. Runkle v. Burlington Northern, </em>188 Mont. 286, 299, 613 P.2d 982, 990 (1980) (holding that a railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>had a duty to exercise this level of care, even in the absence of statutorily imposed duties). We have long recognized that the common law may impose additional, special duties based upon relationship. For example, a county assumes heightened duties of care with respect to persons in its custody. <em>Prindel v. Ravalli County, </em>2006 MT 62, \u00b6 36, 331 Mont. 338, \u00b6 36, 133 P.3d 165, \u00b6 36. Duty may also arise by statute; dram shop acts impose heightened duties of care upon tavern owners. <em>Cusenbary v. Mortensen, </em>1999 MT 221, \u00b6 38, 296 Mont. 25, \u00b6 38, 987 P.2d 351, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b617 The existence of a legal duty is a question of law to be determined by the court. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>Henrickson v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 21, 319 Mont. 307, \u00b6 21, 84 P.3d 38, \u00b6 21. In analyzing whether a duty exists, we consider whether the imposition of that duty comports with public policy, and whether the defendant could have foreseen that his conduct could have resulted in an injury to the plaintiff. <em>Henrickson, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b618 Here, Fisher argues that multiple sections of the Montana Code impose a duty on the Swift truck driver. First, Fisher states, \u00a7 61-8-302, MCA, imposes on all drivers the duty to drive \u201cin a careful and prudent manner that does not unduly or unreasonably endanger the life, limb, property, or other rights of a person entitled to the use of the highway.\u201d Second, Fisher maintains that \u00a7 61-8-303(4), MCA, imposes a duty of care upon all drivers by providing that they \u201cshall operate a vehicle in a careful and prudent manner and at a reduced rate of speed no greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions existing at the point of operation, taking into account the amount and character of traffic, visibility, weather, and roadway conditions.\u201d Finally, Fisher points to a third statute, \u00a7 61-8-346(3), MCA, which he claims imposes a special duty of care upon drivers approaching a \u201cstationary authorized emergency vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b619 We agree that the above-cited sections of the MCA establish that the Swift driver owed Fisher a duty of care. In <em>Craig v. Schell, </em>we recognized that certain sections of the MCA may give rise to specific duties of care for motor vehicle operators. <em>Craig v. Schell, </em>1999 MT 40, \u00b6 15, 293 Mont. 323, \u00b6 15, 975 P.2d 820, \u00b6 15. Here, each of these three statutes imposed duties of care upon the Swift driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b620 <em>1. Foreseeability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b621 Swift does not dispute that these statutes imposed duties of care upon its driver, but argues that the injury to Fisher was unforeseeable, so no duty exists. We have held that \u201cthe existence of a duty \u2018turns primarily on foreseeability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 40 (citation omitted). In <em>Mang v. Eliasson, </em>we relied on Justice Cardozo\u2019s opinion in the <em>Palsgraf </em>case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>to explain the concept of foreseeability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-3\">\u201cThe risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed.\u201d <em>Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co. </em>[citation omitted]. That is to say, a defendant owes a duty with respect to those risks or hazards whose likelihood made the conduct unreasonably dangerous, and hence negligent in the first instance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><em>Mang v. Eliasson, </em>153 Mont. 431, 437, 458 P.2d 777, 781 (1969). We ask \u201cwhether the defendant could have reasonably foreseen that his or her conduct could have resulted in an injury to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 30. A plaintiff is a foreseeable plaintiff if she or he is within the \u201cforeseeable zone of risk\u201d created by the defendant\u2019s negligent act. <em>See e.g. Prindel, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b622 The District Court reasoned that \u201cthere is no question that when a person drives in a negligent manner, a reasonably prudent person could foresee that a law enforcement officer attending a resulting accident could be injured by oncoming traffic.\u201d We agree. Where a duty is established by statute, we look to the class of people the statute intended to protect to determine whether the plaintiff is a member of that class. <em>See e.g. Eklund, </em>\u00b6 42. If so, he is a foreseeable plaintiff. <em>See e.g. Eklund, </em>\u00b6 42. The statutes at issue in the instant case were enacted to protect \u201cperson[s] entitled to use the highway.\u201d Section 61-8-302(1), MCA. Fisher, as a licensed Montana driver and as a highway patrolman, was a member of the protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b623  Even if the only duty that the Swift driver owed to Fisher was the common law duty to exercise reasonable care, Fisher would still be a foreseeable plaintiff because he was within the zone of risk created by the driver\u2019s alleged negligence. <em>See e.g. Prindel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39 (discussing \u201cforeseeable zone of risk\u201d). A driver who fails to exercise the level of care that an ordinary reasonable driver would use could easily foresee that other people on the highway might be hurt as a result of his negligence. The zone of risk created by a negligent driver necessarily includes other drivers and passengers in his immediate vicinity. When that driver\u2019s negligence results in an accident, then that zone of risk also encompasses the resulting accident scene, including the emergency responders like police officers and paramedics. As a highway patrol officer who was struck by the Swift driver in a traffic accident, Fisher was clearly within the zone of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b624 The dissent argues that our opinion today unjustifiably expands the law of foreseeability, and likens our analysis to the \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d: \u201cHad the butterfly not flapped its wings, the storm may not have occurred; the first accident may not have happened; Fisher may not have come to investigate it; Swift\u2019s driver might not have hit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Fisher\u2019s patrol car; J &amp; D might not have had to move Swift\u2019s truck; J &amp; D\u2019s workman might not have carelessly unhooked the trailer; and Fisher would not have been injured[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b625 Fisher was struck not by an errant butterfly, but by Swift\u2019s semi tractor-trailer unit. The significance of this is illustrated, once again, by <em>Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., </em>162 N.E. 99(N.Y. 1928). <em>In Palsgraf, </em>a guard on the railroad platform helped a tardy passenger jump from the platform on to the already-departing train. In the process of boarding the moving train, the passenger dropped a newspaper-wrapped package which contained explosives. The package exploded, sending a blast through the station, and knocking over a set of scales at the opposite end of the platform. The scales struck Mrs. Palsgraf, a passenger waiting next to the scales on the platform. Justice Cardozo concluded that Mrs. Palsgraf could not recover from the railroad for her injuries, and emphasizes her distance from the guard: \u201cThe conduct of the defendant\u2019s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away.\u201d 162 N.E. at 99. Mrs. Palsgraf was struck by the scales, not by the bomb itself. By contrast, Fisher <em>was </em>struck by the Swift truck itself-not by an aimless butterfly, a set of scales, or any other intervening object.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b626 Furthermore, it is well-settled that neither the specific plaintiff nor the specific injury need be foreseen. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 41. In other words, it is not necessary to foresee that Fisher would be injured by the Swift truck sliding across the icy highway as it was being removed from the accident scene, as opposed to, for example, being struck by oncoming traffic. The manner of the accident and the nature of Fisher\u2019s injuries do not change the fact that Fisher was a foreseeable plaintiff within the zone of risk at the accident scene created by the Swift driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u00b627 <em>2. Policy Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b628 Finally, we note that no policy considerations bar the imposition of these statutory duties upon the Swift driver. In evaluating whether a defendant owes a duty of care to a plaintiff, \u201cwe also weigh the \u2018policy considerations for and against the imposition of liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 37 (citation omitted). Specifically, we consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">(1) [T]he moral blame attached to a defendant\u2019s conduct; (2) the prevention of future harm; (3) the extent of the burden placed on the defendant; (4) the consequences to the public of imposing such a duty; and (5) the availability and cost of insurance for the risk involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-9\"><em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 37. In the instant case, the duties are statutorily imposed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>By establishing these duties of care as the law of this State, the Legislature has already given ample consideration to the above-mentioned public policy implications. Thus, we need not discuss them further here.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">\u00b629  The District Court did not err in denying Swift\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of duty. We hold that as a matter of law, the Swift driver owed both common law and statutory duties of care to Fisher. The Swift driver owed Fisher the common law duty to use the level of care exercised by an ordinary, prudent person in the same position. Additionally, \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-302,61-8-303(4), and 61-8-346(3), MCA, imposed specific, heightened duties of care upon the Swift driver. As a licensed driver and highway patrol officer, Fisher was a foreseeable plaintiff within the zone of risk at the scene of the accident. Thus, we agree with the District Court that the Swift driver owed Fisher a duty of care as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b630 B. Breach</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b631 Though the District Court concluded that the Swift driver owed a duty of care to Fisher, it did not reach the question of whether the driver breached that duty, because it held that Fisher failed to adequately prove the causation element of his claim. As discussed further below, we are reversing the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to the issue of causation. Thus, on remand, it will be necessary for the fact-finder to consider whether the Swift driver breached the duties of care he owed to Fisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b632 Specifically, the fact-finder should address whether the Swift driver violated \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-302, 61-8-303(4), and 61-8-346(3), MCA. The violation of a statute is prima facie evidence of a breach of that statutory duty under Montana law. <em>See e.g. Prindel, </em>\u00b6 28. This is a distinct analysis from negligence per se, which is addressed below. The fact-finder should also consider whether the Swift driver breached his common law duty of care to Fisher; that is, whether he acted as a reasonable and prudent person would have under the same circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u00b633 C. Negligence Per Se</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b634 Fisher also argues that Swift was negligent per se. Since the District Court did not address this argument in its summary judgment order, we decline to address it for the first time now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">\u00b635 II. Did the District Court err in partially granting summary judgment to Swift on the issue of causation, and concluding that Fisher\u2019s injury was unforeseeable as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">\u00b636  A defendant\u2019s negligence is the direct cause of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>injury if there is an uninterrupted chain of events from the negligent act to the plaintiffs injury. <em>Cusenbary, </em>\u00b6 26. In such cases, \u201cproof of causation is satisfied by proof that a party\u2019s conduct was a cause-in-fact of the damage alleged.\u201d <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 371, 916 P.2d 122, 139 (1996). A party\u2019s act is the cause-in-fact of an event if \u201cthe event would not have occurred but for that conduct.\u201d <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 371, 916 P.2d at 139 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b637 A. The Causation Analysis in Intervening Cause Cases</p>\n<p id=\"AZj\">\u00b638 However, when the case involves an intervening cause, the analysis becomes more complicated. An intervening cause is a force that comes into motion after the defendant\u2019s negligent act, and combines with the negligent act to cause injury to the plaintiff. <em>Cusenbary, </em>\u00b6 26. This is the crux of the issue in the instant case: was the Swift driver\u2019s alleged negligence the proximate cause of Fisher\u2019s injuries? Or, did the alleged negligence of the towing company constitute an independent, intervening cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b639 When the defendant alleges that the chain of causation has been severed by an independent, intervening cause, as Swift does here, we must undertake a two-tiered analysis. First, as discussed above, we consider whether the defendant\u2019s negligent act was a cause-in-fact of the plaintiffs injury. <em>Cusenbary, </em>\u00b6 28. Second, we consider whether the defendant\u2019s act was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury. <em>Cusenbary, </em>\u00b6 28. To establish proximate cause, the plaintiff must show that it was the \u201cdefendant\u2019s breach which \u2018foreseeably and substantially\u2019 caused his injury.\u201d <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 45 (citation omitted). Though foreseeability \u201cis generally properly confined to the duty element of negligence under Montana law, where a dispute presents the issue of an intervening act of a third party ... we address foreseeability in the proximate cause context as well.\u201d <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 44 (citation omitted). <em>See also Estate of Strever v. Cline, </em>278 Mont. 165, 175, 924 P.2d 666, 672 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b640 We have recognized that \u201cnot all intervening acts are independent. Those that are foreseeable do not break the chain of causation.\u201d <em>Cusenbary, </em>\u00b6 25. The foreseeability inquiry is the same one employed in the duty context: we ask \u201cwhether the defendant could have reasonably foreseen that his or her conduct could have resulted in an injury to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 30. The specific injury to the plaintiff need not be foreseen. <em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b641  We have instructed that \u201cif one of the reasons that makes a defendant\u2019s act negligent is a greater risk of a particular harmful result occurring, and that harmful result does occur, the defendant is generally liable.\u201d <em>Cusenbary, </em>\u00b6 25. Specifically, we consider \u201cwhether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the intervention of the later cause is a significant part of the risk involved in the defendant\u2019s conduct, or is so reasonably connected with it that the responsibility should not be terminated.\u201d <em>Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 176, 924 P.2d at 672 (quoting W.

In sum, \u201ca defendant\u2019s liability for his wrongful act will not be severed by the intervening act of a third party if the intervening act is one that the defendant might reasonably foresee as probable or one that the defendant might reasonably anticipate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Strever, 278 </em>Mont. at 175-76, 924 P.2d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b642  The issue of whether an intervening cause was foreseeable or not is a question of fact that is normally properly left to the fact-finder for resolution. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 45. However, where reasonable minds may reach but one conclusion, foreseeability maybe determined as a matter of law for summary judgment purposes. <em>Cusenbary, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 45. \u00b643 B. Were the Swift driver\u2019s actions the nroximate cause of Fisher\u2019s injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b644 Fisher was injured when the J &amp; D employees released the winch on the Swift driver\u2019s truck. The truck slid across the ice and into Fisher, pinning him between the truck\u2019s trailer and his own patrol car. Swift does not dispute that the conduct of its driver was the cause-in-fact of Fisher\u2019s injuries: but for the Swift driver\u2019s decision to keep driving in the blizzard, Fisher would not have been injured. Instead, Swift argues that the J &amp; D employees were negligent in conducting the winching operation, and that their actions constitute an independent, intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b645 To determine whether the actions of the J &amp; D employees broke the chain of causation, we must ask whether the Swift driver could have reasonably foreseen that his allegedly negligent driving could result in an injury to Fisher. Certainly, reasonable minds could foresee that negligent driving on an icy highway in the midst of white-out conditions would result in an accident. It is also foreseeable that an emergency responder, such as a highway patrolman or medic, would be injured in the ensuing rescue operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b646 Fisher alleges that the Swift driver was negligent because he chose to continue driving despite blizzard conditions. He also complains that Swift failed to take appropriate precautions in approaching the accident scene on the highway. The harm to be feared from negligent driving in blizzard conditions is precisely the type of harm that occurred: the Swift driver lost control of his truck on the ice, and collided with two other vehicles on the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u00b647 It is a well-known fact that vehicles have less traction on icy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>roads. Similarly, windy and snowy conditions impair a driver\u2019s ability to control his vehicle. Given these facts, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that it is unforeseeable that a high profile truck which goes out of control, slides on the ice and initially comes to rest on an icy surface, could be caught by the wind and again slide out of control during towing or removal operations. Thus, we disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Fisher\u2019s injury was unforeseeable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b648 However, contrary to the dissent\u2019s implication, we do not hold that Fisher\u2019s injury was foreseeable as a matter of law. Rather, we conclude that reasonable minds could differ as to whether Fisher\u2019s injury was a foreseeable result of the Swift driver\u2019s alleged negligence. On remand, a jury may find that Fisher\u2019s injury was too remote in time from the Swift driver\u2019s negligence, and that the actions of the J &amp; D employees constituted an independent, intervening cause. Or, a jury may find that the Swift driver\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of Fisher\u2019s injuries. Either way, this fact-intensive inquiry must be left to the fact-finder for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b649 On remand, the fact-finder must consider whether the forces causing Fisher\u2019s injury were a foreseeable result of the Swift driver\u2019s alleged negligence. If so, then the Swift driver\u2019s conduct is the proximate cause of Fisher\u2019s injury. In <em>Busta, </em>we recognized that phrases like \u201cproximate cause\u201d often only serve to confuse the jury, thus we cautioned against using that phrase in jury instructions. <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 371, 916 P.2d at 139. We recommended that in cases involving chain of causation issues, the following jury instruction be given: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause of the (injury/death/damage) if, in a natural and continuous sequence, it helped produce it and if the (injury/death/damage) would not have occurred without it.\u201d <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 371, 916 P.2d at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b650  In sum, the question of whether Swift\u2019s conduct, in a natural and continuous sequence, helped produce Fisher\u2019s injury constitutes a genuine issue of material fact, and thus is inappropriate for resolution on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\u00b651  We hold that the District Court did not err in finding that the Swift driver owed a duty of care to Fisher. We conclude that the District Court did err in determining that injury to Fisher was unforeseeable as a matter of law. Since this case involves the issue of intervening cause, the question of whether Fisher\u2019s injury was foreseeable is a fact-intensive one best left to the fact-finder. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u00b652 On remand, the fact-finder must consider several issues. First, given that the Swift driver owed a duty of care to Fisher under both the common law and several statutes, the fact-finder must determine whether Swift breached this duty. A finding that Swift violated a statute will be prima facie evidence of breach. Next, the fact-finder must consider whether the Swift driver\u2019s actions were the proximate cause of Fisher\u2019s injuries. In addressing the issue of intervening cause, the fact-finder must ask whether injury to Fisher was a foreseeable result of Swift\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b653 In sum, the instant case presents factual questions that are not amenable to resolution by summary judgment. The District Court erred by granting Swift\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of causation. Thus, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b371-6\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"As-\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b654 I dissent. The Court determines that the concept of duty in Montana negligence law is effectively as broad as the Butterfly Effect, which the Court does not understand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court abandons the legal concept of foreseeability to reach its conclusion that a duty is owed to anyone who is at an accident scene because all persons present are within an undefined zone of risk. Also, the Court so severely limits what constitutes an independent intervening cause that a legal determination of what constitutes an intervening cause is all but eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u00b655 Swift is entitled to summary judgment that as a matter of law it owed no duty to Fisher. Of course, the Court is correct that without duty, and a breach of that duty, no negligence can exist. \u00b6 13. Also, it has long been the law in Montana that whether a legal duty exists is a question of law to be determined by the court, and the concept of duty includes the necessity that the defendant could reasonably have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>foreseen his conduct could have resulted in an injury to the plaintiff. \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b656 The District Court held, and this Court agrees, \u201cthere is no question that when a person drives in a negligent manner, a reasonably prudent person could foresee that a law enforcement officer attending a resulting accident could be injured by oncoming traffic.\u201d Thus, the Court concludes Swift\u2019s driver could foresee Fisher\u2019s injury and duty is established. The Court correctly states the law. But neither the District Court nor this Court applied the law to the facts. Fisher was not injured by oncoming traffic. He was injured by J &amp; D\u2019s careless handling of Swift\u2019s trailer, which had come to rest and had passed out of the control of Swift\u2019s driver at least an hour before Fisher was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b657 A correct analysis of whether Swift owed Fisher a duty starts with the well-established law that foreseeability is of \u201cprimary importance in establishing the existence of a duty.\u201d <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 39. If a reasonably prudent defendant cannot reasonably foresee danger of direct injury nor risk from an intervening cause, he is not negligent. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 362, 916 P.2d at 134 (quoting <em>Mang, </em>153 Mont. at 437, 458 P.2d at 781). The specific accident that ensues, however, need not be foreseen. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Ekwortzel v. Parker, </em>156 Mont. 477, 483, 482 P.2d 559, 562-63 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b658 In deciding whether Swift\u2019s driver could reasonably foresee the injury that occurred to Fisher, it is necessary to cut through the hyperbole of counsel and examine the facts as they are presented in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b659 The record presented to the Court does not show the extent of the storm on 1-15 the day of the accident. It is not known just where on I-15 the conditions became so bad that a reasonable man would have pulled to the side of the road and stopped. In the opinion of the sheriffs deputy and the highway patrolmen on the scene, at the point where the accident happened a reasonable driver would have pulled over because the snow was blowing to the extent that visibility was occasionally near zero. The officers did not say it was necessary to stop because the surface of the road was too slick to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u00b660 Fisher was summoned to investigate an accident where a tractor semi-trailer rig had sideswiped two cars that had stopped on the shoulder of the road to wait out the storm. When he arrived, he parked behind the patrol car of a Lewis &amp; Clark County deputy sheriff who was on the scene directing traffic. He parked his patrol car so that it straddled the fog line on the right-hand side of the road in the southbound lanes. He was sure of this because he could see the fog line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>on the highway. Another car stopped behind Fisher\u2019s patrol car. A short time later Swift\u2019s driver, Shultz, came along at a slow speed and sideswiped both Fisher\u2019s patrol car and the car behind it, stopping alongside and in contact with the patrol car. Fisher broke off his investigation of the prior accident, told Shultz to go back to his truck, and then reported the accident involving his patrol car. He then resumed his investigation of the first accident. He talked to people involved in the first accident inside his patrol car while it was pinned beside the Swift trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b661 About an hour to an hour and ten minutes later the J &amp; D wrecker arrived, along with two workmen. One of the J &amp; D workmen told Fisher that the plan was to attach a cable to the rear axels of the semitrailer and pull it away from his patrol car and the other car. Fisher was then to back his patrol car out of the way. The trailer was moved about five feet in this fashion. After the trailer was moved, Fisher got out of his patrol car and went between it and the trailer. He and one of the J &amp; D workmen viewed the damage to the patrol car, which was not too severe. The roadway was described as not slick like ice, but slick like heavy snow. Fisher heard someone say, \u201cLook out,\u201d turned, and saw the trailer coming toward him. No one saw the trailer sliding. It may have been pushed by the wind. But, all agree that it moved only when the other J &amp; D workman unhooked it from the wrecker. Fisher was unable to get out of the way, and he was pinned between the trailer and his patrol car causing his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b662 As we are concerned with a summary judgment motion, it is proper to assume that Swift\u2019s driver was negligent in not stopping when he could not see the road ahead of him, and thus he sideswiped Fisher\u2019s highway patrol car and the other car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After that accident Swift\u2019s negligence came to a halt. The scene was quiet for over an hour. Fisher had not been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b663 Swift\u2019s trailer had to be moved. It mattered not whether it was in the way because of carelessness or if it had simply broken down-it had to be moved. Swift and its driver had nothing to do with moving the trailer. J &amp; D successfully moved the trailer. The move was completed, and Fisher and his car were free to go. Fisher had not been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"A6c\">\u00b664 When Fisher decided to go between the trailer and his patrol car, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the trailer was secured by a cable attached to the wrecker. Fisher, at that point, was merely surveying the damage which had been caused by an accident that had happened over an hour before, in which he had not been injured. And, he was not acting in an official capacity. The damage to his patrol car was being investigated by his colleague. It was the action of J &amp; D\u2019s workman in unhooking the wrecker cable from the trailer which allowed it to roll back into Fisher and the two cars, causing Fisher\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b665 The question of whether Swift owed a duty to Fisher is answered by an analysis of whether its driver, Shultz, was reasonably required to foresee that if he continued in the storm he might come upon other cars and trucks that were stopped on the road because they had been in an accident; that he might hit two of the stopped cars; that a person already at the scene of the accident he was in, but who was not injured in such accident, could well be standing in the road looking at the damage an hour later; and that, while doing so, that person would be injured when an operator of the wrecker clearing the roadway was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b666 The chief element of whether a defendant has a duty to a plaintiff is the foreseeability of the risk the defendant takes. And, because duty is inextricably intertwined with foreseeability, whether a particular defendant owes a particular plaintiff a duty must be decided only on a case-by-case basis. <em>Mang, </em>153 Mont. at 437, 458 P.2d at 781. In this case the Court incompletely analyzes the concept of foreseeability, does not take into consideration the facts of how Fisher\u2019s injuries came about, and, therefore, reaches the wrong conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b667 The Court cites only a part of the analysis in <em>Hinkle </em>to establish that the sole question a court asks is whether a defendant could have foreseen that his or her conduct could result in an injury to the plaintiff. \u00b6 21 (citing <em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 30). The Court then completes its destruction of foreseeability in Montana tort law by ignoring the facts of the case and then taking out of context the statement in <em>Prindel </em>that the foreseeability question presented was merely whether the plaintiff was within a foreseeable zone of risk. \u00b6 21 (citing <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 38).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b668 The Court\u2019s analysis of foreseeability <em>in Hinkle </em>was not so shallow as in this case. The Court in <em>Hinkle, </em>quoting with approval <em>Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Services, Inc., </em>1999 MT 199, \u00b6 28, 295 Mont. 416, \u00b6 28, 986 P.2d 1081, \u00b6 28, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201cPut simply, in analyzing foreseeability in the duty context, we look to whether or not the injured party was within the scope of risk created by the alleged negligence of the tortfeasor-that is, was the injured party a foreseeable plaintiff?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 30. In this case, the scope of the risk created by the alleged negligence of Swift\u2019s driver is what must be analyzed in the context of the facts of how Fisher came to be injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b669 Likewise, <em>Prindel </em>most definitely does not stand for the proposition that anyone who happens to be in the area of an accident is a foreseeable plaintiff, as the Court states in \u00b6 23. <em>Prindel </em>concerned a man carelessly released from jail by the defendant Ravalli County. The man was dangerous and he assaulted Prindel. The Court held in <em>Prindel </em>that the county owed a duty of reasonable care, not to anyone whom the man might have harmed, but only to those persons within the area the defendant county could reasonably have foreseen might be harmed. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 39 <em>(citingLopez, </em>\u00b6 31). Prindel was assaulted by the man Ravalli County carelessly released within ten blocks of the jail. Thus, the Court held that he was a foreseeable plaintiff under the circumstances. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b670 The Court\u2019s conclusion that anyone who happens to be at a place where an accident occurs is a foreseeable plaintiff constitutes a complete distortion of Montana law. What the Court has done is change the concept of duty from an analysis of what a person can reasonably foresee to be a result of his actions and expanded it to include potentially infinite liability for anything a person can imagine might possibly be the result of his actions. When applied correctly, foreseeability in the law is more limited than imagination in assessing a risk. The law limits duty to that which a reasonable person would foresee as likely to happen as a result of his actions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cIn striking this balance-that is, in weighing the likelihood of harm, the seriousness of injury and the value of the interest to be sacrificed-the law judges the actor\u2019s conduct in the light of the situation as it would have appeared to the reasonable man in his shoes at the time of the act or omission complained of. Not what actually happened, but what the reasonable prudent person <em>would then have foreseen as likely to happen, </em>is the key to the question of reasonableness * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">The element emphasized above-what the reasonably prudent person <em>would then have foreseen as likely to </em>/iqppera-constitutes a limitation on the otherwise potentially infinite liability which would follow every alleged negligent act, and the law of torts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>holds a defendant amenable only for injuries to others which, to defendant at the time, were reasonably foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><em>Mang, </em>153 Mont. at 436-37, 458 P.2d at 781 (emphasis in original) (quoting in part Fowler V. Harper &amp; Fleming James, Jr., <em>The Law of Torts </em>vol. 2, 929 (Little, Brown &amp; Co. 1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b671 When the law is correctly applied to the facts presented by this case, it becomes obvious that Swift\u2019s driver could not reasonably foresee the injury to Fisher when he proceeded into the snowstorm on Sieben Flats. As he could not see where he was on the highway, he could reasonably foresee it was likely he would hit another car. As he could not see, he could reasonably foresee that other motorists could not either, and the road might be partially blocked by vehicles that had been in a previous accident. He might reasonably foresee that a highway patrolman would be investigating a previous accident. If so, the patrolman would be on the road, and if this were the case, he would likely run into him or her causing injury. At the very edge of foreseeability, Swift\u2019s driver might foresee that if he did cause an accident, it was likely that a highway patrolman would investigate that accident, and another motorist might come along and negligently injure the patrolman. However, a reasonably prudent person could not foresee that the risk he took by proceeding into the storm made it likely that over an hour after he caused a non-injury accident, a highway patrolman not investigating the accident would be injured not by another motorist who could not see where he was going, but by the negligence of a wrecker crew in unhooking a cable from his trailer after they had moved it. As the Court notes in \u00b6 21 and as stated in <em>Palsgraf, </em>a defendant owes a duty only with respect to those hazards whose likelihood made the conduct unreasonably dangerous. Shultz\u2019s conduct did not make it likely that J &amp; D would injure Fisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b672 The injury to Fisher was not a foreseeable consequence of Swift\u2019s driver proceeding into the snowstorm when he could not see. Therefore, Swift owed no duty to Fisher, and the judgment of the District Court dismissing the action against Swift was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u00b673 As the injuries to Fisher were not foreseeable by Swift\u2019s driver, Swift owed him no duty and is entitled to summary judgment. However, if Swift owed a duty to Fisher, which it did not, I would nevertheless conclude that the negligent action of J &amp; D\u2019s workman in unhooking the cable from Swift\u2019s trailer was an independent intervening cause of Fisher\u2019s injuries as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u00b674 As the Court stated in <em>Prindel, </em>when a case presents the issue of an intervening act of a third party, foreseeability is also addressed in the context of proximate cause. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 44. To the extent that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>specific injury to the plaintiff must be foreseeable, the issue of intervening acts normally involves questions of fact which should be left to a jury. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 45. However, when reasonable minds can reach but one conclusion the question of foreseeability is determined as a matter of law. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b675 In \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, the Court misapprehends the facts of how Swift\u2019s driver came to be in an accident. He did not lose control of his tractor semi-trailer on the ice. He did not lose traction, and he maintained control of his truck. He was driving when he could not see because of the blowing snow. He sideswiped Fisher\u2019s patrol car and the car behind it, which were partially in the far right driving lane, because he did not see them. Nevertheless, I do not disagree with the Court\u2019s proposed instruction concerning independent intervening cause set forth at \u00b6 49. However, this instruction alone does not adequately address the element of foreseeability as it relates to causation that this Court emphasized in <em>Busta </em>and its progeny. The conduct of Swift\u2019s driver is a cause of Fisher\u2019s injury only if, in a natural and continuous sequence, it was a foreseeable and substantial factor in bringing it about. The <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>identifies three factors the fact-finder should pay close attention to when determining whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor in intervening cause cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">(a) the number of other factors which contribute in producing the harm and the extent of the effect which they have in producing it; (b) whether the actor\u2019s conduct has created a force or series of forces which are in continuous and active operation up to the time of the harm, or has created a situation harmless unless acted upon by other forces for which the actor is not responsible; [and] (c) lapse of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 433 (1965). An analysis of this case in conformity with these well-accepted principles leads to only one conclusion-J &amp; D\u2019s negligence is the cause of Fisher\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u00b676 This case necessarily requires a consideration of whether Shultz\u2019s conduct created a force which was in continuous and active operation up to the time Fisher was injured. It did not. In addition, it must be considered whether Shultz\u2019s conduct created a situation that harmed Fisher before there was a lapse of time between his conduct and the injury. It did not. It must also be considered whether the situation created by Shultz was acted upon by J &amp; D\u2019s workman, for whom neither he nor Swift was responsible. It cannot be denied that Fisher would not have been injured if not for the actions of the wrecker crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u00b677 Shultz was in an accident that did not harm Fisher. Over an hour later J &amp; D\u2019s wrecker arrived. The situation created by the accident did not create a situation that would have harmed Fisher unless it was acted upon by the negligent conduct of J &amp; D. Reasonable minds could not differ in finding that the negligence of J &amp; D is an independent intervening cause of Fisher\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b678 Considering the well-accepted and applicable law concerning independent intervening cause, as promulgated by the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>which is appropriately called to a jury\u2019s attention by the trial court and argued by counsel, reasonable minds could not differ. J &amp; D\u2019s negligence in releasing the trailer to roll back into Fisher was the independent intervening cause of Fisher\u2019s injuries. This conclusion is further bolstered by the law providing that under these circumstances Swift could reasonably request an instruction that one is not required to anticipate an injury that can only result from another\u2019s negligence. <em>See Peschke v. Carroll College, </em>280 Mont. 331, 340, 929 P.2d 874, 879 (1996). Swift is entitled to summary judgment that Fisher\u2019s injury was the result of an independent intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b679 I dissent from the Court\u2019s untoward expansion of the concept of foreseeability as it relates to duty to the effect that anyone injured near an accident, no matter how, is a foreseeable plaintiff. I also dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that reasonable minds could differ on whether J &amp; D\u2019s negligence was an independent intervening cause of Fisher\u2019s injury. They could not.</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE RICE join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\"> The Butterfly Effect is the idea that a butterfly stirring the air today in Beijing can transform storm systems next month in New York. James Gleick, <em>Chaos </em>8 (Penguin Books 1987). Flapping butterfly wings in China represents a small change in initial conditions. These small actions cause a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the storm may not have occurred; the first accident may not have happened; Fisher may not have come to investigate it; Swift\u2019s driver might not have hit Fisher\u2019s patrol car; J &amp; D might not have had to move Swift\u2019s truck; J &amp; D\u2019s workman might not have carelessly unhooked the trailer; and Fisher would not have been injured by that workman\u2019s negligence.
