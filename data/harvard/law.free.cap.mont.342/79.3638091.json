We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by affirming the municipal court\u2019s denial of Mouat\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds of double jeopardy?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u00b64 On February 19, 2004, Billings Police Officer Jerry Smidt discovered Mouat at 1:12 a.m. parked on a city-street sidewalk with three flat tires. Officer Smidt noticed that Mouat had \u201cslurred speech, bloodshot and glossy eyes[,] ... poor balance[,]\u201d and smelled of intoxicants. Mouat failed the sobriety tests Officer Smidt administered. Mouat was subsequently arrested and charged with the offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI), a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(1)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\u00b65 The matter was set for trial in the Billings Municipal Court (municipal court) and after numerous motions to continue and speedy trial waivers, the trial commenced on May 26, 2005. During Officer Smidt\u2019s direct testimony, the municipal court admitted, on stipulation by the parties, Officer Smidt\u2019s in-car videotape of Mouat\u2019s arrest. During the video, a hushed sound-bite, only audible when played at full volume, revealed Officer Smidt asking Mouat about a previous DUI conviction. Mouat moved for a mistrial. The judge, who did not hear the statement when the videotape was played for the jury, listened to the videotape again outside the jury\u2019s presence and determined that admission of the offending statement was an inadvertent oversight by both the City of Billings (City) and Mouat, as both parties had access to the videotape for over a year. The municipal court granted Mouat\u2019s motion for a mistrial and ordered the City to redact the statement from the videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u00b66 A second trial commenced on June 21, 2005. The videotape was again stipulated to and admitted. While the City had attempted to redact the offending statement by recording over it, Officer Smidt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>statement was still slightly audible when the videotape was played at full volume. Conceding that the City\u2019s introduction of the statement \u201cwasn\u2019t anything intentional,\u201d Mouat again moved for a mistrial. The City expressed amazement that the statement was not fully redacted and did not object to Mouat\u2019s motion. The municipal court granted the motion with the understanding that the City had the option to retry the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b67 Thereafter, Mouat filed a motion to dismiss with the municipal court on the basis of double jeopardy. Mouat argued that while the City did not introduce the statement \u201cintentionally or with the idea of gaining an advantage[,]\u201d the case should be dismissed because the City \u201cshould not be given a third bite at the apple in a misdemeanor case.\u201d Mouat also argued that it was \u201cburdensome\u201d to hire an attorney for a misdemeanor case. Following a hearing on the motion to dismiss, the municipal court determined that there was \u201cno evidence that the City designed the error on the video tape to goad the Defendant, in either instance, to move for the mistrial.\u201d Accordingly, the municipal court denied Mouat\u2019s motion to dismiss, stating that \u201cthe manifest necessity standard does not apply and the doctrine of double jeopardy does not enjoin the City from re-trying this case a third time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b68 After Mouat\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied, Mouat reserved the right to appeal the denial of her motion to dismiss and pled guilty to the charged offense on September 8, 2005. Thereafter, Mouat filed a timely appeal with the District Court, arguing that the municipal court should have granted her motion to dismiss. Mouat again asserted that while the offending statement\u2019s introduction was not \u201cintentional,\u201d a third trial for the same misdemeanor offense violated double jeopardy protections. In response, the City again relied on <em>State v. Mallak, </em>2005 MT 49, \u00b6 18, 326 Mont. 165, \u00b6 18, 109 P.3d 209, \u00b6 18, and argued that \u201cwhen a mistrial is granted on a defendant\u2019s motion\u201d double jeopardy will not bar a second case unless the \u201cgovernmental conduct in question is intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d The District Court agreed with the City and affirmed the municipal court\u2019s denial of Mouat\u2019s motion to dismiss. The District Court concluded that Mouat\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds [was] not justified under the law\u201d and while \u201ca third trial on a misdemeanor should be rare, [the City] is not precluded on double jeopardy grounds from trying [Mouat] a third time.\u201d Mouat appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b69 Pursuant to \u00a7 3-6-110, MCA, a district court\u2019s review of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>municipal court\u2019s orders and judgments is limited to a review of the record and questions of law. <em>State v. Ditton, </em>2006 MT 235, \u00b6 18, 333 Mont. 483, \u00b6 18, 144 P.3d 783, \u00b6 18. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous, and we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 18. Our review of questions involving constitutional law is plenary. <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err by affirming the municipal court\u2019s denial of Mouat\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds of double jeopardy?</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b611 Mouat argues that the District Court erred when it affirmed the municipal court\u2019s denial of her motion to dismiss, contending that \u201c[d]ouble jeopardy prevents three trials on a misdemeanor offense caused by negligence on the part of the government.\u201d The State responds that Mouat \u201ccannot prevail under this [theory] because she cannot prove objective facts establishing that the City intended to goad her into a mistrial in either case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b612 The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, protects criminal defendants from repeated prosecutions for the same offense. <em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 18. While the Double Jeopardy Clause protects a defendant\u2019s right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal, it does not include an absolute right that the first selected jury will decide his case. <em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 18. Where \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d exists, such as when a mistrial is declared following a hung jury unable to reach a verdict, a trial court will lift the double jeopardy bar to a second trial. <em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 18. However, where a mistrial is declared on the defendant\u2019s motion, double jeopardy will not bar a subsequent trial <em>unless </em>\u201c\u2018the governmental conduct in question [was] intended to \u201cgoad\u201d the defendant into moving for a mistrial____\u2019 \u201d <em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 676, 102 S. Ct. 2083, 2089 (1982)). Accordingly, only where the State engaged in a \u201cMachiavellian\u201d design will a defendant succeed in raising the double jeopardy bar after his motion for a mistrial is granted. <em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">\u00b613  Mouat repeatedly acknowledged to both the municipal court and the District Court that the City did not introduce the offending statement \u201cintentionally or with the idea of gaining an advantage.\u201d Both courts agreed with Mouat on that point, entering findings of fact that the City had not intentionally introduced Officer Smidt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>statement with the hope of causing a mistrial. Consequently, Mouat concedes that the \u201cintent\u201d element required for double jeopardy to bar a subsequent prosecution following a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial is lacking. Instead, Mouat argues on appeal that double jeopardy should bar a subsequent trial after the granting of a defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, if that motion was based on <em>negligent </em>conduct by the government. However, this argument conflicts with the well-settled principle that double jeopardy will only bar a second case where the prosecution intentionally sought to gain an advantage by the granting of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Mouat offers no supporting authority for the proposition that negligent conduct alters that principle. Without commenting on whether the record here actually demonstrates negligence on the part of the City, we must decline Mouat\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b614 Mouat also argues that the City should not \u201cbe given three bites at the apple\u201d in a misdemeanor case, implying that misdemeanor cases should be treated differently than felony cases. While Mouat cites statutes indicating general differences between misdemeanors and felonies, Mouat offers no authority or reasoning supporting adoption of a bright-line rule barring a third trial of a misdemeanor. Both the District Court and the municipal court rejected Mouat\u2019s \u201ctriple jeopard/\u2019 argument, concluding that because the City did not act with an intent to \u201cprovoke a mistrial either time,\u201d double jeopardy guarantees did not bar a third prosecution. As previously noted, this conclusion of law by the District Court is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b615 Lastly, Mouat has raised a \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d argument supported by case authority in her reply brief on appeal. A review of the record reveals that Mouat did not offer this \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d argument in either the municipal court or the District Court. She also failed to make the argument in her opening brief on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, Mouat\u2019s reply brief explains that the arguments in the State\u2019s brief led her \u201cto the discovery of numerous cases\u201d which discussed the issue before us as one of \u201cfundamental fairness as opposed to double jeopardy.\u201d Thereafter she offers an argument that reversal is warranted because \u201cthe ability of the defendant to continually muster time and finances is an important issue in [analyzing] the overall fairness.\u201d While Mouat\u2019s arguments before the municipal court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>District Court briefly alluded to the \u201cburdensome\u201d nature of hiring an attorney in a misdemeanor case, neither argument was sufficient to alert either court to a specific statute, case or constitutional provision that formed the basis of this particular argument. We have \u201cheld that a party must specify in the trial court what authority, rule, statute, or constitutional provision might be violated by a decision contrary to the party\u2019s position, and that failure to do so fails to preserve that issue for appeal.\u201d <em>In re G.S., </em>2002 MT 245, \u00b6 48, 312 Mont. 108, \u00b6 48, 59 P.3d 1063, \u00b6 48. Further, we have often stated that the Court deems issues presented for the first time on appeal to be untimely and will not consider them \u201cbecause it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 12, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 12. Moreover, M. R. App. P. 12(3) prohibits an appellant from raising new issues in the reply brief. <em>See Pengra v. State, </em>2000 MT 291, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 276, \u00b6 13, 14 P.3d 499, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b616  While we acknowledge the inherent logic in the proposition that the government should not have an unlimited number of opportunities to prosecute a defendant, the posture of this case does not allow consideration of the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d argument raised herein, the authority addressing the issue, or whether the record here supports such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b108-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-6\"> Mouat\u2019s opening brief referenced \u201cthe logic of fundamental fairness\u201d in reference to her prosecutorial negligence argument, but not as a separate argument supported by authority as offered in her reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
