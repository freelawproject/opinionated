(the bakery), Carol Skufca, Barb Hulett, Mae Watson and Margaret B. Schraner (collectively, Sweet Flours) appeal from the order entered by the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, granting summary judgment to defendants Raymond and Beverly Murphy, and from its later order ruling that Sweet Flours\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment had been denied by operation of law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting the Murphys summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in ruling that Sweet Flours\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment had been denied by operation of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">\u00b65 In 2002, the bakery and Speedy Auto Glass, Inc. (Speedy) were commercial lessees of a building owned by the Murphys; the businesses were separated by a common wall that extended as high as the framework for a drop ceiling. Meloy owned and worked in the bakery, and Skufca, Hulett, Watson and Schraner were bakery employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">\u00b66 In October of 2002, Speedy\u2019s manager Dave Steinebach placed a videocamera up through a space in the Speedy restroom ceiling where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>tiles were missing, and aimed it toward a relatively small hole in the ceiling of the adjacent bakery employees\u2019 restroom. Law enforcement officers investigated, and arrested Steinebach. He later pled guilty to the misdemeanor offense of surreptitious visual observation or recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b67 In October of 2004, Sweet Flours filed a six-count complaint against the Murphys, Speedy and Steinebach. The only claim against the Murphys was that they caused damages to Sweet Flours by negligently failing to exercise reasonable care for the condition of the premises leased to the bakery. The Murphys answered, and also filed cross-claims not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b68 Subsequently, the Murphys and Speedy moved for summary judgment on Sweet Flours\u2019 claims. The District Court granted the Murphys\u2019 motion and denied Speedy\u2019s on all but one claim. Sweet Flours later settled with Speedy, and moved the District Court to certify its order granting summary judgment to the Murphys as final for purposes of appeal. Pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b), and at Sweet Flours\u2019 request, the court certified the order on June 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b69 On June 12, 2006, Sweet Flours moved to alter or amend the order granting summary judgment to the Murphys. On August 31, the District Court entered its order determining that Sweet Flours\u2019 motion had been denied by operation of law pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(g). Sweet Flours appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\u00b610 We review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same M. R. Civ. P. 56(c) criteria applied by the district court. Because summary judgment is an extreme remedy that should never be substituted for a trial if a material factual controversy exists, summary judgment should be granted only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Hajenga v. Schwein, </em>2007 MT 80, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 507, \u00b6 11, 155 P.3d 1241, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted). To determine the existence or nonexistence of a genuine issue of material fact, we look to the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file and affidavits. <em>Hajenga, </em>\u00b6 12 (citations omitted). Although negligence actions involve questions of fact and ordinarily are not susceptible to summary judgment, questions of fact can be determined as a matter of law when reasonable minds cannot differ. <em>Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 19, 319 Mont. 307, \u00b6 19, 84 P.3d 38, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">\u00b611 We generally review a district court\u2019s denial of an M. R. Civ. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>59(g) motion to amend a judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>Lee v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2001 MT 59, \u00b6 27, 304 Mont. 356, \u00b6 27,22 P.3d 631, \u00b6 27 (citation omitted). When no factual issue exists regarding a district court\u2019s acts in relation to the 60-day time limit in Rule 59(g), however, the issue of whether the court retained authority to decide the motion is a matter of law which we review for correctness. <em>See Associated Press v. Crofts, </em>2004 MT 120, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 36-37, 321 Mont. 193, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 36-37, 89 P.3d 971, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 36-37 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b612 1. Did the District Court err in granting the Murphys summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u00b613 Sweet Flours asserts that genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to the Mmrphys\u2019 alleged failure to maintain the Speedy premises-particularly, the ceiling tiles in the Speedy restroom-and the Murphys\u2019 alleged failure to report Steinebach\u2019s prior illegal conduct to Speedy or to law enforcement. As mentioned above, however, the sole claim against the Murphys in the complaint was that they failed to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the bakery premises. In the District Court and on appeal, Sweet Flours has posited that, notwithstanding this clearly stated claim, the \u201cbasis\u201d or \u201cgravamen\u201d of the claim was something different. While the District Court addressed some of Sweet Flours\u2019 contentions regarding matters that were not pled, we focus exclusively on the claim alleged in the complaint for reasons discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b614 A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief and a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 8(a). We recently restated, in a somewhat different context, the fundamental precept that pleadings are intended to advance \u201cprinciples of fairness and notice[.]\u201d <em>Meadow Lake Estates Assoc. v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 41, \u00b6 28, 341 Mont. 345, \u00b6 28, 178 P.3d 81, \u00b6 28 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\u00b615  A negligence action has four elements: (1) duty, (2) breach of duty, (3) causation and (4) damages. <em>Henricksen, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted). The Murphys\u2019 summary judgment motion was based in part on their argument regarding the extent of a landlord\u2019s liability under Montana law. They asserted that no genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to their lack of knowledge of the camera placement and the hole in the bakery restroom ceiling. In that regard, the Murphys pointed to deposition testimony and affidavits to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>effect that they did not know of the hole in the bakery restroom or the camera installation, at least one plaintiff did not notice the hole in the bakery restroom until after the camera was discovered, and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether the Murphys knew of that hole. In short, the Murphys asserted their duty of reasonable care as landlords did not encompass liability for all injuries to tenants on the bakery premises and, in light of their unawareness of the hole in the bakery restroom ceiling, no genuine issue of material fact existed about whether they breached a duty of reasonable care to maintain the bakery premises. We conclude the Murphys met their initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding a breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b616 In response, Sweet Flours asserted the \u201cbasis\u201d of their claim against the Murphys was a failure to maintain the Speedy premises, not the bakery premises. Along similar lines, Sweet Flours posited that the Murphys had a duty to maintain the Speedy premises stemming from their lease agreement with Speedy and Raymond Murphy\u2019s admission that he had previously made repairs to the building. Sweet Flours cited to no legal authority or document of record permitting them to set forth matters regarding the Speedy premises as a new \u201cbasis\u201d for their claim, however-and, indeed, doing so squarely contradicted the \u201cprinciples of fairness and notice that require a plaintiff to set forth the basis of a claim in a complaint.\u201d <em>See Meadow Lake Estates, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b617 Before making the above-mentioned assertions regarding the Speedy restroom, Sweet Flours stated \u201c[p]laintiffs do not dispute Murphys\u2019 statement of the ... background of the case, except to the extent that Murphys\u2019 [sic] claim they had no knowledge of the hole in the ceiling of the Sweet Flours Bake Shoppe\u2019s bathroom.\u201d This statement constituted the entirety of Sweet Flours\u2019 argument in the District Court regarding the Murphys\u2019 alleged failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the bakery premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b618 Once a party moving for summary judgment has met the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish with substantial evidence, as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory assertions, that a genuine issue of material fact does exist or that the moving party is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Phelps v. Frampton, </em>2007 MT 263, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 330, \u00b6 16, 170 P.3d 474, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted); <em>Hajenga, </em>\u00b6 13 (citation omitted). Here, Sweet Flours presented nothing more than a conclusory assertion. Therefore, we conclude Sweet Flours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>did not raise a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b619 Finally, on appeal, Sweet Flours contends the Murphys had knowledge of Steinebach\u2019s alleged prior illegal conduct on the Speedy premises-namely, growing marijuana and borrowing money from Speedy without authorization-and failed to report Steinebach\u2019s conduct to law enforcement or to Speedy. Sweet Flours\u2019 complaint did not set forth a claim pertaining to the Murphys\u2019 failure to report their alleged knowledge of prior illegal conduct by Steinebach. Moreover, the only arguments Sweet Flours advanced on summary judgment regarding the Murphys\u2019 alleged knowledge of Steinebach\u2019s prior illegal conduct pertained to whether a superseding intervening cause broke the chain of causation. Having determined Sweet Flours raised no genuine issue of material fact regarding the Murphys\u2019 exercise of reasonable care to maintain the bakery premises, we need not reach any causation question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b620 We hold the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Murphys.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b621 2. Did the District Court err in ruling that Sweet Flours\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment had been denied by operation of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b622 The District Court granted M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification on June 7, 2006. On June 12, Sweet Flours moved to alter or amend the judgment based on a newly-discovered witness, Daniel Smith. Sweet Flours submitted Smith\u2019s affidavit, dated May 18, 2006, which stated the owner of the building was with Smith in 2002 when Smith inadvertently discovered plants he believed to be marijuana. On June 30, the parties filed a stipulation to extend the Murphys\u2019 time to respond \u201cup to and including July 31, 2006 and/or the taking of the deposition of the affiant, Daniel Smith[.]\u201d Smith\u2019s deposition was taken on July 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00b623 On July 31, the Murphys filed their response to the motion. On August 8, Sweet Flours filed a reply brief, along with a motion for filing of Smith\u2019s deposition, stating the deposition \u201cha[d] been relied upon by both the parties in their briefs regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment[.]\u201d The District Court apparently signed the order authorizing the filing of Smith\u2019s deposition on August 8, 2006, but the order was not entered until August 14. The Murphys filed Smith\u2019s deposition on August 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\u00b624 On August 31, the District Court entered its order stating Sweet Flours\u2019 motion had been deemed denied by operation of law. It observed that M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) provides a motion to alter or amend a judgment is deemed denied if not ruled on within 60 days. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>District Court reasoned that the 60-day period expired on August 11, 2006, and it no longer had authority to rule on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b625  On appeal, Sweet Flours presents virtually no argument addressing M. R. Civ. P. 59(g), and does not challenge the District Court\u2019s reasoning that the motion was deemed denied by operation of law due to the expiration of the 60-day period. Sweet Flours\u2019 assertions regarding the post-judgment proceedings apparently are based on the proposition that Smith\u2019s testimony raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding the assertions mentioned above that the Murphys had knowledge of Steinebach\u2019s prior illegal conduct-assertions which were not pled in the complaint. Moreover, Smith\u2019s May 18, 2006 affidavit predates Sweet Flours\u2019 reply brief supporting its motion for M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification by one week, and predates the District Court\u2019s certification order by approximately three weeks-indicating Sweet Flours was aware of the \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence as it was seeking M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification of the order granting summary judgment to the Murphys as final. In any event, absent authority regarding M. R. Civ. P. 59(g)-related matters, Sweet Flours cannot meet its burden of establishing error, and it is not this Court\u2019s obligation to develop arguments on a party\u2019s behalf. <em>See Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 55, 336 Mont. 225, \u00b6 55, 154 P.3d 561, \u00b6 55 (citation omitted). We decline to address this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b626 We hold the District Court did not err in determining Sweet Flours\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment had been denied by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
