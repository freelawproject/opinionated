We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in denying Bomar\u2019s motions for</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">dismissal and a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in admitting expert testimony regarding the validity of the statements by a child witness contained in a law enforcement officer\u2019s report?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">\u00b65 In 2005, the State of Montana charged Bomar by amended information with the felony offense of attempted sexual intercourse without consent and, alternatively, with the felony offense of sexual assault. The offense allegedly occurred in July of 2000 and involved then-six-year-old K. J.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">\u00b66 Before trial, Bomar filed several motions <em>in limine </em>which focused in part on the anticipated expert testimony of marriage and family therapist Rochelle Beley regarding her assessment (statement validity assessment) of KJ.\u2019s statements contained in an Oregon law enforcement officer\u2019s report. The District Court granted Bomar\u2019s motion to preclude testimony regarding the ultimate issue of whether Bomar sexually assaulted K.J., and reserved ruling on other aspects of anticipated expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-15\">\u00b67 During the trial in 2005, the State called then-12-year-old K.J. to testify. Among other things, K.J. testified that in 2000, Bomar had placed his penis in her \u201cbottom\u201d-which she and other witnesses clarified in other testimony was K. J.\u2019s term for her vagina or vaginal area-and touched her naked \u201cbottom\u201d with his naked penis. Additional witnesses for the State testified about the circumstances surrounding the alleged incident and K. J.\u2019s reports of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u00b68 The State asserted K. J.\u2019s credibility had been attacked, and called Beley as its final witness. Bomar objected. After hearing Beley\u2019s <em>in camera </em>testimony regarding her statement validity assessment, the District Court allowed Beley\u2019s trial testimony and afforded the defense a continuing objection. Among other things, Beley testified that, based on her statement validity assessment, \u201cit appeared many of [K. J.\u2019s] statements [in the Oregon officer\u2019s report] were consistent with the research, which shows valid statements of sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b69 After the State rested its case, Bomar moved for dismissal. The District Court denied the motion, stating the evidence was sufficient to submit the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b610 During Bomar\u2019s case-in-chief, the defense presented witnesses to refute certain factual aspects of the State\u2019s case and to support Bomar\u2019s affirmative defense of mistaken identity. In addition, the defense called licensed psychologist Dr. Donna Zook, and the State objected. The District Court heard arguments <em>in camera </em>regarding Zook\u2019s anticipated testimony and made rulings. Zook then testified that Beley had not followed proper procedures in performing the statement validity assessment, including a requirement to conduct a face-to-face interview with the child. After the settling of jury instructions, Bomar renewed his motion to dismiss, characterizing it as a motion for judgment of acquittal. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b611 The jury found Bomar guilty of sexual assault. Bomar moved for a new trial on multiple grounds, and submitted clinical psychologist Dr. Michael Scolatti\u2019s affidavit setting forth Scolatti\u2019s opinions regarding Beley\u2019s statement validity assessment. The District Court denied the motion for a new trial, and entered judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"A4D\">\u00b612 Bomar appeals, represented by new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u00b613 In a criminal case, a motion for dismissal for insufficiency of the evidence under \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, is only appropriate if, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, no evidence exists upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 16, 337 Mont. 326, \u00b6 16, 160 P.3d 511, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s denial of such a motion <em>de novo, </em>because evidence is either sufficient or it is not. <em>Swann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u00b6 14 We generally review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>See e.g. State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, \u00b6 8, 127 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>458, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted). However, to the extent an evidentiaryruling is based on a conclusion of law-as Bomar primarily asserts here with regard to the admission of Beley\u2019s testimony-our review is plenary. <em>See State v. Skinner, </em>2007 MT 175, \u00b6 15, 338 Mont. 197, \u00b6 15, 163 P.3d 399, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b615  Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial depends on the basis of the motion. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 164, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6 164, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6 164 (citation omitted). In general, we review the denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion, while acknowledging the underlying assertion may involve a different standard of review. <em>See e.g. State v. Vaughn, </em>2007 MT 164, \u00b6 28, 338 Mont. 97, \u00b6 28, 164 P.3d 873, \u00b6 28 (citations omitted). When a motion for a new trial is based on an asserted insufficiency of the evidence, however, our review is <em>de novo. See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 164 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b6 16 <em>1. Did the District Court err in denying Bomar\u2019s motions for dismissal and a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b617 A person who knowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent commits the offense of sexual assault. Section 45-5-502(1), MCA (1999). As pertinent to this case, \u201csexual contact\u201d means touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of another person, directly or through clothing, in order to knowingly or purposely arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party. Section 45-2-101(66), MCA (1999). A person who knowingly has sexual intercourse without consent with another person commits the offense of sexual intercourse without consent. Section 45-5-503(1), MCA (1999). \u201cSexual intercourse\u201d means, in pertinent part, penetration of the vulva of one person by the penis of another person. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-101(67), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\u00b618 The District Court instructed the jury in accordance with the foregoing statutes, and also gave an instruction on \u201cattempt,\u201d mentioned below. In addition, the District Court instructed that sexual assault and attempted sexual intercourse without consent were charged in the alternative, and the jury could not convict Bomar of both offenses. As noted above, the jury found Bomar guilty of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\u00b619 Bomar posits that the only evidence of the \u201csexual contact\u201d element of sexual assault was K. J.\u2019s testimony that Bomar put his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>penis in her \u201cbottom.\u201d In this respect, Bomar observes the State originally charged him with sexual intercourse without consent and later amended the charge to attempted sexual intercourse without consent. He asserts the amended charge indicates the State believed the evidence was insufficient to establish penetration. Whether Bomar intends this assertion regarding the State\u2019s charging procedure to be free-standing or merely part of his overarching assertion regarding insufficiency of the evidence, he advances no authority or developed argument supporting his apparent position that the amendment of a charging document has some substantive effect on the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. It is not this Court\u2019s obligation to develop arguments on a party\u2019s behalf. <em>See State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 44, 340 Mont. 10, \u00b6 44, 171 P.3d 731, \u00b6 44 (citations omitted). Accordingly, we decline to address this assertion further.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b620 Bomar also argues, apparently in relation to the denial of his motion for a new trial, that his acquittal on the attempted sexual intercourse without consent charge indicates the jury disbelieved K. J.\u2019s testimony regarding penetration, or found the State did not prove that he performed an \u201cact that [went] far enough toward accomplishing Sexual Intercourse to amount to beginning to commit the offense of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent,\u201d as contemplated in the \u201cattempt\u201d instruction. Generally, consistency in jury verdicts is not required and, thus, the question is not whether a criminal jury\u2019s verdict is inconsistent, but whether the verdict is supported by sufficient evidence. <em>See State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 15, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted). Bomar maintains, however, that this case presents a situation in which his acquittal on the attempted sexual intercourse without consent charge demonstrates the insufficiency of the evidence to support his sexual assault conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b621 K.J. testified to the following on direct examination. When she was six years old, she camped with her grandparents in the vicinity of Cut Bank, Montana. Bomar had a house at the campground, and K. J. met and played with Bomar\u2019s grandson. The day before K. J.\u2019s seventh birthday, Bomar\u2019s spouse was outside, Bomar was sitting in his chair, his grandson was sitting on a couch approximately two to three feet away and K.J. was standing next to Bomar\u2019s chair. K.J. asked if she could get a drink or use the restroom, and Bomar answered \u201c[y]es, but can you come here real quick?\u201d K. J. stood between Bomar\u2019s legs, which were spread apart. Bomar asked K. J. to move her swimsuit bottom, and she moved it aside so that her \u201cbottom,\u201d or vaginal area, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>visible. Bomar unzipped his pants, moved his underwear aside, pulled out his penis, and \u201cput it in [her] bottom.\u201d Bomar held his penis with one hand and placed his other hand on KJ.\u2019s back between her shoulder blades. His penis grew bigger \u201c[l]ike a brain popping\u201d and K.J. felt wetness in her \u201cbottom.\u201d Bomar zipped his pants, and K. J. went to the restroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b622 On cross-examination, K. J. responded affirmatively when asked if what happened to her went inside her \u201cprivates\u201d and if she felt it. She further stated she had felt a little wet afterward, and did not remember telling a detective she felt neither wet nor messy. In addition, K. J. admitted there was no blood, bruising or pain, and she did not yell, scream, cry out or call for help. She also acknowledged that, before trial, she had-apparently contrary to Bomar\u2019s physical appearance and some of her testimony on direct examination-described Bomar as wearing sweat pants, having a tattoo on his arm and having a moustache. On redirect, she testified her \u201cbottom\u201d was naked, Bomar\u2019s penis was naked, and he touched her with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b623 Credibility determinations are within the province of the trier of fact-here, the jury-and we will not disturb such determinations on appeal. <em>See State v. Pittman, </em>2005 MT 70, \u00b6 42, 326 Mont. 324, \u00b6 42, 109 P.3d 237, \u00b6 42 (citation omitted). Further, a jury is at liberty to believe all, part or none of the testimony of a witness. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 94, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 94, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 94 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b624 In <em>State v. York, </em>2003 MT 349, \u00b6 13, 318 Mont. 511, \u00b6 13, 81 P.3d 1277, \u00b6 13, we assumed <em>arguendo </em>that, due to the times and distances involved, it was impossible for the appellant to commit an assault as certain witnesses had testified and then encounter a law enforcement officer at another location. We deemed unpersuasive, however, his assertion that the jury was required to accept or reject the entirety of the witnesses\u2019 testimony. <em>York, </em>\u00b6 14. Instead, we determined that, in light of a jury instruction, it was plausible that the jury rejected parts of the witnesses\u2019 version of events and, in its discretion, accepted the remainder. Noting we could not know precisely why or how the jury reached its decision, we held sufficient evidence supported the conviction. <em>York, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b625 Following our <em>York </em>approach, we assume <em>arguendo </em>that Bomar\u2019s acquittal on the attempted sexual intercourse without consent charge indicates the jury found the evidence did not establish an act amounting to the beginning of penetration. We also note the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Court instructed that \u201c[a]t the outset, a witness is entitled to a presumption that his or her testimony is truthful[,]\u201d and \u201c[a] witness false in one part of his or her testimony is to be distrusted in others. However, this rule does not apply to a witness who unintentionally commits an error.\u201d As set forth above, K.J. testified on redirect that Bomar touched her \u201cbottom,\u201d or vaginal area, with his penis; she did not use a term indicating penetration, such as \u201cin\u201d or \u201cinside\u201d on redirect. In light of the jury instructions, we conclude it is plausible that the jury determined K.J. had unintentionally erred in her testimony regarding penetration, yet applied the presumption of truthfulness to her testimony regarding \u201csexual contact\u201d with her intimate parts without penetration. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-101(66), MCA (1999). Further, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude K. J.\u2019s testimony was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find the State had established the elements of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Swann, </em>\u00b6 16; \u00a7 45-5-502(1), MCA (1999). As a result, we need not address Bomar\u2019s argument that the District Court erroneously denied his motion for a new trial based on cases addressing alleged inconsistencies of verdicts with respect to separate, rather than alternative, charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b626 Bomar also asserts that touching his penis to KJ.\u2019s vaginal area would have constituted attempt-as defined in the \u201cattempt\u201d jury instruction-to commit sexual intercourse without consent, the charge of which he was acquitted. While not entirely clear, it appears his assertion is that, under the facts of this case, the \u201csexual contact\u201d element of sexual assault necessarily \u201camount[s] to beginning\u201d the penetration element of sexual intercourse without consent, as contemplated in the \u201cattempt\u201d instruction. Bomar cites to no authority and presents no developed argument regarding this assertion. Thus, we decline to address it. <em>See Lewis, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b627 We hold the District Court did not err in denying Bomar\u2019s motions for dismissal and for a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b628 <em>2. Did the District Court err in admitting an expert\u2019s testimony regarding the validity of K. J.\u2019s statements contained in a law enforcement officer\u2019s report?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b629 Bomar advances arguments pertaining to two lines of cases in relation to Beley\u2019s testimony regarding her statement validity assessment. One line of cases stems from <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579,113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), relating to a trial court\u2019s assessment of the reliability and admissibility of expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>testimony under M. R. Evid. 702 and other evidentiary rules. <em>See e.g. Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 52, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 52, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 52 (citations omitted). The other line of cases concerns the \u201cMontana rule\u201d that an expert who meets certain criteria may testify regarding the credibility of a child who has allegedly been the victim of sexual abuse when the child testifies at trial and his or her credibility is brought into question. <em>See State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 327 Mont. 196, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 113 P.3d 281, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; <em>State v. Scheffelman, </em>250 Mont. 334, 342, 820 P.2d 1293, 1298 (1991); <em>State v. Geyman, </em>224 Mont. 194, 196-201, 729 P.2d 475, 477-80 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b630 As noted above, Bomar filed several motions <em>in limine </em>together in a single document, four of which pertained to KJ.\u2019s out-of-court statements, Beley\u2019s anticipated expert testimony or both. Without going into great detail, these four motions <em>in limine </em>overlapped in certain respects, and were less than clear in others. In any event, Bomar discusses only two of these motions in relation to the issue on appeal-the motion to exclude expert testimony regarding the \u201cultimate issue,\u201d including KJ.\u2019s truthfulness, and the motion to exclude \u201cunqualified expert opinion.\u201d Before trial, as noted above, the District Court granted the motion regarding testimony on the ultimate issue of whether Bomar sexually assaulted K.J., and reserved ruling on other aspects of putative expert testimony. At trial, Bomar\u2019s counsel only briefly mentioned Daubert-related authority-not <em>Daubert </em>itself-near the end of the <em>in camera </em>hearing and testimony regarding Beley, and the District Court later expressed that it had not \u201cpick[ed] up\u201d a Daubert-related challenge to the statement validity assessment at that time. For purposes of our analysis, we need not further detail the sequence of events in the District Court or any confusion that may have arisen in these regards. Accordingly, we include facts below only as necessary to address Bomar\u2019s many arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b631 One of Bomar\u2019s Daubert-related contentions is that the District Court erred in failing to hold a pretrial <em>\u201cDaubert </em>hearing\u201d regarding Beley\u2019s methodology. Apparently relying on Daubert\u2019s language regarding a \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d made \u201cat the outset,\u201d Bomar asserts that any dispute as to the reliability or validity of such testimony must be resolved before trial. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592, 113 S. Ct. at 2796.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b632 Approximately one month before trial, Bomar requested a separate hearing on his previously-filed motions <em>in limine, </em>including the \u201cunqualified expert\u201d motion which cited to <em>Daubert. </em>The District Court responded it did not have time, and had assumed the motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>could be decided without an evidentiary hearing. Defense counsel replied \u201cI think you can do that, Your Honor[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b633 [3] A party waives the right to appeal an alleged error when the appealing party acquiesced in, actively participated in or did not object to the asserted error. <em>State v. Smith, </em>2005 MT 18, \u00b6 10,325 Mont. 374, \u00b6 10, 106 P.3d 553, \u00b6 10 (citations omitted). Here, defense counsel acquiesced in the District Court\u2019s assumption that it could decide the motions <em>in limine </em>without an evidentiary hearing, and raised no issue before or at the beginning of trial regarding the District Court\u2019s pretrial order reserving ruling on several expert testimony-related issues. We conclude Bomar waived his right to appeal any alleged error in the District Court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing and rule on the <em>Daubert </em>issue before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b634 Alternatively, Bomar challenges the District Court\u2019s later reasoning during trial that, although it had not \u201cpick[ed] up\u201d the Daubert-related challenge to the statement validity assessment when it ruled on Beley\u2019s testimony, her <em>in camera </em>testimony established the assessment \u201cwould pass muster\u201d under <em>Daubert. </em>Bomar does not, however, analyze whether or how Beley\u2019s <em>in camera </em>testimony regarding the assessment may have failed to satisfy <em>Daubert. </em>Thus, we need not address that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b635 Bomar\u2019s argument regarding the District Court\u2019s trial rulings is that the opinions of defense experts Zook and Scolatti established that Beley\u2019s statement validity assessment was not rehable or valid. Zook first testified regarding Beley\u2019s assessment during the defense\u2019s casein-chief, well after Beley\u2019s testimony was admitted, and Bomar submitted Scolatti\u2019s opinions with his motion for a new trial. Bomar advances no authority and presents no developed argument for the proposition that <em>Daubert </em>and its progeny require-or even authorize-a trial court to \u201creverse\u201d the admission of expert testimony based on opposing expert opinions provided after the fact. Moreover, as mentioned above, a party waives the right to appeal regarding an alleged error by a district court when the appealing party acquiesced in, actively participated in or did not object to the asserted error. <em>See Smith, </em>\u00b6 10. Because Bomar did not present Zook or Scolatti\u2019s opinions before Beley testified, we conclude he may not assert error in the District Court\u2019s failure to consider those opinions before admitting Beley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b636 Bomar also argues extensively that this Court\u2019s jurisprudence erroneously limits application of <em>Daubert </em>under Montana law to novel scientific evidence. We need not address this legal argument because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>as discussed above, Botnar\u2019s Daubert-related assertions fail insofar as they are predicated on Zook and Scolatti\u2019s late-submitted opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"Akj\">\u00b637 Next, Bomar asserts that, in light of <em>Daubert, </em>we should revisit <em>Scheffelman, </em>particularly its criteria for qualifying an expert under the \u201cMontana rule\u201d to testify about the credibility of a child who has allegedly been sexually abused. <em>See Scheffelman, </em>250 Mont. at 342,820 P.2d at 1298 (citation omitted). Bomar observes the 1989 law review article from which the <em>Scheffelman </em>criteria were derived predates <em>Daubert. </em>Essentially, his argument is that <em>Daubert, </em>as adopted by this Court, supersedes <em>Scheffelman. </em>While Bomar suggested in his motion for a new trial that this Court has been \u201cbacking away\u201d from the \u201cMontana rule\u201d regarding experts on child credibility, he did not argue in the District Court that <em>Daubert </em>has any bearing on <em>Scheffelman. </em>Accordingly, because the assertion is raised for the first time on appeal, we do not address it. <em>See e.g. Vaughn, </em>\u00b6 44 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AHq\">\u00b638 Alternatively, Bomar posits that Beley\u2019s <em>in camera </em>testimony did not meet the second <em>Scheffelman </em>criterion, which is thorough and up-to-date knowledge of professional literature on child sexual abuse. <em>See Scheffelman, </em>250 Mont. at 342,820 P.2d at 1298 (citation omitted). He points to Beley\u2019s statement that she was not familiar with any literature regarding the reliability of a statement validity assessment of notes taken by a third party, as opposed to an assessment of a child\u2019s recorded statements. Bomar contends no such literature exists, but advances no authority or developed argument for the proposition that an expert fails to meet the second <em>Scheffelman </em>criterion when he or she admits unfamiliarity with literature that allegedly does not exist. Thus, we decline to address this assertion further. <em>See Lewis, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"A6L\">\u00b639 Apparently in the alternative, Bomar also points to Zook and Scolatti\u2019s opinions that a statement validity assessment may never apply to a third party\u2019s account of a child\u2019s statement-opinions that appear to be based on interpretations of relevant literature. As with hisDawberi-related arguments, however, Bomar advances no authority or developed argument for the proposition that <em>Scheffelman </em>requires a trial court to \u201creverse\u201d the admission of expert testimony based on subsequently-provided expert opinions. We conclude Bomar has not established error regarding the second <em>Scheffelman </em>criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b640 Bomar also argues that Montana cases provide that child credibility evidence is admissible only in cases involving \u201cvery young children,\u201d and asserts K. J. was a competent 12-year-old witness whose credibility could be assessed without expert testimony. Bomar did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>make this argument in the District Court, however. We do not consider this issue, as it is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Vaughn, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"AtY\">\u00b641 Finally, some of Bomar\u2019s arguments on appeal apparently pertain to the District Court\u2019s reasoning regarding Beley\u2019s testimony in its order denying his motion for a new trial. Bomar does not clearly differentiate his \u201ctrial\u201d and \u201cpost-trial\u201d arguments, however. Nor does he set forth any assertion that would lead us to a different conclusion regarding the motion for a new trial than that we have reached in analyzing the District Court\u2019s pretrial and trial rulings. We conclude Bomar has not established error in the District Comb\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial with respect to Beley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b642 We hold the District Court did not err in admitting Beley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b643 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
