(collectively Kennedy) purchased property in Hamilton at 1013 South First Street on March 1, 2000. The property originally had been constructed as a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant and was zoned for commercial uses. The property bordered residentially zoned property to the west, unzoned property to the south and east, and commercially zoned property to the north. The Neighbors all resided, at some time during this litigation, on the residentially zoned property immediately to the west of Kennedy\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u00b66 Kennedy submitted Precise Plan of Design No. 2015 (the Plan) in April 2000 to the City. Kennedy proposed to modify the property for the commercial uses of a casino and lounge. The Hamilton City Zoning Board of Adjustment (Board) held a hearing regarding the Plan on April 25, 2000. White and Crotty attended. White raised concerns regarding the Plan, including car headlights shining into his windows. The Board considered White\u2019s comments, as well as other public comments, incorporated some of the comments into the Plan, and then adopted the Plan through Office of Community Development Resolution 20-14 (the Resolution). The Board included in the Resolution a condition stating that \u201c[t]he developer shall comply with all federal, state and local laws,\u201d (the Condition). The City subsequently issued Kennedy a temporary certificate of occupancy for the casino on January 1, 2001, followed by a permanent certificate of occupancy on April 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u00b67 Neighbors allege that Kennedy\u2019s casino became an unbearable nuisance immediately after it opened for business. Neighbors complained of loud music, loud patrons, revving car engines, fights, loud garbage dumping, and drug use, occurring on the Kennedy property at all hours of the night. Neighbors contend that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>disturbances unreasonably interfered with the use and enjoyment of their property. Neighbors claim that they complained about Kennedy\u2019s casino to various City officials, including the City Council, the Police Chief, and the Mayor. Neighbors allege, however, that they received no satisfactory resolution to their complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b68 Neighbors filed this lawsuit against the City and Kennedy in district court on March 6, 2003. Neighbors brought tort claims for compensatory damages against the City, alleging, among other things, that the Board had violated City ordinances when it approved the Plan, that various City officials had failed to take legal action against Kennedy, and that various City officials had failed to abate a nuisance at Kennedy\u2019s casino. Neighbors also sought compensatory and punitive damages against Kennedy for intentionally or recklessly maintaining a nuisance, and asked the court to enjoin Kennedy from creating or continuing the nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b69 The City filed a motion for summary judgment on May 30, 2003, with regard to all of Neighbors\u2019 claims against the City. The District Court held a hearing on August 13, 2003, and granted summary judgment on September 27,2005, in favor of the City on all claims. The City filed an unopposed motion asking the court to certify the summary judgment order as final pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). The District Court granted the motion and entered final judgment on October 27, 2005. The Neighbors timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b610 We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, using the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>GRB Farm v. Christman Ranch, Inc., </em>2005 MT 59, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 236, \u00b6 7, 108 P.3d 507, \u00b6 7. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 432, \u00b6 16, 92 P.3d 620, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b611 We address on appeal only those claims raised by Neighbors. Neighbors\u2019 separate action against Kennedy for compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief, remains pending in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>District Court. Nothing in our analysis here affects the validity of Neighbors\u2019 claims against Kennedy. Neighbors finally will be allowed to pursue these claims once we have resolved their appeal against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b612 Neighbors argue on appeal that the City breached two \u201cspecial duties.\u201d Neighbors first claim that the City, acting through the Board, breached a \u201cspecial duty\u201d to protect the Neighbors when it passed the Plan in violation of Hamilton City Ordinances. Neighbors also claim that the City, acting through various City officials, breached a \u201cspecial duty\u201d owed to Neighbors when it refused to abate the alleged nuisance. The District Court determined pursuant to the public duty doctrine that neither the City, nor its officials, owed any \u201cspecial duty\u2019 to Neighbors when passing the Plan or when deciding whether to take actions to abate the alleged nuisance. Neighbors admit the validity of the public duty doctrine, but argue that they fall within the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exception to that doctrine. The Neighbors assert no other basis for imposing a duty on the City on appeal other than through the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exception to the public duty doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b613 The Dissent labels the Court\u2019s characterization of Neighbors\u2019 position on appeal as \u201cpatently untrue.\u201d Second Dissent, \u00b6 70. In truth, however, a review of the Neighbors\u2019 briefs reveals that they raise four issues for review. In truth, nowhere in any of the four issues raised do the Neighbors challenge the validity of the public duty doctrine. Neighbors instead assert repeatedly that the District Court erred in not agreeing with their claims that a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d existed between the City and Neighbors. The Court normally confines its review to the issues actually presented on appeal. Regardless of what Neighbors may have argued in the District Court, we must confine our review to the issues actually raised by Neighbors on appeal. <em>See e.g. In re P.D.L., </em>2004 MT 346, \u00b6 14, 324 Mont. 327, \u00b6 14, 102 P.3d 1225, \u00b6 14. The Dissent nevertheless launches into an entirely gratuitous analysis of the public duty doctrine with respect to sovereign immunity. Second Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 72-75. Neighbors abandoned this argument on appeal and we need not address it. <em>See e.g. Skinner v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 323, \u00b6 9, 329 Mont. 511, \u00b6 9, 127 P.3d 359, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b614 In a similar vein, the Dissent, entirely on its own accord, attempts to convert Neighbors\u2019 tort claims against the City into an action for inverse condemnation. Second Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 76-97. We normally decline to engage in this type of back-seat lawyering and decline to do so now. <em>See e.g. Elliot v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, </em>2006 MT 267, \u00b6 15, 334 Mont. 195, \u00b6 15,146 P.3d 741, \u00b6 15. The Dissent insists that Neighbors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>alleged and pursued an inverse condemnation action. The Dissent contends in part that the City\u2019s approval of the Plan caused the Neighbors\u2019 property to depreciate in value. Second Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 92-97.</p>\n<p id=\"A3X\">\u00b615  Dissent\u2019s argument founders on several factors. First, appellant Prosser purchased her property in December of 2001, more than a year <em>after </em>the City had adopted the Resolution on April 25, 2000. \u201c[I]t is a general rule of the law of eminent domain that any award goes to the owner at the time of the taking, and that the right to compensation is not passed to a subsequent purchaser.\u201d <em>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, </em>533 U.S. 606, 628, 121 S. Ct. 2448, 2463 (2001). This Court specifically has stated that a party cannot complain regarding alleged diminution in value caused by a government action when she purchased the property after the government action. <em>Knight v. City of Billings, </em>197 Mont. 165, 176, 642 P.2d 141, 147 (1982); <em>see also Johns v. Black Hills Power, Inc., </em>722 N.W.2d 554, 558 (S.D. 2006) (applying subsequent purchaser doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b616  The second defect arises from the fact that appellants White and Crotty do not own their residence. They rent. Neighbors\u2019 complaint alleges damage to the value of their property or their real property, but it fails to specify whether White and Crotty are leaseholders in the property or merely tenants at will. White\u2019s and Crotty\u2019s landlord is not a party to this action. As a general rule, a court will award a single amount for each property taken by the government pursuant to an inverse condemnation and a lessee is barred as a matter of law from bringing an inverse condemnation action against the condemning authority for a separate valuation of and award for his leasehold interest. A lessee's remedy lies in instituting an action against the lessor. <em>Direct Mail Services, Inc. v. Best, </em>729 F.2d 672, 676 (10th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b617 Moreover, a split of authority exits regarding whether a tenant at will can recover damages in an inverse condemnation action. <em>See Nichols on Eminent Domain </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 5.02[6][i] (3d ed., Matthew Bender 2003) (\u201cTenants holding occupancy under conditions less secure than a lease or month to month tenancy generally have no interest to recover compensation for the taking of property.\u201d); 29A C. J.S. <em>Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 151 (2007) (\u201c[T]he fact that the lease can be terminated on short notice must be considered in determining the value of the tenant\u2019s interest.\u201d); 26 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 232 (2001) (\u201c[A] mere tenant at will ... is generally not entitled to compensation for the taking of his or her interest...\u201d). These factors further militate against the need to pursue unnecessarily the inverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>condemnation analysis undertaken by the Dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b618  The public duty doctrine provides that where a municipality owes a duty to the general public, that duty is not owed to any particular individual. <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 363, \u00b6 21, 983 P.2d 972, \u00b6 21. The public duty doctrine derives from the practical conclusion that a municipality would be mired hopelessly in civil lawsuits if it were held responsible for every infraction of the law. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 21. The public duty doctrine prevents individual members of the public from using tort liability to constrain unduly a municipality\u2019s discretion to use its limited resources to promote the general welfare. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b619  We have recognized, however, an exception to the public duty doctrine. A person maybe able to establish that the municipality owes that person a \u201cspecial duty\u201d that arises out of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the person and the municipality. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22. A person demonstrates a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d by establishing that (1) a particular statute was intended to protect a specific class of persons, of which plaintiff is a member, from a particular type of harm; (2) a government agent undertook specific action to protect the plaintiff or the plaintiffs property; (3) the plaintiff was reasonably induced to rely on government action; or (4) under certain circumstances, a third party in custody of the government caused harm to the plaintiff. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22. We have held that where the facts are undisputed the question of whether a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exists is a question of law. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b620 <em>Do Hamilton City Ordinances \u00a7 17.116.010 and \u00a7 17.116.050 impose a \u201cspecial </em>duty\u201d <em>on the City to protect residents in the vicinity of a proposed building modification?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u00b621 Neighbors argue first that Hamilton City Ordinances \u00a7 17.116.010 and \u00a7 17.116.050 imposed a \u201cspecial duty\u201d on the City when it approved the Plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">Section 17.116.010 Intent. Precise plan of design is established to provide for orderly development of property to insure compatibility to the surrounding existing and planned land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuA\">Section 17.116.050 Rejection or Approval. If the proposed precise plan of design would substantially depreciate property values in the vicinity or would unreasonably interfere with the use or enjoyment of property in the vicinity by the occupants thereof for lawful purposes or endanger the public peace, health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>safety or general welfare, such plan shall be rejected or shall be so modified or conditioned before adoption as to remove the objections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Neighbors assert that the City had a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Neighbors pursuant to the first exception to the public duty doctrine because they fall within the specific class of persons whom these ordinances are intended to protect from a particular type of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"A5tj\">\u00b622 We must, determine whether the legislative body that passed these ordinances intended them to benefit the general public, or, on the other hand, to protect a specific class of persons from a particular type of harm. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22. We interpret an ordinance by looking first to its plain language. <em>Small v. Board of Trustees, </em>2001 MT 181, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 199, \u00b6 21, 31 P.3d 358, \u00b6 21. We will not determine legislative intent based upon the wording of any particular section or sentence, however, but only from a consideration of the statute as a whole. <em>In re Marriage of McMichael, </em>2006 MT 237, \u00b6 14, 333 Mont. 517, \u00b6 14, 143 P.3d 439, \u00b6 14. We interpret an ordinance to give effect to its purpose and to avoid absurd results. <em>In re McMichael, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b623 The ordinances at issue in this case are part of Title 17 of the City of Hamilton Municipal Code of 1999 (Title 17). Title 17 is entitled \u201cZoning Ordinance of the City of Hamilton.\u201d Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7 17.04.010. Title 17 seeks to \u201cregulate and promote the orderly and harmonious development of the city and its environs ....\u201d Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7 17.04.020. Title 17 states that the \u201cregulations and restrictions established in this Title 17 have been made in accordance with a comprehensive master plan ....\u201d Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7 17.04.030. This master plan serves to (1) \u201cLessen congestion in the streets;\u201d (2) \u201cSecure safety from fire, panic and other dangers;\u201d (3) <em>\u201cPromote health and general welfaref </em>(4) \u201cProvide adequate light and air;\u201d (5) \u201cPrevent overcrowding of land;\u201d (6) \u201cAvoid undue concentration of population;\u201d and (7) \u201cFacilitate adequate provisions for transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks and <em>public requirements.\u201d </em>Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7 17.04.030 (emphasis added). These provisions indicate that the City intended Title 17 to benefit the general public, rather than a circumscribed class of persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b624 The Dissent implies some sort of sinister motive in noting the fact that the Court obtained the complete version of Title 17 of the Hamilton Municipal Code \u201cfrom the City of Hamilton in the course of writing the Opinion in this case.\u201d Second Dissent, \u00b6 62, fn.l. The Dissent presumably also would be troubled by the prospect of the Court obtaining a complete version of a statute contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Montana Code Annotated in the course of writing an opinion. We are at a loss to understand the Dissent\u2019s apparent concern with the Court obtaining a complete version of the legislative enactment that the parties seek it to interpret when the parties have failed to provide a complete version. Parties rarely, if ever, provide the Court with a complete version of a title to the Montana Code Annotated when they seek to have the Court interpret a section of that title. In fact, this situation occurs with such frequency that the Court provides complete sets of the entire Montana Code Annotated to each Justice on this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b625 Neighbors ignore the express purpose of Title 17 and focus instead on the mandatory language in \u00a7 17.116.050. They argue that the language in \u00a7 17.116.050 protects a specific class of persons from a particular type of harm. Neighbors point out that the language in \u00a7 17.116.050 identifies \u201coccupants\u201d of nearby property as the class of persons to be protected. Neighbors also point out that the ordinance identifies the \u201cuse or enjoyment\u201d of the property as the harm from which to protect the occupants. Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7 17.116.050.</p>\n<p id=\"Az9\">\u00b626 Section 17.116.050\u2019s requirement that the Board consider individual interests in particular land use decisions does not change the fact that Title 17\u2019s express purpose is to promote the general welfare. Section 17.116.050 provides for the procedure by which the City reviews proposed development plans in order to \u201cprovide for orderly development of property to insure compatibility to the surrounding existing and planned land uses.\u201d Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7 17.116.010. We construe \u00a7 17.116.050 as one of the procedures by which the City provides for \u201corderly development\u201d of property to promote the general welfare, not as an expression of the City\u2019s intent to protect anyone who lives in the vicinity of a permitted development from depreciation in property values or an \u201cunreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of their property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b627  Moreover, Neighbors\u2019 interpretation of the Precise Plan of Design ordinances would impose an overwhelming burden on the City with potentially adverse consequences. Almost any proposed land development could lead to depreciation in property values or an \u201cunreasonable interference\u201d with a neighbor\u2019s use or enjoyment of property. The City would be forced either to deny all but the most benign development plans or face innumerable lawsuits. We do not think that the legislative body that passed these Precise Plan of Design ordinances intended them to place such an undue constraint on the City\u2019s discretion to promote the general welfare. <em>In re McMichael, </em>\u00b6 14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>We conclude, as a matter of law, that Hamilton City Ordinances \u00a7 17.116.010 and \u00a7 17.116.050 do not create a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the City and the Neighbors. Thus, the City, pursuant to the public duty doctrine, had no \u201cspecial duty\u201d to protect the Neighbors from any harm that might result from the City\u2019s adoption of the Plan. \u00b628 The Dissents argue that the City intended Title 17 to benefit individual landowners rather than the general public in light of the fact that \u00a7 17.116.050 protects \u201ca specific class of persons from a particular type of harm.\u201d First Dissent, \u00b6 53; Second Dissent, \u00b6 63. We determine the intent of a statute, however, by reading the statute as a whole. <em>In re McMichael, </em>\u00b6 14. We will not defeat the express purpose of Hamilton\u2019s zoning regulation-to promote the general welfare-by focusing on a single procedure within Title 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b629 The Dissent implies that we often defeat governmental immunity by looking to a specific provision within a larger statute. The Dissent cites <em>State v. District Court, </em>246 Mont. 225, 805 P.2d 1272 (1990), and <em>Newville v. State, Dept. of Family Services, </em>267 Mont. 237, 883 P.2d 793 (1994), for the proposition that procedures within a statute should be construed as \u201ca promise by a governmental entity to a class of persons ensuring something.\u201d First Dissent, \u00b6 52. These cases address quasi-judicial immunity, however, not the public duty doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b630 We do not face here the question of whether the Board has quasi-judicial immunity over decisions made pursuant to \u00a7 17.116.050. Here we face the question of whether the City intended Title 17-as a whole-to benefit the public welfare, or, on the other hand, a circumscribed class of persons. The express language in Title 17 indicates that the City intended it to benefit the public as a whole, rather than a circumscribed class of persons. Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7\u00a7 17.04.020, 17.04.030. The Dissent\u2019s forced march through this Court\u2019s public duty doctrine precedent fails to identify any support for its proposition that the City of Hamilton intended Title 17 to benefit individual landowners to the detriment of the general welfare. Both Dissents fail to provide any support for burdening a City\u2019s land use decision-making process with innumerable lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b631 Other jurisdictions have refused to find that land use regulations create a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between property landowners and the government. <em>See e.g. Wolfe v. Bennett PS &amp; E, Inc., </em>974 P.2d 355, 359 (Wash. App. Div.

Stevens County, </em>759 P.2d 447, 450 (Wash. 1988) (holding that \u201cthe duty to issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>building permits and conduct inspections is to protect the health and safety of the general public.\u201d)); <em>Derwort v.

The employees had been concerned that ambient dust in the mine might contain asbestos. <em>Orr, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 46.

We held that the State had a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the employees under the third exception to the public duty doctrine because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>State\u2019s inspections had \u201crightfully led\u201d the employees to believe that it was safe for the miners to continue working in the mine. <em>Orr, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"AiR\">\u00b639 Neighbors, unlike the employees in <em>Orr, </em>do not allege that the City \u201crightfully led\u201d the Neighbors to start, stop, or continue taking any particular course of action. Neighbors instead focus on the City\u2019s course of conduct not to enforce the Condition. Neighbors fail to recognize that though the City\u2019s subsequent failure to abide by its alleged promise to enforce the Condition in the Resolution may be relevant to the question of whether the City breached a \u201cspecial duty,\u201d it has no relevance to the question of whether the City had a \u201cspecial duty\u2019 in the first place. <em>Orr, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">\u00b640 Moreover, Neighbors have contradicted their own claims that the City assured them of action by admitting in discovery that \u201c[n]ot once did we ever receive assurance or even a response, from the City, that our complaints and our suffering were priorities, or even problems they intended to solve some day.\u201d Neighbors respond that this discovery answer referred only to the City Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b641 Neighbors argue in the alternative that various City officials, other than the City Council, did give them specific assurances. For example, Neighbors allege that the City Attorney wrote a letter to Kennedy on December 12,2001, that warned Kennedy to \u201cimmediately reduce and regulate the loudness of the music and other noise emanating from your business.\u201d Neighbors point to two legal memoranda that the City Attorney forwarded to the City Administrator that \u201caddress[ed] some of the issues that have been raised regarding nuisance complaints by some of the area residents.\u201d Neighbors also cite to a handwritten note that the Mayor wrote to the Neighbors where the Mayor stated that he had reviewed a video of the disturbances at Kennedy\u2019s casino, and that the Mayor would notify the Neighbors if he needed to meet with them. Neighbors finally point to several entries in the Neighbors\u2019 \u201cdiary\u201d of the events in this case where they indicate they had meetings with various City officials. Neighbors fail to point to any language in these documents, however, where a City official expressly promised the Neighbors that that official would enforce any particular law or condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b642 We determine that the City has established that no genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to whether the City and the Neighbors had a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d pursuant to the public duty doctrine. We conclude as a matter of law that the City owed no \u201cspecial duty\u201d to the Neighbors, thus, we decline to address the Neighbors\u2019 remaining claims on breach, causation, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u00b643 We do not doubt or minimize the disruption to the lives of the Neighbors allegedly caused by Kennedy\u2019s operation of the casino. The videotapes contained in the record demonstrate repeated and continuous disruptions in the form of loud music, revving car engines, fights, and arguments into the wee hours of the morning. We hold only that the Neighbors must seek redress for these claimed injuries against Kennedy, whose operation of the casino has caused these alleged harms.

At the time of the incidents giving rise to this lawsuit, Prosser, White, and Crotty were indeed very close neighbors to the Kennedy property. Prosser\u2019s residence sat about thirty inches from the Kennedy property, and only fifteen feet from the casino itself. Crotty and White\u2019s residence sat fifteen feet from the Kennedy property, and about thirty feet from the casino. A wooden fence separated the Neighbors\u2019 properties from the Kennedy property. The Kennedy property was zoned as commercial property, as was the property to the north, which was used as a bank. The properties to the south and east of the Kennedy property were unzoned; however, at the time Kennedy submitted the Precise Plan of Development, the unzoned properties were used as residential properties. Neighbors\u2019 properties were zoned as residential property. When Kennedy submitted Precise Plan of Development No. 2015 to the City of Hamilton, zoning board staff mailed notices to all property owners and commercial tenants within 300 feet of the Kennedy property. The notice of proposed use was also published in the local paper and posted at the city hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u00b646 The majority dismisses the case under the public duty doctrine, but fails to discuss public duty doctrine cases. As stated above, a recognized exception to public duty doctrine immunity arises when a special relationship exists or is created between the victim and the governmental officer. <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, 321 Mont. 210, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, 90 P.3d 394, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. \u201c[A] special relationship gives rise to a special duty\u201d in any one of four circumstances, the first of which is \u201cby a statute intended to protect a specific class of persons from a particular type of harm.\u201d <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 42. In determining whether a special relationship is established pursuant to statute, this Court looks to the relevant statute. <em>See Orr v. State, </em>2004 MT 354, \u00b6 47, 324 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Mont. 391, \u00b6 47, 106 P.3d 100, \u00b6 <em>47 Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 <em>34-39;Eklund v.

Although the statutes did not specifically reference miners, miners were members of that specific class of persons. <em>Orr, </em>\u00b6 44. Thus, the State had a special duty to protect the health and safety of miners from known dangers in their workplace. <em>Orr, </em>\u00b6 47. This Court concluded that, because a special relationship existed between the State and the miners, the State was \u201cnot shielded by the application of the Public Duty Doctrine.\u201d <em>Orr, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b648 In <em>Massee, </em>the statutes at issue provided that law enforcement officers were to provide domestic violence victims with a notice of the availability of shelters and any legal rights and remedies such victims may have. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 34. These statutes were enacted to prevent serious injury or death as a result of domestic violence. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 43. The victim in <em>Massee </em>died as a result of domestic violence. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 43. Thus, the officer had a special duty to the deceased victim as a member of that protected class, and the public duty doctrine did not apply. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b649 Recently we determined that a statute requiring drivers of police vehicles to proceed with due regard for the safety of all persons created a special class of protected persons. In <em>Eklund, </em>a youth escaped from a detention center, stole a vehicle, and led law enforcement on a high speed chase. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-15. The chase continued into town where the youth lost control of his vehicle and struck Eklund. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 17. The statute mandated that officers, while driving in an emergency or high speed situation, still had a \u201cduty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons.\u201d <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 36 (quoting \u00a7 61-8-107, MCA (2003)). We held that the statute created a special class of persons encompassing those who, by use of streets and highways, are potential victims of high speed chases. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 39. Law enforcement owed a duty to drive with due regard to this class of persons, and thus, the public duty doctrine did not apply. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b650 Like the statutes giving rise to a duty to mine workers in <em>Orr, </em>the domestic violence victims in <em>Massee, </em>and people using the streets in <em>Eklund, </em>the ordinances in this case create a duty to a special class of persons. The ordinances at issue in this case, those providing that a precise plan of design must be submitted to the zoning board, are for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the purpose of \u201cinsuring] compatibility to the <em>surrounding existing </em>and planned uses.\u201d Hamilton Mun. Code (Mont.) \u00a7 17.116.010 (2003) (emphasis added). In cases where a proposed use would not be compatible to the surrounding existing uses, the ordinances instruct the zoning board as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">If the proposed plan of design would substantially depreciate property values <em>in the vicinity </em>or would unreasonably interfere with the use or enjoyment of property <em>in the vicinity by the occupants thereof </em>for lawful purposes ... such plan shall be rejected or shall be so modified or conditioned before adoption as to remove the objections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7 17.116.050 (emphasis added). These ordinances are clearly intended to protect occupants in the vicinity of the property that is the subject of the proposed plan of design from incompatible uses. Neighbors were occupants in the vicinity of the Kennedy property. The zoning board recognized this class of persons existed when it specifically mailed notice to every property owner and commercial tenant within 300 feet of the Kennedy property, in contrast to the posted and published notices provided to the general public. In enacting these ordinances, the City recognized that incompatible uses in the same vicinity could depreciate property values and interfere with the occupants\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property. Thus, the City had a duty to protect Neighbors from such harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b651 The ordinance then mandates that when plans are submitted that could result in the harm anticipated, the City must modify or reject the plan. Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7 17.116.050. Here, existing land use on three sides of the Kennedy property was residential. To the north, the land was commercial, but was currently used as a bank. A lounge is not like a bank that closes its doors in the early evening. It stays open into the early morning hours. Lounges often play music to entertain their patrons. Patrons consume alcohol in a lounge. Alcohol impairs judgment and is known to lead to fighting and other rowdy and loud behavior, which directly impacts the surrounding area. Given the high potential for incompatibility, the City owed a duty to Neighbors to modify or condition the plan to correct such conflicts or reject it entirely. The City contends that it fulfilled its duty by conditioning the plan, requiring the casino to limit all activities to the interior of the building. By imposing this condition, the zoning board foresaw the problems that inebriated, unruly patrons could cause in a residential area. However, this condition was clearly not enough to ameliorate the concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u00b652 The majority interprets the ordinance to be a mere \u201cprocedure\u201d for property development rather than an expression of the City\u2019s intent to protect residents who live in the vicinity. I submit that the procedure is designed to <em>ensure compatibility </em>to the <em>surrounding area. </em>Hamilton Mun. Code at \u00a7 17.116.010. Procedures created by statute are often, in essence, a promise by a governmental entity to a class of persons ensuring something. In <em>State v. District Court, </em>246 Mont. 225, 232, 805 P.2d 1272, 1277 (1990), we held that statutes required the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division to undertake a review process before granting an employer self-insured status. This process is designed to protect a specific class of persons (employees of such businesses) from a particular type of harm-that is, injury while working for an employer without the financial resources necessary to provide benefits. In <em>Newville v. State, Dept. of Family Services, </em>267 Mont. 237, 269, 883 P.2d 793, 812 (1994), we held that the Department of Family Services is required to license and train foster care providers and to investigate adoptive homes. This licensing process is designed to protect a specific class of persons (foster and adoptive children) from a particular type of harm-placement in an unsafe home. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-101, MCA. Although <em>State v. District Court </em>and <em>Newville </em>do not discuss the public duty doctrine, they provide examples where the government, without question, owed a duty to a specific class of persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b653 Like the above statutory schemes, the ordinance in question is designed to protect a specific class of persons, those in the vicinity, from a particular type of harm-that is, property devaluation and/or interference with enjoyment of use from incompatible uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b654 The cases the majority references for the purpose of demonstrating that other jurisdictions refuse to find that land use regulations create a special relationship between landowners and the government are distinguishable based on the statutes at issue. In <em>Wolfe, </em>the statute at issue was a regulation within the building code that provided that an application would expire if not acted upon within a certain number of days. <em>Wolfe v. Bennett PS &amp; E, Inc., </em>974 P.2d 355, 359 (Wash. App. 1999). It did not purport to protect a certain class of persons, nor did it specify any particular type of harm it was meant to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b655 In <em>Taylor, </em>the statute at issue stated that building permits would not be issued to \u201cany applicant or person who fails to provide sufficient evidence of compliance with all laws and regulations relating to the use of land and the construction or improvements of structures thereon.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Stevens County, </em>759 P.2d 447, 449 (Wash. 1988). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The statute does not specify a particular type of harm it is meant to prevent, or any specific class of persons it is meant to benefit. The plaintiffs in <em>Taylor </em>argued that the purpose of the code provisions was to \u201cpromote the health, safety and welfare <em>of the occupants or users of buildings and structures and the general public.\u201d Taylor, </em>759 P.2d at 450 (italics in original). The court in <em>Taylor </em>recognized the statute\u2019s broad purpose of protecting the public, and distinguished it from a more specific statute with the particular purpose of identifying \u201cconditions and circumstances [which] are dangerous and a menace to the health, safety, morals or welfare of <em>the occupants </em>of such buildings and of the public....\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>759 P.2d at 450 (italics in original) (citing <em>Halvorson v. Dahl, 574, </em>P.2d 1190, 1192-93 n.1 (Wash. 1978)). In the <em>Halvorson </em>case where the more specific statute was at issue, the court determined there was a clear intent to protect occupants of substandard housing despite the \u201ctraditional rule that a local government is under no duty, ascertainable in tort, to ensure compliance with its building code.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>759 P.2d at 450 (citing <em>Halvorson, </em>574 P.2d at 1192). The statute was \u201cenacted for the benefit of a specifically identified group of persons as well as, and in addition to, the general public.\u201d <em>Halvorson, </em>574 P.2d at 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b656 Finally, <em>in Derwort v. Polk County, </em>501 S.E.2d 379,381 (N.C. App. 1998), the subdivision planning statutes at issue referred only to the general welfare, to citizens, and to the public. The statutes did not contain language expressing an intent to protect a specific class from a specific type of harm. Similarly in <em>Myers v. Moore Engineering, Inc., </em>42 F.3d 452, 456 (8th Cir. 1994), the plaintiffs argued the city negligently issued a building permit, and that the public duty doctrine should not apply because a special relationship existed. The <em>Myers </em>plaintiffs, however, failed to point to any particular statute or code provision that would establish a special relationship. <em>Myers, </em>42 F.3d at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b657 These cases can be further distinguished because, other than in <em>Halvorson, </em>574 P.2d at 1192-93, the courts applied a different test to determine whether a special relationship existed. Rather than recognizing that statutes can give rise to a special relationship if they are designed to protect a special class of persons from a particular type of harm, the State of Washington stated that a special relationship is created when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">(1) there is direct contact or privity between the public official and the injured plaintiff which sets the latter apart from the general public, and (2) there are express assurances given by a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>official, which (3) gives rise to justifiable reliance on the part of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>Taylor, </em>759 P.2d at 451 (citations omitted); <em>Wolfe, </em>974 P.2d at 359 (citations omitted). North Carolina\u2019s and North Dakota\u2019s test for determining whether a special relationship is created is similar to Washington\u2019s and does not address the question of whether a special relationship is created by a specific statute. <em>Derwort, </em>501 S.E.2d at 382 (citations omitted); <em>Myers, </em>42 F.3d at 456-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b658 Like in <em>Halvorson, </em>the City of Hamilton, by including such specific language in the ordinances, expressed a clear intent to protect occupants in the vicinity of a proposed plan of development from a particular type of harm when the proposed plan is not compatible with the surrounding uses. This Court recognizes, where other jurisdictions have not, that statutes can create special relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b659 In the present case, given the specificity of the ordinance and the resulting special relationship between the City and those occupying the property in the vicinity of the proposed use, the public duty doctrine does not apply.

I write separately to address three additional facets of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">\u00b661 First, the fallacy of the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue One is apparent from its application of selected Hamilton City Ordinances to the exclusion of others. As Justice Leaphart ably demonstrates, \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050 are clearly intended to protect a specific class of persons \u2014 occupants in the vicinity of a proposed precise plan of design-from a particular type of harm-substantial property devaluation and/or unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of their properties. That the City intended to protect the Neighbors and their properties is evident not only from the plain language of these ordinances, but also from the fact that the zoning board mailed notices to all property owners and commercial tenants within 300 feet of the Kennedy property. On the facts presented here and the unambiguous language of \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050, the special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine clearly applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u00b662 To avoid what is plain on the face of \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010and 17.116.050, however, the Court goes outside the record in this case, citing \u00a7\u00a7 17.04.020 and 17.04.030 for the proposition that the general purpose of Title 17 of the Hamilton City Code is \u201cto promote the general welfare.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26. The Court goes so far as to criticize the Neighbors for focusing on the mandatory language of \u00a7 17.116.050. Opinion, \u00b6 25. Yet, nothing in our caselaw-and the Court cites no Montana authority to support its approach-requires us to look at the general purpose of a collection of statutes to the exclusion of the specific purpose of the particular statute(s) at issue. In <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, 321 Mont. 210, 90 P.3d 394, for instance, the statutes at issue were \u00a7\u00a7 46-6-311, -602, and -603, MCA. Rather than analyzing the purpose of Title 46 (which governs criminal procedure), we analyzed the purpose of these three particular statutes. <em>See Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-39, 43. Likewise, in <em>Eklund v. Trost, </em>2006 MT 333, 335 Mont. 112, 151 P.3d 870, we analyzed the purpose of the particular statute at issue, namely, \u00a7 61-8-107, MCA. <em>See Eklund, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35-39. We did not resort to the general purpose of Title 61 (which governs motor vehicles).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b663 In the case at hand, by contrast, the Court ignores the express purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050, resorting instead to the general purpose of Title 17. Yet, while a statutory scheme may serve a general purpose of promoting the general welfare, this does not mean that particular statutes contained within that scheme are not intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>to protect a specific class of persons from a particular type of harm. The Court\u2019s contrary approach is pure sophistry. Under the Court\u2019s reasoning, the public duty doctrine should have applied in both <em>Massee </em>and <em>Eklund, </em>since Titles 46 and 61, MCA, could reasonably be characterized as \u201cpromoting the general welfare.\u201d Indeed, the rather sweeping purpose of \u201cpromoting the general welfare\u201d could apply to just about every title in the Code. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that laws which protect specific classes of persons from particular types of harm do not ultimately promote the general welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b664 Again, there is no authority supporting the Court\u2019s fixation on the general purpose of Title 17 to the exclusion of the specific purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050. The Court states that \u201c[w]e interpret an ordinance by looking first to its plain language.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22. Yet, the Court completely ignores the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050, preferring instead to focus on select language in \u00a7\u00a7 17.04.020 and 17.04.030. The Court states that \u201c[w]e interpret an ordinance to give effect to its purpose and to avoid absurd results.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22. Yet, the Court completely ignores the express purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050, which is to protect occupants in the vicinity of a proposed precise plan of design from substantial property devaluation and/or unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of their properties. Moreover, in so doing, the Court reaches the absurd result that these two ordinances do not protect anyone. <em>See Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 363, \u00b6 21, 983 P.2d 972, \u00b6 21 (\u201c[A] duty owed to all is a duty owed to none.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b665 The Court also states that \u201c[w]e will not determine legislative intent based upon the wording of any particular section or sentence, however, but only from a consideration of <em>the statute </em>as a whole.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22 (emphasis added). Yet, again, the Court does not consider \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050 as a whole, or even at all. Rather, the Court purports to consider Title 17 as a whole and then selects two particular ordinances-\u00a7\u00a7 17.04.020 and 17.04.030-as controlling over all the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b666 Moreover, the Court ignores the well-established rule of construction that specific provisions prevail over general provisions. <em>See Oster v. Valley County, </em>2006 MT 180, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 76, \u00b6 17,140 P.3d 1079, \u00b6 17 (\u201c[M]ore specific statutes prevail over general provisions of law.\u201d); <em>Taylor v. Dept. of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks, </em>205 Mont. 85, 91, 666 P.2d 1228, 1231 (1983) (\u201cWe recognize the rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>statutory construction which provides that special statutes will prevail over general statutes.\u201d); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1-2-102, MCA (\u201c[A] particular intent ... controls] a general one that is inconsistent with it.\u201d). Here, \u00a7 17.116.010 states that the intent of the precise plan of design is \u201cto provide for orderly development of property to insure compatibility to <em>the surrounding existing </em>... <em>uses\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The specific language of \u00a7 17.116.050, states that a proposed precise plan of design \u201cshall\u201d be rejected, modified, or conditioned if such plan \u201cwould substantially depreciate property values <em>in the vicinity </em>or would unreasonably interfere with the use or enjoyment of property <em>in the vicinity by the occupants thereof </em>for lawful purposes\u201d (emphases added). The word \u201cshall\u201d is defined as \u201cmandatory.\u201d Hamilton City Ordinance \u00a7 17.04.040(B)(3). The import of these provisions-to protect occupants in the vicinity of a proposed precise plan of design from substantial property devaluation and/or unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of their properties-prevails over any general intent to promote the general welfare. <em>Oster, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Taylor, </em>205 Mont. at 91, 666 P.2d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b667 Furthermore, it is not necessarily true that the specific intent of protecting occupants in the vicinity of a proposed precise plan of design is inconsistent with the general intent of promoting the general welfare. The Court opines that these two goals cannot exist in harmony, i.e., that a benefit to individual landowners would be \u201cto the detriment of the general welfare.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 30. The Court conjectures that \u201cpotentially adverse consequences\u201d to the City, such as \u201cinnumerable lawsuits,\u201d would result under the Neighbors\u2019 interpretation of the ordinances. Opinion, \u00b6 27. However, there is nothing in the record to support the parade of horribles feared by the Court. Nor has the Court cited any legal authority for the proposition that the general welfare must suffer whenever a municipality owes a duty to protect occupants in the vicinity of a proposed plan of development from substantial property devaluation and/or unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of their properties. Indeed, it is equally-if not more-plausible that such a duty would <em>benefit </em>the general welfare, not be to its detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b668 In sum, the Court substitutes what it would have intended when enacting \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050 in place of the actual intent expressed by these ordinances. As support for its view, the Court erroneously elevates the broadly-stated, general purpose of \u201cpromoting the general welfare\u201d over \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050\u2019s specific purpose of protecting occupants in the vicinity of a proposed precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>plan of design from substantial property devaluation and/or unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of their properties. In so doing, the Court effectively renders the first special-relationship exception to the public duty doctrine <em>(see Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22) a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b669 For the reasons set forth above and in Justice Leaphart\u2019s dissent, I conclude that the special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine applies here and that the City owed the Neighbors a duty of care-though this will be small consolation to the Neighbors, who have been condemned by the City and its officials to endure the apparently unregulated hellish conditions created by Kennedy\u2019s Tavern &amp; Casino.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b670 Wholly aside from the special relationship exception, the public duty doctrine does not apply here for a second reason. The Court asserts that the Neighbors \u201cadmit the validity of the public duty doctrine.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 12. This is patently untrue. Nowhere in their briefs do the Neighbors \u201cadmit\u201d the validity of the public duty doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"AcV\">\u00b671 Asa matter of fact, in the course of this litigation, the Neighbors challenged the doctrine\u2019s constitutionality. At the hearing on the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Neighbors argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">Now, with respect to this well-repeated doctrine of the Public Duty Doctrine, in the State of Montana we have a constitutional provision which says that cities will be liable for suit for injury to person or property, except as may be specifically provided by law by a two-thirds vote of each house of the legislature. In other words, the liability of public entities, the state, county, cities and towns, and others, are governed by statute. Now, we have those statutes. The statutes are set forth in Title 7, which covers specifically local government, and it treats the subject of immunity in section MCA Section 7-1-4125, which merely repeats the constitutional provision in the record. In wording it says, \u201cAs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>provided in Article II, Section 18, of the Montana Constitution, a municipality has no immunity from suit for injury to a person or property, except as may be specifically provided by law by a two-thirds vote of each house of the legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">There have been enacted by law certain limitations on liability. Specifically, in Section 2-9-102, it set a-said, \u201cEvery governmental entity is subject to liability for its torts and those of its employees acting within the scope of their employment or duties whether arising out of a governmental or proprietary function except\u201d again, as provided by statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">Now, the City argues that the common law doctrine of Public Duty Doctrine applies. If it were to apply, it must be enacted by statute. There is no statute, and I beg of them to show me a statute which says that the common law doctrine of Public Duty Doctrine shall apply to municipalities in the State of Montana. No such statute exists. And that doctrine is a common law doctrine. It cannot apply. MCA 1-1-108 says, \u201cIn this state there is no common law in any case where the law is declared by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWZ\">As to liability of municipalities in this state, it is declared by statute. And specifically, the whole Title 7 sets forth the responsibilities and liabilities of municipalities. We therefore believe that this Court must rule, as a matter of law, that the Public Duty Doctrine does not apply to municipalities in the State of Montana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b672 The Neighbors\u2019 argument has merit, and it calls into doubt the premise underlying the whole of the Court\u2019s analysis, namely, that the public duty doctrine survived the enactment of Article II, Section 18 of the 1972 Montana Constitution. That provision states: \u201cThe state, counties, cities, towns, and all other local governmental entities shall have no immunity from suit for injury to a person or property, except as may be specifically provided by law by a 2/3 vote of each house of the legislature.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 18. Thus, governmental immunity from tort exists in this State only as provided by statutes enacted pursuant to a two-thirds vote of both houses. <em>See Whiting v. State, </em>248 Mont. 207, 221-22, 810 P.2d 1177, 1186 (1991). Moreover, any common law doctrine of governmental tort immunity is no longer available. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 18; \u00a7 1-1-108, MCA (\u201cIn this state there is no common law in any case where the law is declared by statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u00b673 As to the public duty doctrine vis-\u00e1-vis governmental immunity from tort, the District Court observed in its Opinion &amp; Order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-3\">\u201cThe public duty rule is not technically grounded in government immunity, though it achieves much the same results. Unlike immunity, which protects a municipality from liability for breach of an otherwise enforceable duty to the plaintiff, the public duty rule asks whether there was [any] enforceable duty to the plaintiff in the first place.\u201d [Quoting Eugene McQuillin, <em>The Law of Municipal Corporations </em>vol. 18, \u00a7 53.04.25, at 197-98 (3d ed., West 2003).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Indeed, at bottom, both governmental tort immunity and the public duty doctrine preclude a plaintiff from obtaining just compensation for injuries perpetrated by a negligent governmental actor. Yet, the public duty doctrine has not been codified in this State by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature. Rather, the doctrine is a nineteenth-century holdover from the common law-a judicially-created shield insulating governmental entities from liability for negligence and misfeasance. <em>See generally Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-85 (Nelson, J., specially concurring and dissenting). Thus, by effectively providing governmental immunity from tort in the absence of an explicit legislative grant of such immunity, the doctrine serves as an end-around the fundamental right of individuals to sue local governmental entities for injury to person or property-a right that is supposed to be subject to only one exception: laws enacted by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b674 The delegates to the 1972 Constitutional Convention unequivocally rej ected governmental tort immunity. As reported by the Bill of Rights Committee, the notion of barring tort suits against the State for negligent acts by its officials and employees is \u201crepugnant to the fundamental premise of the [sic] American justice: all parties should receive fair and just redress whether the injuring party is a private citizen or a governmental agency.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Comments on the Bill of Rights Committee Proposal, February 22, 1972, p. 637. During the deliberations on the proposed language of Article II, Section 18, Delegate Wade J. Dahood, Chairman of the Bill of Rights Committee, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">We have an opportunity now, as long as in Montana no one else will accept it, to make sure that we have full redress and full justice for all of our citizens. So that way, we reduce public dissatisfaction with the administration of justice and make sure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>that every citizen of Montana has the full right to which he\u2019s entitled. We submit it\u2019s an inalienable right to have remedy when someone injures you through negligence and through a wrongdoing, regardless of whether he has the status of a governmental servant or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 8, 1972, p. 1764.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b675 The public duty doctrine frustrates the will of the people as expressed in Article II, Section 18, and this Court errs in perpetuating the doctrine\u2019s existence 36 years after the adoption of the Constitution. It is long past time that we consign this antiquated doctrine to the dustbin of history, where it belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b676 Lastly, the Neighbors\u2019 allegations and arguments raise the question of whether the City\u2019s acts and omissions with respect to the Neighbors\u2019 properties amount to inverse condemnation-a claim that the City cannot avoid by invoking the public duty doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANZ\">\u00b677 The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \u201cprivate property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d This guarantee \u201cwas designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S. Ct. 1563, 1569 (1960). Thus, for example, it is well-settled that the application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking if the law denies the owner all productive or economically beneficial use of the property or excessively interferes with the owner\u2019s distinct investment-backed expectations. <em>See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003,112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992); <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. City of New York, </em>438 U.S. 104, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978). No precise formula determines when property has been taken (in the constitutional sense); the question necessarily requires a weighing of the private and public interests at issue. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>Agins v. City of Tiburon, </em>447 U.S. 255, 260-61, 100 S. Ct. 2138, 2141 (1980), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em>544 U.S. 528, 540-45, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 2082-85 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">\u00b678 In addition, Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution states, in pertinent part: \u201cPrivate property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation to the full extent of the loss having been first made to or paid into court for the owner.\u201d By its plain language, this provision affords Montanans a protection that is independent of the Fifth Amendment. If the City, by its acts or omissions, has \u201ctaken or damaged\u201d the Neighbors\u2019 private property as contemplated by Article II, Section 29, then as a matter of fundamental constitutional right, the City must pay just compensation to the full extent of the Neighbors\u2019 loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b679 \u201cTakings cases do not always arise out of situations where the government has formally condemned property. Instead, some regulatory or other activities may effect a taking, necessitating that owners bring inverse condemnation proceedings against the government.\u201d Julius L. Sackman, <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain </em>vol. 2A, \u00a7 6.03[1], at 6-182 (3d ed., Matthew Bender 2006). \u201cInverse condemnation\u201d is \u201ca generic description applicable to all actions in which a property owner, in the absence of a formal condemnation proceeding, seeks to recover from a governmental entity for the appropriation of his property interest.\u201d <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 6.03[2], at 6-182.1; <em>see also United States v. Clarke, </em>445 U.S. 253, 257, 100 S. Ct. 1127, 1130 (1980) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018inverse condemnation\u2019 appears to be one that was coined simply as a shorthand description of the manner in which a landowner recovers just compensation for a taking of his property when condemnation proceedings have not been instituted.\u201d). \u201cSuch a suit is \u2018inverse\u2019 because it is brought by the affected owner, not by the condemnor. The owner\u2019s right to bring such a suit derives from the self-executing character of the constitutional provision with respect to condemnation.\u201d <em>Kirby Forest Industries, Inc. v.

They had purchased their properties in the years between 1954 and 1976. In 1975, a large shopping center (Rimrock Mall) was opened on 24th Street West south of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties. By the time of the litigation, there were also two large discount stores, a supermarket, a hardware store, a mini-mall, two convenience stores, and several office buildings along 24th Street West, and another supermarket was under construction near the plaintiffs\u2019 properties. In addition, the street provided access to an interstate highway from the city proper. <em>See Knight-Billings, </em>197 Mont. at 166-67,642 P.2d at 141-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b682 Until 1972, 24th Street West was a two lane roadway with on-street parking. In 1972, the City of Billings widened 24th Street West to provide four lanes of traffic. In 1976, the city further widened 24th Street West by condemning real property exclusively on the east side of the street. No real property was taken from the west side of the street, where the plaintiffs had their properties. In 1978, the street was widened by the addition of a fifth lane situated in the middle of the other four lanes, to provide for left-hand turns from 24th Street West. Traffic counts on 24th Street West indicated an average daily vehicular traffic flow of 6,330 vehicles in April 1966; 9,684 vehicles in August 1970; 17,040 vehicles in July 1975; and 18,018 vehicles in 1979. <em>See Knight-Billings, </em>197 Mont. at 167-68, 642 P.2d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b683 Meanwhile, in 1972, the City of Billings adopted a zoning ordinance, pursuant to which the plaintiffs\u2019 properties were zoned as single-family dwellings. In 1978, the plaintiffs petitioned the Billings City Council for a zoning change that would permit their properties to be reclassified as residential professional; however, the proposed zoning change was denied, and in consequence, the plaintiffs\u2019 properties remained zoned for residential purposes only. Also in 1978, the city created a lighting maintenance district to provide lighting for 24th Street West. The lights used were of a higher intensity than normally found on a residential street. Although several of the plaintiffs protested the proposal for the lighting district, their protest was denied. <em>See Knight-Billings, </em>197 Mont. at 167-68, 642 P.2d at 142-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u00b684 After the failure of their petition for a zoning change, the plaintiffs filed an action against the City of Billings charging inverse condemnation of their properties. The evidence at trial revealed the following changes to 24th Street West and the plaintiffs\u2019 properties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6_\">Formerly [24th Street West] was relatively quiet, and had but two traffic lanes. The front yards of the residences were suitable for family or social gatherings. Residents or their guests could park their cars on the street. There was no difficulty getting in and out of driveways. Sidewalks were safe from passing traffic. Noise and pollutant levels were low and not distracting or harmful. There was no undue refuse. Family pets were safe. There was no noticeable vibration from passing traffic and the area was quiet at night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">After the 1976-78 condemnation project on 24th Street West was completed, conditions changed. There is now no free access into driveways, but instead long waits in the fifth lane for passing traffic. Free access to and from the driveways is nearly impossible. There have been traffic accidents in front of the residential properties, and sometimes upon their properties. Children and pets are not safe in the front yards and pedestrian traffic along the sidewalks a few feet from passing vehicular traffic is dangerous. Average traffic flows at 22 miles per hour past their houses. Rocks and rubbish from passing traffic are thrown upon their lawns and into their houses. The sidewalks are constantly filthy, especially in winter. The noise from the passing traffic is so loud that front doors must be closed for conversation to be heard inside. Traffic noise is loud and aggravating at night. The houses cannot be ventilated from the east side because of dust and exhaust fumes. The houses and contents are constantly subject to vibrations. One of the residents testified that she had to tape her windows to avoid the bright light from the high intensity sodium vapor lighting that was installed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4m\"><em>Knight-Billings, </em>197 Mont. at 168-69, 642 P.2d at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b685 The district court found that by reason of the changed conditions on 24th Street West, the plaintiffs\u2019 properties were \u201c \u2018no longer desirable for residential use\u2019 \u201d and could not \u201c \u201cbe put to the highest and best use without a change in zoning restrictions and regulations.\u2019 \u201d However, the court also found that \u201cthe conditions on 24th Street West were not caused by the City but by persons using business establishments situated on 24th Street West\u201d and that \u201cthe actions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the City of Billings were within the proper exercise of the City\u2019s police power.\u201d <em>See Knight-Billings, </em>197 Mont. at 170, 642 P.2d at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b686 On appeal, we addressed the city s contention that its actions were merely in response to the burgeoning development of commercial and other enterprises along 24th Street West, i.e., that the city had not created the business growth but merely adapted to it.

To the contrary, recovery may be allowed under theories of easement or nuisance imposed on the plaintiffs\u2019 properties. <em>See Knight-Billings, </em>197 Mont. at 170-71, 642 P.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b687 We also rejected the notion that an actual physical invasion of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties by the city had to occur. We concluded that the result of the city\u2019s actions had been \u201cto impose a servitude, a limitation upon the use and marketability of plaintiffs\u2019 properties as residential.\u201d We noted that what remained \u201cis that plaintiffs\u2019 properties, through the actions of the City, have become unsuitable for residential use, and the plaintiffs\u2019 right to use their properties [for residential purposes] is limited to a degree of constitutional magnitude.\u201d <em>See Knight-Billings, </em>197 Mont. at 172-73, 174-75, 642 P.2d at 144-45, 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b688 Finally, we observed that in the 1976-78 widening of 24th Street West, the city had compensated the homeowners on the east side of the street but not the homeowners on the west side of the street. Thus, the plaintiffs had been \u201cconsciously singled out or selected to bear a burden which [the city] also consciously elected not to impose on others, even others otherwise similarly situated.\u201d <em>Knight-Billings, </em>197 Mont. at 173-74, 642 P.2d at 145 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We held that on these facts, the city had \u201cinterfered with the private property interests of the plaintiff so as to constitute a\u2018taking\u2019by inverse condemnation.\u201d <em>Knight-Billings, </em>197 Mont. at 174, 642 P.2d at 145-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b689 In <em>Knight-Missoula, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that their property had been damaged by noise, dust, fumes, runoff, and increased traffic from a nearby dirt road and the City of Missoula\u2019s refusal to close or maintain the road. <em>Knight-Missoula, </em>252 Mont. at 240, 827 P.2d at 1275. We reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the city, ruling that the plaintiffs\u2019 inverse condemnation claim was viable. <em>Knight-Missoula, 252 </em>Mont. at 243, 827 P.2d at 1277. We held that the plaintiffs had raised genuine issues of material fact regarding diminution in the value of their property by reason of the existence and use of the road and the City of Missoula\u2019s refusal to close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>or maintain it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Knight-Missoula, </em>252 Mont. at 240, 243, 827 P.2d at 1275, 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b690 Other courts have likewise recognized that inverse condemnation occurs when a continuing nuisance ripens into a constitutional taking. <em>See e.g. City of Jacksonville v. Schumann, </em>167 So.2d 95, 102 (Fla.App. 1964); <em>see also </em>Carlos A. Ball, <em>The Curious Intersection of Nuisance and Takings Law, </em>86 B.U. L. Rev. 819 (2006) (exploring the issue of when a nuisance ripens into a constitutional taking and arguing, for purposes of nuisance/takings cases, in favor of the \u201cpeculiar and substantial\u201d standard articulated in <em>Richards v. Washington Terminal Co., </em>233 U.S. 546, 557, 34 S. Ct. 654, 658 (1914)).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b691 Here, the Neighbors alleged in their complaint that the manner in which Kennedy\u2019s Tavern &amp; Casino is operated constitutes a continuing nuisance. The Neighbors also alleged that despite numerous complaints, 911 calls, and requests for relief to City officials, and despite attending and voicing complaints at many City Council meetings, the City and its various officials failed and refused to take appropriate action to abate the nuisances caused by the manner in which the Casino is operated. Plaintiff Prosser contended that as a result, the value of her property has been diminished. (Plaintiffs White and Crotty rent their property.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b692 Likewise, in her answers to the City\u2019s First Interrogatories, Prosser stated that the value of her property has been depreciated due to the City\u2019s ongoing failure and refusal to enforce the condition, placed on Kennedy\u2019s Precise Plan of Design (\u201cPPD\u201d), that the Casino \u201cshall comply with all federal, state and local laws.\u201d She provides, under oath, specific examples to this effect, and she requests $80,000 in damages \u201cfor loss of sale and inability to sell my home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b693 In the Neighbors\u2019 brief in opposition to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Prosser argued diminution in value of her property by reason of the City\u2019s failure and refusal to enforce the PPD condition and abate the nuisances created by the Casino. Again on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>appeal, the Neighbors assert that Prosser suffered depreciation of property value. They argue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">Because of the noise and interference with the use and enjoyment of her property due to the nuisances caused by the Casino by being in such close proximity to her property, Occupant Prosser placed her property on the market and tried to sell it but was unable to find a buyer. She and the realtor involved attributed the failure to sell or find a buyer to the existence of the Casino immediately next to her home. [Citations to her affidavit and her answers to the City\u2019s interrogatories.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">By approval of the operation of the Casino by these Defendants in a primarily residential area without assuring compatibility with the surrounding uses which are primarily as residential single family residences, the City promoted and facilitated the Casino\u2019s ability to create private and public nuisances in the vicinity by noise and other activities of the Casino and its patrons in such close proximity to Occupants\u2019 residences late at night and over an extended period of time causing depreciation of property values in the vicinity and causing unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the property of Occupants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b694 The City has never denied that such depreciation could occur. Indeed, recognition of this eventuality is set forth plainly in the language of \u00a7 17.116.050, which states: \u201cIf the proposed precise plan of design would <em>substantially depreciate property values in the </em>vicinity..., such plan shall be rejected or shall be so modified or conditioned before adoption as to remove the objections\u201d (emphasis added). Notwithstanding, as argued by the Neighbors, the City has promoted and facilitated the creation and continuation of a nuisance by Kennedy\u2019s Tavern &amp; Casino, which in turn has resulted in depreciation of property values in the vicinity, Prosser\u2019s abutting property in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b695 As noted above, private property may only be taken or damaged for \u201cpublic use.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 29. In <em>Kelo v. City of New London, </em>545 U.S. 469, 125 S. Ct. 2655 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed a broad definition of\u201cpublic use\u201d under the Fifth Amendment-specifically, \u201cpublic purpose,\u201d as opposed to \u201cuse by the public.\u201d <em>See Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 478-83, 125 S. Ct. at 2662-64. The Supreme Court held that the City of New London\u2019s economic development plan met this broad definition, since the plan (which coordinated a variety of commercial, residential, and recreational uses of land) was designed to promote economic development and provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>appreciable benefits to the community, including new jobs and increased tax revenue. <em>See Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 483-84,125 S. Ct. at 2664-65. <em>See also </em>Julius L. Sackman, <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain </em>vol. 2A, \u00a7 7.02[2], at 7-28, \u00a7 7.02[3], at 7-32, \u00a7 7.02[7], at 7-40 (3d ed., Matthew Bender 2006) (noting that the broad meaning of \u201cpublic use\u201d-e.g., revitalizing the local economy by creating temporary and permanent jobs, or generating a significant increase in tax revenue-has prevailed over the narrow conception of \u201cpublic use\u201d-i.e., actual use of the acquired property by the public).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b696 Likewise, in <em>Rutherford v. City of Great Falls, </em>107 Mont. 512, 86 P.2d 656 (1939), this Court considered whether the legislation at issue served a \u201cpublic purpose,\u201d quoting with approval the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201cA public purpose * * * has for its objective the promotion of the general welfare of all the inhabitants or residents within a given political division, as, for example, a state, the sovereignty and sovereign powers of which are exercised to promote the public health, safety, morals, general welfare, security, prosperity, contentment, and equality before the law of all the citizens of the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\"><em>Rutherford, </em>107 Mont. at 517, 86 P.2d at 658 (asterisks in original) (quoting <em>Green v. Frazier, </em>176 N.W. 11, 17 (N.D. 1920)). In addition, we observed in <em>City of Missoula v. Mountain Water Co., </em>228 Mont. 404, 743 P.2d 590 (1987), that \u00a7 70-30-102, MCA, provides a \u201cbroad interpretation\u201d of \u201cpublic use.\u201d <em>See Mountain Water, </em>228 Mont. at 412, 743 P.2d at 595. Indeed, \u00a7 70-30-102, MCA, enumerates a wide range of public uses. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7 70-30-102(1)-(45), MCA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKc\">\u00b697 I make no attempt here to determine whether the depreciation of property values in the vicinity of Kennedy\u2019s Tavern &amp; Casino, which the Neighbors allege has been promoted and facilitated by the City, serves a public purpose. I am satisfied that the Neighbors\u2019 allegations in this regard and the evidence presented thus far are sufficient to survive summary judgment. The Neighbors have established that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the City has taken or damaged Prosser\u2019s property for public use-perhaps \u201cto promote the general welfare,\u201d as the Court endlessly asserts, or to promote economic development, as <em>Kelo </em>authorizes-by failing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>refusing to take appropriate action to abate the nuisances caused by the manner in which the Casino is operated. To the extent that the City has taken or damaged Prosser\u2019s property, she is entitled to just compensation to the full extent of her loss under Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b698 The Court launches into its own \u201centirely gratuitous analysis\u201d of these issues in \u00b6\u00b6 15-17 of the Opinion. In \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, the Court addresses whether Plaintiffs White and Crotty, given that they rent their property, are entitled to compensation under an inverse condemnation theory. It does not appear from the record, however, that White and Crotty are seeking recovery for a taking or damaging. In \u00b6 15, the Court apparently reaches the merits of Prosser\u2019s inverse condemnation claim, asserting that she cannot recover damages because she purchased her property \u201cafter the government action,\u201d which the Court assumes was the approval of Kennedy\u2019s PPD in April 2000. However, Prosser has alleged that the depreciation in the value of her property is the result of a series of events-including, the City\u2019s failure and refusal to enforce the condition, placed on the PPD, that the Casino \u201cshall comply with all federal, state and local laws\u201d and the City\u2019s corresponding promotion and facilitation of the ongoingnuisance created by the Casino. <em>Cf. Blasdel v. Montana Power Co., </em>196 Mont. 417, 425, 640 P.2d 889, 894 (1982) (\u201c \u2018Property is taken in the constitutional sense when inroads are made upon an owner\u2019s use of it to an extent that, as between private parties, a servitude has been acquired either by agreement or in course of time.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Dickinson, </em>331 U.S. 745, 748, 67 S. Ct. 1382, 1385 (1947))); <em>Hart v. City of Detroit, </em>331 N.W.2d 438, 445 (Mich. 1982) (\u201cIt is common for [an inverse condemnation action] to involve a continuous wrong by the condemnor rather than a single act.\u201d). The record is replete with allegations that the City\u2019s acts and omissions have occurred during the course of Prosser\u2019s ownership of her property. Moreover, there exists a factual issue as to whether Prosser\u2019s property value has depreciated during her period of ownership as a result of the City\u2019s conduct. I submit that it is inappropriate for this Court to decide, as a matter of law, that any and all depreciation in Prosser\u2019s property value occurred <em>prior </em>to the governmental actions at issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u00b699 Lastly, the Court misstates my position. I do not contend that the City\u2019s approval of Kennedy\u2019s PPD \u201ccaused\u201d the Neighbors\u2019 property to depreciate in value. Opinion, \u00b6 14. Rather, I simply observe that Prosser has so alleged. Obviously, this is a factual matter properly resolved at trial. In my view, she should be permitted to litigate the merits of her inverse condemnation claim-including whether the City\u2019s actions amount to a taking or damaging for public use, whether the City\u2019s actions \u201ccaused\u201d Prosser\u2019s property to depreciate in value, and whether such depreciation occurred during her ownership of the property. The Court errs in denying her this opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b6100 The Court errs in concluding that the special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine does not apply on the facts of this case, and I join Justice Leaphart\u2019s Dissent as to this issue. Furthermore, the Court errs in perpetuating the public duty doctrine in the face of Article II, Section 18. Finally, the Neighbors have established that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the City has taken or damaged Prosser\u2019s property for public use for which it owes her just compensation to the full extent of her loss, as required by Article II, Section 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b6101 I would reverse and remand this case for further proceedings on the Neighbors\u2019 tort claims and Prosser\u2019s inverse condemnation claim. I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-5\"> Neither the Neighbors nor the City cites \u00a7 17.04.020 or \u00a7 17.04.030. Indeed, neither of these ordinances is part of the record before this Court. Rather, the Court obtained copies of these provisions from the City of Hamilton in the course of writing the Opinion in this case. I do not suggest that the Court had \u201csome sort of sinister motive\u201d in doing so. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 24. I am simply pointing out that rather than interpret the actual ordinances that the parties have asked us to interpret, the Court instead has obtained copies of ordinances that the parties did <em>not </em>ask us to interpret and then interpreted those. The Court justifies these actions on the ground that \u201c[pjarties rarely, if ever, provide the Court with a complete version of a title to the Montana Code Annotated when they seek to have the Court interpret a section of that title.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 24. But that is precisely my point: The parties here sought to have this Court interpret two sections of Title 17; thus, there was no need for them to provide or for us to obtain a complete version of Title 17. The Court never explains why, under these circumstances, it was necessary to obtain a complete version of Title 17. Nor does the Court explain why, when the parties here sought to have this Corut interpret \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050, the Court instead decided to interpret \u00a7\u00a7 17.04.020 and 17.04.030. As for the Court\u2019s suggestion that it is appropriate to \u201cobtainf] a complete version of the legislative enactment that the parties seek it to interpret when the parties have failed to provide a complete version,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 24,1 do not dispute this point. But again, the parties here have provided \u201ca complete version\u201d of the legislative enactments that they seek us to interpret-namely, \u00a7\u00a7 17.116.010 and 17.116.050. They have not asked us to interpret the entirety of Title 17; thus, there was no need for them to provide it or for the Court to obtain it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\"> As alleged by the Neighbors, those conditions include the following: the Casino\u2019s remaining open past 2:00 a.m.; excessively loud music late at night; excessive noise when dumping bottles and refuse in the early morning hours between 4:30 and 6:00 a.m.; creation of a possible fire hazard to the Neighbors\u2019 homes by stacking cardboard boxes next to the wooden fence separating the Neighbors\u2019 properties from the Casino property; patrons yelling and talking loudly and using vulgar and profane language in the Casino\u2019s parking lot late at night; quarreling and fighting in the parking lot; use of drugs and consumption of alcoholic beverages and food outside the Casino; revving and excessive idling of vehicle engines in the parking lot; and patrons urinating in the Neighbors\u2019 yards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\"><em> </em>The Court asserts that I am engaging in \u201cback-seat lawyering\u201d and attempting to \u201cconvert\u201d the Neighbors\u2019 tort claims against the City into an action for inverse condemnation.
