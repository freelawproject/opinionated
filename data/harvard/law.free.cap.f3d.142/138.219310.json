Deane from an order of the district court granting summary judgment to her former employer, Pocono Medical Center (\u201cPMC\u201d), on De-ane\u2019s claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 <em>et seq. </em>In enacting the ADA, Congress intended that the scope of the Act would extend not only to those who are actually disabled, but also to individuals wrongly regarded by employers as being disabled. Deane, a registered nurse, sued PMC under the ADA as such a \u201cregarded as\u201d plaintiff to redress PMC\u2019s failure to accommodate her in a manner that would enable her to retain her position following a work-related injury that affected her ability to do heavy lifting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case came before the <em>en banc </em>court to settle the question that divided the original panel \u2014 whether \u201cregarded as\u201d plaintiffs, in order to be considered qualified under the ADA, must show that they are able to perform <em>all </em>of the functions of the relevant position or just the <em>essential </em>functions, with or without accommodation. The panel decided that they must be able to perform <em>all </em>of the functions. Before the <em>en banc </em>court, neither party supported that position, and we now reject it, concluding that the plain language of the ADA requires proof only of a plaintiff \u2018s ability to perform a position\u2019s essential functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">This conclusion forces us to determine whether Deane has adduced sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to two elements of her <em>prima facie </em>case: (1) whether PMC misper-ceived Deane as being disabled; and (2) whether Deane is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d, a decision that turns on whether lifting is an essential function of nursing at PMC. Because we conclude that Deane has adduced sufficient evidence regarding both of these matters, we hold that summary judgment was inappropriate. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">The panel addressed a second question of much greater difficulty \u2014 whether \u201cregarded as\u201d plaintiffs must be accommodated by their employers within the meaning of the ADA. It may well be, as two members of the panel concluded, that after the employer is disabused of its improper perception of the individual\u2019s disability, there is no reason to afford the individual any special treatment, and hence the employee is not statutorily entitled to accommodation from the employer. However, as resolution of that issue is not neees-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>sary to final disposition of this appeal, we will not decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In April 1990, PMC hired Deane as a registered nurse to work primarily on the medical/surgical floor. On June 22, 1991, while lifting a resistant patient, she sustained a cartilage tear in her right wrist causing her to miss approximately one year of work. In June 1992, Deane and Barbara Manges, a nurse assigned to Deane\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation case, telephoned PMC and advised Charlene McCool, PMC\u2019s Benefits Coordinator, that Deane intended to return to work with certain restrictions. According to De-ane, she informed McCool that she was unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds or perform repetitive manual tasks such as typing, but that her physician, Dr. Osterman, had released her to return to \u201clight duty\u201d work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Deane further explained to McCool that, if she could not be accommodated in a light duty position on the medical/surgical floor, she was willing to move to another area of the hospital, as long as she could remain in nursing. Unfortunately, this telephone call was PMC\u2019s only meaningful interaction with Deane during which it could have assessed the severity of or possible accommodation for her injuries. PMC never requested additional information from Deane or her physicians, and, according to Deane, when she subsequently attempted to contact PMC on several occasions, she was treated rudely by McCool and told not to call again.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">After speaking with Deane and Manges, McCool advised Barbara Hann, PMC\u2019s Vice President of Human Resources, of Deane\u2019s request to return to work, of her attendant work restrictions, and of her stated need for accommodation. Shortly after considering the information conveyed by McCool and after comparing it to the job description of a medical/surgical nurse at PMC, Hann determined that Deane was unable to return to her previous position. Hann then asked Carol Clarke, PMC\u2019s Vice President of Nursing, and Susan Stine, PMC\u2019s Director of Nursing Resources/Patient Care Services, to review Deane\u2019s request to return to PMC and to explore possible accommodations for her. Both Clarke and Stine concluded that Deane could not be accommodated in her previous job as a nurse on the medical/surgical floor or in any other available position at the hospital. Finally, Hann asked Marie Werk-heiser, PMC\u2019s Nurse Recruiter, whether there were any current or prospective job openings for registered nurses at PMC. According to Werkheiser, there were no such openings at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">As a result of the collective determination that Deane could not be accommodated in her previous job or in any other available position in the hospital, PMC sent Deane an \u201cexit interview\u201d form on August 7,1992. On August 10, 1992, Hann notified Deane by telephone that she could not return to work because of her \u201chandicap\u201d, and this litigation ensued. In March 1993, Deane accepted a registered nurse position at a non-acute care facility, where she remained until May 1993. Deane has been employed by a different non-acute care facility since July 1993. Neither of these positions require heavy lifting, bathing patients, or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Deane argued to the district court that she was both actually disabled as a result of her injury and that she was perceived to be so by PMC. On summary judgment, the court rejected both theories and held that Deane was neither disabled nor regarded by her employer as being disabled and that, even if she were, she failed to meet the statutory definition of a qualified individual with a disability. Deane has not appealed the district court\u2019s determination that she was not actually disabled. Indeed, she now concedes that \u201c[i]n light of the decisional trends in this Circuit and others,\u201d she. is not now and never was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>disabled and, consequently, that, but for PMC\u2019s erroneous perception of her actual impairment, she would have no claim under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">What is left, then, are Deane\u2019s contentions that she was disabled under the terms of the ADA by virtue of the fact that PMC regarded her limitations as being far worse than they actually were, that PMC failed to accommodate her lifting restriction, and that she was eventually terminated on account of PMC\u2019s perception that she was disabled. In support of her perception claim, Deane relies on a \u201claundry list\u201d of PMC\u2019s allegedly erroneous perceptions. According to Deane, PMC believed that she was unable to lift more than ten pounds, push or pull anything, assist patients in emergency situations, move or assist patients in the activities of daily living, perform any patient care job at PMC or any other hospital, perform CPR, use the rest of her body to assist patients, work with psychiatric patients, or use medical equipment. Deane refutes each of these perceptions \u2014 or, in her view, misperceptions \u2014 and contends that her injury was, in fact, relatively minor in nature. Deane further contends that PMC should be held responsible for these misperceptions because they were the result of PMC\u2019s \u201csnap judgment\u201d arrived at without making a good faith analysis, investigation, or assessment of the nature of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Finally, Deane maintains that she requires and is entitled to accommodation for her lifting restriction. In this regard, Deane contends that she could be accommodated either in her previous position as a nurse on the medical/surgical floor or through reassignment to another position that would not require heavy lifting. As to the former, De-ane has suggested the following accommodations: (1) use of an assistant to help her move or lift patients; (2) implementation of a functional nursing approach, in which nurses would perform only certain types of nursing tasks; and (3) use of a Hoyer lift to move patients. Deane also maintains that she could have been transferred to another unit within the medical center such as the pediatrics, oncology, or nursery units, which would not have required heavy lifting. In the alternative, Deane submits that she can perform the essential functions of her previous job in the medical/surgical floor without accommodation because lifting is not an essential function of nursing. We set forth our jurisdiction and standard of review in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The core anti-discrimination section of the ADA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112. In order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case under the ADA, a plaintiff must be able to establish that he or she (1) has a \u201cdisability\u201d (2) is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d and (3) has suffered an adverse employment action because of that disability. <em>See Gaul v. Lucent Techs. Inc., </em>134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Turning to the first prong of the <em>pri-ma facie </em>case, we must determine whether Deane is disabled under the terms of the Act. The ADA defines a \u201cdisability\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">(B) a record of such an impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">(C) being regarded as having such an impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1680.2(g).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Deane concedes that she is not actually disabled, but that she was only \u201cregarded as\u201d being disabled, we direct our focus to the third tier of the statutory definition. Read in conjunction with the first tier, which defines an actual disability, the third tier requires us to determine whether PMC regarded Deane as having an impairment and whether the impairment, as perceived by PMC, would have substantially limited one or more of Deane\u2019s major life activities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> De-ane\u2019s actual impairment, therefore, is of no consequence to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Turning to the EEOC Regulations, they provide that an individual is \u201cregarded as\u201d being disabled if he or she:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">(1) [h]as a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">(2) [h]as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitude of others toward such impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">(3) [h]as none of the impairments defined in paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(l). <em>See also </em>H.R.Rep. No. 101-485(11), at 53 (1990) (\u201cHouse Labor Report\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 335; House Judiciary Report at 29, <em>reprinted in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 452.

Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>94 F.3d 1437, 1445 (10th Cir.1996); <em>Bridges v. City of Bossier, </em>92 F.3d 329, 333-34 (5th Cir.1996). The district court rejected De-ane\u2019s perceived disability claim on three grounds. First, the court found, as a matter of undisputed fact, that PMC regarded De-ane\u2019s impairment as limiting only her ability to work as a nurse on the surgieal/medical floor, not her ability to work as a nurse in general. Next, the court determined that Deane could not have been generally precluded from working in her field because, following her termination from PMC, she held two positions as a registered nurse. Finally, the court concluded, as a matter of law, that PMC\u2019s perception of Deane\u2019s impairment was not motivated by \u201cmyth, fear or stereotype\u201d and, therefore, was not actionable under the ADA. We disagree with all three of the court\u2019s rationales, discussing them in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Although the legislative history indicates that Congress was concerned about eliminating society\u2019s myths, fears, stereotypes, and prejudices with respect to the disabled, the EEOC\u2019s Regulations and Inter-pretive Guidance make clear that even an innocent misperception based on nothing more than a simple mistake of fact as to the severity, or even the very existence, of an individual\u2019s impairment can be sufficient to satisfy the statutory definition of a perceived disability. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. \u00a7 1630.2\u00ae (describing, as one example of a \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled employee, an individual with controlled high blood pressure that is not substantially limiting, who nonetheless is reassigned to less strenuous work because of the employer\u2019s unsubstantiated fear that the employee will suffer a heart attack). Thus, whether or not PMC was motivated by myth, fear or prejudice is not determinative of Deane\u2019s \u201cregarded as\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The second ground \u2014 that Deane\u2019s subsequent employment in the field of nursing demonstrated that she was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working\u2014 confuses her actual impairment with PMC\u2019s misperception thereof. Deane\u2019s subsequent work history could, at most, reflect her lack of an actual disability, and it therefore sheds no light whatever on whether, at the time of her termination, PMC regarded her impairment as substantially limiting her ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Finally, contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion, Deane has adduced sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether PMC regarded her as substantially limited in the major life activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>of working. First, there is deposition testimony from PMC officials documenting confusion as to the extent of Deane\u2019s physical capacity, with regard to pushing, pulling, and lifting. There is also evidence that PMC fundamentally misunderstood and exaggerated the limitations that the wrist injury imposed on Deane. Moreover, PMC\u2019s apparent misunderstanding is in line with other testimony that PMC did not evaluate Deane, contact her physicians, or independently review her medical records, but rather relied solely on one telephone conversation it had with Deane.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Deane also produced the affidavit and report of Daniel Rappucci, her vocational expert, who explained the import of PMC\u2019s perception of Deane\u2019s injury. Rappucci concluded that, had Deane been impaired to the extent allegedly perceived by PMC, she would have been precluded from consideration for employment, both within her chosen profession and within a wide range of jobs within her geographic region. Rappuc-ci further opined that Deane would have been precluded from performing not only many of the available jobs in service-producing industries, (including transportation, wholesale/retail, finance, real estate, hospitality industries, medical services, and professional services), which made up 83% of the 41,000 non-agricultural jobs in Deane\u2019s county of residence, but also most of the jobs in the goods-producing industries (contract construction, mining, and manufacturing), which comprised the remaining 17% of available positions. PMC counters with the argument that it attempted to accommodate Deane by placing her in other light-duty positions when and if they became available, and that this suggests that PMC did not believe Deane to be disabled. PMC submits that its actions indicate <em>only </em>that PMC considered Deane to be incapable of performing certain functions that precluded her from returning to nursing.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">As the preceding discussion makes clear, however, there are factual disputes over how impaired PMC regarded Deane as being compared with her actual level of impairment, and whether PMC\u2019s perception of De-ane constituted a \u201csignificante ] restriction] in [Deane\u2019s] ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i). Deane has thus adduced sufficient evidence that PMC regarded her as substantially more physically impaired than she actually was, and that PMC\u2019s misperception, if correct, would satisfy the \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i) threshold. Therefore, summary judgment on this issue was inappropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The second element of Deane\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case under the ADA requires her to demonstrate that she is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d. The ADA defines this term as an individual \u201cwho, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The Interpretive Guidance to the EEOC Regulations divides this inquiry into two prongs. First, a court must determine whether the individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. \u00a7 1630.2(m). Second, it must determine whether the individual, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position held or sought. <em>See id.; see also Bombard v. Fort Wayne Newspapers, Inc., </em>92 F.3d 560, 563 (7th Cir.1996); <em>Benson v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>62 F.3d 1108, 1112 (8th Cir.1995). Because PMC does not dispute Deane\u2019s general qualifications as a registered nurse, we need not dwell on the first step of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Determining whether an individual can, with or without reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the position held or sought, also a two step process, is relatively straightforward. First, a court must consider whether the individual can perform the essential functions of the job without accommodation. If so, the individual is qualified (and, <em>a fortiori, </em>is not entitled to accommodation). If not, then a court must look to whether the individual can perform the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If so, the individual is qualified. If not, the individual has failed to set out a necessary element of the <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The majority panel opinion, in deciding for PMC, reasoned that to satisfy the first step, a \u201cregarded as\u201d plaintiff must make a showing that he or she could perform <em>all </em>the functions of the job (with or without accommodation), not just its <em>essential </em>functions. PMC disassociated itself from the panel\u2019s position before the <em>en banc </em>court. As this issue is one of statutory construction, the \u201cfirst step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the ease.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337,-, 117 S.Ct. 843, 846, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">The ADA prohibits a \u201ccovered entity\u201d from discriminating against a \u201cqualified individual with a disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Section 12111(8), which defines the latter term, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">The term \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d means an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subehapter, consideration shall be given to the employer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">Section 12111(8) is plain and unambiguous. The first sentence of that section, makes it clear that the phrase \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation\u201d refers directly to \u201cessential functions\u201d. Indeed, there is nothing in the sentence, other than \u201cessential functions\u201d, to which \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation\u201d could refer. Moreover, nowhere else in the Act does it state that, to be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d, an individual must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>prove his or her ability to perform <em>all </em>of the functions of the job, and nowhere in the Act does it distinguish between actual or perceived disabilities in terms of the threshold showing of qualifications. Therefore, if an individual can perform the essential functions of the job without accommodation <em>as to those functions, </em>regardless of whether the individual can perform the other functions of the job (with or without accommodation), that individual is qualified under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The history of the ADA confirms this view. In the committee reports that accompanied the ADA, Congress spoke directly to the qualifications standard adopted in the statute. Repeatedly, Congress stated that the qualifications standard turned on the individual\u2019s ability to perform the \u201cessential functions\u201d of the job. <em>See e.g., </em>House Labor Report at 55, <em>reprinted, in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.AN. at 337; House Judiciary Report at 32-33, <em>reprinted in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.AN. at 455. Congress explained that the Act focused on an individual\u2019s ability to perform \u201cessential functions\u201d to ensure that persons with disabilities \u201cnot be disqualified because of the inability to perform non-essential or marginal functions of the job.\u201d House Judiciary Report at 31-32, <em>reprinted in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 454. As stated in one committee report, the purpose of the ADA\u2019s qualifications standard is to \u201censure that employers can continue to require that all applicants and employees, including those with disabilities, are able to perform the <em>essential </em>functions, i.e., the non-marginal functions of the job in question.\u201d House Labor Report at 55, <em>reprinted in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.AN. at 337 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Having rejected the panel\u2019s position that Deane needed to make a showing that she can perform <em>all </em>of the functions of her former job, we must now determine whether Deane has, in fact, adduced sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on the question whether she can perform the <em>essential </em>functions of the job without accommodation as to those functions. Deane claims that the heavy lifting she is restricted from doing is not an essential job function of a nurse. Deane describes nursing as a profession that focusses primarily on skill, intellect, and knowledge. While conceding that lifting constitutes part of a nurse\u2019s duties, she submits that it is only a small part.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">In support of her contentions, Deane again offers Rappucci\u2019s affidavit and report. Rap-pucci opines that patient care, not heavy lifting of patients, is the essential function of registered nursing. As evidence, he references the Department of Labor\u2019s Dictionary of Occupational Titles Job Descriptions (\u201cDOL Dictionary\u201d), which details four critical tasks of a general duty nurse, none of which involves heavy lifting: (1) administering medications and treatments, (2) preparing equipment and aiding physicians during the treatment of patients, (3) observing patients and recording significant conditions and reactions to drugs, treatments, and significant incidents, and (4) taking temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and other vital signs to detect deviations from normal and assess the condition of the patient. Rappucci also notes that nursing is a professional occupation, and he compares it with orderly work to exemplify the differences between the two positions. For example, whereas nursing is classified by the Department of Labor as skilled, medium duty labor, orderly work is classified as semi-skilled, heavy-duty labor. Also, whereas none of a general nurse\u2019s critical tasks under the DOL Dictionary description include lifting, the description of orderly work enumerates \u201clift[ing] patients onto and from bed\u201d as critical task number five. This is because, according to Deane, the orderly position exists to assist the nurse professional in the performance of his or her job duties. Finally, Deane points out that, recognizing the difficulty of unassisted heavy lifting, PMC uses a team approach to the lifting of patients, both in routine matters and in responding to emergency situations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">PMC responds that lifting <em>is </em>an essential function of a nurse. In support, PMC cites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>its job description, which details under the heading \u201cMAJOR TASKS, DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\u201d that one of the \u201cWORKING CONDITIONS\u201d for a staff registered nurse is the \u201c[f]requent lifting of patients.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> PMC also notes that Deane conceded that the PMC job description was \u201can accurate reflection of the tasks, duties and responsibilities as well as the qualifications, physical requirements and working conditions of a registered nurse at [PMC],\u201d and that among her \u201ccritical job demands\u201d at PMC were: (1) the placement of patients in water closets, tub chairs or gurneys, (2) the changing of position of patients, and (3) the lifting of laundry bags. These pieces of evidence, contends PMC, constitute multiple admissions by Deane that lifting is an essential function of a staff registered nurse at PMC. Finally, PMC asserts that the consequences of a nurse\u2019s inability to lift patients could create a dangerous situation in the hospital for Deane and her patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We decline to apply conclusive effect to either the job description or PMC\u2019s judgment as to whether heavy lifting is essential to Deane\u2019s job. The EEOC\u2019s Interpretive Guidance indicates that \u201cthe employer\u2019s judgment as to which functions are essential\u201d and \u201cwritten job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants\u201d are two <em>possible </em>types of evidence for determining the essential functions of a position, but that such evidence is not to be given greater weight simply because it is included in the non-exclusive list set out in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(n)(3). <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. \u00a7 1630.2(n). Thus, the job description is not, as PMC contends, incontestable evidence that unassisted patient lifting is an essential function of Deane\u2019s job. Moreover, the EEOC Regulations also provide that while \u201cinquiry into the essential functions is not intended to second guess an employer\u2019s business judgment with regard to production standards,\u201d whether a particular function is essential \u201cis a factual determination that must be made on a case by ease basis [based upon] <em>all </em>relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Finally, the import of the rest of PMC\u2019s evidence (e.g., her alleged admissions, etc.) is disputed by Deane. For all these reasons, we find that there is a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether De-ane was a qualified individual under the ADA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Finally, we find that Deane can easily establish the third prong of her <em>prima facie </em>case. The August 10, 1992, call from Hann terminating Deane because of her \u201chandicap\u201d is uncontroverted direct evidence that Deane suffered an adverse employment action because of her employer\u2019s perception of her disability. <em>See Martinson v. Kinney Shoe Corp., </em>104 F.3d 683, 686 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201cWhen an employer concededly discharges an employee because of a disability, the employee need prove nothing more to meet the third prong of the prima facie test.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court will be reversed and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Although not a ground of our decision, we take this opportunity to observe that this protracted (and very much ongoing) litigation would likely have been unnecessary had the parties taken seriously the precepts announced in our opinion in <em>Mengine v. Runyon, </em>114 F.3d 415 (3d Cir.1997). In that deeision, we highlighted the importance of communication and cooperation between employers and employees in seeking reasonable accommodations. <em>See id. </em>at 416. Specifically, we noted that, in the context of the Rehabilitation Act, \u201cboth parties have a duty to assist in the search for appropriate reasonable accommodation and to act in good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 420. In this ease, the single telephone interaction between Deane and McCool at PMC hardly satisfies our standard that the employer make \u201creasonable efforts to assist [the employee], to communicate with him in good faith, and to not impede his investigation [for employment].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). While it may turn out that reasonable accommodation for Deane is impossible (or is not required because she is a \u201cregarded as\u201d plaintiff), nevertheless, an employer who fails to engage in the interactive process runs a serious risk that it will erroneously overlook an opportunity to accommodate a statutorily disabled employee, and thereby violate the ADA. <em>Id. </em>at 420-21.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"AN6\"> Honorable Edward R.

We have appellate jurisdiction over the district court's grant of summary judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because our standard of review is plenary, <em>see Kelly v.

With the \"regarded as\u201d prong, Congress chose to extend the protections of the ADA to individuals who have no actual disability. The primary motivation for the inclusion of misperceptions of disabilities in the statutory definition was that \"society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and diseases are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment.\u201d <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. \u00a7 1630.2(1) (EEOC's \"Interpretive Guidance\u201d to the ADA) (citing <em>School Bd. of Nassau County v.

Rappucci also contends that PMC misdefines the essential functions of the nurse position (e.g., by including lifting of laundry bags as a \"major task duty and responsibility\u201d).

Rappucci criticizes the job description for utilizing incorrect language to describe the lifting requirements. For example, according to the Department of Labor, \"frequent lifting of patients\u201d means that the task is performed 33% to 66% of the day, or approximately 3-5 hours over an eight hour work shift. Deane contends that this description is implausible (and inaccurate) and conflicts with other testimony. For example, Joan Campagna, a registered staff nurse at PMC since 1987, swore in her affidavit that a PMC nurse typically spends only minutes per day repositioning patients in their beds, transferring patients from bed to gurney or vice versa, and moving patients into and out of wheelchairs. Moreover, Campagna notes that these tasks are nearly always accomplished by two people and that PMC employs orderlies, licensed practical nurses, and nurses aides whose duties are to assist registered nurses in all patient care activities, including the lifting and transferring of patients.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\">. In view of this conclusion, wc need not reach the more difficult question addressed by the panel whether \"regarded as\u201d disabled plaintiffs must be accommodated by their employers if they cannot perform the essential functions of their jobs. Deane contends that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, \u201cregarded as\u201d plaintiffs are entitled to the same reasonable accommodations from their employers as are actually disabled plaintiffs. She reasons that, just as we found that a plain reading of the ADA only requires plaintiffs to show that they can perform the essential functions of the job, a plain reading of the definition of \"qualified individual\" demonstrates that a \"regarded as\u201d plaintiff is qualified so long as she can perform the essential functions with reasonable accommodation. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (defining a \"qualified individual\u201d as one \u201cwho, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires\u201d); <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(m). Moreover, Deane submits that this plain reading of the statute is buttressed by the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Arline, </em>480 U.S. at 288-89, 107 S.Ct. at 1131-32 (holding that, under the Rehabilitation Act, employers have an affirmative obligation to make reasonable accommodations for employees who are perceived to be handicapped). More importantly, according to Deane, failure to mandate reasonable accommodations for \"regarded as\u201d plaintiffs would undermine the role the ADA plays in ferreting out disability discrimination in employment. This is because, following Deane\u2019s logic, the \"regarded as\u201d prong of the disability definition is premised upon the reality that the perception of disability, socially constructed and reinforced, is difficult to destroy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>and in most cases, merely informing the employer of its misperception will not be enough.</p>\n<p id=\"Ast-\">In countering Deane's position, PMC notes preliminarily that a \"regarded as\u201d plaintiff\u2019s only disability is the employer\u2019s irrational response to her illusory condition. Under these circumstances, reasons PMC, it simply makes no sense to talk of accommodations for any physical impairments because, by definition, the impairments are not the statutory cause of the plaintiff's disability. Adopting Deane\u2019s interpretation of the ADA would, in PMC\u2019s view: (1) permit healthy employees to, through litigation (or the threat of litigation) demand changes in their work environments under the guise of \"reasonable accommodations\" for disabilities based upon misperceptions; and (2) create a windfall for legitimate \"regarded as\u201d disabled employees who, after disabusing their employers of their misperceptions, would nonetheless be entitled to accommodations that their similarly situated coworkers are not, for admittedly non-disabling conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"AoA\">While we acknowledge the considerable force of PMC's argument, especially the latter point, we express no position on the accommodation issue, and note that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has not taken an official position yet either. <em>See </em>Brief for the Equal Opportunity Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>at 6. We note, however, that if it turns out that a \"regarded as\" plaintiff who cannot perform the essential functions of her job is not entitled to accommodation (and therefore does not have to be reinstated), he or she need not necessarily be without remedy.

Thus, if a covered employer discriminated against such an individual in a manner barred by the Americans with Disabilities Act, it would violate the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">But, as I see this ease, the issue here is different. As the majority has pointed out, the district court found that Deane was not actually disabled and she has not appealed that determination. The issue then is whether a person who is not actually disabled can demand a reasonable accommodation from an employer. After all it was Deane who claimed to need the lifting restriction and who claimed that she had to avoid repetitive manual tasks. To me the answer has to be no. I cannot understand how an employee who is not actually disabled can indicate that she must have an accommodation for her work, and then, when the employer takes her at her word but declines to grant the accommodation, assert a valid cause of action against the employer under the ADA. Congress did not pass the ADA to permit persons without a disability to demand accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">It is helpful to consider the following hypothetical. Let us assume that employees in the heavy construction industry in the ordinary course of their employment regularly lift very heavy loads. An applicant for employment who is not actually disabled indicates to the employer that she cannot lift heavy loads but requests an accommodation to avoid the lifting. The prospective employer refuses to make the accommodation. In my view, the employer does not violate the ADA, and when Deane\u2019s case is analyzed it is not different. She, too, was not disabled but asked for an accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The majority believes that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to \u201cwhether PMC misperceived Deane as being disabled.\u201d Maj. Op. at 140. But that dispute does not matter, for the critical issue is not how PMC viewed Deane because there is simply no escape from the fact that an essential element of Deane\u2019s ease is that \u201cPMC failed to accommodate her lifting restriction.\u201d Maj. Op. at 142. After all, as the majority explains, \u201cDeane maintains that she requires and is entitled to accommodation for her lifting restriction.\u201d Maj. Op. at 142. But no matter what misconceptions PMC may have had about Deane, it was Deane who requested the accommodation. Thus, even if PMC regarded her as more substantially impaired than she actually was, this misperception does not matter for she was not entitled to any accommodation. It is critical to remember that this is not a case in which the employer perceived the employee to be disabled and then refused to make the accommodation which it believed she needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The majority indicates that there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether heavy lifting is an essential function of her former job. I agree that there is a genuine dispute of fact as to whether heavy lifting is an essential function of the job. But, just as the dispute of fact regarding PMC\u2019s perception of Deane does not matter, neither does the heavy lifting dispute because it is not material. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Inasmuch as Deane is not actually disabled, she has no right to an accommodation whether or not the accommodation would impact on her ability to perform the essential functions of the job. Furthermore, an employer can determine what it believes are the essential elements for a particular job without concern that its determination might be challenged under the ADA by a person who is not actually disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In my view, this ease is quite straightforward but somehow has become complicated. I respectfully dissent as I would affirm the summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
