At the March 27, 1997 sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Chang to 41 months\u2019 incarceration, a three-year term of supervised release, and a $200 assessment. The district court did not advise Chang of his right to appeal the sentence; nonetheless, Chang filed a timely notice of appeal. Paradoxically, the only issue raised by Chang in this appeal is that he was not advised of his right to appeal. Because the district court\u2019s error was obviously harmless, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-22\">Discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-23\">Rule 32(c)(5) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires a sentencing court to advise a defendant of his right to appeal his sentence. In <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>111 F.3d 109 (11th Cir.1997), Thompson was not advised of his right to appeal his sentence and, importantly, did not take an appeal. He brought a collateral action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 seeking to vacate his sentence on that ground. We held that \u201cthe sentencing court\u2019s failure to advise Appellant of his right to appeal his sentence constitutes error <em>per se,\u201d </em>and vacated Thompson\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 110. We did so in order to effectuate the purpose of Rule 32(c)(5) \u2014 \u201c \u2018to insure that a convicted defendant be advised precisely of his right to appeal and to avoid a situation where the Government claims a defendant is otherwise aware of his right to appeal while the defendant denies such knowledge.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, <em>quoting, Paige v. United States, </em>443 F.2d 781, 782 (4th Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-24\"><em>Thompson </em>does not require resentencing in this case. Here, there is no dispute as to whether Chang was aware of his right to appeal; his timely appeal belies any such claim. The <em>per se </em>rule articulated in <em>Thompson </em>applies where a defendant is not advised of his right to appeal and, in fact, <em>does not appeal. </em>In that situation, the <em>per se </em>rule effectuates both the purpose of Rule 32(c)(5) and the added \u201cpolicy <em>of </em>preventing excessive litigation.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>111 F.3d at 111. In this situation, neither rationale applies, and the violation of Rule 32(c)(5) was harmless. <em>See United States v. Caswell, </em>36 F.3d 29, 30-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>31 (7th Cir.1994) (failure to advise defendant of right to appeal was harmless where district court extended time to appeal to accommodate defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
