The relator further states that on the second day of November, 1869, at a regular meeting of the society, which was not called for the purpose of acting upon charges preferred against him, he was, without cause, and without written charges, in his absence and without notice, disfranchised and expelled. He further states that the constitution of the society provides that \u201cif any member should be found guilty of slander or fraud against the society, the society shall have power to either fine or expel him from said society, and that to hear and determine the offense and fix the punishment, a committee of five shall in every ease be appointed, which shall in every case report to the society their conclusion.\u201d He denies that he was guilty of any misconduct, or of any \u201cfraud or slander against the societyhe avers that he was not found guilty of any such offense, and that the action of the society was. \u201cmalicious, irregular, and <em>ex parte\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">The society shows cause against the <em>mandamus, </em>and sets forth the action of which the relator complains, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-10\">\u201cThe respondent further shows unto the court that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the 28th day of October, 1869, at a meeting of said society, Peter Katus, one of tbe members, made a verbal complaint to and before the society, charging the said Anton Roehler with slander against'the society; that on motion, the following committee of five were appointed to hear and determine the offense, and to fix the punishment, viz: \u00a5m.

St., 251. </em>In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>first case cited, a by-law against insult or disrespectful behavior to a member was held unsustainable. In the last, a charge of defaming and injuring the society in public taverns was said to be insufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP0\">Where the proceedings are regular the courts will not go behind them upon the ground that the tribunal and procedure are of the member\u2019s own choosing. <em>Angell and Ames, </em>\u00a7 <em>418; Commonwealth v.

We Cite in addition to the above cases, the following: <em>Bagg\u2019s Case, 11 Coke, 93; People v. Society, 32 N. Y., 187; Com\u2019th v.

Soc., 24 Barb., 570; Rex v. Barker, 3 Burr., 1265; Hopkins v. Marquis of Exeter, Law Rep., 5 Eq., 63. </em>An examination of these cases will show that the power of expulsion is carefully guarded and exceedingly restricted by the courts; and, as we think, justly so. There can be absolutely no doubt that the proceedings in the case at bar were grossly illegal, and such, indeed, as will subject \"the society to damages, an action for which is now pending.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-4\"><em>F.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The relator has been deprived of substantial rights; and while we should not regard matters of form too closely in the proceedings of corporations like this, yet he is entitled to claim that nothing important shall be disregarded to his prejudice. The objections existing in this case are in their nature jurisdictional, and cannot be considered unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We do not feel disposed to consider the question of the validity of the by-law, as we have only a translation of it, and there may be some difficulty in understanding its precise extent. But the word which is translated \u201cslander\u201d must be regarded as meaning at least some substantial offense against the society, and not including matters which would be privileged, or matters of no importance. Assuming the validity of the by-law, we must assume that it covers something analogous to the offense, which at common law is included in that term, when applied to individuals, although it would not bear that precise construction when applied to corporations. We have no means of know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ing just what it is intended to coyer, but it must bo something in substance of that nature. (</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Unless the words claimed to be slanderous are set forth in the charge, it is impossible to tell whether there is any offense charged under the by-law, and therefore it cannot be known whether there is any jurisdiction to make the inquiry. If a charge is made of an offense not covered, the party cannot be dealt with. And we think the records, which every corporation is supposed and bound to keep, must show upon their face the exact cause of the expulsion and all of the proceedings necessary to authorize action. These should not be left to be shown by parol evidence. There should be means of determining the facts by the record itself in case they are brought in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">As the translation of the by-law is presented to us, we think the society could not give any heavier sentence than the committee, and at any rate if they could, there must have been an opportunity to be heard against it. But as there was no adequate charge made, and as the accuracy of the translation is questioned, wo need not pass on that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The <em>mandamus </em>must be granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-8\">Graves and Cooley, JJ. concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b104-9\">Ohrtstiancy, J. did not sit on this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
