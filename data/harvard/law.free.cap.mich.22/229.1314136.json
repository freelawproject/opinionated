The evidence further tended to show that on the night of the 17th May,- 1870, the defendants raised the grating over the area above described, entered -the cellar through the window, passed up the stairway to the aforesaid trap door, broke through- the trap door into the store, and stole money from the till.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-5\">The defendants\u2019 .counsel requested the court to charge the jury as follows r 1. That unless the jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants raised or otherwise opened the window below the grating and so entered the cellar, there is no burglary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">2.

That if the jury find that the shop of Murray was part of the building owned and occupied by Nicholas Kern,' and that there was access - to the store through the cellar of Murray and the cellar of Kern, then the shop is adjoining a dwelling-house, and there can be no' conviction under-this information.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-8\">The court refused to charge as requested by counsel for defendants, to which the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-9\">' '\u2022\u25a0 And the jury, under the charge of the court. having returned- a verdict of guilty against said defendants, the questions arising on the trial are certified to this court under the- statute-.

Baker, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\">I. The first question raised is whether or not the raising of an iron grating, placed over an area in front of a cellar window, and thereby passing into the area and through the window, which was not shown to have been shut, into the cellar, would constitute a burglarious <em>breaking. </em>\u2014 Rex <em>v. John Davis et al., Russ. &amp; Ry., 321; Rex v. Bennett et al., Russ. &amp; Ry., 288; Rex v. Paine et al., 7 C. &amp; P., 135.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-6\">II. The second question raised is whether an interior breaking of a building other than a dwelling-house is sufficient to constitute the burglary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-7\">At common law, burglary in respect to private property could be committed of a dwelling-house only. As to this the breaking might be of the outside, or after entry by an open door or window, it might be of an inner <em>door. </em>\u2014 4 <em>Bl. Com., 224; 1 Hale P. C., 553. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>5754, 5755 Comp. L. </em>also make an interior breaking of a dwelling-house sufficient. The breaking and entering of buildings not adjoining to or occupied with a dwelling-house, however, is made burglary by \u00a7 <em>5756, </em>but with that the common law concerning burglary has nothing to do. The offense is created by the statute, and the breaking is, in its terms, an exterior one; and an interior breaking is not mentioned as sufficient as in the other two sections cited. Wo insist, therefore, that an exterior breaking was necessary, and that the court below erred in refusing the second request of counsel for <em>defendants. </em>\u2014 The <em>People v. Fralick, Hill &amp; Denio, 63; R. S. of N. Y., 668.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-8\">III. It appears by the evidence that one Nicholas Kern owned the building; that he occupied a part of it for a dwelling-house, and rented a part of it to one Bobert Murray for a shop or store, and that there was internal communication between the two parts. The defendants were charged with breaking and entering the shop of Murray, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>but it is well settled that they should have been charged with burglary of the mansion house of Kern, the fact of internal communication making the store, in the language of the statute, \u201cadjoining to or occupied with a dwelling.\u201d\u2014 <em>1 Bishop on Criminal Law, 297 to 300; 1 Russell on Crimes, 862; Rex v. Hancock, Russ. &amp; Ry., 170; Rex v. Sefton, Russ, &amp; Ry., 202; Rex v. Witt, 1 Moody, 248.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-4\"><em>Dwight May, </em>Attorney General, for the people.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\">I. Breaking through a trap-door, or raising one which is kept down merely by its own gravitation, would be burglary within the meaning of the <em>statute. </em>\u2014 1 <em>Bishop Crim. Law, 190; Rex v. Russell, 1 Moody C. C., 377; Rex v. Callan, Russ. &amp; Ryan, 157; 2 East P. C., 487; Tiffany (Howell\u2019s Ed.,) 568. </em>The evidence tended to show .that plaintiffs in error not only raised the grating, but broke through the trap-door, and by that moans reached the store.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">II. The evidence, does not show that the store was \u201cadjoining to or occupied with a dwelling-house.\u201d The proof fully sustains the <em>information. </em>\u2014 4 <em>Black. Com., 225; 1 Hale P. C., 557 ; 2 East P. C., 504; Rex v. Martin, Russ. &amp; Ryan, 108; Rex v. Jenkins, id., 244; Devoe v. Com., 3 Met., 326 ; 3 Greenlf. Ev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>80, 81; 26 N. Y., 200. </em>It is only by statute that the offence charged is burg<em>lary. </em>\u2014 Koster <em>v. The People, 8 Mich., 432. </em>Kern did not occupy the cellar and store as part of his dwelling-house, nor did Murray; he used the premises simply as a store, and for no other purpose. In view of the authorities above cited, it would have been error to have charged in the information the store as the dwelling-house of either Kern or Murray. The words \u201c adjoining to or occupied with \u201d do not mean adjacent or contiguous. They are words well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>calculated to bring tbe case within the common-law description of burglary, viz: out-houses, adjoining to the dwelling-house, and occupied as part thereof.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b246-5\">Christiancy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">. The defendants were tried in the Recorder\u2019s Court of the city of Detroit, upon an information charging them with with having broken and entered the store or shop of one Murray, in the night time, with the intent feloniously to steal the goods and chattels of said Murray in said store, the information also alleging that they did .then and there feloniously steal two dollars of the money of said Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The evidence tended to prove the larceny in the store, and that the defendants entered in the night time, through an area outside of the cellar, which would seem to have been excavated adjoining the cellar window, and which was covered with an iron grating, as usual in such cases, the. defendants raising the grating for that purpose, then passing, through the window, which was not shown to have been shut at the time, into the- cellar, and thence up a stairway through a trap-door, which was shut, into the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">It was objected in the Court below, and this is the principal objection urged here, that this did not constitute a breaking within the meaning of \u00a7 <em>5756, Compiled Laws; </em>but that the only breaking shown was an interior breaking of the trap-door after getting into the cellar; and that such interior breaking does not come within the provisions of this section, as it would in the case of a dwelling house at common law and under the two preceding sections-of this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">But we think the area or excavation in front of the window, covered and protected by the iron grating, should-properly be considered as a part or prolongation of the cellar, and-'the- grating \u00e1-s- a part of the window-for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>admission of light, and as much for the protection of the window and the cellar against entrance from without as the sash and glass of the window could have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">We think, therefore, the taking up of the grating constituted- an exterior, breaking as clearly as the opening of the window itself, or of the outer door.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We think, also, that under the facts stated in the record (to which we refer without repeating them here), though the ownership of the store was in Kern and under the same roof with his dwelling, yet being leased by Kern to Murray and separately occupied by the latter, with an outside' entrance distinct from that of the dwelling, and in no way used with it, the store must be considered as severed by the lease and several occupancy, and that it was not within the meaning of this section, \u201cadjoining to or occupied with a dwelling-house.\u201d It did not adjoin Murray\u2019s dwelling-house nor any dwelling-house occupied by him. It was in no sense appurtenant to, connected with, or within the curtilage of his dwelling, which seems to be the meaning of the statute. The exceptions were not well taken; there was no error in the ruling of the court, and the Recorder should, we think, proceed to render the proper judgment upon the verdict. Let it be so certified to the Recorder\u2019s Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
