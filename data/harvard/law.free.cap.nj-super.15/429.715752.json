On March 7, 1949, the infant plaintiff, age 11, attended a picnic at the grove with his mother. He was attracted to the shooting gallery and spent much of his time watching patrons shoot at the targets. The rifles were chained to the counter at the front of the gallery. Expended shells fell to the ground on either side of the counter. At about nine o\u2019clock in the evening Patrylow was making preparations to close for the night. It was his practice at such times to shoot each rifle to empty it of undischarged bullets. The boy asked for and was granted permission by Patrylow to enter the gallery to pick up used shells from beneath the inner side of the counter. Patrylow opened a side door to let him in. The boy moved along the counter to a point three or four feet from the door and, with his right hand resting on the top of the counter, leaned over to gather shells with his left hand. Patrylow, who was outside the counter, picked up the rifle lying at the end of the counter between the door and the boy. He knew that the boy was just to his right \u201ctwo or three feet from where the gun actually was.\u201d He aimed the gun \u201ctoward the ground,\u201d \u201cnot entirely to the left,\u201d although admitting there was sufficient space to the left to aim it away from where the boy was and also that he might have aimed it toward the top of the range or at the targets at the rear above the level of the counter. The bullet struck the boy\u2019s right hand as it rested on the counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">We have summarized the evidence in its aspect most favorable to the bojr\u2019s claim, as we must when determining whether a jury question was presented upon defendants\u2019 motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Liability was predicated upon allegations that the boy was a licensee within the gallery and was wounded by Patrylow\u2019s willfully injurious act.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Defendants argue that liability for willful injury can be found only where positive intent of the actor to do harm to the plaintiff appears, and contend that they were entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>judgment on their motion because plaintiffs conceded during the trial that Patrylow did not intend to shoot the boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"> There was no error. While no duty is owing to a mere licensee except to abstain from acts \u201cwillfully injurious\u201d <em>(Sohn v. Katz, </em>112 <em>N. J. L. </em>106 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1934); <em>Faggioni v. Weiss, </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>157 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1923)), nevertheless, an act may be \u201cwillfully injurious\u201d whether or not there is ill will toward, or a positive intent to injure, the person harmed. True, conduct which is willful, unlike conduct which is merely negligent, does import intent. \u201cNegligence and willfulness are mutually exclusive terms which imply radically different mental states. 'Negligence\u2019 conveys the idea of inadvertence as distinguished from premeditation or formed intention.\u201d 38 <em>Am. Jur. Negligence, sec. </em>48, <em>p. </em>692. The element of intent to harm the plaintiff is supplied, however, under the rule in effect in this State (other jurisdictions follow different principles, see <em>Restatement, Torts, Scope Note, secs. </em>500-503 (1934)) by a constructive intention as to the consequences, which, entering into the intentional act which produces the injury, the law imputes to the actor regardless of whether or not he intended to harm the person, so that a charge which otherwise would be mere negligence, becomes, by reason of reckless disregard of the safety of the other, a willful wrong. <em>Baines v. Collins, </em>310 <em>Mass. </em>523, 38 <em>N. E. 2d </em>626 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. Mass. </em>1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The emphasis is upon the reckless indifference to consequences of the deliberate act or omission in the face of known circumstances and the high degree of probability of producing the harm. \u201cTo establish a willful or wanton injury it is necessary to show that one with knowledge of existing conditions, and conscious from such knowledge that injury will likely or probably result from his conduct, and with reckless indifference to the consequences, consciously and intentionally does some wrongful act or omits to discharge some duty which produces the injurious result.\u201d <em>Staub v. Public Service Ry. Co., </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>297 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1922). The definition adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>by the <em>Restatement </em>is substantially the same but is designated conduct \u201cin Reckless Disregard of the Safety of Another\u201d rather than as conduct \u201cwillfully injurious.\u201d It reads: \u201cThe actor\u2019s conduct is in reckless disregard of the safety of another if he intentionally does an act or fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts'which would lead a reasonable man to realize that the actor\u2019s conduct not only creates an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to the other but also involves a high degree of probability that substantial harm will result to him.\u201d <em>(Restatement, supra, sec. </em>500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The suggestion of the former Supreme Court in <em>Rose v. Squires, </em>101 <em>N. J. L. </em>438 (1925), that no legal duty to a licensee is violated unless there be a positive intent to do injury to him was not regarded with favor by the Court of Errors and Appeals but was expressly disapproved in all three opinions by members of that Court upon affirmance of the result below. 102 <em>N. J. L. </em>449 (1925). Both opinions for affirmance quoted the language above from the <em>Staub </em>case as the correct statement of the law. '</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The defendant partnership also sought dismissal as to it on the ground that as master it is not liable for the willful torts of its servant. We think this also was a proper question for jury determination on the evidence in the case. The liability of the master for the willful tortious acts of the servant extends to every case where the act of the servant is committed with a view to the furtherance and discharge of his master\u2019s business and within the scope and limits of his employment. <em>Smith v. Bosco, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>452 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941); <em>Holler v. Ross, </em>68 <em>N. J. L. </em>324 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1902); <em>Moore v. Camden &amp; Trenton Railway Co., </em>74 <em>N. J. L. </em>498 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1907); <em>Gindin v. Baron, </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>215 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">There must, however, be a new trial, because two distinct propositions were charged by the court, one correct and the other erroneous, neither of which was expressly with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>drawn. It will not be presumed that the jury followed the correct instruction, but the judgment will be reversed. The court's instructions were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">* i! under our law the defendants owe a different duty to an invitee than to a licensee or trespasser. There is no need for me to tell you the duty owing to an invitee, because the question of invitee, as I have stated, is not in this case. But <em>the duty owing to a licensee or a trespasser is to exercise reasonable care to avoid creating any conditions on the premises which, to one of ordinary prudence and foresight, could reasonably be held to be an instrumentality for harm.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">The first question, I believe\u2014one of the questions that you will have to determine\u2014is, Were the defendants wantonly negligent under all the circumstances in this case, considering all the testimony and the evidence? <em>Was proper care and foresight used toward .the boy or was there wanton negligence?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">Because of the fact that a gun was used by the defendant Walter Patrylow. I should say to you that persons are bound to use great care in the use of firearms or materials otherwise dangerous or destructive. Our courts have said that the duty which a person lawfully carrying firearms owes to others is not different from that which is imposed on all who have control of any hurtful thing, except in the degree of care to be exercised. As firearms are more than ordinarily dangerous when loaded, those who handle them are bound to use more than ordinary care to prevent injury to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">Our courts have stated that wanton negligence <em>is constituted by the party doing the act or failing to act, loithout having the intent to injure, being conscious from his hnotvledge of existing circumstances and conditions that his conduct will naturally and probably result in injury. </em>Our courts have also said that to establish a willful or wanton injury it is necessary to show that one with knowledge of existing conditions and conscious from such knowledge that injury will likely or probably result from his conduct, with reckless indifference to the consequences, consciously and intentionally does some wrongful act or omits to discharge some duty which produces the injurious result. Now, this definition is quite similar to the one I read before this, with the exception that here the word \u2018intentional\u2019 is used; and I should say to you that our courts have decided that the question of intent might be spelled out from a reckless indifference to the consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">Xou have three or four stages in this case that I think logically you should come to and decide as you go along in your deliberations. Pirst, was Walter guilty of wanton negligence that produced the injury to Thomas King? If he was not, then your verdict should be that of no cause of action, in favor of the defendants; * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">(Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number> Since the plaintiffs predicated liability of the defendants upon violation of the duty owed a licensee to refrain from acts willfully injurious, the distinction between merely negligent misconduct and misconduct within the test of the <em>Slaub </em>case was vital. The italicized portions of the charge are more nearly descriptive of the duty of ordinary care owing an invitee and are clearly erroneous in respect of the conduct of Patrylow in relation to the boy as a licensee. The giving of the correct instruction in language of the <em>Staub </em>case did not cure the error; at best, the charge tended to confuse the jury and to make it difficult for the jury to decide which instruction was right. In such circumstances we are required to reverse. <em>Marzotto v. Gay Garment Co., </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>368, 476 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), affirmed, <em>per curiam, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>116 (1951); <em>Pucci v. Weinstein, </em>8 <em>N. J. Super. </em>247 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); <em>State v. Tapack, </em>78 <em>N. J. L. </em>208 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1909); <em>Collins v. Central R. R. Co. of N. J., </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>593 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1917); <em>Brown v. Public Service Ry. Co., </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>747 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Reversed with direction for a new trial. Costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
