A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A9ZW\">It will be expedient and advantageous first to state concisely the acknowledged facts of basic relevancy to the paramount issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">By a warranty deed dated April 1, 1943, a parcel of real estate situate in the Township of Berlin, Camden County, New Jersey, was conveyed to \u201cSamuel Pontani and Adelaide Pontani of the City of Phil\u00e1delphia, County of Philadelphia and State of Pennsylvania (husband and wife).\u201d The grantee, Samuel Pontani, died intestate on November 5, 1948, a resident of the Township of Berlin, New Jersey, having retained during his life his interest and estate in the premises described in the deed. The plaintiffs Vincent Pontani and Rita Jordan, the son and daughter of the decedent, are his surviving heirs at law. They are not the issue of the grantee Adelaide Pontani.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The plaintiffs instituted the present action on June 16, 1950, in which they alleged that they are tenants in common of the premises and as heirs they are collectively entitled to an undivided one-half interest therein. They sought partition and an accounting. The defendant denied the existence of the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged interest and by way of counterclaim solicited a judgment confirming her sole ownership as the surviving tenant of an estate by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The grantees designated in the deed as husband and -wife had never been united in wedlock by any ceremonial. marriage. Whether the matrimonial relationship was originated by a common-law marriage was the supremely controversial issue of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">It may be incidentally recalled that a common-law marriage contracted in this State on or after December 1, 1939, has no validity. <em>B. S. </em>37:1-10. It was the insistence of the defendant in the present action that the compact of marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>between the decedent and herself was made on June 30, 1940, in the City of Philadelphia, at which time both of them were residents of that city. Its consummation and its validity wore accordingly considered to have been governed by the then existing law of the State of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Ordinarily, the validity of a marriage is determined by the <em>lex loci contractus, </em>and whenever the common or statute law of any state, territory or other jurisdiction of the United States is pleaded in an action in any court of this State, the court shall take judicial notice of the law of that jurisdiction and may inform itself of such laws in such manner as it may deem proper. ' In the absence of such pleading, it shall be presumed that the common law of such state, territory or other jurisdiction of the United States is the same as the common law as interpreted by the courts of this State. <em>L. </em>1941, <em>c. </em>81, amended <em>L. </em>1942, <em>c. </em>104 <em>(R. S. </em>2 :98-28 <em>et </em>seq.); <em>Franzen v. Equitable Life, &amp;c., Society, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>457 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In the present case it is not apparent that the applicable law was either pleaded or proved. <em>Kelly v. Kelly, </em>134 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>316 <em>(Prerog. </em>1944); <em>Bosze v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>1 <em>N. J. </em>5 (.1948); <em>Shepherd, v. Ward,, </em>5 <em>N. J. </em>92 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">However, since the cause of action was debated before the judge of the Chancery Division and evidently considered and decided by him in the light of the decisional law of the courts of Pennsylvania, we will review it in the same aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">We are not aware of any more informative exposition of the law of Pennsylvania concerning this subject than that which we quote from the recent decision of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania in <em>Ksionska v. Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>82 <em>A. 2d </em>505 <em>(Super. Ct., </em>July 19, 1951):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">\u201cA common law marriage, admittedly valid in Pennsylvania, is one effected by agreement of the parties without the benefit of the formality of a church ceremony, an officiating officer, and without license. Essential prerequisites are mutual consent and intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>to effect a present marriage, as distinguished from an agreement to effect a marriage at some future time. That mutual intention must be expressed <em>per verba de praesenti </em>and not <em>per verba de futuro.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">A common law marriage may be established by (1) proof of the contract itself; and (2) proof of cohabitation and reputation from which the fact of the contract may be inferred. <em>Pierce v. Pierce, </em>355 <em>Pa. </em>175, 179, 49 <em>A. 2d </em>346 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1946] ; <em>In re Nikitka\u2019s Estate, </em>346 <em>Pa. </em>63, 29 <em>A. 2d </em>521 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1943] ; <em>In re McGrath\u2019s Estate, </em>319 <em>Pa. </em>309, 315, 179 <em>A. </em>599 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1935] ; <em>In re Craig\u2019s Estate, </em>273 <em>Pa. </em>530, 533, 117 <em>A. </em>221, 222 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1922], It is the fact of the contract itself which is the proof of the marriage. Proof of cohabitation and reputation as husband and wife does not establish the marriage, but is evidence from which the fact of a marriage contract may be presumed or inferred. <em>Grimm\u2019s Estate, </em>131 <em>Pa. </em>199, 201, 18 <em>A. </em>1061, 6 <em>L. R. A. </em>717 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1890] ; <em>In re Yardley\u2019s Estate, </em>75 <em>Pa. </em>207 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1874] ; <em>Pierce v. Pierce, supra, </em>355 <em>Pa. </em>179, 49 <em>A. 2d </em>346 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1946], Such presumption or inference, however, may always be rebutted and will wholly disappear in the face of proof that no marriage in fact had been celebrated. <em>In re Nikitka\u2019s Estate, supra; Appeal of Reading Fire Ins. &amp; Trust Co., </em>113 <em>Pa. </em>204, 6 <em>A. </em>60 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1886].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\"> If a litigant does not rest a case upon proof of cohabitation and reputation but offers evidence of the marriage contract itself, the result must depend upon the sufficiency of the latter evidence. <em>Pierce v. Pierce, supra, </em>355 <em>Pa. </em>179, 49 <em>A. 2d </em>346 [Sup. <em>Ct. </em>1946] ; <em>Fitzpatrick v. Miller, </em>129 <em>Pa. Super. </em>324, 327, 196 A. 83, 85 <em>[Super. Ct. </em>1937] ; <em>Murdock\u2019s Estate, </em>92 <em>Pa. Super. </em>275, 277 <em>[Super. Ct. </em>1927]. Evidence of cohabitation and reputation as man and wife are of no avail if the asserted contract does not meet the standards required by law. <em>Pierce v. Pierce, supra; Bisbing\u2019s Estate, </em>266 <em>Pa. </em>529, 531, 109 A. 670 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1920] ; <em>Fitzpatrick v. Miller, supra; In re Murdock\u2019s Estate, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">Mr. Justice Patterson, speaking for the Court in <em>Re Nikitka\u2019s Estate, supra, </em>said, 346 <em>Pa. </em>at page 65, 29 A. <em>2d </em>521, 522 <em>[Sup. Ct. </em>1943] : * * it has been held over and over again that where the claimant herself proves that no valid contract was actually entered into, evidence as to cohabitation and reputation is worthless.\u2019 If, however, there is proof of a valid marriage contract, evidence of cohabitation and reputation is proper corroboration of that fact,\u2014 corroboration in the sense that the parties had, relying upon their agreement, lived together as husband and wife and were so known and recognized in the communities in which they lived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Inasmuch as the central point of the present appeal implicates the weight of the credible evidence, we endeavor in a summary fashion to impart the evidence introduced by and on behalf of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>During some period of time before June 30, 1940, the decedent liad been a widower with the two children, then minors. The defendant was a widow with one, son, her husband having died on January 7, 1939. There is no intimation that their associations were meretricious, but rather their relationship was characteristic of a conventional courtship. We ascribe some material significance to that fact. They were not of the same religious sectarian faitli and that disparity intervened in their discussions of prospective marriage. Vide, <em>Chirelstein v. Chirelstein, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>468, 483 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). Had it not been for that impediment it may logically be inferred that the parties would have by mutual consent been united by means of a ceremonial marriage. That circumstance we regard as enlightening and explanatory of their chosen course of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">About three weeks prior thereto they ultimately resolved to become husband and wife on June 30, 1940, and thereafter cohabit as such. It seems to us perfectly natural and not fantastic that in the consummation of such an agreement they would practice some deception on their children and represent to them that they intended to enter into a ceremonial marriage on that day at Williamstown. It is reasonable to infer that in the pursuit of their plan, they would not invite but rather discourage their children from accompanying them to Williamstown for a fictitious purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The defendant testified that in the forenoon of June 30, 1940, in pursuance of their previous understanding and arrangements, Mr. Pontani visited her at her apartment and said: \u201cWill you be my wife ?\u201d She replied, \u201cWill you be my husband?\u201d They kissed and lie placed a wedding ring upon her finger and remarked, \u201cNow we are man and wife.\u201d The defendant describes their mutual intentions in these words: \u201c'And he kissed me, and in the eyes of God we felt we were man and wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">They had planned a honeymoon trip that day to Atlantic City, where pursuant to arrangements they met her son and his girl friend. A photograph of them taken at Atlantic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>City on that occasion shows the defendant wearing a corsage of gardenias. Upon their return that evening to his apartment, his daughter had prepared for them a wedding cake.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The defendant produced a card which she received at that time from her sister. It is dated June 30, 1940, and deserves to be exhibited in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cOUR WEDDING CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU BOTH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aox\">Sister and Sam. May your joys all keep increasing. May your plans and dreams come true, And may the years that lie ahead Bring happiness to You.\u201d (On the back :)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">\u201cPhiladelphia June 30\u20141940</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">Dear Sister:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">This little card I am sending you, is just to say Hello, with our good wishes for Health, wealth &amp; Happiness to you and Sam, thinking of you always, with lots of love.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-14\">Loving Sister</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-15\">(Signed) Marne\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">The fact that the decedent and the defendant cohabited as man and wife from the date of the alleged marriage to the date of his death does not encounter the slightest contradiction in the evidence. Among the many cards from the decedent and others which the defendant has sentimentally retained are those entitled \"Happy Birthday to my wife,\u201d signed \"Your Husband\u201d; \u201cBirthday Greetings to My Wife and Sweetheart and Lots of Love,\u201d signed \u201cYour Hubby\u201d; similarly signed are \u201cHappy Birthday to My Wife,\u201d \u201cA Christmas Message to My Wife,\u201d \u201cEor My Wife, a Birthday Greeting,\u201d \u201cTo My Darling Wife,\u201d \u201cA Christmas Wish for My Wife,\u201d \u201cTo a Very Dear Wife on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-17\">Also illuminative are cards from \u201cJoanne,\u201d the daughter, then five years of age, of the plaintiff Rita Jordan, envelope .postmarked September 26, 1947, entitled \u201cHappy Birthday, Grandma,\u201d and others from \u201cVinnie,\u201d the plaintiff Vincent Pontani, entitled \u201cTo Mom on Her Birthday,\u201d \"Love to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Mother on Easter,\u201d \u201cEor Mother with Love at Christmas,\u201d \u201cGreetings to a Wonderful Mother,\u201d and \u201cTo a Wonderful Mother and Dad at Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It is also notable that on October 18, 1949, almost a year after the decedent\u2019s death, the plaintiil Vincent Pontani procured a policy of insurance from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in which he designated \u201cAdelaide\u2019Pontani,\u201d the defendant, as the sole beneficiary and represented her relationship to him to be \u201cstepmother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We recognize the general principle that the mutual intention to create a common law marriage must be expressed <em>per verba de praesenii </em>and not <em>per verba de futuro, </em>but we are not persuaded that under the law of Pennsylvania the determination of the mutual intention to make such a contract must necessarily he confined to the literal meaning of the words uttered to the exclusion of the contemporaneous conduct of the parties and the accompanying and surrounding conditions and circumstances. <em>Caddy v. Johnstown Firemen\u2019s Relief Ass\u2019n., </em>129 <em>Pa. Super. </em>493, 196 <em>A. </em>590 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1938); <em>In re Rosenberger\u2019s Estate, </em>65 <em>A. 2d 377 (Sup. Ct. Pa. </em>1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In the decision last cited Chief Justice Maxey remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>\u2018wedding ring\u2019 has for centuries been a symbol of marriage. Counsel for the appellant stresses the fact that Grace did not formally \u2018accept\u2019 the ring, but merely said, \u2018That is fine, I love it.\u2019 When in any marriage ceremony the groom places the wedding ring on the finger of Ms bride, the bride does <em>not usually </em>reply, T accept this ring- as proof of our marriage.\u2019 The fact that she extends her hand to have the ring placed upon the appropriate finger and keeps the band there is sufficient evidence of her acceptance of it as the sign and symbol of her legal union with a man who thereby shows that he has chosen her as his wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">In the present case the defendant produced a wedding ring which she testified that she had worn continuously from the day of the alleged marriage. It bears the inscription \u201cS. P. to A. M. June 30, 1940.\u201d If the testimony concerning such a conspicuous and habitual practice as the wearing of the ring were false, the plaintiffs would reasonably have been expected to refute it. They did not attempt to do so. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>over it is incidentally observed that although the decedent died on November 5, 1948, this action was not instituted until June 16, 1950. Evidently the plaintiffs in the existing circumstances believed that their father and the defendant were husband and wife until they ultimately discovered that a ceremonial marriage had not been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Certain ingredients of the defendant\u2019s testimony have not eluded our attention. Upon being recalled the defendant\u2019s recollection seems to have been reinvigorated and she added that when the decedent kissed her and placed the wedding ring on her finger he said, \u201cNow we are man and wife,\u201d and concerning the purchase of the ring she was subjected to the following cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201cQ. Where was it bought?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">A. On 52nd Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">Q. When?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">A. About two weeks before we were married.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">\u25a0Q. Where on 52nd Street was it you bought this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">A. Between Walnut <em>and\u2014I don\u2019t </em>know, <em>some small street.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">Q. To the north or south of Walnut?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">A. South.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-13\">Q. On which side of the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-14\">A. On the west, <em>I guess it was. I am not sure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-15\">Q. On the west side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-17\">Q. Can you be a little more definite?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-18\">A. Bajian, or something, his name was. <em>I don\u2019t knoto what it was. </em>A small jewelry store there. It\u2019s still there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-19\">Q. How much did you pay for the ring?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-20\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-21\">Q. You were present, were you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-22\">A. I don\u2019t know what he paid for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-23\">Q. When was the inscription put on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-24\">A. We left it to have it done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-25\">Mr. Babaian testified that he was acquainted with the decedent and from memory he denied that the ring was purchased from him. It was disclosed that there are more than seven jewelry stores on the same side of 52nd Street in that neighborhood, one of which is but two doors from the Babaian store.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>We specifically refer to those features of the defendant\u2019s testimony because the trial judge apparently deemed them to bo of sufficient improbability to justify the rejection of her testimony in all of its essential particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In our review of this cause in respect to the issues of fact, we have been deeply conscious of our duty to give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Rule </em>1:2-20; <em>Rule </em>4:2-6. However, we are of one mind that in the existing state of the evidence in the present case the trial judge attributed too sweeping an effect to the probable exaggerations and imperfections in the defendant\u2019s testimony to which we have alluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In this instance we feel constrained to exercise our appellate power to make our own independent findings of fact. <em>Lehmann v.
