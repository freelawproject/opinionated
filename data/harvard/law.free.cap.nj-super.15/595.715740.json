Brunswick Traction Co., </em>66 <em>N. J. L. </em>637 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1901); <em>Paynter v. Bridgeton, &amp;c., Trac. Co., </em>67 <em>N. J. L. </em>619 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1902); <em>Mason v. Erie R. R. Co., </em>75 <em>N. J. L. </em>521 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1907); <em>Brown v. Public Service Ry. Co., </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>747 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1923); <em>Pabst v. Public Service Railway Co., </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>537 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1928); <em>Bistany v. Bennett, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>107 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">There was no evidence whatever that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by any affirmative act of the defendant\u2019s driver. The evidence related to a passive condition and the alleged negligence was of a negative character.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The bus was proceeding westerly on Edgemont Drive, which was a deviation from the regular route made necessary by the closing of a bridge for repairs. The plaintiff signaled the driver that she desired to alight from the bns at the corner of Edgemont Drive and Evergreen Place. The driver stopped the bns at the northerly curb some few feet from the corner at a point adjacent to the grass plot between the curb and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the pavement of the sidewalk. The plaintiff described the occurrence: \u201cI got off the bus as usual, as I always do, and when I stepped my right foot down and the other foot, I went sprawling. My foot went down into a hole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The physical characteristics of the area are portrayed by the photographic exhibits. The curbing on the north side of Edgemont Drive curves in the form of an arc around the corner, to join the easterly curb of Evergreen Place. Glose to the beginning of its curvature on Edgemont Drive there is a catch basin covered by an iron grating. To discharge a passenger at a point east of the catch basin seems to have been circumspect and prudent. See <em>Malzer v. Koll Transportation Co., </em>108 <em>N. J. L. 296 (E. &amp; A. 1931).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Other photographs persuade us that by reason of the growth of the surrounding grass the hole would not have been visible to one occupying the driver\u2019s seat in the bus. The following interrogatory was propounded to the plaintiff at her examination before trial: \u201cSp\u00e9cify the exact nature of the alleged nuisance, trap or hole mentioned in the complaint and the length of time it is alleged to have existed to the knowledge of the defendant.\u201d Her answer: \u201cThe hole on the property of the defendant Charles Koos was covered over with grass, and without very close inspection could not be visible to a passerby.\u201d At the trial she was asked, \u201cAs you were getting off the bus, that grass had grown sort of over the hole so you couldn\u2019t see it, hadn\u2019t it?\u201d She answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Therefore the factual background was that of a driver of a bus operating the vehicle over an uncustomary route and being unaware of any concealed danger discharged a passenger at a place apparently safe. Certain elementary principles promptly enter into the consideration of the ease. A common carrier is not an insurer of the safety of its passengers. The mere happening of -an accident does not in these circumstances raise a presumption of negligence. Negligence is a fact which must be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>There is no evidence in the transcript from which it could be logically inferred that the existence of the depression in the grass plot was sufficiently exposed to view to have been visible to a reasonably vigilant and cautious driver similarly situated. There is no positive duty resting upon the operators of such common carriages to anticipate every uneven surface or defect in the highway or along its side and stop his vehicle so as to avoid the remote possibility of a passenger stepping on some uneven surface or in a depression which, notwithstanding the exercise of reasonable watchfulness, did not appear to be and was not a place having the manifest characteristics of potential harm. <em>MacDonald v. Philadelphia Rural Transit Company., </em>147 <em>Pa. Super. </em>220, 24 <em>A. 2d </em>37 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1942); <em>Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. </em>Thomas, 180 <em>Va. </em>292, 23 <em>S. E. 2d </em>148 <em>(Sup. Ct. of App. </em>1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We agree with the trial judge that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff failed to show the right to relief. <em>Rule, 3 </em>:41-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
