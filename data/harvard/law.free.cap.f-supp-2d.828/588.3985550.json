PAULEY III, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Plaintiffs Gregory Galan, Lawrence Waxman, Richard White, Russell W. Andrews, Frederick W. DeVito, Mary T. DeVito, David W. DeVito, and F.W. DeVito, Inc. Retirement Plan Trust bring this putative class action against Defendants Moore Capital Management, LP (\u201cMoore Capital\u201d), Moore Capital Management, LLC (\u201cMoore LLC\u201d), Moore Capital Ad-visors, LLC (\u201cMoore Capital Advisors\u201d), Moore Advisors, Ltd. (\u201cMoore Advisors,\u201d and together with Moore Capital Advisors, the \u201cAdvisors\u201d), Moore Macro Fund, LP (\u201cMoore Macro Fund\u201d), Moore Global Fixed Income Master Fund, LP (\u201cMoore Global Fund,\u201d together with Moore Macro Fund, the \u201cFunds,\u201d and with the other Moore entities, the \u201cMoore Defendants\u201d), MF Global, Inc. (\u201cMF Global\u201d), and Christopher Pia (\u201cPia\u201d). The Consolidated Class Action Complaint dated September 30, 2010 (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) alleges violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d), the Sherman Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d) arising from a scheme to manipulate the prices of platinum and palladium futures contracts from October 25, 2007 to June 6, 2008 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Defendants move to strike certain allegations in the Complaint and to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim. For the following reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion to strike is granted in part and denied in part, and their motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">L. <em>The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">On April 29, 2010, the CFTC issued an order (the \u201cCFTC Order\u201d) instituting an administrative proceeding against Moore Capital and the Advisors arising out of their attempted manipulation of platinum and palladium futures contracts. (Compl. Ex A: Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c), 6(d) and 8a of the Commodity Exchange Act and Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions at 1, 12.) The CFTC Order was issued after Moore Capital and the Advisors \u201csubmitted an Offer of Settlement, which the [CFTC] ... accepted].\u201d (CFTC Order at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">The CFTC Order included findings of fact and imposed sanctions on the Moore Capital and the Advisors, including a $25 million fine. (CFTC Order at 1, 7.) Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>cifieally, the CFTC found that between November 2007 and May 2008 a former portfolio manager for Moore Capital\u2014 identified in the Complaint as Pia \u2014 \u201cengaged in a trading strategy in an attempt to manipulate upward the settlement prices of the palladium and platinum futures contracts.\u201d (CFTC Order at 2, 3.) This strategy, known as \u201cbanging the close,\u201d involved placing market-on-close buy orders through a futures commission merchant \u2014 identified in the Complaint as MF Global \u2014 in the last ten seconds of the closing period for each commodity. (CFTC Order at 2.) The orders \u201cwere relatively large\u201d for the \u201cilliquid palladium and platinum markets\u201d and typically \u201cconstituted a large percentage of volume of trading on the close.\u201d (CFTC Order at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Following the filing of this action, the CFTC instituted proceedings against Pia arising out of the same conduct. (Attachment to Letter from C. Lovell to the Court dated July 27, 2011). Those proceedings also resulted in a consent order that recited findings of fact and imposed sanctions on Pia, including a $1 million fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">II. <em>The Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Plaintiffs purchased and sold platinum and palladium futures contracts \u2014 as well as the commodities themselves \u2014 during the Class Period. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Moore Capital is a Delaware limited partnership headquartered in New York. (Compl. \u00b6 27.) It is a \u201cmulti-strategy investment firm\u201d that manages various investment funds. (Compl. \u00b6 27.) Moore Capital is the successor-in-interest to Moore LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Pia was a portfolio manager at Moore Capital and the head of the \u201cexecution desk\u201d operated by the Moore Defendants. (Compl. \u00b6 31.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">Moore Capital Advisors is a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in New York, and a registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading ad-visor. (Compl. \u00b6 29.) Moore Advisors is a Bahamian company and also a registered commodity pool operator. (Compl. \u00b6 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">The Funds are investment funds organized under the securities laws of the Bahamas. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) The Complaint\u2019s allegations regarding the relationship between the Funds and the Advisors are confusing and contradictory. On the one hand, the Complaint alleges that the Funds \u201cmade, paid for[,] and financed [Defendants\u2019] manipulative trades\u201d through their agents and the Advisors, suggesting control over the scheme by the Funds. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) However, the Complaint also states that the Funds were \u201cat all relevant times controlled and managed by the Moore Defendants\u201d and that the Advisors were co-general partners of the Funds. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 33, 127.) Obfuscating matters further (and as discussed in detail below), the Complaint defines the \u201cMoore Defendants\u201d to include the Funds themselves. (Compl. \u00b633.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">MF Global is a financial derivatives broker headquartered in New York. (Compl. \u00b6 34.) MF Global acted as the futures commission merchant for the Moore Defendants. (Compl. \u00b6 34(a).) A futures commission merchant is \u201c[a]n individual or firm that executes orders to buy and sell futures or futures options.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>746 (9th ed. 2009). As the Moore Defendants\u2019 futures commission merchant, MF Global \u201ccarried the Moore Defendants\u2019 accounts, accepted and en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tered their manipulative trades, and otherwise assisted the Moore Defendants.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 34(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AUsI\">I. <em>Motion to Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Defendants move to strike all references to the CFTC Order from the Complaint on the grounds that they are immaterial to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f) permits a court to \u201cstrike from a pleading ... any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d \u201c[MJotions to strike are [generally] viewed with disfavor and infrequently granted.\u201d <em>In re Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. Research Reports Sec. Litig., </em>218 F.R.D. 76, 78 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (Pollack, J.). A motion to strike \u201cwill be denied, unless it can be shown that no evidence in support of the allegation would be admissible.\u201d <em>Lipsky v. Commonwealth United Corp., </em>551 F.2d 887, 893 (2d Cir.1976). \u201cResolution of a Rule 12(f) motion is left to the district court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n v. Bay Ridge Toyota, Inc., </em>327 F.Supp.2d 167, 170 (E.D.N.Y.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In seeking to strike the allegations based on the CFTC Order, Defendants rely primarily on <em>Lipsky v. Commonwealth United Corp., </em>551 F.2d 887 (2d Cir.1976). There, the Court of Appeals held that references to a complaint in a separate action against the defendant by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) were properly stricken from the plaintiffs complaint. The Court of Appeals observed that the SEC\u2019s complaint ultimately resulted in a consent judgment \u201cbetween a federal agency and a private corporation [that] is not the [product] of an actual adjudication of ... the [underlying] issues. Consequently, it cannot be used as evidence in subsequent litigation between that corporation and another party.\u201d <em>Lip-sky, </em>551 F.2d at 893. The Court of Appeals then explained that \u201c[s]ince it is clear that the SEC[ ] consent judgment, itself, can have no possible bearing on the [plaintiffs] action, the SEC complaint which preceded the consent judgment is also immaterial, for the purposes of Rule 12(f).\u201d <em>Lipsky, </em>551 F.2d at 893-94. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals \u201ch[e]ld that neither a complaint nor references to a complaint [that] results in a consent judgment may properly be cited in the pleadings.... \u201d <em>Lipsky, </em>551 F.2d at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">As courts in this Circuit have found repeatedly, <em>Lipsky </em>teaches \u201cthat references to preliminary steps in litigations and administrative proceedings that did not result in an adjudication on the merits or legal or permissible findings of fact are, as a matter of law, immaterial under Rule 12(f).... \u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, </em>218 F.R.D. at 78; <em>see Gotlin v. Lederman, </em>367 F.Supp.2d 349, 363 (E.D.N.Y.2005) (Glasser, J.) (\u201c[C]ourts hold that references in pleadings to agreements with state or federal agencies may properly be stricken on a Rule 12(f) motion.\u201d); <em>Ledford v. Rapid-American Corp., </em>No. 86 Civ. 9116(JFK), 1988 WL 3428, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 1988) (\u201c[References in a complaint to proceedings which do not adjudicate underlying issues may be stricken.\u201d); <em>Sec. Investor Prat. Corp. v. Stratton Oakmont, Inc., </em>234 B.R. 293, 336 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1999) (\u201cThe Second Circuit has clearly held that consent judgments ... are not the result of actual adjudications on the merits and therefore cannot be used as evidence in subsequent litigation between the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Applying that principle here, it is clear that the references to the CFTC\u2019s findings are properly stricken from the Complaint. To the extent the Complaint describes the manipulative trading scheme, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>those allegations simply recast the CFTC\u2019s findings and are derived wholesale from the CFTC Order. For example, Paragraph 81 alleges that the CFTC\u2019s \u201ccharges involved what the CFTC found to be a \u2018manipulative scheme\u2019 in NYMEX platinum and palladium futures contracts traded in this District during the period of \u2018at least November 2007 through May 2008.\u2019 \u201d (Compl. \u00b6 81.) Similarly, Paragraph 83 asserts that \u201c[a]s the CFTC\u2019s holding that the Moore Capital Defendants violated Section 9(a)(2) shows, in devising, entering or causing others to enter these \u2018bang the close\u2019 orders, Defendant Pia was, in fact, an employee, agent and other person acting on behalf of each of the Moore Defendants.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 83.) These allegations are paradigms of the type of pleading prohibited by <em>Lipsky </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Although the CFTC Order included certain factual findings, it nevertheless was the product of a settlement between the CFTC and the Respondents, not an adjudication of the underlying issues in the CFTC proceeding. Plaintiffs are therefore prohibited from relying on the CFTC Order to plead the \u201cunderlying facts of liability.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>668 F.2d 94, 97 (2d Cir.1981); <em>see Footbridge Ltd. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>No. 09 Civ. 4050(PKC), 2010 WL 3790810, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2010) (\u201c[Djefendants\u2019 motion to strike is granted with respect to the allegations ... insofar as they are based on pleadings, settlements, and government investigations in other cases.\u201d); <em>Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., </em>234 B.R. at 336 (striking references to an SEC consent order); <em>Dent v. US. Tennis Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>No. 08 Civ. 1533(RJD)(WP), 2008 WL 2483288, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Jun. 17, 2008) (striking references to a settlement with the New York Attorney General).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the CFTC Order is material to their claims because it will be admissible at trial is mistaken. The admissibility of \u201ca civil consent decree\u201d such as the CFTC Order \u201cis governed by Fed.R.Evid. 408.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>668 F.2d 94, 97 (2d Cir.1981). Rule 408 \u201cbars evidence of a compromise to prove liability for the claim, but specifically permits use of such evidence for other purposes.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>668 F.2d at 97. Here, in pleading the facts supporting their claims, Plaintiffs quote extensively from the CFTC Order, indicating an express purpose to employ the CFTC Order to prove liability. Indeed, that purpose is manifest in Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that this Court should accord <em>Chevron </em>deference to the CFTC\u2019s findings of liability. <em>(See </em>Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 24 (citing <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Moreover, Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. Pentagon Capital Management PLC </em>is misplaced. There, Judge Sweet found that a consent decree with the SEC was admissible under Rule 408 because it was being offered not \u201cto establish liability against the parties who settledf,] but to offer evidence as a shield\u201d against the SEC\u2019s allegations. <em>Pentagon Capital, </em>No. 08 Civ. 3324(RWS), 2010 WL 985205, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2010). Moreover, it was the defendants, not plaintiff, who sought admission of the consent order in that action. <em>Pentagon Capital, </em>2010 WL 985205, at *4. Here, Plaintiffs proffer no similar defensive purpose regarding the admissibility of the CFTC\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Finally, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 contention, Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(C) does not provide an independent basis for admissibility of the CFTC Order. Rule 803(8)(C) provides that government records including \u201cfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>by law\u201d are not hearsay, \u201cunless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(C). But this rule merely creates an exception to the normal hearsay rules excluding out of court statements offered for the truth. The CFTC Order\u2019s admissibility is governed by Rule 408, which, as discussed above, excludes Plaintiffs\u2019 intended use.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 motion to strike the references to the CFTC Order in paragraphs 1-3, 5, 9, 31(c), 35, 80-91, 101, 116, 119-21, and 170 is granted. However, Defendants also seek to strike allegations that do not appear to reference the CFTC Order directly. For example, Defendants appear to object to the inclusion in some paragraphs of the terms \u201cbang the close,\u201d \u201cfrequent,\u201d and \u201coften.\u201d The term \u201cbang the close\u201d is a colloquial trading term that need not be stricken from the Complaint. To the extent that the Complaint purports to quote terms such as \u201cfrequent\u201d or \u201coften\u201d directly from the CFTC Order, they are stricken. Defendants\u2019 motion to strike the references in paragraphs 31(a) and (b), 77, 94-97, 114, 122-23, 125, 127-28, 130-31, 134, 138-40, 181, 187, 210, 214-15, 217 is otherwise denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">II. <em>Allegations Absent the CFTC Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Defendants argue that the Complaint fails to adequately plead facts supporting nearly every element of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. However, because this Court has stricken the references to the CFTC Order, many of the parties\u2019 arguments are difficult to evaluate. Indeed, those references permeate the Complaint, and their absence denudes the Complaint of the specifics of the alleged manipulative trading scheme. This Court will address the elements of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims only to the extent necessary to illustrate that Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the CFTC Order requires dismissal of their claims. To avoid an advisory opinion, this Court declines to address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding many of the other disputed elements at this time. This Court notes, however, that certain of the parties\u2019 arguments relate to allegations that do not rely on the CFTC and are therefore subject to resolution on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">III. <em>Motion to Dismiss Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">On a motion to dismiss, a court must accept the facts alleged as true and construe all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor. <em>ECA Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Trust Fund of Chi. v. JP Morgan Chase Co., </em>553 F.3d 187, 196 (2d Cir.2009). In order to survive a motion to dismiss, \u201c[a] complaint must contain sufficient factual matter ... to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">IV. <em>Sherman Act Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">Defendants contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 Sherman Act claim is deficient because it fails to allege (1) a conspiracy among independent economic actors; (2) an agreement to manipulate prices; and (3) antitrust standing. Additionally, MF Global argues for dismissal of the Sherman Act claim on the grounds that the Complaint fails to plead allegations specific to MF Global.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>a. <em>Conspiracy Among Independent Actors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">\u201cUnder Section 1 of the Sherman Act, \u2018every contract, combination ..., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce ... is ... illegal.\u2019 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. The crucial question in a Section 1 case is therefore whether the challenged conduct stems from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express.\u201d <em>Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm\u2019t, </em>592 F.3d 314, 321 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In <em>American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, </em>the Supreme Court examined the question of when the conduct of affiliated entities \u201cmust be viewed as that of a single enterprise for purposes of \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Am. Needle, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Football League, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2201, 2208, 176 L.Ed.2d 947 (2010) (quotations omitted). The Court observed that it has \u201clong held that concerted action under \u00a7 1 does not turn simply on whether the parties involved are legally distinct entities.\u201d <em>Am. Needle, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2209. Rather, conduct by legally related entities can violate \u00a7 1 when it stems from an agreement among \u201cseparate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests, such that the agreement deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking, and therefore a diversity of entrepreneurial interests.\u201d <em>Am. Needle, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2210, 2212 (quotations and citations omitted). This inquiry is one of \u201ccompetitive reality\u201d that ultimately examines \u201cwhether the agreement joins together independent centers of decisionmaking. If it does, the entities are capable of conspiring under \u00a7 1____\u201d <em>Am. Needle, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2212 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Here, the Complaint alleges an agreement to manipulate the prices of platinum and palladium futures among the Moore Defendants, Pia, and MF Global. Defendants argue that the Moore Defendants and Pia are incapable of conspiring with each other for \u00a7 1 purposes because the Moore Defendants are affiliates of one another and Pia is merely their employee. Defendants also argue that MF Global could not have been pursuing an economic interest apart from the Moore Defendants because it allegedly acted only as their agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">In evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy allegations, this Court declines to hold that the Moore Defendants are incapable of conspiring with each other merely by virtue of their legal affiliations. Such a holding would contravene the Supreme Court\u2019s directive in <em>American Needle </em>that \u201c\u00a7 1 does not turn simply on whether the parties involved are legally distinct entities.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 2209; <em>see In re Sulfuric Acid Antitrust Litig., </em>743 F.Supp.2d 827, 884 (N.D.Ill.2010) (noting that courts have found that \u201crelated entities can conspire with each other\u201d and that \u201c[t]he reasoning ... elaborated on by <em>American Needle </em>supports that conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">That conclusion aside, the Complaint nevertheless fails to include plausible allegations of an agreement joining together \u201cindependent centers of decision-making.\u201d <em>Am. Needle, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2212. The Complaint\u2019s allegations concerning the origins of the manipulative trading scheme are perplexing. In some paragraphs, the Complaint appears to describe a top-down scheme originating from the Funds by alleging that they \u201cacted through [their] agents and [the Advisors],\u201d (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-33), and that Moore Capital, the Advisors, and Pia \u201cwere the agents or other persons acting on behalf of the ... Funds,\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 176). But it states elsewhere that the <em>Funds </em>\u201cwere controlled and managed by the Moore Defendants.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 127.) These allegations are contradictory. Moreover, the latter statement is non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>sensical. By defining the \u201cMoore Defendants\u201d as a group of entities that includes the Funds, Paragraph 127 alleges enigmatically that the Funds controlled themselves. <em>See In re Livent, Inc. Noteholders Sec. Litig., </em>151 F.Supp.2d 371, 405 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (\u201c[A] court need not feel constrained to accept as truth conflicting pleadings that make no sense, or that would render a claim incoherent....\u201d). And to infuse still more dissonance into the allegations, at times the Complaint indicates that the manipulative trading scheme was driven by Pia, with his intent imputed to the Funds.

While some courts \u201crequire plaintiffs to demonstrate control in order to find [that] an agency relationship exists,\u201d <em>In re Amaranth Natural Gas Commodities Litig., </em>711 F.Supp.2d 301, 307 (S.D.N.Y.2010), the Court of Appeals has held that a principal \u201cneed not actually have participated in [the agent\u2019s] wrongful conduct or have controlled [the agent\u2019s] behavior; for the purpose of imposing liability under [\u00a7 ] 2(a)(l)[ (B) ], it is enough if [the agent] was \u2018acting for\u2019 [the principal] in executing the illegal trades.\u201d <em>Guttman, </em>197 F.3d at 39.

Defendants contend, however, that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring a claim based on \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability. This Court agrees.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Claim is dismissed with prejudice to the extent it is based on a \u201ccontrol person\u201d theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">f. <em>Loss Causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 346, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005), Defendants argue that the Complaint fails to allege facts demonstrating that the manipulative trading scheme was the proximate cause of Plaintiffs\u2019 losses. Specifically, Defendants argue that \u201cclaims predicated on ... trades which were opened and closed entirely during the Class Period [are] ... insufficient because any artificiality present at the time positions were opened ... would have been present also when these positions were closed ..., thereby offsetting any potential damage.\u201d (Defs. Br. at 27.) This is a formulation of <em>Dura\u2019s </em>\u201closs causation\u201d principle, which recognizes that if a purchaser pays an artificially inflated price based on a misrepresentation to the market but \u201csells [his] shares quickly before the relevant truth begins to leak out, the misrepresentation will not have led to any loss.\u201d <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">While this explanation is persuasive in the context of information hidden from the market,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">\u201c[m]anipulative conduct is different. A market manipulation is a discrete act that influences stock price. Once the manipulation ceases, however, the information available to the market is the same as before, and the stock price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>gradually returns to its true value. For example, suppose that a bank manipulates the market for a stock by engaging in \u201cwash sales,\u201d fictitious trading for the purpose of creating a false appearance of activity. By creating an appearance of increased trading volume, wash sales may drive up the price of a security. Once the wash sales cease, ordinary trading resumes. The spectre of wash sales may continue to affect the stock price for some time as investors recall the recent increased activity and observe the higher price; over time, however, the security will fall back to its true investment value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">In market manipulation cases, therefore, it may be permissible to infer that the artificial inflation will inevitably dissipate .... It is that dissipation \u2014 and not the inflation itself \u2014 that [may] cause[] plaintiffs\u2019 loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><em>In re Initial Public Offering Sec. Litig., </em>297 F.Supp.2d 668, 674-75 (S.D.N.Y.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">This analysis demonstrates the infirmity in Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Dura. </em>The trading scheme described in the Complaint relied on large trades in an illiquid market in the final seconds of the close. Their effect could have been dissipated depending on the timing of both Defendants\u2019 trades and Plaintiffs\u2019 transactions in the market. Moreover, although courts frequently look to the securities laws in deciding claims under the CEA, <em>Dura\u2019s </em>application outside the securities law context has been questioned. <em>See Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. v. Allegheny Energy, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 171, 183 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(\u201cDura\u2019s </em>conclusion that overpayment alone cannot prove loss causation ... is based on the tailored application of these principles set out by the Supreme Court in the securities context.

Aug. 29, 2009) (discussing authority for and against <em>Dura\u2019s </em>applicability to claims under the CEA).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, without passing on the sufficiency of Plaintiffs\u2019 substantive allegations, this Court finds that <em>Dura\u2019s </em>loss causation principles do not apply to the type of manipulative conduct alleged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">VI. <em>RICO Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">To establish RICO liability, \u201ca plaintiff must show \u2018(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>DeFalco v.

Here, Defendants challenge the Complaint\u2019s RICO allegations on three grounds: (1) it fails to allege RICO continuity; (2) it fails to allege specific predicate acts; and (3) Plaintiffs\u2019 lack RICO standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">As to the second argument, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations concerning predicate acts fail for two reasons. First, Plaintiffs argue that those allegations are sufficient because they (1) \u201cplead the RICO scheme, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>see generally </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 79-82, 85(a); ...

Br. at 39.) However, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument and their citations illustrate that the predicate act allegations are based heavily on portions of the Complaint that have been stricken because of their reliance on the CFTC Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Second, even if those allegations survived, Plaintiffs rely impermissibly on group pleading to allege the existence of predicate acts underpinning their RICO claim. While Plaintiffs dispute this conclusion by pointing to Paragraphs 35, 80, and 91 as evidence that the Complaint identifies \u201cindividual actors,\u201d those paragraphs do nothing to differentiate the conduct of the various Defendants other than Pia. Rather, they primarily refer to the CFTC\u2019s findings, which pertain to only some of the Defendants. <em>See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Young, </em>No. 91 Civ. 2923(CSH), 1994 WL 88129, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 1994) (\u201cThe allegations\u2019 impermissible failure to distinguish between [certain] Defendants mandates dismissal under both Rule 9(b) and Rule 8(a). The Complaint never specifically alleges the nature of each defendant\u2019s participation in the allegedly fraudulent scheme.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claim is dismissed for failure to adequately plead predicate acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Because the parties\u2019 arguments regarding RICO standing and continuity are substantially intertwined with the allegations based on the CFTC Order, this Court declines to address those arguments at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion to strike is granted in part and denied in part, and their motion to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim is granted.
