We consider in this case whether Personnel Administration Rules PAR. 10 (Rule 10), pertaining to special certifications in the civil service based on race, color, national origin, or sex, was validly enacted, procedurally satisfied, and constitutionally sound. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Rule 10 is valid and constitutional, and that the actions of the HRD were lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">1. <em>Rule 10. </em>Rule 10 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-13\">\u201c(1) Prerequisites for special certifications based on race, color, national origin or sex shall be made whenever:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-14\">\u201c(a) an appointing authority shall make requisition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>fill one or more positions included in said appointing authority\u2019s affirmative action plan on file with the administrator, and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201c(b) the administrator has made a written determination substantiating that previous practices of the department and/or of said appointing authority with respect to the filling of such position or positions have discriminated against members of a group, hereinafter referred to as a protected group, on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin in contravention of any provision of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the Commonwealth, Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 2000e) or any other federal or state statute[,] the administrator may then certify, in addition to names certified in accordance with PAR. 09, the names of a like number of individuals who are members of the protected group and are on an eligible list for such position, in order of their standing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201c(2) At least ten days prior to certifying names under the provisions of PAR. 10(1), the administrator shall post a notice of his intention to do so in the offices of the Department of Personnel Administration and shall mail a copy of such notice to the appointing authority, with instructions to post copies of such notice at all locations where persons whose names may be certified under the provisions of section one may, if employed, be assigned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">2. <em>Factual and procedural background. </em>We recite in some detail the lengthy procedural history of these consolidated cases because the evidence of discrimination, presented by the MBTA, unfolded over the course of several proceedings before the Civil Service Commission (commission). On September 9, 1996, the chief of the MBTA police department submitted three public safety civil service requisition forms to the HRD in accordance with Rule 10. One form requested special certification of a \u201cfemales\u201d list for the position of lieutenant from an existing departmental promotional eligible list; the other two forms requested special certification of a \u201cfemales\u201d list and a \u201cminori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ties\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> list for the position of sergeant from an existing departmental promotional eligible list.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Attached to each requisition form was a statistical breakdown of the racial and gender composition of the MBTA\u2019s police force as of May, 1996. The statistics showed that out of a total of 211 police officers in the MBTA police department, fifty-two officers (or 24.6%) were minorities, and fifteen officers (or 7.1%) were women. With respect to the 181 patrol officers, fifty officers (or 27.6%) were minorities, and twelve officers (or 6.6%) were women. With respect to the thirty police officers occupying the positions of sergeant, lieutenant, captain, major, and chief, two officers (or 6.6%) were minorities, and three officers (or 10%) were women.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The HRD approved a \u201cfemales\u201d list for one lieutenant position, a \u201cfemales\u201d list for two sergeant positions, and a \u201cminorities\u201d list for three sergeant positions. The chief of the MBTA police department posted notices of his intention to certify names under the provisions of Rule 10 for these positions, and eligible candidates from both the regular lists<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the special certification lists were considered. Effective October 5, 1996, the MBTA promoted a total of nine police officers, with the approval of the HRD. Two lieutenant positions were filled by one white male (William Fleming from the regular list) and one white female (Nancy O\u2019Loughlin from the special certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>list).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Seven sergeant positions were filled by two white males (Salvatore Venturelli and Michael Moms from the regular list), two white females (Anne McCall and Irene Reardon from the special certification list), two black males (Herman Wheeler and Michael Lopes from the special certification list), and one black female (Gloria Andrews from the special certification list).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rule 10 did not establish any quotas with respect to promotions, and the MBTA\u2019s affirmative action program was scheduled to expire on January 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the commission, pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>alleging that they were unlawfully bypassed for promotion in favor of minority and female candidates. By decision dated November 5, 1997, the commission denied the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, concluding that (1) Rule 10 was a valid exercise of the HRD\u2019s rule making authority under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 3; (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims could not be decided by the commission; and (3) both the MBTA and the HRD attempted in good faith to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 10. As such, the commission declined to substitute its own judgment for that of the MBTA and the HRD.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The plaintiffs sought judicial review of the commission\u2019s determination pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By decision dated October 20, 1998, a judge in the Superior Court (first Superior Court judge) denied the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the minority promotions, affirming the commission\u2019s determination in that regard. The judge concluded that the statistical data presented by the MBTA, together with its well-documented judicial history of racial discrimination, constituted a \u201cstrong basis in evidence\u201d to support the MBTA\u2019s use of special certification lists for minorities. The judge further concluded that Rule 10 was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling State interest. In addition, the judge agreed with the commission that the promulgation of Rule 10 was a valid exercise of the HRD\u2019s rule mating authority under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 3, and that the MBTA and the HRD satisfactorily complied with its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the gender-based promotions, reversing the commission\u2019s determination in that regard and remanding the matter to the commission for further findings whether there was a \u201cstrong basis in evidence\u201d to justify the use of a gender-based classification in determining eligibility for promotions. The judge opined that the mere absence of women in the positions of sergeant and lieutenant did not warrant a finding that women had been subjected to past gender discrimination by the MBTA, and she concluded that the statistical data presented by the MBTA did not constitute a \u201cstrong basis in evidence\u201d to support its use of special certification lists for women. The plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal with respect to the judge\u2019s decision affirming the minority promotions; the MBTA filed a timely notice of appeal with respect to the judge\u2019s decision regarding the gender-based promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">On remand to the commission, the MBTA presented the testimony of Dr. Leonard A. Cupingood, an expert in the field of statistics, who performed, as part of his work, utilization analyses comparing the gender composition of an employer\u2019s work force with the gender composition of similar occupations in the relevant labor market, using the census as his primary data base.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dr. Cupingood compared, inter alla, the number of women employed by the MBTA police department with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>number of women in the field of \u201cprotective services\u2019\u2019 who were performing police-related work in the Boston metropolitan area,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> taking into consideration the age, education, and income constraints that would be associated with an MBTA position. He concluded that there was a statistically significant underutilization of women in the MBTA police department in 1996. Nonetheless, by decision dated December 6, 2000, the commission found that the evidence presented by the MBTA was insufficient to show past discrimination justifying the use of gender-based classifications in determining eligibility for promotions. The MBTA filed a complaint for judicial review of the commission\u2019s determination pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Before this appeal was considered, the MBTA filed a motion under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (6), to present additional evidence to the commission pertaining to the gender of actual applicants for various officer positions in the MBTA police department. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the MBTA\u2019s motion, concluding that the evidence was material, that the MBTA had shown good cause for not presenting the evidence earlier \u201cinasmuch as the [HRD], which had exclusive access to the information, acknowledged at the [prior] hearing that the information now being offered to the [commission] by the [MBTA] was timely requested but not provided,\u201d and that the plaintiffs had not shown that they would be prejudiced by the admission of such evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After considering the new evidence, the commission concluded, by decision dated January 22, 2002, that the additional testimony provided by Dr. Cupingood still did not demonstrate prior discriminatory practices by the MBTA police department that would justify the use of gender-based classifications in promotion decisions. Therefore, the commission affirmed its decision of December 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The MBTA then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to its complaint for judicial review of the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sion\u2019s determinations relating to the gender-based promotions. By decision dated November 21, 2003, a judge in the Superior Court (second Superior Court judge) allowed the MBTA\u2019s motion, reversing and vacating the determinations of the commission dated December 6, 2000, and January 22, 2002, and affirming the determination of the commission dated November 5, 1997, which upheld the MBTA\u2019s gender-based promotions. The judge concluded that at the hearings before the commission on remand, the MBTA presented uncontroverted expert testimony that the statistical disparity between women in the labor force for the positions at issue and women in the MBTA police department did, in fact, exceed the benchmark of three standard deviations established by the first Superior Court judge as the measure for evaluating whether there was a \u201cstrong basis in evidence\u201d as to past discrimination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The judge further opined that the MBTA was not required to provide direct evidence of past gender discrimination, but instead could present evidence of \u201cgross statistical disparities\u201d between the proportion of women hired and the proportion of women willing and able to do the work. Because the MBTA presented unrebutted statistical evidence to meet the benchmark of three standard deviations, the judge concluded that the commission was obligated to uphold the MBTA\u2019s promotions of female police officers to the positions of sergeant and lieutenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the judgments affirming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>minority and gender-based promotions, and the Appeals Court consolidated the parties\u2019 actions. We then transferred the cases to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiffs now contend that (1) the actions of the MBTA in requesting, and of the HRD in approving, special certifications based on race and gender, pursuant to Rule 10, for promotions to the positions of sergeant and lieutenant in the MBTA police department violated the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and arts. 1 and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; (2) there was no statutory authority for the HRD\u2019s promulgation of Rule 10; and (3) the HRD and the MBTA failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 10. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">3. <em>Standard of review. </em>General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>requires the commission to determine, on the basis of the evidence before it, whether the appointing authority sustained its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there was reasonable justification for the action taken by the appointing authority. See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, </em>434 Mass. 256, 260 (2001); <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 303 (1997). Reasonable justification in this context means \u201cdone upon adequate reasons sufficiently supported by credible evidence, when weighed by an unprejudiced mind, guided by common sense and by correct rules of law.\u201d <em>Selectmen of Wakefield </em>v. <em>Judge of First Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>262 Mass. 477, 482 (1928). See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, supra. </em>\u201cIn reviewing [the commission\u2019s] action under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), it was not open to the Superior Court judge to substitute [her] judgment for that of the commission.\u201d <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 451 (2000). The judge\u2019s task was limited to determining whether the commission\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. See <em>McIsaac </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 476 (1995). Further, a judge is required to \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d <em>Iodice </em>v. <em>Architectural Access Bd., </em>424 Mass. 370, 375-376 (1997), quoting G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). \u201cThis standard of review is highly deferential to the agency on questions of fact and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416, 420 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44, \u201cwe review the commission\u2019s decision to determine if it violates any of the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), and cases construing those standards.\u201d <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>426 Mass. 1, 5 (1997). \u201c[W]e are required to overturn commission decisions that are inconsistent with governing law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>410 Mass. 890, 892 (1991) (considerable deference generally accorded agency decision, unless agency commits error of law). The party appealing from an administrative decision has the burden of proving its invalidity. See <em>Coggin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 587 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">4. <em>Constitutional claims. </em>We generally analyze claims of constitutional violations last because they need not always be considered. See <em>Manor </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Cedar Junction, </em>416 Mass. 820, 824 (1994). Here, however, because of the importance of the constitutional issues, which are the focus of the present appeal, we discuss them first. The plaintiffs contend that the actions of the MBTA, with the approval of the HRD, in promoting minority and female police officers through the use of special certifications under Rule 10 violated the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the cognate provisions of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The thrust of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that the MBTA failed to provide a \u201cstrong basis in evidence\u201d that it had engaged in prior discriminatory practices with respect to the promotion of officers, the effects of which continue to affect its police department, such that the MBTA was justified in bypassing the plaintiffs in favor of women and minority candidates for the positions of sergeant and lieutenant. The plaintiffs assert that, at the time of the present dispute, the MBTA was in full compliance with the minority hiring practices for civil service jobs set forth in <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>334 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Supp. 930, 944 (D. Mass. 1971), afPd in part and rev\u2019d in part, 459 F.2d 725, 735-737 (1st Cir. 1972), as evidenced by the fact that 24.6% of all police officers employed by the MBTA police department were minorities. Further, the plaintiffs take issue with the testimony of Dr. Cupingood, who opined that the MBTA had \u201cunderutilized\u201d women in the police department. The plaintiffs claim that any such purported underutilization did not equate with past discrimination by the MBTA, necessitating the application of Rule 10 to promotion decisions. Accordingly, the plaintiffs argue that the promotions made from special certifications based on race and gender must be deemed unconstitutional and invalid. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in relevant part, that no State shall \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d The standard for equal protection analysis under our Declaration of Rights is the same as under the Federal Constitution. See <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., 396 </em>Mass. 740, 743 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin Fruit Co., </em>388 Mass. 228, 235 (1983). The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that every citizen be treated identically but, rather, that an adequate explanation be given for treating citizens differently. See <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>323 F.3d 160, 168 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 825 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">As to the minority promotions, classifications based on race are inherently suspect and, therefore, are subject to strict judicial scrutiny. <em>See Adarand Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995); <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Educ., </em>476 U.S. 267, 273 (1986). See also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>437 Mass. 521, 533 (2002). A classification based on race will be upheld where its proponents demonstrate that such classification serves a compelling State interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>J.A. Croson Co., </em>488 U.S. 469, 493, 505 (1989) (city failed to demonstrate compelling interest in apportioning public contracts on basis of race); <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Bd. ofEduc., supra </em>at 274. The burden of production is on the governmental actor to show that a racial classification is justified. See <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 168 n.6. See also <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pena, supra </em>at 224. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>However, the ultimate burden of persuasion rests on those challenging an affirmative action plan to demonstrate that it is unconstitutional. See <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Educ., supra </em>at 277-278.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The remedying of past racial discrimination is a compelling State interest as long as there is a \u201c \u2018strong basis in evidence\u2019 for the conclusion that the [affirmative action plan] at issue serves a remedial purpose with respect to past discrimination.\u201d <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Roache, </em>951 F.2d 446, 450 (1st Cir. 1991), cert, denied, 504 U.S. 913 (1992), quoting <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>J.A. Croson Co., supra </em>at 500. See <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Educ., supra </em>at 277; <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>147 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 1998). \u201cThe \u2018strong basis in evidence\u2019 may consist of \u2018either a contemporaneous or antecedent finding of past discrimination by a court or other competent body, or evidence approaching a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 169, quoting <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, supra. </em>The evidence of discrimination must be specific to the agency seeking to use a racial preference; discrimination in society as a whole will not support an affirmative action plan. See <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Educ., supra </em>at 274, 276. \u201c[T]he relevant analysis in cases involving proof of discrimination by statistical disparity focuses on those disparities that demonstrate such prior governmental discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, citing <em>Hazelwood Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>433 U.S. 299 (1977). \u201cIn the absence of particularized findings, a court could uphold remedies that are ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.\u201d <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Educ., supra </em>at 276. The question whether current remedial action is warranted by past discrimination is, accordingly, fact driven. See <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 21. We turn, therefore, to consider whether there was a strong basis in evidence to show that the MBTA\u2019s past employment practices discriminated against minorities, necessitating the implementation of Rule 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Racial discrimination in hiring practices pertaining to Massachusetts police officers has been established in prior judicial determinations. In <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>459 F.2d 725, 728, 735-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>736 (1st Cir. 1972), the court found that civil service examinations used before 1970 had a racially discriminatory impact on minorities who applied for jobs as police officers in various Massachusetts municipalities and agencies, including the MBTA. Nearly twenty years later, in <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Roache, supra </em>at 452, the court recognized that discriminatory hiring practices, such as those found in <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Beecher, supra, </em>have a significant impact beyond the entry level, affecting the number of minorities who ultimately reach the supervisory level. \u201c[Rjemedial action takes time, and discrimination may linger for many years in an organization that had excluded blacks from its ranks.\u201d <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Roache, supra. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>480 U.S. 149, 168-169 (1987) (plurality opinion) (where \u201c[djiscrimination at the entry level necessarily precluded blacks from competing for promotions, and resulted in a departmental hierarchy dominated exclusively by nonminorities[,j . . . [the department cannot] segregate the results achieved by its hiring practices and those achieved by its promotional practices\u201d); <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 20-21. Cf. <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>445 Mass. 611, 624 (2005) (MBTA management \u201cmust put an end to any legacy of discrimination that still pervades that authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In May, 1996, minorities comprised 27.6% of the patrol officers employed by the MBTA police department (fifty officers out of 181).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In comparison, minorities constituted only 7% of all sergeants in the MBTA police department (one sergeant out of fourteen), and there were no minority lieutenants. Of the sixteen highest ranking officers employed by the MBTA police department, comprised of nine lieutenants, one captain, five majors, and one chief, only one such officer (a major) was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>black, or 6.2% of this group. While the MBTA has made significant progress in remedying discriminatory hiring practices, as evidenced by the number of minority patrol officers, the effects of such discrimination linger at the supervisory level.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 170-171 (\u201cPast discrimination in the hiring of minorities has limited the opportunity for minorities to move up through the ranks, and recent statistics show that these effects remain\u201d). If the MBTA had based its promotion decisions on strict rank order, as determined by scores on a competitive examination, the statistical disparity between minority and nonminority officers would have been even more pronounced. No black officers would have been promoted to fill any of the seven sergeant positions. Consequently, minorities would have comprised only 4.8% of all sergeants in the MBTA police department (one sergeant out of twenty-one). Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, we do not think that the MBTA\u2019s evidence of past racial discrimination is too temporally remote or statistically insignificant to justify a conclusion that such discrimination has had a readily apparent effect on the promotion of minority officers. Rule 10 serves a compelling State interest in remedying the ongoing effects of past racial discrimination. The plaintiffs have failed to make a sufficient demonstration to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As to the promotions of women, classifications based on gender, unlike race, are not inherently suspect under the United States Constitution and, therefore, are subject only to an intermediate level of scrutiny. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>518 U.S. 515, 532-533 &amp; n.6 (1996). See also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Jeter, 486 </em>U.S. 456, 461 (1988). To withstand such judicial scrutiny, the State must show that the challenged classification is \u201csubstantially related to an important governmental objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra </em>at 533. In contrast, under the Massachusetts Equal Rights Amendment,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cclassifications on the basis of sex are subject to a degree of constitutional scrutiny \u2018at least as strict as the scrutiny required by the Fourteenth Amendment for racial classifications.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>378 Mass. 342, 354 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 21 (1977). Such classifications \u201cwill be upheld only if a compelling interest justifies the classification and if the impact of the classification is limited as narrowly as possible consistent with its proper purpose.\u201d <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 666 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">As alluded to in our discussion of racial discrimination, \u201cabsent explanation, it is ordinarily to be expected that nondiscriminatory hiring practices will in time result in a work force more or less representative of the . . . composition of the population in the community from which employees are hired.\u201d <em>International Bhd. of Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 339 n.20 (1977). A statistical imbalance, however, may be a telltale sign of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere gross statistical disparities can be shown, they alone may in a proper case constitute prima facie proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination.\u201d <em>Hazelwood Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>433 U.S. 299, 307-308 (1977) (analyzing statistical proof that school district engaged in pattern or practice of teacher employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964). See <em>International Bhd. of Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 339. Cf. <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 228 &amp; n.9 (1978) (discrimination may be inferred from disparate treatment of two groups as evidenced by statistical disparities).

To the extent that a significant statistical disparity exists between the composition of a public employer\u2019s workforce and the relevant qualified applicant pool, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>such employer has the requisite basis for believing that remedial action is necessary. See <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>323 F.3d 160, 170 (1st Cir. 2003). See also <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Educ., 416 </em>U.S. 267, 292 (1986) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Roache, </em>951 F.2d 446, 451 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">When, as here, special qualifications are necessary to fill particular jobs,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cthe relevant statistical pool for purposes of demonstrating discriminatory exclusion must be the number of [women] qualified to undertake the particular task.\u201d <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>J.A. Croson Co., </em>488 U.S. 469, 501-502 (1989). More specifically, the proper comparison is between the gender composition of the MBTA police department and the gender composition of the qualified police officer population in the relevant labor market. See <em>Hazelwood Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 308. When evaluating discriminatory exclusion with respect to certain entry level positions or those requiring minimal training, a court need only view statistical comparisons between the composition of an employer\u2019s workforce and the composition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the general population as probative of discriminatory practices. See <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>J.A. Croson Co., supra </em>at 501; <em>International Bhd. of Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 337-338.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">As an initial matter, data from the 1990 census showed that women constituted 13.9% of the potential applicants in the labor force available for \u201cprotective service\u201d positions. See note 12, <em>supra. </em>However, in 1996, women comprised only 6.6% of the patrol officers employed by the MBTA police department (twelve officers of 181). Women constituted 7% of all sergeants in the MBTA police department (one sergeant of fourteen), and 11% of all lieutenants (one lieutenant of nine). Of the sixteen highest ranking officers employed by the MBTA police department, comprised of nine lieutenants, one captain, five majors, and one chief, only two such officers (one lieutenant and one captain) were female, or 12.5% of this group. If the MBTA had based its promotion decisions on strict rank order, as determined by scores on a competitive examination, no female officers would have been promoted to fill any of the seven sergeant positions. Consequently, women would have constituted only 4.8% of all sergeants in the MBTA police department (one sergeant of twenty-one).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Following a remand to the commission, the MBTA had been allowed to present additional evidence as to the statistical disparity between the number of women who were qualified to be police officers in Massachusetts and the number of women who were employed by the MBTA police department. See note 13, <em>supra. </em>In his supplemental report setting forth a \u201cStatistical Analysis of Female Representation in the MBTA Police Force,\u201d Dr. Cupingood presented data for the years 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1994, as to the numbers of male and female applicants for police officer positions in Massachusetts, the numbers of those applicants who took the required examination, and the numbers of applicants who passed it. He opined that, based on his analysis of this data, women were, from a statistical perspective, significantly underrepresented in the MBTA police department. Women comprised 15.4% of the total applicants, 15.0% of the applicants who took the examination, and 14.8% of those who passed it. Dr. Cupingood applied the same statistical methodology as used in an earlier report, which was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>same methodology relied on by the first Superior Court judge in her October 20, 1998, decision. Using the 14.8% benchmark of female availability (women who had passed the examination), Dr. Cupingood opined that there was an underrepresentation of 16.2 females in the MBTA police department in May, 1996.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Dr. Cupingood stated that a shortfall of 16.2 women was significant and corresponded to a statistical disparity of 3.14 standard deviations, meaning that there was approximately a one in 600 probability that such occurrence had happened by chance. This statistical disparity of 3.14 standard deviations exceeded the benchmark of three standard deviations adopted by the first Superior Court judge as the measure for a \u201cstrong basis in evidence\u201d of past discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Taking a broader view of hiring practices by the MBTA police department, Dr. Cupingood opined that, using the 14.8% benchmark of female availability, there was a statistically significant shortfall of 18.2 women hired from 1986 to 1996.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A shortfall of 18.2 females corresponded to a statistical disparity of 3.78 standard deviations, meaning that there was approximately a one in 6,000 probability that such occurrence had happened by chance. Again, this statistical disparity of 3.78 standard deviations exceeded the three standard deviations benchmark adopted by the first Superior Court judge. The plaintiffs did not challenge Dr. Cupingood\u2019s statistical methodology or present any witnesses to discredit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">As to promotional decisions made by the MBTA police department, Dr. Cupingood opined that the data with respect to the positions of sergeant and lieutenant was simply too small to be amenable to statistical analysis. This deficiency, however, was not fatal to the MBTA\u2019s case for showing that a gender classification was justified. Dr. Cupingood still opined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>small number of women occupying the positions of sergeant and lieutenant was consistent with a pattern of underutilization of women in the MBTA police department. Moreover, as we discussed in our analysis of racial discrimination, to the extent that women were not being hired in statistically significant numbers by the MBTA police department in the first instance, there was no way that they could be promoted in statistically significant numbers. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>480 U.S. 149, 168 (1987); <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>147 F.3d 13, 20-21 (1st Cir. 1998); <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Roache, </em>951 F.2d 446, 452 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We conclude that the MBTA\u2019s evidence of gross statistical disparities between the number of women who were qualified to be police officers in Massachusetts and the number of women who were hired for positions in the MBTA police department constituted prima facie evidence of a past practice of discrimination. The chief of the MBTA police department had the requisite firm basis for believing that remedial action was necessary. As such, Rule 10 served a compelling State interest in addressing the ongoing effects of past gender discrimination. The plaintiffs have failed to meet their ultimate burden of demonstrating that the implementation of Rule 10, permitting special certifications based on gender, was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Once the proponents of an affirmative action plan show that it serves a compelling State interest, a court then considers whether such remedial action is narrowly tailored to address the particular harm at issue. See <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Educ., supra </em>at 274; <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Roache, supra </em>at 453. See also <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, supra </em>at 666. Narrow tailoring ensures that the \u201cmeans chosen \u2018fit\u2019 [the government\u2019s] compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate . . . prejudice or stereotype.\u201d <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>J.A. Croson Co., supra </em>at 493. We analyze several factors in determining whether a remedial measure is narrowly tailored, including \u201cthe extent to which (i) the beneficiaries of the order are specially advantaged; (ii) the legitimate expectancies of others are frustrated or encumbered; (iii) the order interferes with other valid state or local policies; and (iv) the order contains (or fails to contain) built-in mechanisms which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>will, if time and events warrant, shrink its scope and limit its duration.\u201d <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 23, quoting <em>Mackin </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>969 F.2d 1273, 1278 (1st Cir. 1992), cert, denied, 506 U.S. 1078 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The plaintiffs contend that Rule 10 is not narrowly tailored to redress purported discrimination against minorities and women in the MBTA police department because the evidence did not demonstrate that those groups, in fact, had suffered discriminatory treatment in the past. We disagree and conclude that Rule 10 was narrowly tailored to satisfy the MBTA\u2019s compelling interest in eliminating racial and gender discrimination in the hiring and promotion practices of its police department. When evaluating an affirmative action plan, the fact that only <em>qualified </em>minority and female candidates, meaning those who have passed the required examinations, are \u201cspecially advantaged\u201d is an \u201cimportant indicium of narrow tailoring.\u201d <em>Mackin </em>v. <em>Boston, supra. </em>See <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Roache, supra </em>at 454. It suggests that promotions are not being made illegitimately or gratuitously to achieve racial or gender balance. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paradise, supra </em>at 177-178 (relief appropriate where qualified candidates promoted and State agency not obligated to make unnecessary or gratuitous promotions). Here, the police officers on the eligible lists for minority and female candidates had passed the required examinations and, thus, were qualified for promotion. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 65. See also <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 24. The plaintiffs have not asserted that the officers who were promoted to the ranks of sergeant and lieutenant were unqualified to perform the responsibilities of those jobs. See <em>id. </em>See also <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Roache, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">All of the MBTA police officers who hoped to be promoted were competing for a limited number of positions. The nature of competition is such that success is not automatic, but typically subject to a combination of variables. See <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>(expectation of promotion not firmly rooted where more candidates than available vacancies). See also <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>323 F.3d 160, 171 (1st Cir. 2003); <em>Mackin </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 1278. The civil service system does not guarantee an applicant a promotion \u201cat a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>date or upon a specific event.\u201d <em>Bielawski </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>422 Mass. 459, 466 (1996). See <em>Callanan </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r for the Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 597, 601 (1987) (\u201cindividuals do not have a vested right in their particular positions on the eligibility list once it is established\u201d); <em>Bums </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>619 F.2d 99, 104 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 449 U.S. 893 (1980) (expectation of promotion not property interest entitled to constitutional protection where subjective factors may be considered in addition to written examination score). The civil service system confers only limited rights on those individuals, like the plaintiffs, who pass the relevant examinations, but it gives broad discretion to the HRD to establish eligibility lists for promotion. See <em>Callanan </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r for the Commonwealth, supra. </em>Thus, while the plaintiffs have claimed that they were entitled to be promoted, and undoubtedly hoped that they would be, there was simply no guarantee that they would be successful in that endeavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We add that no valid policies have been disturbed by promoting qualified minorities and women to higher ranks within the MBTA police department. \u201cWhile Massachusetts law requires an explanation for promotions made outside of strict rank order, there is no prohibition on such out-of-rank decisions.\u201d <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 171-172. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27. Finally, no quotas with respect to promotions were established under Rule 10, and the MBTA\u2019s affirmative action program expired on January 1, 2000. Therefore, Rule 10 was limited in scope and duration. See <em>Mackin </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>(duration of affirmative action plan is significant factor in determining whether remedial action is overly broad). Rule 10 was a narrowly tailored means of addressing racial and gender discrimination in the hiring and promotion practices of the MBTA police department. The plaintiffs have failed to satisfy their ultimate burden of demonstrating that Rule 10 violated their rights to equal protection under the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">5. <em>Validity of Rule 10. </em>The plaintiffs contend that there is no statutory authority for the existence of Rule 10. The thrust of their argument is that nothing in G. L. c. 31 suggests a legislative intent to confer on the HRD the authority to create special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>classifications for promotions within the civil service. We disagree and conclude that, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the HRD had the statutory authority, pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 3, to certify separate lists of candidates for promotion, based on race and gender, as part of the MBTA\u2019s affirmative action plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The power of an administrative agency to promulgate rules or regulations is conferred by the Legislature. See <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 721, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S. 936 (1983). With respect to the present action, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 3, states that the \u201cadministrator [of the HRD] shall make and amend rules which shall regulate the recruitment, selection, training and employment of persons for civil service positions.\u201d These rules shall include provisions for \u201c[promotional appointments, on the basis of merit as determined by examination, performance evaluation, seniority of service <em>or any combination of factors </em>which fairly test the applicant\u2019s ability to perform the duties of the position as determined by the administrator\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 3 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u201cAn administrative agency . . . has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing, and regulations adopted by the agency stand on the same footing as statutes, with reasonable presumptions to be made in favor of their validity.\u201d <em>Student No. 9 </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>440 Mass. 752, 762-763 (2004). See <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 584, 587 (2002) (court will give \u201cdue weight and deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes within its charge\u201d). Such deference \u201cis necessary to maintain the separation between the powers of the Legislature and administrative agencies and the powers of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 723. When considering a challenge to a rule or regulation promulgated by an administrative agency, a court generally needs to find only \u201csome rational relation between the regulation and the empowering statute\u201d to uphold its validity. <em>White Dove, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Marine Fisheries, </em>380 Mass. 471, 477 (1980). See <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra. </em>The burden is on the party challenging the rule or regulation to show that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>conceivable basis on which it can be upheld. See <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Cambridge, </em>395 Mass. 535, 553 (1985); <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 776 (1980). \u201cA court will not declare a regulation void unless its provisions cannot, in any appropriate way, be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Student No. 9 </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., supra </em>at 763. See <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 771 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Rule 10 states that, once specified conditions are met, the HRD may certify the names of a designated number of individuals, who are members of a protected group and are on an eligible list for one or more available positions, in order of their standing. It does not dispense with the statutory requirement that an applicant take a promotional examination in the first instance, or with consideration of the applicant\u2019s performance on such examination. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 65 (promotional appointments in MBTA police department \u201cshall be made only after competitive examination\u201d). It merely allows a candidate\u2019s membership in a protected group to be considered along with the regular criteria for promotion in circumstances where it has been determined that prior practices of the appointing authority have discriminated against that protected group. Nothing in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 3 (&lt;?), mandates that promotions be made in strict rank order based only on examination results. Rather, the statute allows consideration of \u201cany combination of factors which fairly test the applicant\u2019s ability to perform the duties of the position as determined by the administrator.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27 (allowing promotion of qualified person other than one at top of eligibility list where appointing authority files written statement of reasons for such appointment). Cf. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 21 (allowing HRD to limit eligibility for any examination for original appointment to either men or women \u201cif the duties and responsibilities of such position require special physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>cal or medical standards or require custody or care of a person of a particular sex\u201d). Moreover, this court acknowledged the commission\u2019s approval of Rule 10 in <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, </em>434 Mass. 256, 264 (2001) (\u201ccivil service law allows consideration of race in promotion decisions as part of an approved affirmative action plan\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Here, both the commission and the first Superior Court judge concluded that Rule 10 was a valid exercise of the HRD\u2019s rule making authority under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 3, and we agree. On the record before us, we have no difficulty discerning a rational relation between Rule 10 and the empowering statute where the evidence demonstrates that prior practices of the MBTA police department resulted in discriminatory treatment of minorities and women. \u201cA regulation is essentially an expression of public policy.\u201d <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 721. Rule 10 was specifically designed to ensure that civil service hiring and promotion procedures did not run afoul of constitutional and statutory prohibitions against unlawful racial and gender discrimination. The plaintiffs have not come close to showing that the promulgation of Rule 10 was beyond the statutory authority conferred on the HRD by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">6. <em>Compliance with Rule 10. </em>The plaintiffs next contend that the MBTA and the HRD failed to satisfy the procedural requirements of Rule 10. They argue that when the chief of the MBTA police department requested special certifications based on race and gender, he submitted to the HRD only statistical data of the racial and gender composition of the MBTA\u2019s police force as of May, 1996. The plaintiffs point out that, pursuant to Rule 10 (1) (b), special certifications in the civil service shall be made when, inter alla, the HRD \u201chas made a written determination substantiating that previous practices of the . . . appointing authority with respect to the filling of [particular] positions have discriminated against members of a group, hereinafter referred to as a protected group, on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin.\u201d The plaintiffs assert that the mere requests by the MBTA police department for special certifications, together with the HRD\u2019s pro forma approval of such requests, did not constitute a written determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>MBTA police department had engaged in prior discriminatory practices against minorities and women with respect to promotional appointments. Therefore, the plaintiffs continue, the approval of such special certifications was unlawful, and the promotions based on eligible lists of minority and female candidates were invalid. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The commission found, and the first Superior Court judge agreed, that the HRD\u2019s written approval of the requests for special certifications and the posting of notices of intention to certify eligible lists of minority and female candidates constituted a good faith attempt by the HRD and the MBTA to comply with Rule 10. Further, the commission concluded that there was \u201cno suggestion or evidence in the record to show that the processing of these selective certifications was in any manner different from accepted procedure.\u201d A reviewing court \u201cshall give due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 210 (1983) (decision by commission that civil service rule not violated entitled to weight). See also <em>Amherst-Pelham Regional Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., </em>376 Mass. 480, 491 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We recognize that the HRD did not issue a written determination specifically enunciating that past hiring and promotion practices of the MBTA police department had resulted in discriminatory treatment of minorities and women. Nonetheless, we conclude that the statistical evidence presented by the MBTA, which was unrebutted and persuasive, and the HRD\u2019s written approval of the requests for special certifications were sufficient to satisfy the technical requirements of Rule 10. The plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the commission\u2019s decision was unlawful or that their substantial rights have been prejudiced in this regard. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).

A standard deviation of two approximately corresponds to a probability of occurrence of five percent.\u201d \u201cTwo standard deviations is normally enough to show that it is extremely unlikely (that is, there is less than a 5% probability) that the disparity is due to chance, giving rise to a reasonable inference that the hiring was not race-neutral; the more standard deviations away, the less likely the factor in question played no role in the decisionmaking process.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Ameritech Servs., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 414, 424 (7th Cir. 2000). See <em>Hazelwood Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>433 U.S. 299, 308 n.14 (1977). Dr. Cupingood opined that three standard deviations, the benchmark being used in this case, \u201cis particularly rare, and might occur only three times in a thousand.\u201d The plaintiffs have not challenged the adoption of this three standard deviations benchmark by the first Superior Court judge, and as such, it is the law of the case. See <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 599 (1940) (\u201cWhere there has been no change of circumstances, a court or judge is not bound to reconsider a case, an issue, or a question of fact or law, once decided\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\">When the chief of the MBTA police department requested special certifications based on race and gender, he supported such requests with statistical data setting forth the demographics of the MBTA police department in May, 1996, and September, 1996. In proceedings before the Superior Court, the respective judges found that the statistical data from May, 1996, varied only slightly from the statistical data from September, 1996. We rely here on the statistics from May, 1996, because they appear to be more detailed and comprehensive, and because any differences are not significant enough to be material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We note that on February 6, 1997, the MBTA entered into an equal employment opportunity agreement and compliance program with the Attorney General\u2019s office and numerous labor organizations, pursuant to which the MBTA agreed to \u201ctake effective action to prevent and eliminate discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, religious creed, age and disability with regard to employment or the terms and conditions of employment including, but not limited to, <em>promotions, </em>terminations, transfers, job assignments and discipline\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Article 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments, provides in part: \u201cEquality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In her concurring opinion in <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Educ., </em>476 U.S. 267, 286 (1986), Justice O\u2019Connor pointed out that \u201c[t]he Court is in agreement that. . . remedying past or present racial discrimination by a state actor is a sufficiently weighty state interest to warrant the remedial use of a carefully constructed affirmative action program.
