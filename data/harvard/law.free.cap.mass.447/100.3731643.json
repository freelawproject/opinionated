L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27F, covered the time spent by truck drivers hauling bituminous concrete<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to and from the construction site (road time). The deputy director of the division of occupational safety (division) conducted a public hearing and, in a written decision dated August 21, 2001, concluded that the prevailing wage law did not cover drivers\u2019 road time, rescinding the 1993 policy. The plaintiffs, all labor organizations whose representatives include truck drivers who haul bituminous concrete and ready-mix concrete to public construction projects, sought review of the decision, and a Superior Court judge entered a declaration in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. The defendants appealed, and we transferred this case here on our own motion. Because we conclude that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden to show that the decision of the deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>director was arbitrary or capricious, and because we grant due deference to the deputy director\u2019s interpretation of the prevailing wage statute, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>Statutory scheme. </em>The director (or commissioner)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the department administered the prevailing wage law, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 26-27F, through the division. G. L. c. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3. Under the prevailing wage law, the director establishes the hourly rate of wages for \u201cmechanics and apprentices, teamsters, chauffeurs and laborers\u201d who are employed in the construction of public works. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The director prepares a list of the jobs usually performed on public works projects and, when requested, assigns to each job the minimum wage that must be paid to persons performing that job. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 27A of c. 149, provides an administrative mechanism for review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>of the commissioner\u2019s wage determinations and classifications of employment. There is no provision for appeal from a decision made pursuant to \u00a7 27A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Violators of the prevailing wage law may be punished by a fine, imprisonment, or both. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27C. The Attorney General is charged with the law\u2019s enforcement. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><em>Background and procedure. </em>In 1993, the commissioner (St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 72) issued a policy statement that teamsters who hauled bituminous concrete, ready-mix concrete, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201cjersey barriers\u201d were covered by the prevailing wage law both for their road time as well as for their time at the construction site.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition to the prevailing wage law, the commissioner cited our decision in <em>Construction Indus, of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>406 Mass. 162 (1989) <em>(Construction </em>Industries), as authority for the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Consistent with the 1993 policy, in July, 2001, in connection with a Massachusetts Highway Department construction project, the division issued wage rate sheets that included road time for drivers hauling bituminous concrete. The defendant businesses and organizations then filed an appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27A, contesting the application of the prevailing wage law to the drivers\u2019 road time. After a public hearing conducted in accordance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27A, the deputy director issued his written decision, which rescinded the 1993 policy, ruling that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201cDrivers who deliver bituminous concrete or ready mix concrete to public construction projects . . . are covered by the prevailing wage law while they are on-site at the public construction project. Those drivers are not covered by the prevailing wage law while off-site, including over-the-road driving and picking-up materials. All drivers who operate trucks on public construction sites as part of the construction work are covered by the prevailing wage law while they are on-site.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In his decision, the deputy director stated that, since the <em>Construction Industries </em>opinion, \u201cbituminous drivers have been undisputedly covered by the prevailing wage law while at the work site,\u201d but noted that the court\u2019s decision did not address whether drivers of bituminous concrete are entitled to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>prevailing wage rates for road time. Because the prevailing wage law repeatedly references the employment of workers \u201con said works,\u201d with the exception of drivers who haul gravel or fill, the deputy director concluded that \u201c[a]ny regulation of the wages of off-site workers, except drivers who haul gravel or fill, is an expansion of the statute\u2019s applicability beyond its clearly stated scope.\u201d The deputy director also concluded that the 1993 policy was not a correct interpretation of the intent of the prevailing wage statute. He further noted that his conclusion was consistent with the Federal prevailing wage law that covers workers\u2019 on-site time only.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The plaintiffs sought review of the deputy director\u2019s decision in the Superior Court. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231A and relief in the nature of a writ of certiorari pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The parties filed cross motions for judgment on the pleadings. A Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings and denied the State defendants\u2019 cross motion. The judge ordered the entry of a judgment declaring that the director \u201cis empowered and indeed duty bound to set wages pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27F, for the over-the-road hours of teamsters who haul bituminous or ready-mix concrete provided said hours and said teamsters have substantial connection or nexus with the site of public construction.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The defendants filed notices of appeal. A single justice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Appeals Court entered a stay of the Superior Court judgment pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><em>Standard of review. </em>Because the prevailing wage law contains no provision for judicial review of a decision of the director or his designee, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 <em>27A </em>(\u201cThe decision of the [director] or his designee shall be final\u201d), the plaintiffs\u2019 resort to certiorari was not inappropriate. See <em>School Comm. of Franklin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>395 Mass. 800, 807 &amp; n.6 (1985) (\u201c[r]esort to certiorari may not be had if another adequate remedy is available\u201d). See also <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth, </em>430 Mass. 783, 790 (2000), quoting <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604, 605 (1988) (G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, provides limited judicial review to correct substantial error of law affecting material rights). \u201cThe standard of review for an action in the nature of certiorari depends on \u2018the nature of the action sought to be reviewed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Black Rose, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>433 Mass. 501, 503 (2001), quoting <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 49 (1977). Although <em>Felix A. Marino Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>426 Mass. 458, 464 (1998), did not address directly the proper avenue to obtain review of a decision of the commissioner (or his designee) under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 <em>27A, </em>it stated that because the plaintiff in that case challenged the commissioner\u2019s decision \u201c[b]y allegations in the nature of a petition for a writ of certiorari,\u201d the plaintiff had to establish that the decision was arbitrary or capricious. See <em>Receiver of the Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>396 Mass. 50, 58 (1985) (wage rate determination subject to arbitrary or capricious standard). A decision is not arbitrary or capricious unless there is no ground which \u201creasonable [people] might deem proper\u201d to support it. <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>329 Mass. 314, 318 (1952). \u201cWe give great deference to the [agency\u2019s] expertise and experience in areas where the Legislature has delegated to it decision making authority . . . .\u201d <em>Box Pond Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 412 (2001), quoting <em>Wolf </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>407 Mass. 363, 367 (1990). Moreover, we accord no special weight to the decision of the Superior Court judge in reviewing the record before the deputy director. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Stoughton, </em>437 Mass. 1, 5 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the Superior Court judge was correct in concluding that the decision of the deputy director was arbitrary and capricious<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> because the statute covers road time for haulers of bituminous concrete. In support of their assertion, the plaintiffs rely on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Construction Industries. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In <em>Construction Industries, supra </em>at 163, the plaintiffs, two trade associations and four truck owners, sought a declaration that the commissioner lacked authority under the prevailing wage law to set wages for track drivers who deliver bituminous concrete to public works construction sites. After defining bituminous concrete, the court explained how it is used in the construction of roads and highways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">\u201cThe manufacture of bituminous concrete takes place at either a stationary plant, from which it is then transported to the construction site or, in some cases, at portable on-site plants. In either case, the bituminous concrete is hauled by track from the site of manufacture to the location where it is laid down. The role of the track driver is the same whether the bituminous concrete is manufactured on the site or at a stationary plant. After loading the track, the driver proceeds to the application site. The driver then backs the truck up to a device called a spreader and dumps the concrete into the spreader\u2019s hopper. The spreader is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>used to lay the concrete down evenly. A \u2018roller\u2019 follows the spreader and compacts the layer of bituminous concrete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">\u201cIt usually takes several \u2018lifts\u2019 to empty a truck. . . . The truck driver continues to dump concrete into the spreader until his truck is empty. He then leaves the site, fills the truck again, returns to the site, and repeats the entire process. During the dumping and spreading procedure, the truck driver takes directions from the spreader operator and the foreman. It takes from five to fifteen minutes to complete the process and empty the truck.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 164. The court stated: \u201cIt is beyond dispute that the truck drivers at issue are \u2018teamsters\u2019 [for purposes of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167. However, based on limiting language in the statute, the court went on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">\u201cQuite clearly, the commissioner has not been given authority to set wages for all teamsters who have any connection with a public works project. . . . [T]he limits of the commissioner\u2019s authority to set wages . . . are governed by the physical locus of the work site itself and the work which is performed there. The commissioner is empowered to set wages for teamsters when there is a significant nexus between the work those teamsters perform and the site of the construction project. In simple terms, the commissioner must ask, \u2018What do they do at the site?\u2019 When the performance of a statutorily specified job has a significant connection with the construction project, then that job falls within the domain of the posted wage law statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 168. The court concluded that the commissioner had authority \u201cto set wages for the teamsters employed by the plaintiffs who haul bituminous concrete to public works projects and then aid in its installation,\u201d noting that the truck drivers are more than \u201cmaterialmen\u201d because \u201cthey work with the road crew to spread the bituminous concrete,\u201d thus rendering their activities \u201can essential part of the work done at the site.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 169. Therefore, the decision affirmed that the commissioner has fairly broad policy-making authority because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Legislature delegated the details of how the prevailing wage law should be applied, subject to certain limits. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 173. Most importantly, nowhere in the <em>Construction Industries </em>case did the court address whether the wage rates that the commissioner had authority to set included road time.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In further reliance on <em>Construction Industries, supra, </em>the plaintiffs argue that the deputy director erred because the prevailing wage law is not ambiguous. Thus, they argue, the decision of the deputy director is entitled to no deference. The plaintiffs read too much into the court\u2019s statements that the statute is not ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 169 n.5. As discussed, the issue whether road time was covered was not addressed. In addition, the court\u2019s conclusion concerning the clarity of the statute\u2019s language was made in the context of the commissioner\u2019s authority to set wages for teamsters whose work had a significant connection with the work site.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The opinion does not assist the plaintiffs\u2019 argument. See generally <em>Felix A. Marino Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>426 Mass. 458, 461 (1998) (\u201cword \u2018construction\u2019 in \u00a7 26 is ambiguous standing alone\u201d). Moreover, the plain language of the statute does not refer to road time. See notes 6 and 7, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, the decision in this case is entitled to deference because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Legislature has delegated decision-making authority to the commissioner. <em>Box Pond Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 412 (2001). G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27F. See <em>Felix A. Marino Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., supra </em>(where question whether work fell under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27H, \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d deference to commissioner\u2019s discretion required).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In concluding that the statute did not cover road time, the deputy director relied on the words in the statute \u201c \u2018on said works,\u2019 \u2018upon [public works projects],\u2019 and \u2018on various types of public works.\u2019 \u201d To support his exclusion of road time, he also noted that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27, contained a single specific exception for individuals who transport \u201cgravel or fill to the site of said public works or remov[e] gravel or fill from such site.\u201d Discussing the rule of statutory construction stated in <em>Harbor-view Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Auth., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975) (\u201ca statutory expression of one thing is an implied exclusion of other things omitted from the statute\u201d), the deputy director concluded that the Legislature intended that only haulers of gravel and fill would be covered for road time. These are reasonable grounds for interpreting the statute. We do not impose our own judgment where an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reasonable. <em>Massachusetts Med. Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. 44, 62 (1988). We conclude that the decision was not arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The plaintiffs argue that, even if the decision of the deputy director is entitled to deference, the decision is still arbitrary or capricious because covering road time under the prevailing wage statute has been a policy for twenty-five years. See <em>Cleary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 343-344 (1964) (\u201cSignificance in interpretation may be given to a consistent, long continued administrative application of an ambiguous statute,\u201d but interpretation or regulation may not conflict with statute). The plaintiffs point to nothing in the record that demonstrates that the policy of covering drivers of bituminous concrete for road time existed before the 1993 policy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, the 1993 document itself indicates that it is a new policy. It has an effective date of July 1, 1993, and states that the policy would \u201cnot apply to on-going investigations or projects out to bid or award before the effective date.\u201d As discussed, the 1993 policy relied on the statute as well as the <em>Construction Industries </em>case, which we have concluded did not address the issue whether road time was covered. It was not arbitrary or capricious for the deputy director, after analyzing the statute\u2019s language, to conclude that in setting the 1993 policy, the then \u201ccommissioner expanded his authority under the statute beyond its plain meaning.\u201d \u201c[T]he commissioner is charged with the implementation of the prevailing wage law,\u201d <em>Felix A. Marino Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., supra </em>at 460, the statute makes his decisions final, and the deputy director changed the policy through a public hearing pursuant to the appeal process in \u00a7 27. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>BayBank Middlesex, </em>421 Mass. 736, 741-742 (1996) (\u201ccommissioner\u2019s expertise in tax matters might even bring the commissioner to the conclusion that a prior interpretation of a statute or regulation was wrong and should be changed\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the Superior Court judge is vacated. A new judgment shall enter declaring that the decision of the deputy director that the prevailing wage law does not cover the over-the-road time of drivers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>of bituminous concrete was not arbitrary or capricious and is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-12\">Since 1993 the department has been reorganized or renamed several times.

In his decision, the deputy director noted that testimony was received in opposition to the inclusion of ready-mix drivers, but that \u201cthe opponents to the scope of the hearing failed to present any reasoning as to why the work of ready-mix drivers is dissimilar to the work of bituminous drivers and should be treated singularly.\u201d The decision included ready-mix drivers, but this appeal pertains only to drivers of bituminous concrete.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The plaintiffs also had included a count under G. L. c. 30A, but it was dismissed on the State defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss by another Superior Court judge, who concluded that judicial review in the nature of certiorari under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, is an appropriate remedy. There was no appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In reaching his conclusion, the judge stated that the deputy director\u2019s interpretation of the terms \u201con\u201d and \u201cupon\u201d in the statute were \u201ctoo wooden.\u201d The judge emphasized that the \u201csignificant nexus\u201d required under the <em>Construction Industries </em>decision connotes more than mere physical presence. A \u201csignificant connection\u201d is also required, which the judge found to be undisputed due to the \u201cintegral\u201d role played by these truck drivers. In addition, the judge stated that \u201cthe plain requirement of [\u00a7\u00a7 ] 26 and 27 is that the director set wages for the entire job these teamsters perform not just the on-site hours.\u201d The judge concluded that to uphold the deputy director\u2019s decision would frustrate the statute\u2019s purpose of protecting teamsters from substandard earnings because the nature of the teamsters\u2019 jobs \u201cprevents them from being physically present on the work site throughout the entire work day,\u201d and would result in a \u201ctwo tiered pay scale,\u201d an \u201cabsurd and unfair\u201d result. Last, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the judge reasoned that, \u201cby including the term \u2018teamsters\u2019 within the statute, the Legislature meant professional truck drivers and also understood that the nature of the occupation involved a substantial amount of driving to and from a public work site.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The State defendants argue that the Superior Court judge erroneously conducted a de nova review of the case, instead of conducting review pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4 (certiorari), to determine whether the deputy director\u2019s decision was arbitrary or capricious. While the judge refused to extend any deference to the deputy director\u2019s decision because he viewed the issue as a matter of statutory construction solely for the court, he did conclude that the decision was arbitrary or capricious due to the \u201cabsurd\u201d results it creates (a two-tiered pay scale for the teamsters and a limitation on their pay where the nature of the job prevents them from being present on the worksite throughout the entire day). Thus, while deference to the deputy director\u2019s decision should have been extended, the ultimate relevant inquiry, whether the decision was arbitrary or capricious, was followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> The two statements on which the plaintiffs rely are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u201cThe commissioner is empowered to set wages for teamsters when there is a significant nexus between the work those teamsters perform and the site of the construction project. In simple terms, the commissioner must ask, \u2018What do they do at the site?\u2019 When the performance of a statutorily specified job has a significant connection with the construction project, then that job falls within the domain of the posted wage statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\"><em>Construction Industries, supra </em>at 168.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">\u201cGeneral Laws c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 27, are not ambiguous. The plain requirement of these provisions is that the commissioner set wage rates for teamsters (among others) whose work has a significant connection with the work site.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 169 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The latter conclusion was in the context whether, because of the maxim that an ambiguous penal statute should be construed narrowly, drivers who hauled bituminous concrete should be excluded from the statute\u2019s reach altogether. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The plaintiffs further argue that the <em>Construction Industries </em>case rendered the deputy director\u2019s reliance on the rule of statutory construction \u201ca bald attempt to relitigate a matter of settled law.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 169 (court need not address rule of statutory construction that expression of one thing implies exclusion of other things because \u201cwe think the plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental assumption that [teamsters] are mere materialmen is mistaken\u201d). We decline to address this argument because, even if the plaintiffs are correct, the deputy director\u2019s reliance on the statute\u2019s language alone provides reasonable grounds for his interpretation. For the same reason, we need not address the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the deputy director\u2019s consideration whether his interpretation of the prevailing wage law aligned with the Federal wage statute, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141 (2000 &amp; Supp. H 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In support of their contention, they rely on <em>Construction Industries, supra </em>at 164-165, where the court stated: \u201cSince at least 1976, the commissioner has considered those truckers who haul bituminous concrete to the site of public works projects and aid in the application of that concrete, to be teamsters employed on those sites.\u201d However, there is nothing that indicates that teamsters who haul bituminous concrete were covered for their road time since 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In light of our conclusion, we need not address the parties\u2019 differing public policy arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
