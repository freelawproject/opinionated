Bulger was employed by the Commonwealth for forty-two years, having served in the Massachusetts General Court from 1961 until 1995 (the last seventeen years as President of the Senate), and as president of the University of Massachusetts (university) from 1996 until his resignation on September 1, 2003. On that date he became eligible for a superannuation retirement allowance under our State retirement system in accordance with G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5 (1). This case requires us to decide whether payments to Bulger in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the form of a monthly cash housing allowance, and payments made by the university into an annuity fund in his name, qualify as \u201cregular compensation,\u201d as that term is defined by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, for purposes of calculating the retirement allowance to which he is entitled. The Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) determined that the payments did not so qualify, and Bulger sought judicial review of CRAB\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. A judge in the Superior Court concluded that CRAB had erred and, consequently, allowed Bulger\u2019s motion to amend CRAB\u2019s decision to include as \u201cregular compensation\u201d the housing allowance payments and those annuity payments made from January 5, 2001, until August 31, 2003. We granted CRAB\u2019s application for direct appellate review. For reasons that follow, we conclude that the value of Bulger\u2019s monthly housing allowance is includable as an element of \u201cregular compensation\u201d under \u00a7 1, but that the annuity payments made on his behalf are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">1. The relevant facts, summarized below, were established by stipulation of the parties at a hearing before the division of administrative law appeals (DALA), and they were adopted by CRAB. Only the final three years of Bulger\u2019s employment, from September 1, 2000, until August 31, 2003, are material to this appeal. Bulger and the board of trustees of the university (trustees) negotiated the terms of his compensation for those years, and those terms are set forth in three letter agreements dated October 28, 1998; October 1, 2000; and June 3, 2002. From September 1, 2000, until June 30, 2001, Bulger\u2019s salary was $280,000 a year. From July 1, 2001, until his resignation, his salary was $309,000 a year. Throughout the relevant three-year period, Bulger also received a monthly cash housing allowance of $2,419, a benefit provided pursuant to the university\u2019s executive compensation package and applicable to the president of the university and each chancellor of the university\u2019s five campuses. In relevant part, the executive compensation package states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">\u201cA monthly housing allowance in an amount established by the Board of Trustees at the time of appointment, shall be paid to the President and to each Chancellor who does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>not have a campus residence. In addition, cleaning and catering expenses directly related to University business events shall be reimbursed. As a condition of employment, a Chancellor may be required to live in a campus-provided residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Bulger received his housing allowance as part of his regular paycheck, and at all relevant times, he treated the allowance as taxable income on his Federal and State tax returns.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">An additional benefit provided pursuant to the executive compensation package was monthly contributions, equal to seven per cent of Bulger\u2019s annual base salary, to an annuity fund. The letter agreement of October 28, 1998, in relevant part, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\u201cSaid fund shall be in the name of the University and in the event that prior to January 4, 2001, you shall leave the employ of the University . . . then all amounts deposited in the fund and all earnings thereon shall remain the property of the University and you shall forfeit all rights to said funds. In the event that you remain as President of the University until January 4, 2001, on that date all amounts deposited in said fund and all earnings thereon shall be distributed to you [and in] the event you remain as President after July, 2003, any further payments into an investment fund shall be in an amount and under such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Board Chair after consultation with you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The letter agreement of October 1, 2000, designated that \u201c[cjommencing on January 5, 2001 and annually thereafter, as part of your regular compensation, the University shall deposit into a 401A account or other appropriate tax-deferred investment vehicle of your choice an amount equal to seven per cent (7%) of your base salary in each year.\u201d This language was modified in the letter agreement of June 3, 2002, as follows: \u201cAs part of your regular compensation, the University shall deposit into a 403(b) account or other appropriate tax-deferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>investment vehicle of your choice an amount equal to seven per cent (7%) of your base salary in each year.\u201d In accordance with the letter agreements, the university made monthly contributions in Bulger\u2019s name into a tax-deferred investment account entitled \u201cThe Vanguard Group 401(a) Executive Retirement Plan\u201d (Vanguard account).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3The Vanguard account was the only such retirement plan Bulger used while president of the university. No pension deductions were taken by the university on the funds deposited into the Vanguard account or on the value of the monthly housing allowance received by Bulger.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">As has been stated, Bulger resigned from his position as president of the university, effective September 1, 2003, and shortly thereafter submitted an application to receive his superannuation retirement allowance. General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 5 (2) (a), sets forth the basic formula for computing a member\u2019s superannuation retirement allowance, which is a factor of three components: (1) the member\u2019s age at retirement; (2) the number of years of service to the Commonwealth; and (3) the average annual rate of \u201cregular compensation received by such member<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> during any period of three consecutive years of creditable service\u201d or during the \u201clast three years of creditable service preceding retirement,\u201d whichever is greater (for our purposes, the last three years of Bulger\u2019s term as university president). Bulger\u2019s application to the State Board of Retirement (board) included a request that his monthly housing allowance and the payments into the Vanguard account in his name be included as part of his \u201cregular compensation\u201d for purposes of computing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>his retirement allowance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a letter of decision dated September 26, 2003, the board allowed Bulger\u2019s application for benefits, but denied his request to include his cash housing allowance and annuity payments in computing his retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Bulger appealed from the board\u2019s decision to CRAB. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4). CRAB assigned the appeal for a hearing before DALA, and the parties elected to waive a hearing and to submit the case on documents. The administrative magistrate issued a decision reversing the board\u2019s decision and allowing the housing allowance and annuity payments to be included as elements of Bulger\u2019s \u201cregular compensation.\u201d CRAB adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact, but did not accept her conclusion and order, ruling that the \u201conly element of [Bulger\u2019s] compensation package that is includable as regular compensation for purposes of calculating his pension is his base salary .... All other payments are excluded . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6Bulger sought judicial review of GRAB\u2019S decision in the Superior Court, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1), and CRAB entered a cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Considering the parties\u2019 cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, a Superior Court judge reversed CRAB\u2019s decision and allowed Bulger\u2019s motion to amend the decision to include as \u201cregular compensation\u201d both the housing allowance payments as well as the payments to the Vanguard account from January 5, 2001, until August 31, 2003.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on decisions of this court interpreting \u201cregular compensation\u201d to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>recurrent payments that are not inflated by extraordinary ad hoc payments such as bonuses or overtime pay, see <em>Bower </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>393 Mass. 427, 429 (1984); <em>Boston Ass\u2019n of Sch. Adm\u2019rs &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. 336, 339-340 (1981), and recognizing that the failure to take deductions from an employee\u2019s \u201cnon-salary compensation\u201d has never been considered a dispositive factor in determining whether that compensation falls within the definition of \u201cregular compensation,\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, for purposes of calculating an applicant\u2019s retirement benefit, see, e.g., <em>Bower </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra, </em>the judge concluded that the cash housing allowance paid to Bulger throughout the relevant three-year period qualified as \u201cregular compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Considering the funds paid into the Vanguard account in Bulger\u2019s name from January 5, 2001, onward, the judge reasoned that \u00a7 1 expressly includes \u201cpremiums paid by any governmental unit for the purchase of an individual or group annuity contract as authorized by [G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 18A],\u201d* ***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which authorizes the university to purchase, on behalf of any employee, \u201can individual or group annuity contract or any other investment approved by the internal revenue service guidelines relative to [\u00a7] 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code [I.R.C.].\u201d The judge further reasoned that, although the Vanguard account, ostensibly by its name, appeared to qualify for deferred tax treatment under I.R.C. \u00a7 401(a), it nevertheless also met requirements for tax deferred status under I.R.C. \u00a7 403(b). The judge concluded that the Vanguard account was an annuity plan authorized under G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 18A, and, therefore, was \u201cregular compensation\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. On the basis of his conclusions, the judge allowed Bulger\u2019s motion to amend the CRAB decision to include as \u201cregular compensation\u201d funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>paid to him as a monthly cash housing allowance and payments made into the Vanguard account after January 5, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">2. In reviewing CRAB\u2019s decision that the statutory definition of \u201cregular compensation\u201d encompasses neither the housing allowance nor the annuity payments, we are required to give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, ante </em>233, 241-242 (2006), and cases cited. We exercise de nova review of legal questions, however, and we must overturn agency decisions that are not consistent with governing law. See <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>426 Mass. 1, 5 (1997); <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>410 Mass. 890, 892 (1991); <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 595 (1974). The only dispute is whether the term \u201cregular compensation,\u201d as defined by the Legislature in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, encompasses (a) the cash housing allowances received by Bulger, and (b) the payments by the university into the Vanguard account after January 5, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We begin with the language of the statute. See <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>421 Mass. 344, 345-346 (1995). See also <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 242 (1985). General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 1, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201c \u2018Regular compensation\u2019 . . . shall mean the salary, wages or other compensation in whatever form, lawfully determined for the individual service of the employee by the employing authority,<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> not including bonus, overtime, severance pay for any and all unused sick leave, early retirement incentives, or any other payments made as a result of giving notice of retirement .... Regular compensation shall also include all premiums paid by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>governmental unit for the purchase of an individual or group annuity contract as authorized by [G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 18A,] or [G.L. c. 71, \u00a7 37B].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The statutory language is straightforward and unambiguous. We have recognized that the expression \u201cregular compensation\u201d \u201cpoint[s] to recurrent or repeated amounts of compensation not inflated by extraordinary ad hoc payments. . . . [M]oreover \u2018regular,\u2019 as it modifies \u2018compensation,\u2019 imports the idea of ordinariness or normality as well as the idea of recurrence.\u201d <em>Bower </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 429, quoting <em>Boston Ass\u2019n of Sch. Adm\u2019rs &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 341. The use of the terms \u201csalary, wages or other compensation in whatever form,\u201d denotes, unquestionably in our minds, a legislative intent to include the many distinct ways in which individuals are paid for their services. See <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 66, 69 (2000). As wages have a meaning apart from salary, see <em>id. </em>at 68-69, so \u201cother compensation in whatever form\u201d must be understood to encompass all other forms of recurring payments for an employee\u2019s services, so long as the payments comport with the other requirements of \u00a7 L</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The housing allowance payments at issue were \u201crecurrent,\u201d \u201cregular,\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d remuneration for Bulger\u2019s services as president of the university. We do not accept CRAB\u2019s characterization of the housing payments as an \u201cadministratively workable method\u201d designed by the trustees to reimburse Bulger for the additional expenses generally associated with maintaining a residence consistent with the position of president of the university and suitable for entertainment purposes. CRAB\u2019s position ignores the factual findings of DALA, which were adopted by CRAB, regarding the manner in which the trustees established the housing allowance as part of Bulger\u2019s compensation package. According to those findings (which, as stated, were based on the parties\u2019 stipulations), the housing allowance was never intended to be used for housing. The trustees were fully aware that Bulger would continue to live in his home in the south Boston section of Boston throughout his tenure as president of the university. According to the chairperson of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>trustees who was responsible for negotiating Bulger\u2019s compensation package in 1998, the trustees felt at that time that Bulger had done an outstanding job as university president and considered Bulger\u2019s acceptance of a housing allowance as an important enhancement of his compensation package that would motivate his interest in the presidency for an additional five-year term. In view of these circumstances, treating the housing allowance as anything other than \u201cother compensation in whatever form\u201d would render that term in the statute meaningless. \u201cUnless it is a technical term, \u2018words and phrases [in a statute] shall be construed according to [their] common and approved usage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd.., supra </em>at 68, quoting G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. See <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>391 Mass. 92, 94 (1984) (\u201cwe need not look beyond the words of the statute where the language is plain and unambiguous\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">CRAB places improper emphasis on the fact that the university\u2019s payroll officials did not take regular payroll deductions, as authorized pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 (1) (b), from the housing allowance payments. This fact would be of concern were we dealing with payments made before 1945. Section 1 defines \u201c[r]egular compensation\u201d paid prior to that year as \u201cthe full salary, wages or other compensation in whatever form, lawfully determined for the individual service of the employee by the employing authority, <em>from which regular deductions were made </em>pursuant to the provisions of chapter 32\u201d (emphasis supplied). The Legislature did not include that phrase, however, in relation to compensation paid after 1945. We must assume that the distinction was purposeful. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor C., </em>432 Mass. 635, 640 (2000); <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>421 Mass. 344, 348 (1995); <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Lennett, </em>415 Mass. 857, 863 (1993). As stated by the Appeals Court in <em>Forbush </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 696, 701 (1994), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>we should be \u201cdifferentially precise in according discrete, and not identical, meanings\u201d to separate, yet related, standards reflected in statutory language. That principle has additional force when dealing with statutory definitions, and \u201c[a] definition [that] declares what a term means . . . excludes any meaning that is not stated.\u201d <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., </em>413 Mass. 670, 675 (1992), quoting <em>Colautti </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>439 U.S. 379, 392 n.10 (1979). The fact that payroll deductions were not taken from the housing allowance payments simply is not a decisive factor. See <em>Bower </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>supra; <em>Kozloski </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 783, 785 n.3 (2004); <em>Varella </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 384, 385-386 (2002). As this court recognized in <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>345 Mass. 692, 698 (1963), \u201c[t]he statute is designed to give each member specified retirement benefits in accordance with standards stated in the statute. We see nothing in the statute which prevents a member from receiving those benefits because of an honest error which can readily and fairly be corrected.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 698 &amp; n.5 (identifying G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20 [5] [c], as the statutory mechanism for correcting errors). See <em>Hollstein </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 110-111 (1999). We conclude that the housing allowance payments should be included as \u201cregular compensation\u201d in the computation of Bulger\u2019s retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The payments into the Vanguard account, on the other hand, fail to meet the threshold requirements of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. As has been discussed, the Superior Court judge determined that the account qualified to receive deferred tax treatment under both \u00a7 401(a) (hence, we presume, its name) and \u00a7 403(b) of the I.R.C., and concluded, therefore, that the monthly contributions paid into that plan were included within \u00a7 1 as \u201cpremiums paid [into] an individual or group annuity contract as authorized by [G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 ISA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We need not address the merits of this analysis because, rather than relying on the judge\u2019s conclusion, Bulger concedes in his brief that the Vanguard account is not of the type authorized by G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 18A. He argues instead that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>payments qualify as \u201cregular compensation,\u201d not because they literally fall within the scope of G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 18A, but because they reflect \u201csalary, wages or other compensation in whatever form, lawfully determined for the individual service of [Bulger] by the [trustees].\u201d Bulger\u2019s position, in essence, is that the payments must be \u201cregular compensation\u201d because that is how the payments were characterized by the trustees in the letter agreements of October 1, 2000, and June 3, 2002, both of which provided, \u201c[a]s part of your regular compensation, the University shall deposit. . . .\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The statutory definition is precise and makes clear that \u201cregular compensation\u201d does not extend to payments made into an annuity fund on an employee\u2019s behalf unless that fund is authorized by G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 18A, or by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37B. Neither of those carefully drawn exceptions is applicable here. We cannot read into the statute a legislative intent to include other types of annuity contracts, based on their similarity to those exceptions already contained in the statute, or based on the terminology that parties might choose to call the payments in the employment agreement. See <em>Boston Ass\u2019n of Sch. Adm\u2019rs &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. 336, 339-340 (1981). See also <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999) (\u201cWhere, as here, the language of the statute is clear, it is the function of the judiciary to apply it, not amend it\u201d). To do so would undermine the legislative goal of ensuring \u201ca minimum level of predictability in computing pension payments made out of the retirement system.\u201d <em>Zelesky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Pub. Employee Retirement Admin., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 109 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">3. We address briefly a matter that is unrelated to the question of statutory interpretation at issue in this case. On February 3, 2005 (after DALA had made its findings in the case and before CRAB had reached its decision), an article authored by Timothy Cahill, the treasurer of the Commonwealth, appeared on the \u201cop-ed\u201d page of The Boston Globe. The article was entitled \u201cBulger Payout Threatens Pension System\u201d and presented arguments as to why, in Cahill\u2019s opinion, Bulger\u2019s appeal before CRAB should be denied. Bulger contended before the Superior Court judge that the article constituted an illegal ex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>parte communication that unduly influenced the final decision of CRAB. He filed a motion requesting the judge to vacate the CRAB decision and allow him to conduct further discovery concerning his allegations. The judge denied Bulger\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Bulger has appealed from that portion of the judge\u2019s order denying his motion. Bulger\u2019s claim of procedural irregularities has, for the most part, been rendered moot by our decision. To the extent that it technically remains alive, we reject it, essentially for the same reasons given by the judge: (1) there is insufficient evidence in the record to establish any impropriety in the manner in which CRAB reached its decision; (2) the article presented no factual information on which CRAB might have impermissibly relied, beyond that already contained in the administrative record; (3) it was Bulger himself (through counsel) who initially brought the article to CRAB\u2019s attention by requesting that his objection to the article be noted in the record; (4) CRAB complied with this request and expressly stated that it did not consider the article substantively while reaching its decision; and, finally, (5) there is no substantive evidence to demonstrate that this express statement might not be true. No discovery in connection with CRAB\u2019s deliberations was warranted in these circumstances. See <em>Cushing </em>v. <em>Fire Comm\u2019r of Brookline, </em>345 Mass. 418, 422 (1963); <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Holyoke, </em>271 Mass. 565, 569 (1930) (\u201cGood faith is always assumed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">4. That portion of the judgment of November 29, 2005, ordering that the payments made into an \u201cinvestment fund\u201d held in Bulger\u2019s name, from January 5, 2001, through August 31, 2003, shall be included in his \u201cregular compensation\u201d is vacated. The judgment is modified to direct that the payments made on his behalf into the investment fund are not part of his \u201cregular compensation.\u201d As modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\"> The record reflects that in 1996 and 1997, Bulger declined to accept the housing allowance payments to which he was entitled. Those payments went to the University of Massachusetts Foundation as a charitable contribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\"> The record contains no information on the Vanguard account other than the fact that funds ($1,635 from January, 2001, until November, 2002; $4,659 in December 2002; and $1,803 thereafter) were deposited into the account monthly by the university.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[3]\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">3 The qualification that the compensation must be \u201creceived by [a] member\u201d implies neither that all compensation received by a member must be treated as \u201cregular compensation\u201d nor, as argued by CRAB, that compensation must literally be received during the relevant pay period. We have stated that the modifying clause \u201censures that <em>only </em>years of creditable service are considered in determining the highest three-year average annual rate of regular compensation. It does not alter the definition of regular compensation.\u201d (Emphasis original.) <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>421 Mass. 344, 347 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> Because the university had not made pension deductions on the housing allowance payments or the annuity payments, Bulger tendered to the State Board of Retirement (board) a personal check for $14,659.85, the amount calculated by Bulger to be equivalent to what should have been deducted from those components of his compensation up to the time of his resignation. Bulger also informed the board that he would pay any accumulated interest on the undeducted amount when the appropriate sum had been calculated by the board. The board returned his check. The parties have stipulated that, should Bulger be successful in this appeal, he would tender the appropriate amount of pension deductions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\"> CRAB\u2019s decision included a review of other elements of Bulger\u2019s compensation package beyond the two elements involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b681-9\"> \u201cRegular compensation\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, expressly does not include any \u201cbonus, overtime, severance pay for any and all unused sick leave, early retirement incentives, or any other payments made as a result of giving notice of retirement.\u201d Bulger now concedes that any payment into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Vanguard account made before January 5, 2001, was not compensation for his services but, essentially, a bonus contingent on his remaining in his position as university president through January 4, 2001, and, therefore, does not qualify as \u201cregular compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\"> The parties agree that a second type of annuity payments expressly included as \u201cregular compensation\u201d within G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, paid into a plan authorized by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37B, is not applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[8]\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">8 Although the term \u201cemploying authority\u201d is not defined in the statute, \u00a7 1 defines the term \u201c[e]mployer\u201d as the \u201cperson, board, or commission with the power to appoint or employ personnel as employees of the commonwealth.\u201d For our purposes, the terms are synonymous. The employing authority for the president of the university is its board of trustees. See G. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 11, 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b685-6\"> We also note that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 (1) (c), requires a disbursing officer to treat the value of non-cash maintenance allowances in the form of full or partial boarding and housing as a component of an employee\u2019s regular compensation. There would be no logic to a statutory scheme that treated the value of an employee\u2019s use of housing supplied by an employer as \u201cregular compensation,\u201d but did not treat a cash housing allowance as \u201cregular compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
