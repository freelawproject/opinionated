A jury in the East Brookfield Division of the District Court Department convicted the defendant on a complaint charging motor vehicle homicide by negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>operation, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The evidence at trial demonstrated that Carol Suprenant (victim) was hospitalized with chest and lung injuries suffered as a result of an accident caused by the defendant\u2019s negligent operation of an automobile and died of respiratory failure four days later after her doctors, at her request, removed her from a ventilator that allowed her to breathe and might have ensured her survival. The defendant appeals from her conviction, challenging (as she did at trial) the sufficiency of the evidence proving causation and claiming (for the first time on appeal) that the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on the concept of superseding causes were inadequate. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">1. The jury could have found the following facts. On July 4, 2002, the victim and her husband, Robert Suprenant, left their home in Spencer to attend a cookout at their daughter\u2019s home. At about noon, the Suprenants were traveling south on Mechanic Street and had just entered the intersection of Mechanic and Chestnut Streets, when their automobile was struck on the passenger side by an automobile traveling east on Chestnut Street operated by the defendant. The force of impact pushed the Suprenants\u2019 automobile a distance of approximately fifteen to twenty feet, across the road, over a sidewalk, and into a chain link fence. Traffic entering the intersection from the defendant\u2019s direction was controlled by both a stop sign and blinking red light. A jury could infer that the defendant had failed to stop (or yield the right of way) at the intersection and, thus, was negligent. The victim was transferred from the accident scene by emergency medical personnel to St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital at Worcester Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">As a result of the accident, the victim suffered multiple chest wall fractures, including fractures of the ribs and sternum and a lung contusion. The victim had suffered for several years prior to the accident from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition which makes it difficult to breathe and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>thus, to supply oxygen to the bloodstream, and had required the use of an oxygen tank in her home to assist in her breathing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trauma to her chest compromised her ability to breathe as she had before the accident, to the point where she could no longer oxygenate her blood by normal breathing. That night in the intensive care unit, the victim was intubated and placed on a ventilator.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The next morning, the doctors removed the victim from the ventilator, and she was transferred from the intensive care unit to a medical floor in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Over the next few days, the victim\u2019s breathing difficulties increased. Three doctors separately advised the victim of the need to reintubate her and place her again on a ventilator in order to assist her breathing. At first the victim, who had in the past repeatedly told her daughter-in-law (and health proxy) that she never wanted to be kept alive by a ventilator, refused permission for the doctors to do so. After speaking with family members and her doctors, however, the victim acquiesced and allowed herself to be reintubated, at least temporarily, in order to determine if her health would improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The next morning the victim\u2019s kidneys began to fail, and doctors advised the victim that her worsening condition would require dialysis. At this point, the victim stated that she no longer wished to be attached to a ventilator. Two doctors on the medical staff of the hospital met separately with the victim to discuss the nature of the circumstances facing her and the probable consequences of forgoing mechanical ventilation. The victim\u2019s personal physician also spoke with her at great length about her decision and encouraged her to remain on the breathing tube and ventilator to allow her situation time to improve. The victim understood (a jury could infer) that her death was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>probable if she did not allow intubation and that, conversely, her injuries were potentially survivable if she remained on the ventilator. The victim was adamant that she did not want to be intubated. On July 8, she was taken, off the ventilator and the intubation tube was removed. She died a few hours later from respiratory failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">At trial one doctor testified that, if the accident had not happened, the victim probably would not have needed a ventilator and could have continued being on home oxygen in her usual fragile state of health, but that the chest injuries suffered in the accident \u201ctipped the scales against her.\u201d He also opined that the victim\u2019s decision not to be intubated \u201clikely played a role in her death.\u201d Another doctor stated his opinion \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d that the victim would have survived her injuries if she had agreed to mechanical ventilatory support, and might even have returned to the state she was in before the accident, but conceded as well that the victim might have required \u201cchronic and continuous ventilatory support.\u201d The victim\u2019s daughter-in-law assessed the situation as follows: \u201cWe all knew that it was a possibility that she might not make it, but [the doctors] couldn\u2019t give us a guarantee that she would make it without. . . hav[ing] to be on a [ventilator] for the rest of her life, and she didn\u2019t want to live like that, and we couldn\u2019t force her to do that.\u201d The victim\u2019s primary care physician testified, \u201cI do think her mind was made up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">2. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motions for the entry of a required finding of not guilty presented at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence. The defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s proof was insufficient to sustain the conviction because no rational jury could have determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the victim\u2019s death from respiratory failure was proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant asserts that the victim\u2019s death was a direct result of her independent decision not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>undertake medical procedures that could be considered appropriate for a person in her condition and that would, in all probability, have allowed her to survive the accident. The defendant concedes that the victim had the right to make an informed decision to forgo life support, but argues that the victim\u2019s choice broke the chain of causation and relieved the defendant of criminal responsibility for the victim\u2019s death. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The defendant was not entitled to a required finding of not guilty. The standard of causation under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G, is the same as that employed in tort law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berggren, </em>398 Mass. 338, 340 (1986). Conduct is a proximate cause of death if the conduct, \u201cby the natural and continuous sequence of events, causes the death and without which the death would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>434 Mass. 197, 202, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 963 (2001).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no question that the defendant\u2019s negligent failure to stop, or yield the right of way, at the intersection (for which the defendant accepts responsibility in this appeal) set in motion a chain of events that resulted in the victim\u2019s death. The victim\u2019s injuries from the accident exacerbated serious preexisting health problems and required her to be intubated and placed on the ventilator. Her ultimate decision to be removed from life support was not an independent occurrence but the final step in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>continuous sequence of events that began with the defendant\u2019s negligent operation of her automobile. \u201cBut for\u201d the negligence, the accident would not have occurred, and the victim would not have been forced into the position of having to make what was, in retrospect, a true life-or-death decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The general rule is that intervening conduct of a third party will relieve a defendant of culpability for antecedent negligence only if such an intervening response was not reasonably foreseeable. See <em>Jean W. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 496, 503 n.6 (1993) (Liacos, C.J., concurring), quoting <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 762 (1984) (\u201c[T]he foreseeability of the harm [is] the \u2018most crucial factor\u2019 justifying liability\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>404 Mass. 532, 534 (1989); <em>Copithorne </em>v. <em>Framingham Union Hosp., </em>401 Mass. 806 (1988). \u201cThis is just another way of saying that an intervening act of a third party that was not reasonably foreseeable in the circumstances would prevent the victim\u2019s death from following naturally and continuously from the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Askew, supra. </em>Whether an intervening act was reasonably foreseeable and, thus, followed naturally from the defendant\u2019s conduct, or unforeseeable and, thus, broke the chain of causation as matter of law, is a question of fact for the jury to decide based on an assessment of the circumstances. See <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., </em>399 Mass. 790, 794-795 (1987); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 453 comment b (1965) (if either facts or reasonable foreseeability of intervening act are subject to reasonable difference of opinion, question of proximate cause must go to jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Here, the victim\u2019s choice was between invasive life support that might have assured her survival, but could also have led to a life of ventilator dependence (and, we may assume, continued pain and suffering), or acceptance of \u201ccomfort measures\u201d only. The record shows that the victim was intelligent and coherent at all times. She had an absolute right to make the decision that she did. See <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>387 Mass. 152, 154 (1982); <em>Superintendant of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 744-745 (1977). Modem medicine can sometimes prolong or sustain life by way of invasive procedures, but it is common knowledge that some patients will refuse to consent to such procedures. The jury were warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>in determining, in the circumstances of this case, that the victim\u2019s decision to forgo invasive life support was reasonably foreseeable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The defendant poses the question: \u201cIn the realm of crimes of negligence, should the tort concept of \u2018you take your victim as you find him\u2019 apply . . . even though, by pure chance and coincidence, it has the effect of turning an act of simple negligence into a serious crime?\u201d The answer to this question is \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Through the enactment of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G <em>(b), </em>the Legislature has decided, as matter of social policy, to deter acts of reckless driving by making the killing of another human being by means of negligent operation of a motor vehicle an offense punishable by up to two and one-half years\u2019 imprisonment and a $3,000 fine. Prior to the statute\u2019s enactment, prosecutors presented with facts like those before us had to choose between prosecution of a misdemeanor, such as driving so as to endanger, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (a), or of the far more serious crime of involuntary manslaughter, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13, which carries a maximum penalty of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 390 (1981), citing memorandum from Mr. Endicott Peabody to the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts General Court, dated March 29, 1976, regarding 1976 Senate Doc. No. 703. We have concluded that the Legislature intended the statute \u201cto provide a middle ground between the felony of manslaughter and the misdemeanor of driving so as to endanger.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 390-391. A finding of ordinary negligence is sufficient to establish a violation of the statute. See <em>id. </em>at 389, and cases cited. The defendant\u2019s insistence that this standard is not fair, or leaves \u201cnothing to soften the blow,\u201d is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The defendant\u2019s suggestion that she should not be held accountable for the victim\u2019s death, because the same injuries would have been minor if inflicted on a healthy young person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>has no merit. Our long-standing rule in Massachusetts, in criminal law as well as in tort, is that \u201cthe wrongdoer takes the victim as he or she finds him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevlin, </em>433 Mass. 305, 313 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernette, </em>398 Mass. 658, 668 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. 423, 429 (1981); <em>Wiemert </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>216 Mass. 598, 603 (1914); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hackett, 2 </em>Allen 136, 142 (1861); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>7 Gray 585, 586-587 (1856) (if the act hastened the death, then the death was caused by the act).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">3. We now consider the defendant\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on causation were so inadequate and confusing as to require a new trial. The defendant asserted no challenge to the judge\u2019s instructions at trial. She is entitled to relief only if she demonstrates error in the instructions that created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, namely, \u201ca substantial danger that the jury was misled by [an] erroneous instruction, and that the instruction may have materially influenced their appraisal of the [evidence].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The judge properly charged the jury on the elements of negligent motor vehicle homicide.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He advised the jury that there may be more than one cause of a person\u2019s death, but that the Commonwealth is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cdirectly and substantially set in motion a chain of events that produced the death in a natural and continuous sequence,\u201d and that the death would not have occurred without the defendant\u2019s actions. This is a correct statement of the law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berggren, </em>398 Mass. 338, 341 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The judge instructed the jury on the law of intervening events and superseding causes, as set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>cordance with what has been said in this opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge emphasized that the jury must acquit the defendant \u201cif the death would not have occurred without the intervention of another person or event, and a reasonable person in the same circumstances would not have foreseen the likely possibility of such a result.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There was no possibility that the jury did not understand that they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s negligence directly set in motion a continuous chain of events that produced the death, and that they must acquit the defendant if the death would not have occurred without the intervention of some other person or event that was not reasonably foreseeable. The judge\u2019s instructions focused the jury\u2019s attention on the issue of causation and correctly left the issue of foreseeability to the jury. See <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., </em>399 Mass. 790, 796 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>394 Mass. 727, 745, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Aiello </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>474 U.S. 919 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">4. The order staying the defendant\u2019s sentence on her conviction of homicide by negligent operation of a motor vehicle is vacated. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The defendant was sentenced to twelve months in a house of correction, suspended for thirty-six months, and six months of electronically monitored house arrest, and her driver\u2019s license was revoked for ten years. Execution of her sentence was stayed pending appeal by a single justice of the Appeals Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The victim\u2019s primary care physician testified at trial that the victim\u2019s condition would have gradually deteriorated over time and that the disease would have shortened her life. He opined that, based on the severity of her disease, the victim could have expected to enjoy only three to six more years of \u201cgood quality\u201d life.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Intubation is a procedure where a hollow tube, one-half to three-quarters of an inch in circumference, is inserted into the mouth and approximately six to eight inches into the windpipe. The tube enables oxygen to be delivered directly into the lungs by means of a ventilator. A ventilator was described at trial as a \u201cmechanical breathing machine\u201d that pushes air into and out of the lungs by way of a pressure piston.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Conviction under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G <em>(b), </em>requires proof by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant operated a motor vehicle, (2) on a public way, (3) in a negligent manner to endanger lives and public safety, (4) thereby causing the death of another person. The focus at trial was on whether the defendant was negligent and whether her negligence caused the victim\u2019s death. Only the latter element is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The term \u201cproximate cause\u201d has fallen into disfavor. Drafters of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm \u00a7 574 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 2005), make clear their dislike for the term as \u201can especially poor one to describe the idea to which it is connected,\u201d and have opted instead to use \u201cscope of liability\u201d as the umbrella term for the concept that, for liability to be imposed, the harm that occurred must be one that results from the hazards that made the defendant\u2019s conduct tortious. We continue to use the term as it has been used in the past, as shorthand for the principle that an actor\u2019s liability is limited to those physical harms that are within the foreseeable risks of the tortious conduct. See, e.g., <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 312, 321-322 (2002). See also <em>Heng Or </em>v. Edwards, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 475, 485-491 (2004) (in-depth discussion of conventional use of \u201cproximate cause\u201d and possible alternative formulations). We thus leave for another day, in a case where the matter is appropriately briefed, the issue whether we should replace the term \u201cproximate cause,\u201d as defined in our case law, with the term \u201cscope of liability,\u201d as defined in the proposed Restatement (Third) of Torts, and the principles accompanying \u201cscope of liability\u201d set forth therein. The judge did not use the term \u201cproximate cause\u201d while instructing the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The defendant\u2019s attempt to assign blame to the victim for her own death, because she \u201cmade the deliberate choice to . . . engage in irrational and self-destructive behavior\u201d is not persuasive. There is no contributory negligence in the law of motor vehicle homicide. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>394 Mass. 77, 87 (1985), and cases cited. We also reject the defendant\u2019s attempt to apply the tort doctrine of \u201cavoidable consequences\u201d to this criminal matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The judge also instructed the jury on the lesser included charge of operating a motor vehicle negligently so as to endanger the public, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\u201cIf the defendant\u2019s actions would not have brought about the death all by themselves without the intervention of some other person or event, the defendant is still held responsible as the cause of death if two conditions are met. First, the defendant\u2019s actions directly and substantially set in motion a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>natural, continuous sequence of events to cause the death. And second, a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have foreseen that her actions could easily result in serious injury or death to someone like the victim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The instructions tracked, substantially, Instruction 5.27 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (1995). The judge\u2019s use of the word \u201cresult\u201d instead of the word \u201cevent\u201d was immaterial and did not change the essential meaning of the instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The jury returned during deliberations seeking a copy of the law of negligent motor vehicle homicide. The judge responded by repeating the substance of his earlier instructions. The jury later requested clarification on the issue of causation and asked for specific examples that would help to distinguish between what is, and what is not, a \u201cmajor factor in the cause of death.\u201d The judge declined to give examples but repeated, for the third time, his instructions on the elements of negligent motor vehicle homicide and on intervening events and superseding causes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
