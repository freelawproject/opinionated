At the time of her death, the decedent, Helen M. Zaborowski (decedent), held the joint account in a California credit union in her name and in the name of her nephew, the defendant, Andrew McLeod. The joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>account named the decedent and the defendant as \u201cjoint owners] with right of survivorship.\u201d Shortly after the death of the decedent, the defendant contacted the California bank, withdrew the funds in question, and closed the joint account.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The plaintiffs, Stanley Barboza (Stanley) (decedent\u2019s brother) and Robert Barboza (Robert) (Stanley\u2019s son), administrators of the decedent\u2019s estate, filed a complaint in equity in the Probate and Family Court, arguing that, pursuant to Massachusetts law, the funds belong to the estate. The case was tried without a jury, and a judge in the Probate and Family Court entered a judgment ordering the defendant to relinquish the money to the estate for administration by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Because we conclude that California law applies to determine whether the proceeds of the joint account are nonprobate assets belonging to the defendant, that the plaintiffs have failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the decedent did not intend the proceeds of the joint account to go to the defendant on her death, and that the judge erred in admitting certain evidence, we vacate judgment for the plaintiffs and dismiss the underlying complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\"><em>Standard of review. </em>In nonjury cases, findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Marlow </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>369 Mass. 501, 508 (1976), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). \u201cOn the other hand, to ensure that the ultimate findings and conclusions are consistent with the law, we scrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to the facts. . . . Thus, the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of appellate review does not protect findings of fact or conclusions based on incorrect legal standards.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 621 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the essential facts as found by the judge that, aside from the ultimate question whether the decedent intended a gift to the defendant of an interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>joint bank account, are supported by the record. We reserve certain facts for our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The decedent grew up in the East Boston section of Boston with two sisters and her only brother, Stanley. In the 1940\u2019s, the decedent married Ralph Zaborowski and moved with him to California. During her time in California the decedent maintained a close relationship with her nephew, the defendant, and when the defendant attended college for a short time on the west coast, she assisted him with obtaining a summer job. Throughout the years, the decedent also remained close to Stanley, exchanging letters and telephone calls, and visiting him in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In 1966, the decedent opened a bank account in California in her name. Years later, in 1981, she added her husband Ralph\u2019s name to the account as a joint owner with right of survivorship. Ralph passed away in 1994, and the decedent requested that the defendant fly from Massachusetts to California to comfort her and assist her with preparing her late husband\u2019s funeral arrangements. While the defendant was in California, the decedent asked him to sign a signature card so that he could be added to the bank account at issue in this case. The defendant signed the card and shortly thereafter the decedent removed Ralph\u2019s name from the account and added the defendant\u2019s name to the account as a joint owner with right of survivorship. After Ralph\u2019s passing, the decedent moved back and forth between California and Massachusetts. She eventually settled in Dartmouth, where she died intestate on June 12, 2003. At the funeral the defendant delivered the eulogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The defendant testified that in the years between the time he was added to the account and the decedent\u2019s death, he never contributed any money to the account, never received statements, and never managed the account, nor ever asked to do so. During the decedent\u2019s lifetime, the defendant also did not hold an automatic teller machine card for the account, and he never attempted to withdraw money from the account. On one occasion, however, he asked the decedent if he could have some money from the account and he was told that the funds were \u201cnot available.\u201d The decedent may have also stated that the account was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Stanley testified that he had discussed the account with the decedent two months after her husband died and while she was still living in California. He testified that the decedent stated that she had put the defendant\u2019s name on the account, but that she did not mean it as a gift; she \u201cjust wanted someone to help out in case of an emergency.\u201d Another witness, Elizabeth Willett, who cleaned the decedent\u2019s Massachusetts home for many years, testified that, about six months prior to the decedent\u2019s death, in the course of a conversation about a will, the decedent mentioned that the defendant was her favorite and that she had \u201csomething\u201d for him. Willett met the defendant for the first time at the decedent\u2019s wake, and at that time, she told the defendant about the decedent\u2019s intent to give him something.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Shortly after the decedent\u2019s passing, as the defendant was looking through the decedent\u2019s personal papers at her home, he learned that the account was still open. He then consulted an attorney, who advised him that the remaining funds in the account belonged to him. The defendant contacted the credit union, withdrew approximately $142,000, and closed the account. When negotiations regarding the funds failed, the plaintiffs requested, and were granted, a temporary restraining order enjoining the defendant from using the proceeds of the account during the pendency of this action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">At trial, the plaintiffs produced copies of documents found in the decedent\u2019s personal effects. Among the documents were two account statements from the California credit union; an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) interest reporting form; and a putative draft will. The account statements were addressed to the' decedent at her Massachusetts address and included information regarding the amount of interest earned on the account. They contained both the decedent\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s names, but the defendant\u2019s name had been scratched out by hand. The IRS form bore a similar handwritten redaction. At the top of the putative draft will was written, \u201cI do hereby bequeath (without reservation) my earthly belongings to the following.\u201d Below this statement was a list of the decedent\u2019s loved ones. Beside each name was a dollar amount, and next to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>name was \u201c100,000.\u201d This bequest and the $100,000 bequest to the decedent\u2019s brother, Stanley, are the largest bequests listed in the putative draft will.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Choice of law applicable to joint account. </em>\u201cIt is a familiar rule of law that the right of succession to the estate of a deceased person, whether he leaves a will or dies intestate, depends upon the law of his domicil.\u201d <em>Rackemann </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>204 Mass. 394, 397 (1910). Here, it is undisputed that the decedent\u2019s domicil was Massachusetts, but that does not resolve whether Massachusetts law or the law of the location of the bank account, California, applies. In determining the issue of ownership of the account, the judge applied Massachusetts law, which provides that a representative of the estate of the deceased may show, by a preponderance of the evidence and in light of the attendant facts and circumstances, that at the time the joint account was established, the deceased did not intend to make a present completed gift of a joint interest in an account. <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Caples, </em>362 Mass. 107, 114 (1972). <em>Egan </em>v. <em>Deely, </em>361 Mass. 886, 887 (1972), citing <em>DePasqua </em>v. <em>Bergstedt, </em>355 Mass. 734 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The defendant, citing authority from several jurisdictions, argues that the question of ownership of the account should be governed by the law of the situs of the deposit, and therefore, California law should apply to determine whether the decedent intended to grant the defendant an interest in the joint account. As discussed <em>infra, </em>California law provides that funds in a joint account belong to the surviving party unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent. There is no case law in Massachusetts that directly addresses this choice of law issue. See <em>Florio </em>v. <em>Florio, </em>445 Mass. 1004, 1006-1007 (2005) (noting that Florida choice of law statute would appear to govern issue which law determines ownership of joint account, but declining to grant relief where scant documentation of decedent\u2019s domicil and without account agreement). We conclude that the law of a joint account\u2019s situs at the time of a decedent\u2019s death should apply to determine ownership of the account.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Substantial case law from other jurisdictions supports our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>conclusion. See, e.g., <em>Barstow </em>v. <em>Tetlow, </em>115 Me. 96, 98 (1916); Tyler v. <em>Suburban Trust Co., </em>247 Md. 461, 468 (1967); <em>Matter of the Estate of Kugel, </em>192 Misc. 61, 63 (N.Y. Sur. Ct. 1948). Our conclusion also is consistent with our existing rule regarding the disposition of real estate located outside the Commonwealth. See <em>Rackemann </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 397 (\u201cIf [the decedent] owns real estate in another State or country, that is, of course, subject to the local laws of the place where it is situated . . .\u201d). In addition, California has a substantial interest in ensuring the proper adjudication of joint accounts opened within its borders. Moreover, the record in this case supports the inference that the decedent intended the account to be subjected to the benefits and burdens of California law. Based on the documents and testimony submitted it is clear that, up until her death, the decedent retained her mental acuity, lived independently, and ably managed her personal affairs. Until her death, she continued diligently to maintain the account in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">2. <em>Disposition of the joint account. </em>At oral argument, the plaintiffs conceded that all of the evidence concerning ownership of the account had been presented below. Therefore, in the interest of judicial economy and efficiency, and to prevent unnecessary additional litigation for this family, we stand in the shoes of the trial court and decide the matter on the record before us. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leventhal, </em>364 Mass. 718, 723 (1974); G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The applicable provision of the California Probate Code provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cSums remaining on deposit at the death of a party to a joint account belong to the surviving party or parties as against the estate of the decedent unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Cal. Prob. Code \u00a7 5302(a) (West 1991 &amp; Supp. 2006). \u201c \u2018Clear and convincing\u2019 evidence requires a finding of high probability. The evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>It must be sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.\u201d <em>In re David C., </em>152 Cal. App. 3d 1189, 1208 (1984). The burden of proof is on the party \u201cseeking to show that the transaction is not to be taken at face value.\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Blanchette, </em>362 Mass. 518, 524 (1972). The admissible evidence presented by the plaintiffs does not rise to the level of clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The documents the plaintiffs produced do little to illuminate the issue. The putative draft will found in the decedent\u2019s home contains an itemized list of gifts to be given to her loved ones on her death. She lists the def\u00e9ndant, and none of her other nieces or nephews, as a beneficiary to receive $100,000. We think this fact militates against the plaintiffs and supports the defendant\u2019s argument that the decedent intended to give the defendant the proceeds of the account, approximately $142,000, on her death. The meaning of the putative draft will, of unknown origin and date, is unclear, and the fact of its existence does not advance the plaintiffs\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Further, the various redactions on the IRS forms and bank account statements, assuming they were made by the decedent, could reflect the decedent\u2019s desire not to subject the defendant to tax liability, and not necessarily her desire to remove the defendant as a joint owner of the account. The fact that the decedent was familiar with adding and removing names from her California joint bank account, as indicated by the prior removal of her late husband and the addition of the defendant to the account, makes the latter possibility less likely. In any case, by no means is it clear and convincing that the redactions were made to eviscerate the defendant\u2019s joint interest in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">We turn to the testimony of Elizabeth Willett, the decedent\u2019s long-time house cleaner and a hostile witness called by the defendant. Willett claimed that, during a conversation with the decedent about making a will, the decedent stated that the defendant was her favorite and that she had \u201csomething\u201d for him. The facts tend to support this statement, because the defendant delivered the decedent\u2019s eulogy. The conversation could be interpreted in any number of ways, none of which clearly and convincingly evinces the decedent\u2019s intent not to leave her nephew the proceeds of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Finally, as discussed in the law revision commission comments to the 1990 enactment of Cal. Prob. Code \u00a7 5302, there are many ways the decedent could have rebutted the right of survivorship, but she did not. For example, she could have explicitly established the account as a joint account with \u201cno survivorship rights.\u201d However, the account expressly granted to the defendant a joint interest in the account with a \u201cright of survivorship.\u201d The decedent retained this designation long after her domicil had changed to Massachusetts and when, presumably, based on the facts in the record, she was capable of changing the designation on the account or closing the account and moving the entire proceeds of the account elsewhere. Given that the plaintiffs have not illustrated by clear and convincing evidence the decedent\u2019s contrary intent, we must presume she intended her nephew to remain the joint owner of the account, with a right of survivorship. The proceeds of the account belong to the defendant, not to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">3. <em>Admissibility of statements of decedent. </em>The defendant also argues that the judge erred in admitting statements of the decedent, made after the defendant\u2019s name was added to the joint account with a right of survivorship, indicating her intent not to give the defendant a joint interest in the account. We agree, and those statements have not been considered in the above analysis whether the plaintiffs produced the requisite clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In the proceedings below, the defendant filed a motion in limine to prevent the admission of these statements, and the motion was denied. In the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision, citing <em>Desrosiers </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 852, 857-858 (1982), she concluded, \u201c[a] decedent\u2019s statements made subsequent to the creation of a joint account may be admissible as relevant evidence of the decedent\u2019s donative intent.\u201d Thus, as reflected in the findings of fact, the judge admitted two hearsay statements of the decedent: her alleged statement to the defendant that the account \u201cwas not available to him and that the account was closed,\u201d and her alleged statement to Stanley that she did not intend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>have the defendant\u2019s name on the account as a gift, but for an emergency situation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The well-settled evidentiary rule that \u201ca grantor or assignor cannot defeat his own deed or assignment by declarations made after it has taken effect,\u201d <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>110 Mass. 325, 327 (1872), applies in this case. See <em>DePasqua </em>v. <em>Bergstedt, supra </em>at 736 (noting that <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Leland, supra, </em>has been cited \u201cin support of the proposition that evidence of the nature admitted here is not admissible to defeat the title of the survivor to a joint account\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The judge\u2019s reliance on the <em>Desrosiers </em>case is misplaced. In the <em>Desrosiers </em>case, sufficient evidence existed to show that the decedent lacked donative intent when she added her daughter\u2019s name to the account. The Appeals Court assumed, without holding, that subsequent statements made by the decedent would have been inadmissible to show the decedent\u2019s initial intent; however, the court determined that the subsequent statements of the decedent were admissible for the purpose of showing whether the decedent\u2019s intent to create a gift in the joint account arose after the account was created. <em>Desrosiers </em>v. <em>Germain, supra </em>at 858. The key point in time, under the analysis employed in the <em>Desrosiers </em>case, is the inception of the joint account. See <em>DePasqua </em>v. <em>Bergstedt, supra </em>at 737 (proffered evidence \u201cinsufficient to rebut the donative intent implicit in the creation of the joint account\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Here, there was sufficient evidence to show that when the decedent added the defendant\u2019s name to the joint account she intended to make a gift of a joint interest in the account. The record indicates that the decedent understood the ramifications of her behavior and that expressly designating the account as a joint account with a right of survivorship would result in a gift to the defendant. Therefore, because the decedent\u2019s donative intent was clearly established at the time of the creation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>joint account, the subsequent statements attempting to defeat that gift were not admissible. <em>DePasqua </em>v. <em>Bergstedt, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the judgment for the plaintiffs and dismiss the underlying complaint with prejudice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> Prior to trial, a preliminary injunction issued with the same language as the temporary restraining order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> Based on our conclusion that California law applies to this proceeding, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>need not address the defendant\u2019s additional argument that Massachusetts law with respect to ownership of joint accounts should be altered to require a clear and convincing standard of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\"> The defendant also argued that the various redacted documents should have been excluded from the evidence presented at trial; however, it is unclear, based on the testimony at trial, whether the redactions were made by the decedent, and even if they were, the redactions were not necessarily contrary to the defendant\u2019s right of survivorship (see <em>supra). </em>Therefore, we assume, without deciding, that they were properly admitted, and we consider them a part of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> Pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 45, the defendant requested costs and attorney\u2019s fees in connection with this appeal to be paid by the plaintiffs out of the funds of the estate. We defer action on his request until defense counsel submits the appropriate documentation in support of this request and we review any material the plaintiffs may choose to submit in opposition. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10 (2004). An award under \u00a7 45 is a matter of discretion (\u201cin the discretion of the court,\u201d to be paid \u201cas justice and equity may require\u201d), not a matter of right. Accordingly, the parties\u2019 submissions should address not only the amount of any requested costs and attorney\u2019s fees, but also how we should exercise our discretion with respect to allowing or denying the request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
