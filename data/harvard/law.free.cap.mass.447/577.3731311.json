At issue are the amendments made by Melanie\u2019s Law to the procedure by which the Commonwealth may prove prior OUI convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. We conclude that the amended OUI statute, as applied to the defendant in this case, does not violate the ex post facto, due process, or confrontation clauses of the Federal or State Constitutions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On October 11, 2005, a complaint issued in the Peabody Division of the District Court Department charging the defendant, Matthew J. Maloney, with OUI as a fourth offense in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****On October 28, 2005, the Governor signed into law an emergency act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entitled \u201cAn Act increasing penalties for drunk drivers in the Commonwealth,\u201d St. 2005, c. 122. On November 9, 2005, after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>three-day jury trial, the defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Following this conviction, the defendant was entitled to a separate proceeding, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, to determine whether he had been convicted of the three prior GUI offenses alleged in the complaint. The Commonwealth, seeking clarity whether the amendments of Melanie\u2019s Law would apply to this proceeding, moved to report the question to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *The trial judge allowed the motion and reported the following two questions to the Appeals Court: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>We allowed the parties\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>(1) Would application to cases now pending in the trial court of St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 6A, amending G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> violate State or Federal constitutional prohibitions of ex post facto laws, specifically, the fourth category of such laws as set forth in <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798)?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">(2) Would the introduction of documentary evidence of the types listed in St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 6A, be sufficient to sustain a finding of a prior conviction when it demonstrates, through corroborating identifying information such as date of birth, address, social security number, or distinguishing physical characteristics, that the defendant is the same person as that named in the prior conviction, or must the Commonwealth in all cases present live witnesses to establish that fact?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>2. <em>Legal framework. </em>General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24, is the Massachusetts OUI statute. Section 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1) makes it a crime to operate a motor vehicle on a public way while under the influence of an intoxicant, and sets forth more severe penalties for those convicted of second or subsequent offenses. In order to subject a repeat OUI offender to these greater penalties, the Commonwealth must prove the prior convictions in a separate proceeding pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A. This statute governs the proof of repeat offender enhancements generally, and provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u201cIf a defendant is charged with a crime for which more severe punishment is provided for second and subsequent offenses, and the complaint or indictment alleges that the offense charged is a second or subsequent offense, the defendant on arraignment shall be inquired of only for a plea of guilty or not guilty to the crime charged . . . . If a defendant pleads guilty or if there is a verdict or finding of guilty after trial, then before sentence is imposed, the defendant shall be further inquired of for a plea of guilty or not guilty to that portion of the complaint or indictment alleging that the crime charged is a second or subsequent offense. If he pleads guilty thereto, sentence shall be imposed; if he pleads not guilty thereto, he shall be entitled to a trial by jury of the issue of conviction of a prior offense, subject to all of the provisions of law governing criminal trials. . . . Upon the return of a verdict, after the separate trial of the issue of conviction of one or more prior offenses, the court shall impose the sentence appropriate to said verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\"><em>Id. </em>Proceedings under this section are \u201csubject to all of the provisions of law governing criminal trials,\u201d <em>id., </em>and the Commonwealth must prove prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>445 Mass. 161, 174 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">a. <em>Proof of prior OUI convictions before enactment of Melanie\u2019s Law. </em>Before the enactment of Melanie\u2019s Law, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4), inserted in 1986, governed proof of prior OUI convictions. See St. 1986, c. 620, \u00a7 13. After several amendments not relevant here, this section provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cIn any prosecution commenced pursuant to this section, introduction into evidence of a prior conviction or prior finding of sufficient facts by either original court papers or certified attested copy of original court papers, accompanied by a certified attested copy of the biographical and informational data from official probation office records, shall be prima facie evidence that a defendant has been convicted previously or assigned to an alcohol or controlled substance education, treatment, or rehabilitation program because of a like offense by a court of the commonwealth one or more times preceding the date of commission of the offense for which said defendant is being prosecuted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4), as amended through St. 2003, c. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7; St. 2003, c. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 228, 229. Although \u00a7 24 (4) did not require introduction of live testimony to authenticate conviction records, it apparently became a common practice in some courts to require such live testimony \u2014 a practice the Commonwealth considered burdensome.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">b. <em>Prima facie evidence. </em>Section 24 (4) provided that a court record of a prior conviction, accompanied by other documentation, would be \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d that a defendant had been convicted previously. In criminal cases, when evidence \u201cA\u201d is prima facie evidence of fact \u201cB,\u201d then, in the absence of competing evidence, the fact finder is permitted but not required to find \u201cB\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>406 Mass. 135, 144 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pauley, </em>368 Mass. 286, 291-292, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 887 (1975). A number of Massachusetts criminal statutes designate certain evidence as \u201cprima facie.\u201d See, e.g., G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 39 (certificate of chemical analysis of narcotics is prima facie evidence of composition, quality, and weight); G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 11C (defendant\u2019s possession of firearm with obliterated serial number is prima facie evidence that defendant obliterated it).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Such provisions serve to identify evidence that the Commonwealth may introduce to meet its burden and which, while just as probative as other evidence, is less burdensome to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>produce. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279, 280 n.1 (2005) (use of narcotics analysis certificates \u201creduce[s] court delays and the inconvenience of having the analyst called as a witness\u201d). They do not, however, alter the Commonwealth\u2019s substantive burden of proof, render admissible any evidence that previously was inadmissible, or render sufficient any evidence that necessarily was insufficient beforehand. Rather, when properly employed by the Legislature, such provisions are merely a matter of administrative convenience that eliminate uncertainty as to what will constitute sufficient proof. Accordingly, we have held that the Legislature\u2019s decision that \u201cA\u201d is prima facie evidence of \u201cB\u201d does not impermissibly lower the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof, at least where \u201cA\u201d is enough to establish \u201cB\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pauley, supra </em>at 296-298.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, </em>421 Mass. 295 (1995), we added a gloss to the \u201cprima facie\u201d aspect of \u00a7 24 (4). In that case, the Commonwealth sought to prove the defendant\u2019s prior OUI offenses through several \u201cpackets\u201d of court documents indicating that a Roger A. Koney had been convicted previously of OUI. <em>Id. </em>at 301. However, there was no evidence other than identity of name connecting these documents to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>In finding the evidence insufficient, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201cIt was incumbent on the Commonwealth to prove . . . that the defendant, Roger A. Koney, who was in the courtroom was the same Roger A. Koney named in the three prior convictions. . . . This the Commonwealth did not do. Mere identity of name is not sufficient to indicate an identity of person.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 301-302. In effect, we read into \u00a7 24 (4) a requirement that documentation reflecting a conviction be linked to the defendant before such documentation can be prima facie evidence of a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">c. <em>Changes effected by Melanie\u2019s Law to proof of prior OUI convictions. </em>Statute 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 6A, replaced G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201cIn any prosecution commenced pursuant to this sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>tian, introduction into evidence of a prior conviction or a prior finding of sufficient facts by either certified attested copies of original court papers, or certified attested copies of the defendant\u2019s biographical and informational data from records of the department of probation, any jail or house of correction!], the department of correction, or the registry, shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant before the court had been convicted previously or assigned to an alcohol or controlled substance education, treatment, or rehabilitation program by a court of the commonwealth or any other jurisdiction. Such documentation shall be self-authenticating and admissible, after the commonwealth has established the defendant\u2019s guilt on the primary offense, as evidence in any court of the commonwealth to prove the defendant\u2019s commission of any prior convictions described therein. The commonwealth shall not be required to introduce any additional corroborating evidence, nor live witness testimony to establish the validity of such prior convictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 6A.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">A comparison of the former G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4), and \u00a7 6A of Melanie\u2019s Law reveals several key distinctions. First, whereas the former \u00a7 24 (4) provided that court records of a prior conviction <em>\u201caccompanied by </em>a certified attested copy of the biographical and informational data from official probation office records\u201d (emphasis added) would be prima facie evidence of the prior conviction, \u00a7 6A provides that <em>either </em>court records of conviction <em>\u201cor </em>certified attested copies of the defendant\u2019s biographical and informational data\u201d (emphasis added) shall be prima facie evidence. Second, \u00a7 6A expands the types of documents that can have prima facie effect to include records from any jail, house of correction, the department of correction, or the registry of motor vehicles. Finally, \u00a7 6A adds language stating that documentation acceptable as prima facie evidence of a prior conviction shall be self-authenticating and admissible \u201cto prove the defendant\u2019s commission of any prior convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>described therein,\u201d without corroborating evidence or live testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">3. <em>Threshold issues. </em>Before turning to the reported questions, we address first two threshold issues raised by the defendant as to whether Melanie\u2019s Law applies here at all.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">First, due to an apparent clerical error, St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 6A, states that it replaces G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (c) (4), a completely different provision of the statute concerning the reinstatement of licenses by the registrar of motor vehicles, rather than G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4). Thus, it seems, the current GUI statute includes both \u00a7 24 (4) and the new language of \u00a7 6A, although both sections deal with the same subject matter in similar terms and \u00a7 6A clearly seems intended to replace \u00a7 24 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We cannot conclude that the Legislature intended such an illogical result. Nor do we infer the Legislature\u2019s ratification of this error from the mere fact that it has yet to be corrected. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>405 Mass. 115, 119 (1989) (refusing to ascribe significance to legislative inaction). Where, as here, a statute contains an obvious clerical error, a court may depart from the statute\u2019s literal meaning in order to effectuate legislative intent. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>423 Mass. 399, 409 (1996), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Kokoska </em>v. <em>Bullen, </em>519 U.S. 1057 (1997), citing 2A Singer, Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a7 47.37, 47.38 (5th ed. 1992). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Murgatroy, </em>115 N.H. 717, 718 (1975) (court would disregard negligent homicide statute\u2019s mistaken reference to wrong section number so as not to defeat legislative intent). Accordingly, we read \u00a7 6A of Melanie\u2019s Law as replacing G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4), not \u00a7 24 (1) (c) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The defendant argues that under the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d any ambiguity in a criminal statute should be construed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>criminal defendant\u2019s favor. See <em>Youngworth </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>436 Mass. 608, 611 (2002). He claims that because, read literally, both \u00a7 24 (4) and \u00a7 6A of Melanie\u2019s Law are now part of the OUI statute, he should have the benefit of the more lenient version. However, the rule of lenity \u201cis a guide for resolving ambiguity, rather than a rigid requirement that we interpret each statute in the manner most favorable to defendants.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652-653 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tata, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 23, 26 (1989). In criminal cases no less than in civil, \u201c[w]here the draftsmanship of a statute is faulty or lacks precision, it is our duty to give the statute a reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>445 Mass. 315, 319 (2005), quoting <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, </em>389 Mass. 617, 622 (1983). We thus reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the former \u00a7 24 (4) should apply to this case on the ground that it technically remains part of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">As a second threshold matter, the defendant contends that \u00a7 6A does not apply retroactively to a case such as his, which was already pending in the trial court when Melanie\u2019s Law was enacted. The statute does not answer this question directly; however, in contrast to the 1986 amendments to the OUI statute, St. 1986, c. 620, \u00a7 23, which applied only \u201cto violations committed on or after the effective date of this act,\u201d Melanie\u2019s Law contains no such limitation. Because the Legislature clearly knew how to make \u00a7 6A purely prospective in application and did not do so, it is proper to apply \u00a7 6A to the present case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">4. <em>Ex post facto clause. </em>We now address the first question reported by the trial court: whether \u00a7 6A of Melanie\u2019s Law, St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 6A, if applied to the defendant\u2019s pending proceeding under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11A, constitutes an impermissible ex post facto law. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Both the Federal and State Constitutions forbid ex post facto laws. See art. I, \u00a7 10, of the United States Constitution (\u201cNo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>State shall . . . pass any ... ex post facto law . . .\u201d); art. 24 of the Massachusetts Constitution (\u201cLaws made to punish for actions done before the existence of such laws, and which have not been declared crimes by preceding laws, are unjust, oppressive, and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a free government\u201d). We have interpreted the Federal and State ex post facto clauses identically. <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>428 Mass. 39, 41, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1003 (1998). In the seminal case of <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798) <em>(Calder), </em>the United States Supreme Court enumerated four categories of ex post facto laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">\u201c1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment and inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We must decide whether \u00a7 6A falls under Calder\u2019s fourth category.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">While <em>Calder </em>broadly forbids any law that retroactively \u201calters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less or different testimony ... in order to convict the offender,\u201d <em>id., </em>subsequent cases have made it clear that not every change in the rules of evidence falls under Calder\u2019s fourth category. See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>171 U.S. 380, 386-387 (1898) (no ex post facto violation where defendant was convicted based on handwriting exemplars that were admissible due to intervening change in rules of evidence); <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 589-590 (1884) (no ex post facto violation where defendant was convicted based on testimony of convicted felon made competent to testify by intervening change in law). Rather, the Supreme Court has determined that only retroactive changes to the burden of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>necessary to convict a defendant, or to the sufficiency of the evidence required to meet that burden, constitute violations of <em>Calder\u2019s </em>fourth category.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The recent case of <em>Carmell </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>529 U.S. 513 (2000), is instructive. There, the Supreme Court found a fourth category violation where a defendant was convicted of sexual assault based on the victim\u2019s uncorroborated testimony, which would have been legally insufficient at the time of the offense but which was rendered legally sufficient at the time of the trial by a change in the law. In holding that this intervening change \u201calter[ed] the legal rules of evidence ... in order to convict\u201d the defendant, the Supreme Court emphasized that it \u201cchanged the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530. The Court described <em>Calder\u2019s </em>fourth category as forbidding laws that \u201csubvert[] the presumption of innocence\u201d by \u201creducing the quantum of evidence required to convict an offender[,] . . . retrospectively eliminating an element of the offense, increasing the punishment for an existing offense, or lowering the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532. To distinguish <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Missouri, supra, </em>and <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>Utah, supra, </em>the <em>Carmell </em>Court focused on the distinction between laws that impermissibly lower the level of sufficiency of evidence required to convict and those that \u201cmerely \u2018regulat[e] ... the mode in which the facts constituting guilt may be placed before the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carmell </em>v. <em>Texas, supra </em>at 545, quoting <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>Utah, supra </em>at 590. Thus, the <em>Carmell </em>decision clarified that <em>Calder\u2019s </em>fourth category is meant to encompass only those laws that alter retroactively the government\u2019s burden of proof or the sufficiency of the evidence necessary to convict a defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">With this in mind, we consider whether \u00a7 6A \u201calters the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>legal rules of evidence, and receives less or different testimony,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and, if so, whether it does so \u201cin order to convict the offender.\u201d We conclude that it does neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">a. <em>\u201cAlters the legal rules of </em>evidence.\u201d The defendant argues that \u00a7 6A \u201calters the legal rules of evidence\u201d regarding proof of a prior OUI conviction by allowing court records of conviction to be prima facie evidence of a conviction without corroborating evidence or live authenticating testimony. The defendant contends that, contrary to our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, </em>421 Mass. 295, 302 (1995), \u00a7 6A allows proof of a prior conviction by \u201c[m]ere identity of name.\u201d The Commonwealth counters that \u00a7 6A did not change, but merely clarified, existing law, and that it does not come within Colder's fourth category because it does not alter the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof or the sufficiency of the evidence necessary to meet that burden. We conclude that however \u00a7 6A may have changed the law, it does not authorize proof of a prior conviction on evidence that was held insufficient in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, supra. </em>Because, so construed, the statute does not reduce the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof or the sufficiency of evidence required to prove a prior conviction, it does not violate the ex post facto clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, supra, </em>we held that, for purposes of proving a prior OUI conviction, \u201c[m]ere identity of name is not sufficient to indicate an identity of person.\u201d We stated that the Commonwealth must produce evidence linking the person named in the conviction record to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 301-302. As the Commonwealth observes, conviction records will often include more identifying information than merely the offender\u2019s name, in which case this requirement will be met.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, to the extent that \u00a7 6A might be read as allowing proof of a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>conviction solely by a record bearing the same name as the defendant\u2019s, it should be obvious that a conviction record bearing the name \u201cJohn Smith\u201d can only be prima facie evidence that someone named John Smith was convicted previously. Our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, supra, </em>established what should be common sense \u2014 that the prior conviction record is not sufficient (indeed, is hardly even probative) unless linked to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Our reasons for construing \u00a7 6A as consistent with the <em>Koney </em>decision are twofold. First, we \u201cpresume that the Legislature is aware of the prior state of the law as explicated by the decisions of this court,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>440 Mass. 436, 441 (2003), quoting <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., </em>432 Mass. 438, 455 (2000) (Cowin, J., dissenting), and do not readily assume that it intends to overrule our decisions sub silentio, see <em>Crown Shade &amp; Screen Co. </em>v. <em>Karlburg, </em>332 Mass. 229, 230-231 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Second, a contrary interpretation of \u00a7 6A invites constitutional difficulty. In a G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, proceeding, prior convictions must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>445 Mass. 161, 174 (2005). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, supra, </em>we held that records bearing only a name were insufficient as a matter of law to meet the Commonwealth\u2019s burden. If the Legislature abrogated the <em>Koney </em>decision, it would effectively authorize proof of a prior conviction by something less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Put differently, a legislative attempt to make \u201cmere identity of name\u201d prima facie evidence of a prior conviction exceeds the Legislature\u2019s constitutional authority to create prima facie inferences in criminal cases. Because we construe statutes to avoid constitutional problems where possible, see <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Executive Director of the Judicial Nominating Council, </em>425 Mass. 406, 410 (1997), we interpret \u00a7 6A, as we did its predecessor, not to authorize proof of a prior conviction by \u201cmere identity of name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Construed in this manner, \u00a7 6A is not a violation of <em>Calder\u2019s </em>fourth category, because it falls on the permissible side of the fine drawn in <em>Carmell </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>529 U.S. 513, 545 (2000). Section 6A does not change the Commonwealth\u2019s burden under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, of proving prior OUI convictions beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>reasonable doubt. Nor does it have the <em>effect </em>of lowering this burden by reducing the sufficiency of the evidence the Commonwealth must introduce. In the <em>Carmell </em>decision, the Texas Legislature took evidence that was formerly <em>insufficient </em>to convict (the victim\u2019s uncorroborated testimony) and retroactively made it <em>sufficient. Carmell </em>v. <em>Texas, supra </em>at 544-546. By contrast, the \u201cprima facie\u201d element of \u00a7 6A does not render sufficient any evidence that would not have been sufficient beforehand.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">This can best be seen by analogy to \u00a7 6A\u2019s predecessor, the former G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4). A court record of conviction, accompanied by probation records linking the defendant to the conviction, would have been sufficient to prove the prior conviction even before former \u00a7 24 (4) <em>assured </em>prosecutors and judges that it would. Indeed, we can think of nothing that would establish the prior conviction more definitively. Likewise, the types of official public records that \u00a7 6A makes prima facie evidence (conviction, probation, corrections, or registry records) each could have been independently sufficient to prove the prior conviction even before Melanie\u2019s Law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, post </em>593, 601-602 (2006). We have long recognized the significant probative value of \u201ca record of a primary fact made by a public officer in the performance of official duty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279, 283 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, 417 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The fact that the evidence designated as prima facie by \u00a7 6A was already sufficient to establish a prior conviction does not make the provision meaningless. As already stated, prima facie provisions serve a useful purpose that does not involve lowering the Commonwealth\u2019s substantive burden of proof: they represent the Legislature\u2019s considered judgment that certain evidence (usually administratively easier to produce) is so probative of an aspect of a crime that it is sufficient to meet the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of production on that issue. Subject to constitutional limits such as we imposed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, supra, </em>and that we reaffirm today, the Legislature is free to make such judgments and prosecutors and judges are entitled to rely on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">b. <em>\u201cIn order to convict the </em>offender.\u201d Even if \u00a7 6A did \u201calter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the legal rules of evidence\u201d with regard to proof of a prior conviction, it would not be \u201cin order to convict the offender\u201d under <em>Calder. </em>Section 6A applies only to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, proceedings, from which no conviction results. Rather, the OUI offender is already convicted of the substantive offense, and the proceeding is only to determine the appropriate punishment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>441 Mass. 783, 787-788 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>422 Mass. 391, 393-394 (1996) (repeat offender provision of OUI statute relates solely to punishment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>389 Mass. 316, 321 (1983) (same). Indeed, speaking of repeat offender statutes generally, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\u201c[A] repeat offender statute \u2018concerns solely the sentence of a person convicted of a [current] violation . . . who has previously been convicted of [another enumerated violation]. The prior offense is not an element of the crime for which a defendant is charged but concerns the punishment to be imposed if he is convicted . . . and the prior offense is proved.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>445 Mass. 161, 169 (2005), quoting <em>Bynum </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 705, 708-709 (1999).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 6A only applies once an OUI offender is already convicted and pertains solely to punishment, it is not used to \u201cconvict the offender\u201d and thus does not implicate Calder\u2019s fourth category.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">5. <em>Due process and confrontation clauses. </em>The defendant argues also that St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 6A, violates the due process and confrontation clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. The second reported question encompasses these arguments, es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>sentially asking whether \u00a7 6A is a permissible exercise of legislative power. We construe likewise the portion of the second reported question that asks whether, notwithstanding \u00a7 6A, Uve testimony is required to prove that prior OUI convictions were in fact those of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The thrust of the defendant\u2019s due process and confrontation clause claims is that \u00a7 6A impermissibly allows proof of a prior OUI conviction based on \u201c[m]ere identity of name,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, supra </em>at 302. As stated above, we construe the statute to be consistent with the <em>Koney </em>decision. Subject to the limitations of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, </em>\u00a7 6A does not violate the confrontation clause by permitting certain public records to serve as prima facie evidence of a prior conviction, with or without live authenticating testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279, 283-284 (2005) (no confrontation clause violation where narcotics analysis certificates are admitted as prima facie evidence of composition, quality, and weight of drugs, without analyst\u2019s testimony). Nor does \u00a7 6A violate principles of due process by permitting these specified records to serve as prima facie evidence of a conviction, because, subject to the limitations of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, supra, </em>any of them is sufficient to prove the prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pauley, </em>368 Mass. 286, 296-298, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 887 (1975) (at least where fact proved can establish prima facie inference beyond reasonable doubt, prima facie provision comports with due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>We hold that the application of \u00a7 6A of Melanie\u2019s Law, St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 6A, as construed in this opinion, to the defendant\u2019s G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, proceeding does not violate the ex post facto, due process, or confrontation clauses of the Federal or State Constitutions.
