Mason (father). General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 30, governs removal from the Commonwealth of children of divorced parents<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where one of the parents seeks to relocate without the consent of the other parent. Removal of the children may be authorized by the court only \u201cupon cause shown,\u201d meaning a showing that removal is in the children\u2019s best interests. <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>370 Mass. 857 (1976). In <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985), we addressed removal where one parent had sole physical custody of the children. Today we consider the appropriate standard where parents have joint physical and legal custody. We conclude that in such a situation \u201ccause shown\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30, means a showing that removal is in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children taking into account all the circumstances and weighing the factors as described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">On the facts in this case, the judge appropriately considered the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children, and did not abuse her discretion in concluding that removal of the children would not serve their best interests. Refusal to authorize removal did not violate the mother\u2019s constitutional right to interstate travel, and there was no reversible error in the admission of certain contested evidence at trial. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts found by the judge. The mother and father married in 1985. Two children were bom of their marriage in 1992 and 1994, respectively, in New Hampshire. The parents divorced there in 1998. The judge found that during the marriage each parent took the part of a \u201cprimary caretaker\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>to the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the marriage, by stipulation the father and mother entered into a joint physical and legal custody agreement that was incorporated into their divorce decree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the agreement, the parents divided physical custody of the children approximately equally. The parties agreed to move within twenty-five miles of Chelmsford, and agreed that, in light of uncertainty as to where each would locate in Massachusetts, the children would attend school in the district of the mother\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Some years passed, and each parent remarried. The mother and father obtained modification of the divorce decree by the Probate and Family Court as required by their changing needs. The father eventually relocated to Nashua, New Hampshire, approximately seventeen miles from Chelmsford. The mother objected privately but had little advance notice of the move and did not file suit to prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Weeks after the father gave notice of his plan to move to Nashua, the mother gave notice of her intent to relocate with the stepfather to Bristol, New Hampshire. The mother\u2019s parents five in Bristol; she planned to move into her parents\u2019 home with her family and eventually into her own home nearby.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The stepfather\u2019s children from a previous marriage (of whom the stepfather had joint custody) and his former wife were also to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>move to Bristol, and the stepfather promised them that he would follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In 2002, testing revealed that the older child, then ten years old, had attention deficit disorder/attention hyperactivity disorder and related learning problems. Although kind and athletic, he lacked appropriate social skills and had trouble making friends. As a result of medication, the hard work of both parents, and a dedicated school staff, the child was able to succeed in fifth grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The Chelmsford school district has initiated a student accommodation plan for the child, and his middle school has established an \u201cactive and effective support system for him.\u201d The judge found that the child is making \u201cgreat strides\u201d both socially and educationally in his middle school.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge further found that, based on the State\u2019s standardized achievement tests, the Chelmsford school system is one of the better school systems in the Commonwealth, and that the Bristol, New Hampshire, middle school ranks below the State average on New Hampshire\u2019s standardized achievement test. The judge concluded that, in light of the disruptions to his developmental process that would be occasioned by the challenges of a new home, school, and sibling, and reduction in the time spent with the father, the move to New Hampshire would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the older child\u2019s socialization and education.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In addition to the developmental issues, the judge found that the mother\u2019s children claimed one of them was inappropriately touched by the son of the mother\u2019s new husband. The allegation caused considerable acrimony between the mother and father. This tension left the child, who subsequently recanted and then reasserted his claim of abuse, feeling \u201cscared about his role in the family\u201d and \u201cemotionally harmed\u201d by his parents\u2019 ongoing conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">When the mother informed the father of her intention to move to New Hampshire, the father refused to consent to removal of the children from the Commonwealth and filed a complaint for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>modification of the divorce decree in the Probate and Family Court seeking, among other things, sole physical custody and a temporary order enjoining the mother from removing the children from the Commonwealth. The mother counterclaimed for modification granting her sole physical custody and for a temporary order permitting the planned relocation to Bristol, New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">A probate judge allowed the father\u2019s temporary order enjoining removal and other judges issued orders not material here. After some time, and a four-day trial, a different judge weighed the best interests of the children and determined that removal to New Hampshire in the manner requested by the mother was not in the best interests of the children and thus would not be authorized by the court. The judge found that Chelmsford schools were preferable to those of Bristol, particularly for the child with special needs; that uprooting the children would be detrimental to their interests; that the move would cause a reduction of the father\u2019s parenting time that would not be in the children\u2019s interests; that misconduct allegations against a step-sibling weighed against increased time in the mother\u2019s household; and that there was insufficient evidence of financial imperative to justify the mother\u2019s move to Bristol. The judge determined that the father\u2019s move to Nashua did not provide ground for the relief requested by the mother, and the judge did not award sole physical custody to either party, deciding instead to order continued shared legal and physical custody. The mother appealed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>True joint custody is divisible into two components: shared legal custody and shared physical custody. C.P. Kindregan, Jr., &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 47:1 at 395-396 (3d ed. 2002); Folberg, Joint Custody \u00a7 13.01[2], in 2 Child Custody &amp; Visitation Law and Practice (2005), citing <em>Pascale </em>v. <em>Pascale, </em>140 N.J. 583, 595-596 (1995) (Folberg). Shared legal custody carries \u201cmutual responsibility and involvement by both parents in major decisions regarding the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>welfare including matters of education, medical care and emotional, moral and religious development.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. This contrasts to sole legal custody, which gives to only one parent these rights and responsibilities. <em>Id. </em>Shared physical custody contemplates that \u201ca child shall have periods of residing with and being under the supervision of each parent . . . assuring] . . . frequent and continued contact with both parents.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. This contrasts to sole physical custody which generally reflects that the children reside with only one parent \u201csubject to reasonable visitation by the other parent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Although the General Laws state that there is no presumption \u201ceither in favor or against shared . . . custody at the time of trial on the merits,\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31, such an arrangement is generally appropriate only if the parties demonstrate an ability and desire to cooperate amicably and communicate with one another to raise the children. Folberg, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 13.06[1]; Gardner, Joint Custody is Not for Everyone 63, 66 (1982), reprinted in Joint Custody and Shared Parenting (J. Folberg, ed. 1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cJoint custody is synonymous with joint decision making and a common desire to promote the children\u2019s best interests. \u2018It is understandable, therefore, that joint custody is encouraged primarily as a voluntary alternative for relatively stable, amicable parents behaving in mature civilized fashion,\u2019 <em>Braiman </em>v. <em>Braiman, </em>44 N.Y.2d 584, 589-590 (1978) . . . . [I]n order to be effective \u2018joint custody requires ... a willingness and ability to work together to reach results on major decisions in a manner similar to the way married couples make decisions.\u2019 Taussig &amp; Carpenter, Joint Custody, 56 N.D. L. Rev. 223, 234 (1980).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\"><em>Rolde </em>v. <em>Rolde, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404-405 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Shared physical custody in particular carries with it substantial obligation for cooperation between the parents. Such an arrangement, by its nature, involves shared commitment to coordinate extensively a variety of the details of everyday life. E.E. Maccoby &amp; R.H. Mnookin, Dividing the Child: Social and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Legal Dilemmas of Custody 217-227 (1992). Shared physical custody necessitates ongoing joint scheduling and provision for supervision and transportation of children between homes, schools, and youth activities. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 227 (discussing coordination by parents of rules for children in two households). It is thus incumbent on a parent who has been awarded joint physical custody to recognize that the viability of the endeavor is dependent on his or her ability and willingness to subordinate personal preferences to make the relationship work. While a joint physical custody agreement remains in effect, each parent necessarily surrenders a degree of prerogative in certain life decisions, e.g., choice of habitation, that may affect the feasibility of shared physical custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In this case, the mother wishes to remove the children from the Commonwealth, and the father, who shares legal and physical custody jvith her, has refused to consent. The mother has thus requested permission from the court to remove the children. General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 30, provides that \u201c[a] minor child of divorced parents who is a native of or has resided five years within this [C] ommonwealth and over whose custody and maintenance a probate court has jurisdiction shall not ... be removed out of this [C]ommonwealth ... if under [the] age [of consent], without the consent of both parents, unless the court upon cause shown otherwise orders.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe words \u2018upon cause shown\u2019 mean only that removal must be in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985), citing <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>370 Mass. 857 (1976). See <em>Welker </em>v. <em>Welker, </em>325 Mass. 738, 746 (1950). \u201c[T]he best interests of the child standard is one grounded in the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>needs and circumstances of the individual child in question.\u201d <em>Adoption of Vito, </em>431 Mass. 550, 566 (2000). Assuming the judge\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous, we review her determination of the best interests of the children only for an abuse of discretion. <em>White </em>v. <em>Laingor, </em>434 Mass. 64, 68 (2001), quoting <em>Boulter-Hedley </em>v. <em>Boulter, </em>429 Mass. 808, 811 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Where physical custody is shared, the \u201cbest interest\u201d calculus pertaining to removal is appreciably different from those situations that involve sole physical custody. American Law Institute\u2019s (ALI) Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a7 2.17 (1), (4) (c) (2002).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>In re Marriage of Burgess, </em>13 Cal. 4th 25, 40 n.12 (1996); <em>In re Marriage of Francis, </em>919 P.2d 776, 786 n.12 (Colo. 1996), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>In re Marriage of Ciesluk, </em>113 P.3d 135, 138 (Colo. 2005); <em>Baures </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>167 NJ. 91, 116 (2001). See also Richards, Children\u2019s Rights v. Parents\u2019 Rights: A Proposed Solution to the Custodial Relocation Conundrum, 29 N.M. L. Rev. 245, 264 (1999) (removal standard should differentiate between cases involving primary residential parent and those involving shared physical custody). Where physical custody is shared, a judge\u2019s willingness to elevate one parent\u2019s interest in relocating freely with the children is often diminished. Terry, Relocation: Moving Forward, or Moving Backward?, 15 J. Am. Acad. Matrimonial Law. 167, 212-213 (1998). No longer is the fortune of simply one custodial parent so tightly interwoven with that of the child; both parents have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>equal rights and responsibilities with respect to the children. The importance to the children of one parent\u2019s advantage in relocating outside the Commonwealth is greatly reduced. See Wallerstein, To Move or Not to Move: Psychological and Legal Considerations in the Relocation of Children Following Divorce, 30 Fam. L.Q. 305, 318 (1996) (\u201ca parent with true joint physical custody proposing a move should be required to prove that [relocation] is in the best interest of the child, and not merely desired by the moving parent\u201d). ALI Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.17 (1), (4) (c) (see note 10, <em>supra), </em>recently adopted by the ALI, supports the view that where \u201cneither parent has been exercising a clear majority of custodial responsibility,\u201d the effect of the relocation on the child is a \u201crelevant factor[]\u201d in determining the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Where physical custody is shared and neither parent has a clear majority of custodial responsibility, the child\u2019s interests will typically \u201cfavor protection of the child\u2019s relationships with both parents because both are, in a real sense, primary to the child\u2019s development.\u201d Wallerstein, <em>supra </em>at 318. Distant relocation often impedes \u201cfrequent and continued contact\u201d with the remaining joint custodian. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31; Kindregan, Family Interests in Competition: Relocation and Visitation, 36 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 31, 36 (2002) (Kindregan). Cf. <em>In re Marriage of Seagondollar, </em>139 Cal. App. 4th 1116, 1119 (2006) (removal from California \u201cnecessarily interferes with the other parent\u2019s ability to have frequent and continuing contact with\u201d children).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Joint physical custody need not necessarily be impeded by relocation outside the Commonwealth. In some cases, distance between the parents may not greatly increase as a result of removal. In addition, there are significant differences in the individual tolerances of the custodians and the children. Waller-stein, <em>supra </em>at 320 (\u201cTravel plans and arrangements should be tailored to the age, temperament, and wishes of the child\u201d). Cf. Kindregan, <em>supra </em>at 53 (shuttling of children between households \u201cby air, bus, or rail . . . extremely disruptive of the child\u2019s social life and development\u201d). It is a question for a judge, taking into account all of the facts, whether an increase in travel time between households and schools brought about by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>removal, and other burdens of distance, will significantly impair either parent\u2019s ability to exercise existing responsibilities, and ultimately whether removal is in a child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We turn to the propriety of the judge\u2019s order denying permission for the mother to remove the children. The order is based on the judge\u2019s findings that the children\u2019s best interests would be negatively affected by this move. She made detailed written findings that their current schools were superior, that uprooting the children would be difficult for them, that the move would impair the father\u2019s parenting to the detriment of their interests, that potential misconduct by other siblings in the mother\u2019s household weighed against increased physical custody by the mother, and that any financial or other advantage<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the move to the mother was unclear. From this the judge determined that it was not in the children\u2019s best interests to be removed to Bristol.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The mother disagrees with the judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, but \u201c[findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 52 (a) (2006). We do not substitute our judgment of the evidence for the subsidiary findings of the judge absent clear error, see <em>G.E.B. </em>v. <em>S.R.W., </em>422 Mass. 158, 172 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>415 Mass. 814, 821-822 (1993) (Liacos, C.J., dissenting), or a \u201cfirm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977). The mother advances several arguments with regard to the judge\u2019s findings of fact, none of which is persuasive. The judge was not required to adopt the opinions of a guardian ad litem, therapist, psychologist, school official, and other evaluator, each of which were different from those of the judge in certain particulars.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s findings regarding financial matters are also not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>internally inconsistent or unsupported by evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Her findings regarding the situation are warranted by the evidence and, based on them, her conclusion that removal is not in the children\u2019s best interests is not an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The mother contends in passing, without citation to directly relevant judicial authority, that the judge\u2019s refusal to authorize removal of the children from the Commonwealth offended her right to freedom of movement pursuant to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Cf. <em>Saenz </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>526 U.S. 489, 504-507 (1999) (unconstitutional burden of restrictions on program eligibility). To the contrary, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30, does not restrict the mother\u2019s right of travel, only her right to remove children within the law\u2019s scope.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge here determined that removal would clearly not serve the best interests of the children. Thus, we are satisfied that the mother\u2019s travel was not unconstitutionally impeded by the application of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30. See <em>Gallup </em>v. <em>Gallup, </em>271 Mass. 252, 257-258 (1930). See Kindregan, <em>supra </em>at 48 (right of parent to relocate with child subject to State\u2019s power to promote child\u2019s best interests).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The mother also maintains that it was erroneous to admit at trial a reproduction of notes made by a school counsellor. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>argues that the copied notes were inadmissible because they were not proper business records, were not the best evidence available, and were not authenticated by affidavit. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 79E, 79J. The counsellor who made the notes testified that she was the one who recorded them and testified as well to much of their content. Although their admission may not have complied precisely with the rules of evidence, other evidence was properly admitted that clearly supports the judge\u2019s decision. We are satisfied \u201cwith substantial confidence that the error would not have made a material difference.\u201d <em>DeJesus </em>v. <em>Yogel, </em>404 Mass. 44, 49 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Probate and Family Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\"> Certain children are excepted from the statute\u2019s provisions.

Bercume, 428 Mass. 635, 638-641 (1999) (addressing argument that divorce agreement bound parties in contract after merger with judgment), and they bring to our attention no New Hampshire authority to that effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The stipulations did not expressly characterize the arrangement as \u201cjoint physical custody,\u201d but the parties\u2019 arguments assume that this was the relationship among the parents and children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The mother testified at trial that her parents had vacated their three-bedroom home and were living in a trailer on the property in anticipation of the family\u2019s arrival. The mother planned to occupy her parents\u2019 vacant home with her two children, the stepfather, his two children, and a newborn child with whom she was pregnant at the time of trial. The mother planned to accommodate the newborn child by dividing the large master bedroom in two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The child attends a group organized by a guidance counsellor in his middle school that provides a safe setting for children to practice social skills.

Although the mother concedes that the children had lived in the Commonwealth for five years when judgment entered, it is notable that they had not resided in the Commonwealth for five years when the mother requested permission for removal. The mother notes this in her brief but fails to argue that the children were excluded from the scope of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30, at the time of judgment by reason of the duration of their residence. The mother also fails to argue that the relocation of the father and joint physical custodian to New Hampshire affected the applicability of \u00a7 30, or that the judge\u2019s order granting the father joint physical custody at his home in New Hampshire amounted to the permission necessary for removal by the mother pursuant to \u00a7 30. We express no opinion on these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b210-6\"> The Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution \u00a7 2.17 (2002), as adopted and promulgated by the American Law Institute, state in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u201c(1) The relocation of a parent constitutes a substantial change in circumstances . . . only when the relocation significantly impairs either parent\u2019s ability to exercise responsibilities the parent has been exercising or attempting to exercise [under the judgement of divorce], &lt;1</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u201c(4) When a relocation constituting changed circumstances . . . renders it impractical to maintain the same proportion of custodial responsibility to each parent, the court should modify the parenting plan in accordance with the child\u2019s best interests ... in accordance with the following principles: tt</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">\u201c(c) If neither parent has been exercising a clear majority of custodial responsibility for the child, the court should modify the plan [e.g., enter an order] in accordance with the child\u2019s best interests, taking into account all relevant factors including the effects of the relocation on the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The advantages may include, for example, a greater support network or other nonfinancial considerations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\">For example, the guardian ad litem recommended that the mother be permitted to relocate to Bristol, New Hampshire, that the father\u2019s custody be concentrated on nonschool days, and that the mother should occasionally provide roundtrip transportation to a midway-point between the residences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\"> The mother argues that the judge failed to consider that the father worked part time in the general vicinity of Bristol, New Hampshire. The mother misreads the judge\u2019s findings of fact, which state that, \u201c[a]s a ski instructor, the [fjather travels up to the ski area on Saturday and returns on Sunday [and thus] [i]t would be difficult for [him] to have parenting time with his children during the ski season, if his parenting time were to be reduced primarily to weekends.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> Because of our decision, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether the parties were bound by the \u201cchange of address\u201d portion of the divorce decree to remain in the vicinity of Chelmsford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> Other courts have reached similar results. See, e.g., <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>489 N.E.2d 90, 100 (Ind. Ct. App. 1986); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Schilb, </em>877 S.W.2d 665, 668 (Mo. Ct.

Some courts have concluded that there is no violation of a parent\u2019s right to travel interstate if a restriction or burden serves the children\u2019s best interests.
