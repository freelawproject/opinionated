L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1), as amended through St. 2003, c. 28, of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (OUI), fourth offense. He grounds his appeal on the contention that the Commonwealth did not present sufficient evidence to prove that he had committed the prior offenses. We granted direct appellate review. We conclude that the evidence was sufficient, and therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>1. <em>Legal framework. </em>The offense of OUI and penalties for the first and subsequent offenses are set forth in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24. The statute defines OUI, for our purposes, as \u201coperating] a motor vehicle with a percentage, by weight, of alcohol in [the operator\u2019s] blood of eight one-hundredths or greater, or while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1). The statute provides enhanced penalties for subsequent offenses. For example, a defendant may face more substantial fines and a longer term of incarceration if he \u201chas been previously convicted or assigned to an alcohol. . . education, treatment, or rehabilitation program by a court . . . because of a like offense three times preceding the date of the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Trial of a subsequent OUI offense entails two separate proceedings. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11A. The defendant is tried first for the crime presently charged, and if guilty, he is entitled to a separate \u201ctrial of the issue of conviction of . . . prior offenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4), inserted by St. 1986, c. 620, \u00a7 13, set forth the type of evidence that could be used to establish the prior convictions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cIn any prosecution commenced pursuant to this section, introduction into evidence of a prior conviction or prior finding of sufficient facts by . . . certified attested copy of original court papers, accompanied by a certified attested copy of the biographical and informational data from official probation office records, shall be prima facie evidence that a defendant has been convicted previously or assigned to an alcohol or controlled substance education, treatment, or rehabilitation program because of a like offense by a court of the commonwealth one or more times preceding the date of commission of the offense for which said defendant is being prosecuted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">On its face, \u00a7 24 (4) endorsed proof of the Commonwealth\u2019s prima facie case by court papers (reflecting prior \u201clike\u201d of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>fenses) accompanied by probation office records (for purposes of identifying the defendant). The provision did not restrict expressly the evidence sufficient to prove prior OUI offenses, nor did it expressly authorize use of other evidence, such as records of the registry of motor vehicles (RMV) or live witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">2. <em>Background. </em>The defendant was charged in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department with OUI, fourth offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The charge resulted from an arrest in September, 2004. At trial, the defendant pleaded guilty to the OUI offense. Then, in a separate trial held pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11A, the Commonwealth sought to establish that this was the defendant\u2019s fourth offense. To prove the three prior convictions (or assignments by courts to alcohol programs), the Commonwealth presented the following evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The police officer who arrested the defendant in 2004 identified the defendant in court as the person whom he had arrested and recited the name, date of birth, and address that the defendant had given him. Certified records of the RMV also assisted in establishing the defendant\u2019s identity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>The records contained a color photograph of the defendant, his full name and date of birth, and his current and former addresses. Those RMV records contained references to three prior OUI offenses. In particular, the RMV records reflected an entry in 1989 for \u201cDWP<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alcohol Program Watertown G,\u201d that stated a code number indicating that the record related to a matter in the Waltham Division of the District Court Department (first offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The Commonwealth also introduced court records of the latter two convictions. Certified prior convictions stated that, as a result of an incident in 1994, the defendant was convicted of OUI, second offense (second offense), and that as a result of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>incident in 1995, he was convicted of OUI, third or subsequent offense (third offense). The full name and date of birth that were displayed on the court records matched the defendant\u2019s information in RMV data, as well as the information that the defendant gave the arresting officer during the 2004 incident. The addresses in the court records also correlated generally to the prior addresses of the defendant contained in RMV records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The Commonwealth contended that court records relating to the third offense conviction were sufficient to prove there had been three \u201clike\u201d offenses prior to the 2004 incident (i.e., a third offense and two earlier offenses), thereby providing the basis for a fourth offense conviction. It argued that one conviction for third offense OUI was sufficient to establish the fact of the three prior convictions. The Commonwealth maintained as well that other evidence demonstrated that the instant offense was the fourth one. The court record of conviction of second offense OUI indicated a conviction of a first and second offense, RMV records reflected all three offenses, and RMV records and the testimony of the officer provided the defendant\u2019s biographical information. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s oral motion for a determination that \u201cthere [was not] sufficient evidence for [conviction of] a fourth offense\u201d (which we take as the equivalent of a motion for a required finding) and found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had committed three prior \u201clike\u201d offenses. He based the finding on all the evidence, in particular, the testimony of the officer, a photograph in RMV records that \u201cappealed] to be\u201d the defendant, and the information in court and RMV records. The judge sentenced the defendant accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>3. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient based on his interpretation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4), and our holdings in prior cases. Specifically, he construes our prior cases, and implicitly the statute, as requiring that the Commonwealth introduce certified copies of each prior conviction and argues that the evidence admitted (including certified court papers showing a conviction for GUI, third offense) was insufficient. He also maintains that the statute permitted the Commonwealth to use biographical information from the probation office to prove the offenses, but not biographical information from RMV records. Finally, he argues that, pursuant to our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, </em>421 Mass. 295, 302 (1995), and an amendment to \u00a7 24 (4) that was inapplicable to his trial, \u201clive witness\u201d testimony was required to prove that he was the defendant in the court records, and that the officer\u2019s testimony could not establish that fact. We address these arguments together because they all involve construction of the statute and the sufficiency of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We begin by considering whether the defendant\u2019s claims regarding the GUI statute, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, and in particular \u00a7 24 (4), are correct, i.e., that the statute required three certified records of convictions, along with records of the probation office and \u201clive testimony.\u201d As discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, ante </em>577, 582 (2006), the Legislature may set forth the proof necessary to demonstrate guilt of an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The plain language of \u00a7 24 (4) identified as \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d any \u201ccertified attested cop[les] of original court papers\u201d tending to prove the existence of a \u201cprior conviction or prior finding of sufficient facts,\u201d where the papers were accompanied by probation office information. The provision did not contain language expressly requiring introduction of the above evidence. It was silent concerning RMV records and \u201clive witness\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The defendant argues that we should interpret the \u201cexpression of one [or more] thing[s]\u201d in \u00a7 24 (4) as \u201can implied exclusion of other things omitted from the statute.\u201d See <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Auth., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975). He maintains that, because the above proof was expressly approved, use of other proofs was implicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>forbidden, although at oral argument he conceded somewhat inconsistently that not all other proofs would necessarily be impermissible or insufficient. It would follow, he contends, that the evidence admitted at trial was thus insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We assume that, if the Legislature intended evidence of prior offenses to be limited in the manner argued by the defendant, it would have said so explicitly. See <em>Bech </em>v. <em>Cuevas, </em>404 Mass. 249, 254 (1989). The purpose of \u00a7 24 (4) was not to restrict evidence, but to highlight an easily obtainable minimum to prove a prima facie case. The statute did not state that, because two types of proof were named, nothing else could be used. It said only that this was <em>one </em>way to meet the burden of proof for penalty enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with our construction of analogous statutes, runs counter to the Legislature\u2019s intent, and relies on an unwarranted distinction among the pieces of evidence and testimony presented by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 24 (4) is consistent with decisions construing similar language elsewhere in the General Laws. For example, G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 13, provides that a duly executed certificate of a qualified analyst (State or Federal) \u201cshall be prima facie evidence\u201d of the attributes of a narcotic or other drug, poison, medicine, or chemical. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>399 Mass. 465, 467 (1987), we concluded that the provision did not require the type of proof endorsed by the statute to the exclusion of all other manner of proof. We stated that other evidence of the attributes of a substance was also sufficient, such as testimony of an \u201cexperienced user of a controlled substance . . . that a substance that he saw and used was a particular drug.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same is true of another statute that states that certain proof is \u201cprima facie\u201d evidence of a particular fact. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>368 Mass. 58, 82-83 (1975) (interpreting G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 176). The provisions in question do not prohibit proof by means other than the kind specifically mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The legislative history of \u00a7 24 (4) likewise supports the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to limit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>evidence that could be used to prove prior OUI offenses. The provision was added to the OUI statute by St. 1986, c. 620, \u00a7 13, part of an emergency act whose purpose, as stated in the preamble, was to \u201cimmediately provide for an increase in the penalties for [OUI] . . . , [that being] necessary for the immediate preservation of the public safety.\u201d St. 1986, c. 620, preamble. At a time when the Legislature perceived a need for increased penalties to combat the threat presented by intoxicated drivers, the Legislature hardly would have been disposed to restrict the type of evidence available to prove prior convictions. See 1986 House Doc. No. 4705, at 1 (Governor\u2019s letter proposing amendment). It was not the purpose of the amendment that added \u00a7 24 (4) to render the evidence listed therein the sole method of proof, nor was its purpose to create a requirement that \u201clive witness\u201d testimony be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We are not persuaded that there is merit to the distinctions proffered by the defendant. The record discloses no material difference between the RMV and probation offices for purposes of generating reliable driving and biographical information, and little difference between the RMV and courts with respect to generating records of \u201clike\u201d OUI offenses. Our statutes generally command licensed drivers and courts to convey to the RMV in timely fashion the information at issue here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A driver is also required to recite to an inquiring police officer (such as the officer that arrested the defendant in 2004) the operator\u2019s true \u201cname and address.\u201d See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25. A limitation on the usefulness of court records likewise would be unsound. A judgment of conviction for a third offense may appropriately be relied on to establish culpability for the first two offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The statute at issue, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4), was amended after the trial of the instant case. The amendment, St. 2005, c. 122, is known as \u201cMelanie\u2019s Law,\u201d and the parties agree that it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>not govern this case. The defendant contends, however, that the changes made by Melanie\u2019s Law support his arguments, that under the version of the statute in effect at the time of his trial, probation records and \u201clive witness\u201d testimony were required. He contends that the amendment to \u00a7 24 (4) made by Melanie\u2019s Law aids in interpreting the statute as existing before the amendment. That law amended \u00a7 24 (4) to permit the use of various types of records (jail, house of correction, department of correction, probation, or RMV) as alternatives to certified prior convictions to establish prima facie evidence of a defendant\u2019s previous conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The amendment also specifically states that live witness testimony is not required.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The defendant contends that the amendment would have been superfluous if it endorsed types of proof that had previously been sufficient. He argues that the court should interpret the prior \u00a7 24 (4) as prohibiting reliance by the finder of fact on RMV records and requiring \u201clive witness\u201d testimony, because a contrary interpretation would render superfluous the changes brought about by Melanie\u2019s Law. See <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Mass. 327, 332 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaughey, 9 </em>Gray 296, 297 (1857).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument fails because the amendments to \u00a7 24 (4) have a meaning entirely different from that which he suggests. Melanie\u2019s Law has authorized a variety of types of evidence that will constitute prima facie evidence. It permits the Commonwealth to use prior convictions alone or various criminal justice records to prove the prior offenses. The statement that no live witness testimony is required codifies prior law, and is thus not superfluous. Cf. <em>ACE Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>437 Mass. 241, 248-249 (2002) (duplicate codification superfluous because other language \u201calready stated unambiguously\u201d existing law). The language does not suggest that, before Melanie\u2019s Law, \u00a7 24 (4) required probation office records and \u201clive witness\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Having concluded that the Legislature did not set forth in \u00a7 24 (4) a requirement that the listed evidence be presented, we turn to our prior cases concerning sufficiency of evidence. We have said that proof is sufficient if \u201cthere was enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each . . . element [of the crime] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). A finder of fact may draw any reasonable and possible inference from the evidence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770, 779 (2005). Circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to prove matters in dispute, including the existence of prior offenses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In respect to proof of prior convictions, we require more than \u201c[m]ere identity of name\u201d from the documents introduced, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, </em>421 Mass. 295, 302 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>(1995), but we have never said that live witness testimony was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Consistent with these authorities, the conviction here was well supported. Evidence was admitted at trial of prior \u201clike\u201d offenses, which was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that there were, in fact, three prior offenses. Proof was also admitted that was sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the defendant was the person who was convicted of these offenses. The Commonwealth demonstrated not only \u201cidentity of name,\u201d but also a correlation in court records with the defendant\u2019s date of birth and prior addresses. RMV records, which contained more particularized identifying information (including a photograph that \u201cappealed] to be\u201d the defendant), also reflected the offenses and the fact that they were the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The evidence was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had \u201cbeen previously convicted or assigned to an alcohol . . . education, treatment, or rehabilitation program by a court. . . because of a like offense three times preceding the date of the commission of the [2004 OUI] offense.\u201d See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1) (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\"> There are also provisions specifying lesser enhancements for conviction of second and third offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> We use the past tense because the statute was amended after conclusion of the trial at issue here. See St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 6A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\"> The defendant was charged initially with OUI, third offense, but the complaint was amended to charge a fourth offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> All of the official records were certified and admitted over objection. See Mass. R. Grim. R 40 (a) (1), 378 Mass. 917 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279, 283 (2005). Despite the facts that the defendant objected to the admissibility of the documentary evidence and that this evidence was admitted over objection, he has not pursued the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\"> We understand that \u201cDWI,\u201d driving while intoxicated, is the same as the offense of \u201coperating under the influence\u201d or OUI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\"> The court record of the third offense bore the address reflected in the registry of motor vehicles (RMV) records as the defendant\u2019s residence at the time (excepting the postal code). The court record of the second offense had the same city as the RMV records but did not have the same street address. The discrepancy appeared to arise from an error of transcription (\u201c12 Thorn-bridge St., Cambridge, MA,\u201d appeared in the court record, while \u201c112 Trow-bridge St., Cambridge, MA,\u201d appeared in the RMV record).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The complaint for the last offense contained more substantial identifying information such as Social Security number, gender, and height, which also matched RMV records, but the address in court records (given by the defendant to the arresting officer) was slightly different from the address reflected in RMV records; the last digit of the street number and the last digit of the postal code were different.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\"> Section 24 (4) also did not bear explicitly on admissibility. It related to relevance and sufficiency, not admissibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\"> Licensed drivers must inform the RMV of biographical and descriptive information (such as current address) to obtain a license, and they must renew their operators\u2019 licenses regularly. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 8. See 540 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.06(3) (1996). Courts must \u201cimmediately\u201d report to the registrar of motor vehicles any revocation of a license that results from an OUI conviction. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(b).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\"> The amendment accomplished this by substituting for the prior requirement that convictions \u201cbe accompanied by\u201d official probation records, that convictions now could be proved by prior convictions <em>or </em>copies of biographical data from any of the criminal justice agencies. General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (4), now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cIn any prosecution commenced pursuant to this section, introduction into evidence of a prior conviction or a prior finding of sufficient facts by either certified attested copies of original court papers, or certified attested copies of the defendant\u2019s biographical and informational data from records of the department of probation, any jail or house of correction!], the department of correction, or the registry, shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant before the court had been convicted previously or assigned to an alcohol or controlled substance education, treatment, or rehabilitation program by a court of the commonwealth or any other jurisdiction.
