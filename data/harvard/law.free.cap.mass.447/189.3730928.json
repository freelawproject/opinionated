The plaintiffs challenge to the certification was filed in the county court, and was reserved and reported to the full court by a single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The plaintiffs claim is that the proposed amendment, which seeks to overrule the rule of constitutional law announced in <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309 (2003) (due process and equal protection clauses of Massachusetts Constitution bar limiting marriage to heterosexual couples), constitutes the \u201creversal of a judicial decision\u201d and therefore is excluded from the initiative process by art. 48, The Initiative, Part II, \u00a7 2, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree. Neither the plain meaning of the words \u201creversal of a judicial decision\u201d nor their intended meaning as understood in the context of the Debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1917-1918, from which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>emerged, supports the broad interpretation of the exclusion pressed by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">1. <em>Discussion. </em>The initiative as set out in art. 48, Part I, empowers \u201ca specified number of voters to submit constitutional amendments and laws to the people for approval or rejection,\u201d subject to the exclusion of certain matters. See art. 48, Part II, \u00a7 2. Measures that relate to \u201cthe reversal of a judicial decision\u201d are excluded from the initiative process. <em>Id. </em>In interpreting any statutory or constitutional provision, including this exclusion, the starting point of our analysis is its plain language, \u201cthe principal source of insight into legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 242 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 720 (1984). \u201c \u2018Its words are to be given their natural and obvious sense according to common and approved usage at the time of its adoption,\u2019 although the historical context should not \u2018controlO the plain meaning of the language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>432 Mass. 515, 526 (2000), quoting <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>289 Mass. 149, 158, appeals dismissed, 296 U.S. 543 (1935), and sub nom. <em>Brink </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>297 U.S. 725 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The \u201creversal of a judicial decision\u201d has a specialized meaning in our jurisprudence. It contemplates a peculiarly judicial function, consisting principally of the power to vacate or to set aside the decision in a particular case. See <em>Loanes </em>v. <em>Gast, </em>216 Mass. 197, 199 (1913). Where the court vacates or sets aside a decision, the rights of the parties, as previously determined by the same or another court, are affected. It is, at a minimum, this judicial function that the plain language of art. 48 declares off limits to the initiative process, essentially excluding from that process a petition that would permit the citizens to review a decision of the court, and reverse its determination of the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The \u201coverruling\u201d of the prospective application of a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>decision, by amending the Constitution (or by enacting a new statute) is fundamentally different. Such action does not affect the determination of the rights of the litigants, or the application of the law, made by the court in a particular case, nor does it subject the court\u2019s decision to a nonjudicial review. Contrast <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Group of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>418 Mass. 238 (1994), rev\u2019d sub nom. <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Irish-American, Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Group of Boston, </em>515 U.S. 557 (1995) (judgment of Supreme Judicial Court affirming entitlement of group of gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of Irish immigrants to march in privately organized parade reversed by United States Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds). The underlying substantive law is simply changed to reflect the present intentions of the people, and that new law will be applied thereafter in any subsequent case or cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">While it is not uncommon for this court to \u201creverse\u201d decisions made in the lower courts, we have also, on occasion, \u201coverruled\u201d prior decisions interpreting the Constitution,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or a common-law principle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When we have done so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>however, we have not \u201creversed\u201d those decisions, in the sense of stripping from the parties the determinations made in their cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, we have merely removed or altered the precedential or prospective effect of the decisions. This power is not peculiarly judicial, and has been exercised legislatively on many occasions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">From this perspective, it is apparent that the plain language of art. 48 does not bar the people from using the initiative process to amend the Constitution prospectively, thereby changing the substantive law to be applied and effectively \u201coverruling\u201d the precedential effect of a prior court decision interpreting it, because such an amendment does not constitute the \u201creversal of a judicial decision,\u201d as we have understood the meaning of those words.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Delving into the historical context from which the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>of the exclusion emerged affords no further assistance to the plaintiff. We previously have had occasion to consider the meaning of the exclusion in that context. In <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 517, the court addressed a number of challenges to the Attorney General\u2019s certification of an initiative petition that proposed a new law regarding the expansion of \u201cthe scope of the commonwealth\u2019s drug treatment program\u201d and \u201cthe forfeiture of assets used in connection with drug offenses.\u201d One of those challenges was that the proposed law fell within the \u201creversal of a judicial decision\u201d exclusion, because the petition, as worded, \u201cmight have the effect of reversing a trial judge\u2019s \u2018final order\u2019 regarding an asset forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In ruling that the art. 48 exclusion did not apply, the court turned to the debates on the constitutional convention of 1917-1918, regarding the Initiative. 2 Debates in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention 1917-1918 (1918). The court noted that the \u201creversal of a judicial decision\u201d exclusion, as well as other exclusions relating to \u201cthe appointment [and] tenure . . . of judges\u201d and \u201cthe powers, creation or abolition of courts,\u201d were intended to secure the continued independence of the judiciary, and, in particular, the power of the Supreme Judicial Court to declare statutes unconstitutional, without the fear of reprisals from the people. <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 525-528. By further examining the specific meaning that the word \u201creversal\u201d was intended to convey, the court noted that the original language used in the debates was \u201crecall,\u201d and that the word had been changed to \u201creversal\u201d during editing, but that the change did not intend any change in meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 527 n.12. The court then noted that it was \u201cclear that the delegates understood the phrase [recall] to refer to Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s controversial 1912 proposal by that name.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527. \u201cAs used by Mr. Roosevelt, the phrase described the situation in which a State court sets aside a statute as unconstitutional and the people are given the opportunity to reinstate the same law, notwithstanding the court\u2019s declaration of its unconstitutionality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527-528.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The <em>Mazzone </em>court concluded that by excluding petitions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>relate to the \u201creversal of a judicial decision,\u201d \u201cthe constitutional convention intended no more than to prevent a statute, declared unconstitutional by a State court, from being submitted to the people directly and thereby reenacted notwithstanding the court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528. \u201cCitizens may overrule a decision based on State constitutional grounds, but may do so only by constitutional amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court pointed out that an interpretation that would exclude from the initiative process petitions for amendments related to laws that a court had already applied, if the enactment of the amendments might result in a different decision in the future, \u201cwould effectively eviscerate the popular initiative\u201d envisioned in art. 48. <em>Id}</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The court\u2019s conclusion in the <em>Mazzone </em>decision that art. 48, even with its exclusions, permits the people to petition for a constitutional amendment overruling a decision based on State constitutional grounds, accurately reflects the tenor of the debates on this point. In those debates, the chairman of the Committee on Initiative and Referendum, John W. Cummings, of Fall River, spoke in favor of the initiative, explaining that the need for the initiative process was driven by the lack of action on the part of the General Court in amending laws and the Constitution in the face of decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court striking down worker protection statutes (as violative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the Constitution\u2019s due process clause), and adopting common-law principles (such as the \u201cfellow-servants doctrine\u201d) that placed extraordinary burdens on workers and their families. 2 Debates, <em>supra </em>at 595-597 (remarks of Mr. Cummings). He specifically noted that the distrust among workers engendered by these decisions was not so much directed to the court, where \u201cthey seemed to take it for granted that they should accept the law as [the court] found it\u201d; rather, it was directed at the Legislature, which made no attempt to relieve them of the burdens thereby created. <em>Id. </em>at 597 (remarks of Mr. Cummings). It was the initiative process that would now afford an alternative avenue for such relief if faced with an recalcitrant Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Notably, it was also Mr. Cummings who proposed the judicial exclusions to the initiative, including the exclusion of matters relating to the \u201crecall [or reversal] of judicial decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789. As the principal proponent of these exclusions, Mr. Cummings was called on to answer many questions about their scope. <em>Id. </em>at 789-795. In doing so, he explained that the exclusions were intended to protect the independence of the judiciary, by ensuring that the Justices were not subjected to unjust criticisms and drawn into political debates \u201cto defend themselves or their decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790. Disagreements about what the law should provide could be accommodated by the initiative process (not the \u201crecall\u201d process), where \u201cif the courts declare a law unconstitutional we have the power to expand the Constitution and reenact the law and make it constitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791. In this way, public debate would more properly be focused on whether some laws, or the Constitution, ought to be amended to conform with the current expectations and wishes of the people, and not on the legal correctness of previous judicial decisions interpreting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In sum, the plain meaning of the words \u201creversal of a judicial decision\u201d does not include the concept of \u201coverruling\u201d the prospective or precedential effect of a decision by an amendment to the Constitution or by the enactment of a new statute. The debates further confirm that the \u201creversal of judicial decision\u201d exclusion was not intended to preclude such an amendment (or enactment), so long as its subject matter was not barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>by other important exclusions not at issue in this case. See note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">2. <em>Conclusion. </em>There was no error in the Attorney General\u2019s certification of the petition. We remand the case to the county court for entry of a judgment declaring that the Attorney General\u2019s certification of the petition is in compliance with the requirements of art. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-12\">In relevant part, art. 48, The Initiative, Part n, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cNo measure that relates to . . . the appointment, qualification, tenure, removal, recall or compensation of judges; or to the reversal of a judicial decision; or to the powers, creation or abolition of courts . . . shall be proposed by an initiative petition . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">We decide only the applicability of the \u201creversal of a judicial decision\u201d exclusion to the proposed initiative petition, as it is the ground raised and argued by the patties before the court.

In that case (decided prior to our decision in <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309 [2003]), we reiterated that \u201c[t]he initiative process permits the people to petition for a constitutional amendment that overrules a court decision when the court has declared a statute to be in violation of our Constitution,\u201d <em>Albano </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 160, and ruled that an initiative petition to amend the Constitution to provide that \u201conly the union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Massachusetts\u201d did not violate art. 48\u2019s exclusion of matters \u201crelating] to the powers of the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b223-7\">Greanby, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlT\">(concurring, with whom Ireland, J., joins). The parties have argued this case <em>solely </em>on the meaning of the word \u201creverse\u201d in the context of the debates that took place during the adoption of the initiative process for constitutional amendments. Although the matter is not free from some doubt, I agree that the word \u201creverse\u201d has a meaning that differs from the word \u201coverrule\u201d; that the difference was established at the time of the constitutional convention of 1917-1918; and, consequently, that the voters who ratified art. 48, The Initiative, Part II, \u00a7 3, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, are deemed to have been aware of the difference. The Attorney General expresses in his brief (on the only ground argued) the essential difference, as it relates to this case, as follows: \u201c[Ajmending the constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage prospectively would not imply that <em>Goodridge </em>[v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309 (2003),] was wrongly decided [but would instead adopt] a new constitutional rule in place of the one announced in that case.\u201d The ballot question, therefore, can go forward for the reasons stated by the court. See <em>Albano </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>437 Mass. 156, 159-160 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">A positive vote enacting the initiative, however, might not be the end of the story. In <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 341-342, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">\u201cThe marriage ban works a deep and scarring hardship on a very real segment of the community for no rational reason. The absence of any reasonable relationship between, on the one hand, an absolute disqualification of same-sex couples who wish to enter into civil marriage and, on the other, protection of public health, safety, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>general welfare, suggests that the marriage restriction is rooted in persistent prejudices against persons who are . . . homosexual. \u2018The Constitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.\u2019 <em>Palmore </em>v. <em>Sidoti, </em>466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984) .... Limiting the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the basic premises of individual liberty and equality under the law protected by the Massachusetts Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">There can be no doubt after the <em>Goodridge </em>decision that the Massachusetts Constitution protects the right of a couple who wish to marry, and are otherwise eligible to marry, to obtain a marriage license, regardless of gender. It is equally clear that the proposed initiative is directed toward withdrawing this right from a distinct segment of our community, thereby prohibiting, as matter of constitutional law, same-sex couples from committing to civil marriage and from attaining the multitude of legal rights, and financial and social benefits, that arise therefrom. The proposed initiative cannot be said to further a proper legislative objective (as was categorically decided by the <em>Goodridge </em>court, there is none<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>). The only effect of a positive vote will be to make same-sex couples, and their families, unequal to everyone else; this is discrimination in its rawest form. Our citizens would, in the future, be divided into at least three separate and unequal classifications: heterosexual couples who enjoy the right to marry; same-sex couples who were married before the passage of the amendment (but who, if divorced, would not be permitted to remarry someone of the same sex); and same-sex couples who have never married and, barring the passage of another constitutional amendment on the subject, will be forever denied that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">There is no Massachusetts precedent discussing, or deciding, whether the initiative procedure may be used to add a constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>tional provision that purposefully discriminates against an oppressed and disfavored minority of our citizens in direct contravention of the principles of liberty and equality protected by art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. This basis for noncertification was not argued to the Attorney General when he considered validity of the initiative, nor has it been raised by any of the parties in their briefs. See <em>ante </em>at 191 n.4. Put more directly, the <em>Goodridge </em>decision may be irreversible because of its holding that no rational basis exists, or can be advanced, to support the definition of marriage proposed by the initiative and the fact that the <em>Goodridge </em>holding has become part of the fabric of the equality and liberty guarantees of our Constitution. If the initiative is approved by the Legislature and ultimately adopted, there will be time enough, if an appropriate lawsuit is brought, for this court to resolve the question whether our Constitution can be home to provisions that are apparently mutually inconsistent and irreconcilable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We may then give careful consideration, in view of what has been said above, to the legal tenability and implications of embodying a provision into our Constitution that would look so starkly out of place in the Adams Constitution, when compared with the document\u2019s elegantly stated, and constitutionally defined, protections of liberty, equality, tolerance, and the access of all citizens to equal rights and benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The parties agree that voters have no power to pass on the validity of what was stated by this court in <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309 (2003), because doing so would be tantamount to a \u201creversal of a judicial decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-5\">This approach honors the principle that issues not briefed and argued should not be decided, especially when a question of constitutional law, that may become moot, is involved, and the approach respects the roles of the Legislature and the people in the initiative process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\">A positive vote on the proposed initiative may be vulnerable on grounds of Federal constitutional law as well. See <em>Romer </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996) (striking down constitutional amendment to Colorado Constitution purporting to withdraw protection of State\u2019s antidiscrimination statutes from homosexuals on grounds that amendment created unequal classifications of citizenry and impermissibly barred those seeking to resolve inequality from traditional political process). See also <em>Reitman </em>v. <em>Mulkey, </em>387 U.S. 369, 373 (1967) (affirming judgments of Supreme Court of California holding that State constitutional amendment initiative erasing statutory protection against racial discrimination in housing denied equal protection of laws under Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution). Whether the substantive due process or equal protection guarantees of the Federal Constitution permit an amendment to a State Constitution that is motivated by animus, or is discriminatory on its face without a sufficiently important reason, are, at this point in time, unlitigated questions of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
