At issue is whether a judge in the Land Court may invoke the provisions of Mass. R. Civ. R 39 (b), 365 Mass. 801 (1974), to revive a right to a trial by jury that has been waived for failure to comply with the procedures set forth in G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15. That statute provides, in part, that failure to enter in the Superior Court (within a specified period) questions that have been \u201cframed\u201d in the Land Court \u201cshall constitute a waiver of the claim to a trial by jury, and thereafter the superior court shall have no further jurisdiction of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In this case a judge in the Land Court concluded that the defendant, HealthSouth Corporation (HealthSouth), failed to comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, and consequently had waived its right to a jury trial. Invoking rule 39 (b), the judge then ruled, as a matter of discretion, that HealthSouth \u201cmay have a jury trial on all issues so triable.\u201d The judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent request that he report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>his order to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996). The plaintiffs petitioned for interlocutory relief, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par., and a single justice of the Appeals Court granted leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal from the judge\u2019s order. We transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm so much of the judge\u2019s order as ruled that HealthSouth waived its right to a jury trial and reverse so much of his order as granted Health-South the right to a jury trial in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiffs, Senior Housing and HRPT Properties Trust (HRPT Trust), are real estate investment trusts that own and lease commercial real estate, including nursing homes and hospitals. HealthSouth is a health care services provider that owns and leases medical facilities to conduct its operations. For disputed reasons not relevant to our decision, in January, 2002, HealthSouth and Senior Housing restructured their existing financial arrangements and entered into a new \u201cExchange Agreement\u201d whereby HealthSouth conveyed two rehabilitation hospitals to Senior Housing and Senior Housing conveyed five nursing homes to HealthSouth. By separate agreement signed the same day, HealthSouth leased the two hospitals from Senior Housing, with an option to purchase.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> HealthSouth subsequently conveyed one of the five nursing homes it had purchased, a skilled nursing facility in North Andover, to Senior Residential Care/North Andover, Limited Partnership (Senior Residential Care).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Land Court cases arose from these transactions: the first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>which we shall refer to as the parking lot case, was initiated by HRPT Trust, and the second, which we shall refer to as the lease reformation case, was commenced by Senior Housing. We review the procedural history of both cases in some detail as it is relevant to our analysis of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On February 3, 2003, HRPT Trust commenced an action against Senior Residential Care to quiet title, pursuant to G. L. c. 240, \u00a7\u00a7 1-10,\u00ae claiming that Senior Residential Care was wrongfully using a parking lot and buildings owned by HRPT Trust in North Andover adjacent to one of the skilled nursing facilities involved in the 2002 transaction between Senior Housing and HealthSouth. HRPT Trust also sought declaratory relief, remedies for trespass and ejectment, and damages. On March 18, 2003, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 24, 365 Mass. 769 (1974), HealthSouth filed a motion to intervene in the parking lot case and filed a complaint and a jury demand, naming Senior Housing and HRPT Trust as defendants (rule 24 complaint).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Health-South advanced claims of breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, reformation, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, and violations of G. L. c. 93A, alleging that it had acquired the disputed property in North Andover under the January, 2002, exchange agreement with Senior Housing, and that, during negotiations, Senior Housing had misrepresented that it was the record owner of the disputed property, when HRPT Trust was its actual owner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On June 2, 2003, Senior Housing and HRPT Trust, represented by the same counsel, filed a joint answer to HealthSouth\u2019s rule 24 complaint, together with a demand for a jury trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Meanwhile, on April 16, 2003, Senior Housing had commenced a separate action in the Land Court against HealthSouth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>(lease reformation case), alleging that HealthSouth\u2019s chief financial officer had misrepresented its creditworthiness during the January, 2002, lease negotiations,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that its creditworthiness was a \u201cprimary factor\u201d on which the 2002 amended lease agreement was based. Senior Housing sought reformation of the lease.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On May 23, 2003, HealthSouth filed its answer as well as counterclaims in the lease reformation case, together with a demand for a jury trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On July 11, 2003, HealthSouth\u2019s motion to consolidate the two cases was allowed. Mass. R. Civ. R 42 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). Thereafter, on September 16, 2003, Senior Housing only, now represented by separate counsel, filed an answer to HealthSouth\u2019s counterclaims in the lease reformation case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There matters stood. Of relevance to this case, no party framed jury trial issues in the Land Court or filed a statement of jury issues in the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Six months later, on March 12, 2004, Senior Housing moved to amend its complaint in the lease reformation case, which was allowed on September 22, 2004.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On November 2, 2004, Health-South filed its answer to the amended complaint. It once again asserted counterclaims against both Senior Housing and HRPT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Trust, and made a demand for a jury trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Senior Housing (but again not HRPT Trust) filed an answer to HealthSouth\u2019s amended counterclaims on November 22, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">On December 3, 2004, a case management conference was scheduled. By this date no party had filed a statement of jury issues as required by G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15. In response to a claim of Senior Housing that HealthSouth had waived its right to a jury trial, the judge in the Land Court invited all parties to submit statements on that question, which Senior Housing and Health-South did on December 20, 2004.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Senior Housing acknowledged that HealthSouth had made a jury demand no \u201clater than 10 days after the service of the last pleading directed to such issue,\u201d in accordance with Mass. R. Civ. P. 38 (b), 365 Mass. 800 (1974), pointing to HealthSouth\u2019s demand for a jury trial filed with its first answer and counterclaims on May 23, 2003. Senior Housing argued, however, that HealthSouth had thereafter waived its right to a jury trial by failing to file a statement of jury issues in the Superior Court \u201cwithin thirty days after the expiration of the time for claiming a trial by jury,\u201d as required by G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> HealthSouth countered that, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Senior Housing had responded to its November <em>2, </em>2004, amended counterclaims, HRPT Trust had not yet done so, and that accordingly the ten-day period for HealthSouth to demand a jury trial had not yet started to run, nor had the thirty-day period for filing the statement of jury issues in the Superior Court been triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">On January 27, 2005, HRPT Trust filed its statement on the question. Noting that HealthSouth\u2019s November, 2004, claims against it were exactly the same as HealthSouth\u2019s allegations against it in HealthSouth\u2019s March, 2003, rule 24 complaint, which HRPT Trust had previously answered, HRPT Trust argued that its answer filed on June 2, 2003, in response to Health-South\u2019s rule 24 complaint, constituted its response to Health-South\u2019s claims; that a response to HealthSouth\u2019s November, 2004, counterclaims would be duplicative; and that HealthSouth had waived its right to a jury trial by failing to comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On March 16, 2005, in response to HealthSouth\u2019s motion to compel it to do so,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> HRPT Trust filed an answer to HealthSouth\u2019s November 2, 2004, counterclaims. On April 12, 2005, for the first time, Health-South filed in the Land Court a motion to frame the jury issues, which HRPT Trust opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">On May 13, 2005, the Land Court judge issued his ruling on the jury trial issue. He concluded that the deadline for Health-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>South to file its statement of jury issues in the Superior Court as required by G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, had expired \u201clong before April 12, 2005,\u201d and that HealthSouth had waived its right to a jury trial. The judge then stated that he was exercising his discretion under rule 39 (b) to order a jury trial<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> because application of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, he said, would work a \u201cgrave injustice\u201d on HealthSouth.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">2. <em>Waiver of claim to a trial by jury. </em>The Legislature has determined that, for cases commenced in the Land Court in which a timely demand for a jury trial is made, the Superior Court is the appropriate forum to try the jury issues. See G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15. See also G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 25 (Land Court \u201cshall hold no trials by jury\u201d); <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>215 Mass. 324, 325 (1913). As to such cases, G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, lays out a two-step procedure for perfecting a timely demand for a jury trial. First, a party must make a jury demand \u201cin accordance with\u201d rule 38 (b) (party must \u201cserv[e] upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the service of the last pleading directed to such issue\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15. As to that step, Senior Housing and HRPT Trust readily agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>HealthSouth made a timely jury demand in its rule 24 complaint filed on March 18, 2003, and in its answer and counterclaims filed on May 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Second, the jury issues \u201cshall be framed\u201d in the Land Court, and the party requesting a jury trial \u201cshall\u201d file a statement of framed issues and \u201call other material papers in the case\u201d in the Superior Court \u201cwithin thirty days after the expiration of the time for claiming a trial by jury.\u201d G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15. The thirty-day period commences ten days after \u201cservice of the last pleading directed to such issue.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. R 38 (b). Failure to comply with the second step \u201cshall constitute a waiver\u201d of the claim to a trial by jury. G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15. The dispute in this case turns on whether HealthSouth satisfied the second step. That question in turn is resolved by identifying the \u201clast pleading directed to such issue.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. R 38 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Senior Housing argues that the relevant \u201clast pleading\u201d was its answer to HealthSouth\u2019s counterclaims, filed on September 16, 2003. HealthSouth responds that the relevant \u201clast pleading\u201d was HRPT Trust\u2019s March 16, 2005, answer to Health-South\u2019s amended counterclaims, and that the thirty-day period did not begin to run until March 26, 2005.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> For several reasons we conclude that HealthSouth did not satisfy the requirements of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, and has therefore waived its right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">First, an amended pleading does not extend the time for demanding a jury trial, nor does it revive a right to a jury trial that has been waived, unless the amendment contains new issues not presented in the original pleadings. See <em>Dole </em>v. <em>Wooldredge, </em>142 Mass. 161, 180-182 (1886); <em>Pyramid Co. of Holyoke </em>v. <em>Homeplace Stores Two, Inc., </em>175 F.R.D. 415, 418 (D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Mass. 1997); J.W. Smith, H.B. Zobel, &amp; C.S. Murphy, Rules Practice \u00a7 38.3, at 12 (Supp. 2006). See also <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>437 Mass. 99, 101-103 (2002) (in negligence action, amended answer, which raised additional affirmative defense of release based on document that defendant came across during course of discovery, did not raise new issue); <em>Communications Maintenance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Motorola, Inc., </em>761 F.2d 1202, 1208 (7th Cir. 1985), quoting <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Breslin, </em>332 F.2d 928, 931 (5th Cir. 1964) (it is \u201cwell-settled law\u201d that supplemental pleadings do not extend time for making demand for jury trial \u201cexcept as to new issues raised by the new pleadings,\u201d interpreting Federal Rules of Civil Procedure); <em>In re N-500L Cases, </em>691 F.2d 15, 23 (1st Cir. 1982) (\u201cOne issue is the same as another when it is based on the same conduct or concerns the same general area of dispute\u201d); <em>Lanza </em>v. <em>Drexel &amp; Co., </em>479 F.2d 1277, 1310-1311 (2d Cir. 1973) (amended complaint, which added new claim and sought punitive damages, raised no new issues where \u201csame conduct and same allegedly false documents\u201d constituted basis for all claims and defendant \u201chad been put on notice of the underlying facts and basic legal theory \u2014 fraud \u2014 upon which plaintiffs sought relief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In these cases, none of the 2004 amended pleadings of the parties raised \u201cnew\u201d issues. Senior Housing\u2019s motion to file the amended complaint makes this clear: its 2004 amendments supplemented its existing claim of fraud by HealthSouth by seeking \u201cadditional or alternative remedies\u201d available under applicable law for its claim of fraud and \u201c amplify [ing]\u201d that claim \u201cby alleging additional facts.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Lanza </em>v. <em>Drexel &amp; Co., supra. </em>The various claims and responsive counterclaims asserted by HealthSouth did not change, see notes 8, 12, and ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>companying text, <em>supra, </em>and its November, 2004, amended answer and counterclaim do nothing more than elaborate its damages. See note 15, <em>supra. </em>See <em>Pyramid Co. of Holyoke </em>v. <em>Homeplace Stores Two, Inc., supra </em>at 419-420 (as it was based on same factual claim, amendment of answer to assert counterclaim for first time did not revive waived right to jury trial); <em>Berisford Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Syncom Corp., </em>650 F. Supp. 999, 1001-1002 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (amended complaint does not revive waived jury right unless it \u201craises issues not fairly present in the original complaint\u201d; court will look to \u201cthe underlying essence of the two complaints to see if they differ, rather than focusing on the fine-tuning of legal theories or the artful sharpening of allegations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Second, and perhaps more telling, after the initial round of pleadings were completed on September 16, 2003, HealthSouth should have perfected its jury claim by filing its statement of framed issues in the Superior Court on or before October 26, 2003. It did not do so, thereby waiving its demand for a jury trial. HealthSouth could not have predicted that Senior Housing would file a motion to amend its complaint many months later on March 12, 2004.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Communications Maintenance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Motorola, Inc., supra </em>(court must decide at what point \u201cthe pleadings finally framed the various issues to be put before the trier-of-fact; that is, when did the pleadings cease raising new factual issues, and begin simply alleging new legal theories or particularized facts\u201d). Had Senior Housing\u2019s amended complaint of March, 2004, raised \u201cnew\u201d issues, which it did not, Health-South could have filed an amended motion to frame, had one been necessary. See note 24, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">By strong affirmative language the Legislature has directed that the Superior Court shall lose jurisdiction of a case if a party making a jury demand does not timely file framed jury issues in the Superior Court. This reflects a legislative response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>to the complexity of having a single case proceed in two separate trial court departments at the same time, the Land Court and the Superior Court. It is not unreasonable to expect parties to comply assiduously with the requirements of the statute in order to secure the greatest possible efficiency in the administration of these complex parallel proceedings. Once the pleadings are complete, a party that has made a timely demand for a jury trial must promptly assess the case in its entirety and determine whether to proceed in the Land Court alone, thereby forgoing its right to a jury, or whether to proceed in the Superior Cotut with its jury claims and the attendant expense of two trials, one in the Land Court and one in the Superior Court. The Legislature no doubt anticipated that a party might make a timely demand for a jury trial, and then (once the pleadings were complete) decide to forgo its right to a jury because of the costs and delay involved. Compliance with the statutory mandate places on a party the obligation of making that determination as soon as possible, permitting a considered but efficient process for trying appropriate issues to a jury in the Superior Court for cases commenced in the Land Court. As the judge in the Land Court noted, G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, requires the framing of jury issues in the Land Court \u201cat a point very near the beginning of a case.\u201d HealthSouth knew no later than September, 2003, that it had equitable and legal claims against Senior Housing and HRPT Trust. It would defy a plain reading of the statute to conclude that, by waiting until April, 2005, to frame the issues in the Land Court, it has complied with its obligations under G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">3. <em>Judicial discretion to revive right to a jury trial. </em>Rule 39 (b) grants \u201cdiscretion upon motion\u201d to a judge to \u201corder a trial by jury of any or all issues\u201d where a party had a right to a jury trial but failed to demand one.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> A judge\u2019s discretion under rule 39 (b) to order a jury trial is \u201clargely unlimited.\u201d Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. R 39 (b), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil Procedure at 649 (LexisNexis 2005), citing former G. L. c. 231, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u00a7 60; <em>Gechijian </em>v. <em>Richmond Ins. Co., </em>305 Mass. 132, 143-144 (1940) (after plaintiff waived jury trial right in stipulation, judge\u2019s granting of jury trial under former G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60, reviewed for abuse of discretion). See, e.g., <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Boott Cotton Mills, </em>185 Mass. 576, 577-578 (1904) (judge has power to extend time for demanding jury trial). Here, however, the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion must be considered in light of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, which provides that the jury issues \u201cshall be framed\u201d in the Land Court and \u201cshall be entered\u201d in the Superior Court within a specifically defined time, and that failure to do so \u201cshall\u201d constitute a waiver of a claim to a trial by jury, which \u201cshall\u201d divest the Superior Court of further jurisdiction over the case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">It requires little parsing of the mandatory language of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, to recognize that it is irreconcilable with the discretionary language of rule 39 (b). And where there is an irreconcilable conflict between a court rule and a statute, the rule generally must yield to the statute. See <em>Eastern Energy Corp. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>419 Mass. 151, 154-155 (1994) (rejecting plaintiff\u2019s request to apply Mass. R. A. R 4 [a], as amended, 395 Mass. 1110 [1985], to salvage its untimely appeal, where rule \u201cwould contradict the provisions of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, which specifically govern the timing of appeals\u201d); <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>414 Mass. 663, 665 (1993) (\u201cstatutory appeal period . . . cannot be overridden by a contrary rule of court when the manner and time for effective filing of an appeal are delineated in the statute\u201d); <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Division of Water Pollution Control, </em>412 Mass. 464, 465-466 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(1992) (same); <em>LaRoche </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 419, 421 (2002) (\u201ca court rule generally may not override a statute\u201d). Cf. <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 417, 419 (1985) (purpose of Mass. R. Civ. R 81 [d], 365 Mass. 841 [1974], which provides that \u201c[i]n applying these rules to any proceedings to which they apply, the terminology of any statute which also applies shall, if inconsistent with these rules, be taken to mean the analogous device or procedure proper under these rules,\u201d is not to make rules of civil procedure paramount to express statutory language).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Contrary to HealthSouth\u2019s argument, exercise of discretion pursuant to rule 39 (b) cannot be harmonized with the explicit command of G.

The January, 2002, amended lease agreement substituted the two rehabilitation hospitals, now owned by Senior Housing, as the lease property. In addition, the amended lease agreement made the following changes to the 1994 lease: (1) the lease term was extended from 2006 to 2011; (2) annual rent was reduced from $10.3 million to $8.7 million; and (3) HealthSouth\u2019s purchase option exercise date was extended and the price reduced from $80.3 million to $40 million.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Senior Residential Care/North Andover, Limited Partnership, is a codefendant in one of the Land Court cases.

See text accompanying note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Although HealthSouth\u2019s May 23, 2003, answer and counterclaims named HRPT Trust as a counterclaim defendant, the docket does not reflect a summons showing service on HRPT Trust. HRPT Trust did not file a responsive pleading, nor did HealthSouth move to compel or default.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\">In addition to reformation of the lease, the amended complaint now sought rescission and avoidance of the lease, and damages for fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The counterclaims were identical to the earlier filed claims and counterclaims, see notes 8 and 12, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text, with the following exceptions. HealthSouth added six new paragraphs of factual allegations relating to its agreement to sell the North Andover skilled nursing facility to Senior Residential Care. See note 5, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. In those six paragraphs HealthSouth described its damages resulting from the property dispute with HRPT Trust in the parking lot case, viz.: because HealthSouth was unable to convey title to the disputed property by May 31, 2003, Senior Residential Care exercised its right under its purchase and sale agreement with HealthSouth to close the nursing home and reconvey the facility back to HealthSouth. HealthSouth alleged that, under the terms of the agreement, Senior Residential Care was then entitled to receive from Health-South the purchase price for the reconveyance ($2,066,250), costs incurred in closing the nursing home ($400,000), and reimbursement for certain capital improvements. HealthSouth further alleged as damages its carrying costs (over $30,000 a month) for maintaining, securing, insuring, and paying property taxes on the North Andover skilled nursing facility, which it claimed was not marketable due to the nonconveyance of the disputed property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Attached to Senior Housing\u2019s statement was a letter from its counsel advising the judge that she had spoken with counsel for HRPT Trust, and that HRPT Trust \u201cjoins in this statement and will not be filing anything additional.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In its written submission to the Land Court, Senior Housing did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>identify with specificity the date within which (in its view) HealthSouth was required to file a statement of the jury issues, arguing only that \u201cHealthSouth has filed no such documentation with the Superior Court during the 21 months these cases have been pending.\u201d According to the judge\u2019s subsequent order, Senior Housing argued (presumably at a hearing on the question) that the time for claiming a jury trial expired ten days after it served its response to Health-South\u2019s original counterclaims (September 16, 2003), or, at the latest, after HealthSouth served its response to Senior Housing\u2019s amended complaint (November 2, 2004). Under this logic, the thirty-day period began to run on either September 26, 2003, or November 12, 2004, and expired on either October 26, 2003, or December 12, 2004 (ten days after the last pleading, and thirty days thereafter).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">HRPT Trust argued that the time for claiming a jury trial expired on June 12, 2003, ten days after HRPT Trust answered HealthSouth\u2019s rule 24 complaint on June 2, 2003. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>Under this reasoning, the thirty-day period for HealthSouth to file in the Superior Court would have expired on July 12, 2003, thirty days following ten days after the last pleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\">HealthSouth moved to compel HRPT Trust to answer its counterclaims on March 11, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Rule 39 (b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 801 (1974), provides: \u201cIssues not demanded for trial by jury as provided in Rule 38 shall be tried by the court; but notwithstanding the failure of a party to demand a jury in an action in which such a demand might have been made of right, the court in its discretion upon motion may order a trial by jury of any or all issues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The judge reasoned that this case did not fit within the \u201cmodel\u201d presupposed by G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, because in his words it did not involve \u201cwell-defined issues, apparent from the outset, that can be carved out, decided discretely, and then reinserted into the Land Court proceedings.\u201d He also noted that HealthSouth\u2019s inclusion of a timely jury demand in all of its responsive pleadings demonstrated its clear intent, from the beginning of the litigation, to assert its jury trial right. Finally, the judge stated that the pleadings were not complete until March 16, 2005, when HRPT Trust filed its answer to HealthSouth\u2019s November 2, 2004, counterclaims, and noted that his finding that the issues in this final pleading were not new \u201cmay not have been as clear to [HealthSouth] as it was to [the judge],\u201d and that \u201cthe situation was, from [HealthSouth\u2019s] perspective, at best ambiguous.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure govern Land Court proceedings, see Mass. R. Civ. P. 1, as appearing in 423 Mass. 1404 (1996). No exclusions under Mass. R. Civ. P. 81, as amended, 423 Mass. 1412 (1996), are applicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">HealthSouth also argues that its motion to intervene was never formally allowed and that, therefore, HRPT Trust\u2019s answer to HealthSouth\u2019s rule 24 complaint, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>could not have been the relevant \u201clast pleading.\u201d This argument fails. Senior Housing and HRPT Trust assented to Health-South\u2019s motion to intervene on June 2, 2003. Furthermore, the judge treated HealthSouth as a party in allowing its motion to consolidate in July, 2003, and in his September 22, 2004, order allowing Senior Housing\u2019s motion to amend its complaint, by noting that HealthSouth had intervened. Finally, if carried to its logical conclusion, this argument would serve to preclude HealthSouth\u2019s standing in the parking lot case to argue these issues before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\"> If a complaint seeking only equitable relief is later amended to seek money damages, a jury demand as to the legal issue may then be made. See J.W. Smith, H.B. Zobel, &amp; C.S. Murphy, Rules Practice \u00a7 38.3, at 12 (Supp. 2006). Senior Housing\u2019s 2004 amended complaint added a claim for damages, while its original complaint had a claim for reformation of the lease only. However, the core issues remained the same. In any event, giving HealthSouth every benefit of the doubt, it should have moved to frame the jury issues as to that one issue no later than December 12, 2004 (ten days after HealthSouth filed its November 2, 2004, amended counterclaims, plus thirty days).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> It is significant that when HealthSouth finally moved to frame jury issues in April, 2005, it recited only issues raised in the 2003 pleadings: whether Senior Housing and HRPT Trust are liable for fraud, breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, civil conspiracy, or negligent misrepresentation arising out of the failure to convey title to the disputed property in North Andover; and if they are liable under any of these theories, what is the proper amount of damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\"> The Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure apply in this case. See note 22, <em>supra. </em>The docket does not reflect that HealthSouth filed a motion requesting that the judge exercise his discretion, as required by rule 39 (b). In its December 20, 2004, statement on the issue of waiver, HealthSouth did argue that the judge had the authority under rule 39 (b) to order a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\">HealthSouth argues that the plaintiffs waived the argument that rule 39 (b) did not authorize the judge to exercise discretion in the context of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15. Specifically, HealthSouth claims that because Senior Housing agreed in the Land Court that the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure apply to this case, and because HRPT Trust raised the issue only in a footnote in a reply to the judge, they did not preserve the issue for appeal. These arguments are unavailing. The judge ruled on the exact issue. Moreover, in their requests that the judge report his order to the Appeals Court, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996), the plaintiffs argued that the judge could not exercise his discretion under rule 39 (b) to circumvent the clear mandate of the statute. Cf. <em>M.H. Gordon &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 64, 67-68 (1982) (where issue not raised for first time on appeal and judge ruled on issue, plaintiffs had right to argue issue on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\">HealthSouth\u2019s reliance on <em>Boston Seaman\u2019s Friend Soc\u2019y, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>379 Mass. 414 (1980), is misplaced. In that case, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal more than thirty, but less than sixty, days after entry of judgment in the Probate and Family Court, and the question was which appeal period was applicable: the thirty-day period found in G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 9, or the sixty-day period found in Mass. R. A. P. 4, 365 Mass. 846 (1974). <em>Boston Seaman\u2019s Friend Soc\u2019y, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 415. This court held that the sixty-day period in the rule applied, and therefore the appeal was timely. <em>Id. </em>at 416. The statutory section in question, G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 9, was immediately followed by G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 10, which specified that the statute \u201cshall be in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 10. Of particular significance was that the statute \u201cwas adopted as part of a comprehensive legislative and judicial effort to coordinate statutes of the Commonwealth and rules of this court.\u201d <em>Boston Seaman\u2019s Friend Soc\u2019y, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In contrast, G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, was enacted in 1898 as part of the legislation creating the Court of Registration, St. 1898, c. 562, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, 14, which later became the Land Court, St. 1900, c. 354, \u00a7 1; St. 1904, c. 448, \u00a7 10, not as part of a comprehensive effort to reconcile statutes with the rules of civil procedure. General Laws c. 185, \u00a7 15, was not repealed when the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted. See, e.g., St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 178 (repealing G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60, which formerly granted discretion to judge to extend time for demanding jury trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The Land Court judge implicitly recognized that the statute and the rule are incompatible. In a footnote in his order, the judge warned that his exercise of discretion in these cases \u201cshould not be misinterpreted as an indication of my rulings in future cases. In the future, I will expect parties seeking a jury trial to bring a timely motion pursuant to G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, even if the early \u2018issue framing\u2019 it requires may be thought inappropriate. . . . Should such a motion not be brought within the time required by G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, I will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>deem it a waiver of the right to a jury trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We reject the suggestion by the Land Court judge that it was appropriate for HealthSouth to delay framing the jury issues in the Land Court because the issues that needed to be decided by the jury would \u201conly become clear after discovery is concluded, pretrial motions decided, and the parties and the court have had the benefit of a pretrial conference.\u201d The Legislature has established the procedure applicable to cases pending in the Land Court where there has been a timely demand for a jury trial. The obvious purpose is to remove to the Superior Court as soon as possible all of the jury-based claims. This case is a telling example of why early removal to the Superior Court, which can manage all discovery and pretrial issues, is in the interests of a fair administration of justice. As the Land Court judge noted, \u201cat heart\u201d the disputes among these parties are contract disputes, not land disputes. Had HealthSouth met its requirements under the statute, the jury issues would have been framed and filed in the Superior Court no later than October, 2003. Some three years later the litigants are still awaiting their day in court. <em>That </em>is the issue which has, in the judge\u2019s words, \u201csignificant case management implications.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
