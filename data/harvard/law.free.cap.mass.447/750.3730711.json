L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B) \u201cposes a low risk for sex offense recidivism and a low degree of dangerousness.\u201d The examiner ordered Doe to register with the board as a level one sex offender in accordance with G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The examiner\u2019s decision became the decision of the board. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L. A Superior Court judge reviewed the administrative record pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and dismissed Doe\u2019s complaint for judicial review of the board\u2019s decision. Doe appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review. Doe asserts that the registration statute, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d),</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and accompany<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ing board regulation, 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.37A (2002),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which prohibit him from being relieved from any registration obligation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> violate his substantive and procedural due process rights under provisions of the Declaration of Rights to the Massachusetts Constitution. We reject his arguments and, treating the judgment as one upholding the board\u2019s decision, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The background of the case, drawn from the examiner\u2019s decision and related record materials, may be summarized as follows. Doe is now in his late fifties. In May, 1994, he pleaded guilty, in a District Court, to two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. The victim was the eight year old daughter of his girl friend, with whom he had been living since November, 1991. The incidents occurred on separate dates and took place sometime between January and February of 1992. Doe was then forty-four years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">On the date of the first incident, the victim\u2019s mother had just given birth to Doe\u2019s baby daughter, and had brought the baby home from a hospital. The victim woke up in the middle of the night and went looking for her mother in the bedroom that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>mother shared with Doe. When the victim did not see her mother, she became scared. Doe asked the victim if she wanted to come into the bed with him, and she proceeded to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Doe then unzipped his jeans and put his penis against the victim\u2019s buttocks, trying to penetrate her anally. The victim grabbed his arm to make him stop. The victim\u2019s mother came into the room, and the victim was able to get away. The victim disclosed the assault to her mother and later to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">On another occasion, the victim\u2019s mother was out of the house and Doe was looking after the victim and her younger brother. While the victim and her brother were watching television, Doe put his hand into the back of the victim\u2019s underwear, touching her buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">When he tendered his guilty plea, Doe admitted the victim\u2019s allegations, but denied any penetration. With respect to the first charge and finding of guilt, Doe was sentenced to two and one-half years in a house of correction. The judge ordered eighteen months of this sentence to be served, and suspended its balance for six years, under probation supervision until May 19, 2000. On the second charge, a guilty finding was entered and the case was filed. Doe has no other criminal convictions. Doe was incarcerated from May 19, 1994, to August 25, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">In September, 2003, the board notified Doe that it recommended that he register as a level two sex offender pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(b). </em>Doe challenged his obligation to register and his classification level, and requested an administrative review of the board\u2019s decision pursuant to \u00a7 178L.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">On February 11, 2004, a hearing examiner commenced a de nova hearing. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.22(2) (2002). At the hearing, the board relied solely on documentary evidence, namely its \u201cclassification report\u201d and attachments thereto. Doe testified, as did his wife and his treatment provider, Dr. Paul S. Lapuc, a psychologist with a doctorate in clinical psychology and an expert in sex offender treatments and recidivism risk assessment. Doe also relied on documentary evidence, including the treatment notes and a report of Dr. Lapuc.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The examiner subsequently entered an eighteen-page decision finding that Doe is required to register and must register as a level one sex offender. In addition to noting the charges and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>proceedings against Doe mentioned above, and the circumstances underlying those charges, all of which were contained in the board\u2019s classification report and attachments, the examiner pointed out that, while incarcerated, Doe had participated in sex offender treatment twice weekly until released. Further, six months before his release, Doe began attending a Statewide sex offender treatment program. His participation was evaluated as good.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The examiner mentioned that the board did not submit any evidence at the hearing concerning Doe\u2019s behavior while on probation. In a letter to the board, reproduced as an attachment to the board\u2019s classification report, Doe indicated that his probation officer was supportive of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The examiner recounted the evidence of Doe\u2019s sex offender and other treatment following his incarceration. After release from incarceration, Doe continued sex offender treatment with Dr. Lapuc (Doe received sex offender treatment with Dr. Lapuc prior to, but not during, his incarceration). Dr. Lapuc diagnosed Doe as suffering from pedophilia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a dependent personality disorder. In addition, Doe sought treatment of his PTSD every two weeks with a counsellor from a Veterans Administration hospital. The examiner recounted some of Dr. Lapuc\u2019s testimony. Dr. Lapuc remarked that, over the course of his treatment, Doe showed substantial progress in understanding and addressing his sexually deviant behavioral triggers; demonstrated victim empathy; did not deny or minimize his crimes; developed a support network with his family, faith, community, and mental health system; and internalized the essential components of his relapse prevention model. Dr. Lapuc noted that Doe made major lifestyle changes, adhered to the precepts of his Muslim faith, and has shown a long-standing willingness to rehabilitate himself. Dr. Lapuc opined that Doe \u201cposes no risk to the community or to his family .. . and the likelihood of recidivistic behavior is negligible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Finally, the examiner considered the evidence concerning Doe\u2019s current circumstances. Doe testified at the hearing that he resides with his wife in a home that they own together. Doe stated that his wife and others are supportive of him. He testified that he does not smoke, drink, use any type of drugs, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>frequent bars, and that he is an active member of the Muslim community. Doe\u2019s wife (not the victim\u2019s mother, a former girl friend) testified on his behalf. She stated that she, and some of the board members of the Islamic center to which she and Doe belong, are fully aware of Doe\u2019s sex offense history. Doe\u2019s wife testified that she remains present with Doe during any children\u2019s activities sponsored or held by the Islamic center.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In his decision, the examiner first denied Doe\u2019s motion for relief from registration under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d), </em>and 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.37A. The examiner explained that Doe is \u201clegally prohibited\u201d from relief from registration because Doe \u201chas been convicted of sex offenses involving children, sexually violent offenses[,] and two or more Wetterling offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The examiner went on to address Doe\u2019s classification level. He concluded that .the board had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Doe poses only a low risk of sex offense recidivism and \u201cthe degree of dangerousness posed to the public is not such that a public safety interest is served by public access to his registration information.\u201d The examiner explained that Doe\u2019s sexual misconduct \u201cinvolved an extravulnerable, extrafamilial female child victim against whom he sexually offended in a repetitive and compulsive manner\u201d and, on one occasion, in a public place as defined in 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(l) (2002) (defining public place as including area open to scrutiny of others). The examiner, however, concluded that Doe should be classified as a level one sex offender because circumstances existed that mitigated his risk for sex offense recidivism and degree of dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">1. An overview of applicable law will be useful, and we set out that overview.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">a. The applicable statute governing registration was enacted by the Legislature in 1999, see St. 1999, c. 74 (1999 statute), in keeping with several decisions of this court citing infirmities in the prior registration scheme, see St. 1996, c. 239, and replacing that scheme. Decisions of this court dealing with the 1996 precursor to the present statute are summarized in <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 421-423 (2001). The <em>Roe </em>decision sets forth the key provisions of the 1999 statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>\u201cThe 1999 statute provides that a person convicted of any of the enumerated sex offenses on or after August 1, 1981, or released on or after August 1, 1981, from confinement, parole, or probation supervision following a conviction of one of these offenses, is a \u2018[s]ex offender.\u2019 G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. The definition of \u2018[s]ex offender\u2019 includes a juvenile adjudicated delinquent by reason of a sex offense or a youthful offender who has been convicted of a sex offense. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">\u201cThe 1999 statute provides for the appointment by the Governor of a seven-member sex offender registry board. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1). A sex offender who lives or works in the Commonwealth must register with the board by mail, listing his name, home address, and (if applicable) work address, or his intended home and work addresses. \u00a7 178E (o)-(c), 178E 178E (Z). He must verify this information annually and report any changes to the board. \u00a7\u00a7 178F, 178F V2. The penalty for a first offense of knowingly failing to register or failing to notify the board of any changes is from six months to two and one-half years in a house of correction, up to five years in State prison, a $1,000 fine, or both a fine and imprisonment. \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">\u201cThe 1999 statute provides for postregistration hearings and mandates the order of priority in which offenders are to be reviewed. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178K (3), 178L. The board is to promulgate guidelines for classifying an offender\u2019s level of dangerousness and risk of reoffense and apply those guidelines to assess the risk level of particular offenders. \u00a7 178K (1). The board may determine that an offender does not pose a danger or risk of reoffense and relieve him of any further registration requirement. \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d). </em>Once an offender receives notice from the board of its initial recommended classification, he can request an evidentiary hearing to determine his future duty to register and his final classification. \u00a7 178L. The board then assigns a final risk classification level: level one (low); level two (moderate); or level three (high). \u00a7\u00a7 178K (2), 178L (2). Offenders may seek judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, of the board\u2019s final classification and registration requirements. \u00a7 178M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\u201cPrior to final classification by the board, information concerning offenders is not available to the public, but only to law enforcement agencies. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1781, 178J (c); 178K (2) (a)-(c). Public notification depends on an offender\u2019s classification level. \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(a)-(c). </em>Persons classified as level two and level three offenders must register each year in person at their local police station, and their registry information is available on request to members of the public over eighteen years of age who state that they are requesting such information for their own protection or for the protection of another person for whom they have responsibility. \u00a7\u00a7 178F <em>lh, </em>1781, 178J, 178K (2) <em>(b)-(c). </em>Information regarding level three offenders will be disseminated through active community notification. \u00a7 178K (2) (c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">\u201cA person classified as a level one offender must continue to register annually by mail. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178F. As long as his classification remains at level one, an offender\u2019s registry information is available only to law enforcement agencies, not to any member of the public. \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(a).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">\u201cThe board must maintain a central computerized registry of sex offenders. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178D. The file on each offender contains the offender\u2019s registration data. . . . The board must \u2018promptly\u2019 transmit such data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and to police departments in the municipalities where the offender intends to live and work, and the municipality where the offense occurred. \u00a7 178E (a)-(c), 178E (g)-(j), 178E (/).\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 423-426.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d), </em>see note 2, <em>supra, </em>and 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.37A, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>not all sex offenders, currently including Doe, may be relieved of the obligation to register.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, the provision concerning automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>termination of the duty to register appears not to apply to Doe because he has been convicted of a sexually violent offense. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178G.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">b. The <em>Roe </em>decision is the only decision of this court dealing with the 1999 statute. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418 (2001). The <em>Roe </em>court held that sex offenders may be required to provide the board with their names and addresses <em>prior to </em>the conducting of individualized hearings (concerning whether they currently present a risk to children or other vulnerable persons), and that the board may furnish registration data* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to law enforcement authorities, without violating the due process protections of art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. <em>Id. </em>at 419-420. Justice Cowin concurred, on the basis that the provision in issue was facially valid, but could be susceptible to an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge in certain cases where automatic dissemination of registration data to law enforcement authorities raises due process concerns. <em>Id. </em>at 442-443. Her separate opinion identified those cases (in general terms) in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>\u201cThe statute includes offenses \u2018whose seriousness we well recognize\u2019 as well as those where the risk of reoffense \u2018may be minimal and the present danger of [the offender] to children not significant.\u2019 <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>430 Mass. 155, 164, 165 (1999) <em>(Doe [No. 5]). </em>For example, the offense of rape and abuse of a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, and an attempt to commit this offense, may include individuals involved in consensual sexual experimentation with teenage peers. See, e.g., <em>Doe (No. 5), supra </em>at 164 (discussing G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23)\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-5\"><em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 444 (Cowin, J., concurring). Three Justices (Chief Justice Marshall and Justices Ireland and Cordy) concurred insofar as the 1999 statute required registration <em>before a hearing </em>of sex offenders who pose \u201ca grave threat to children\u201d and where the risk of reoffense \u201cis compelling,\u201d and dissented as to sex offenders who posed <em>no </em>threat to children or other vulnerable persons, especially in the statute\u2019s retrospective application. <em>Id. </em>at 446-447 (Marshall, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">2. As a preliminary matter (and to the extent that Doe makes such an argument), there is no merit to the assertion that G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d), </em>see note 2, <em>supra, </em>and 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.37A, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>on their face violate substantive and procedural due process protections possessed by a level one sex offender who has committed a sexually violent offense against a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">a. As to substantive due process, Doe\u2019s liberty and privacy interests obviously are not fundamental. See, e.g., <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>428 Mass. 90, 100-102 (1998); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 143 (1997). Doe has a \u201cdiminished expectation of privacy in [his] identity,\u201d <em>Landry </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>429 Mass. 336, 344 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1073 (2000); see <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>429 Mass. 736, 739 (1999), and no public dissemination is involved as to a level one sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The statute and regulation \u201cbear[] a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective.\u201d <em>Rushworth </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>413 Mass. 265, 268 (1992), quoting <em>Pinnick </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number><em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 14 (1971). That legislative purpose is set forth in the 1999 statute\u2019s emergency preamble: \u201cWhereas, The deferred operation of the act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to protect forthwith the vulnerable members of our communities from sexual offenders . . . .\u201d St. 1999, c. 74, Preamble. The purpose is affirmatively supported by expressed legislative findings,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as by other considerations and research involving pedophiles like Doe.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no facial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>substantive due process issue. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>441 Mass. 157, 164 (2004) (State has legitimate and compelling interest in protecting public from harm by sexually dangerous persons). See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., supra </em>at 103 n.13 (State has \u201ca compelling interest in protecting the public from future crimes\u201d), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">b. Nor is there any facial procedural due process issue. The requirement that Doe register is \u201cimplemented in a fair manner.\u201d <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 674 (1993). Doe\u2019s registration requirement does not occur in a vacuum. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, supra </em>at 165. A sex offender, like Doe, is protected from the risk of erroneous deprivation of liberty by the requirement of having been convicted of, and sentenced on, at least one qualifying and inherently violent sexual offense. We note that the sex offender has thirty days to provide the board with any information useful to assess his obligation to register. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L. If the board\u2019s conviction data are incorrect, the sex offender has the opportunity to demonstrate to the board that he was not convicted of the sex offense at issue. If the sex offender contests the board\u2019s conclusion that he was convicted of the subject sex offense, he may request a hearing under \u00a7 178L and, ultimately, seek judicial review of any decision pursuant to \u00a7 178M.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">While the duty to register and update information annually (all by mail in Doe\u2019s case and with no dissemination to the public) is a burden and somewhat intrusive, these particularly dangerous sex offenders are not facing a loss of liberty in the sense that they are subject to detention, confinement, or commitment. Nor are they <em>publicly </em>identified as sex offenders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>In light of the State\u2019s important and reasonable interests, previously described, procedural due process is not offended by a registration requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">3. We come to Doe\u2019s principal challenge, namely that, <em>as applied to him, </em>the statute and regulation are unconstitutional because, contrary to what was found by the examiner, he does not constitute any risk of harm to children and, thus, should not be required to register at all. This argument calls into question the correctness of the examiner\u2019s decision. If no substantial evidence supports that decision, and if the record established that Doe poses no risk at all, then the statute and regulation, considered on an as applied basis, might be constitutionally vulnerable. We conclude, however, that the examiner\u2019s decision that Doe poses a minimal threat is correct. As a consequence, the larger issue, whether an offender who is found by an examiner to pose absolutely no risk to children can, consistent with constitutional protections, be compelled to register, may be left for decision to another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Doe does not challenge the examiner\u2019s statement of the testimony and evidence, or underlying evidence, but rather summarily challenges the examiner\u2019s ultimate conclusion, arguing that the examiner\u2019s determination, that Doe presented a cognizable risk of reoffense, was unsupported by the record because the record establishes his \u201ctotal rehabilitation.\u201d Doe overlooks the complete content of the record, including his own expert\u2019s (Dr. Lapuc) concession that, \u201cI don\u2019t think that once anybody\u2019s engaged in sexual acting out behavior can you say that there is absolutely no risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Based on his review of the evidence, the examiner reasonably concluded, based on substantial evidence, that several statutory and regulatory factors and subsidiary factors<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> supported a determination that Doe\u2019s over-all level of risk to reoffend and degree of dangerousness was low, and not \u201cclose to nil.\u201d Doe\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>admission to having committed the sexual misconduct underlying the two charges of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age supported the examiner\u2019s findings that his adult sex offending behavior was repetitive and compulsive (on one occasion Doe put his penis against the victim\u2019s buttocks, trying to penetrate her anally; and on a different occasion, Doe put his hand in the back of the victim\u2019s underwear); he sexually assaulted a child (the victim was eight years old); he sexually assaulted an extravulnerable child (the victim was under the age of ten years); and he sexually assaulted an extrafamilial victim (the victim had a nonfamilial relationship with Doe and lived in the same household with Doe for less than two years before the offending behavior occurred), thus satisfying the factors in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) (a) (iii), and 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(3) (sex offender an adult who targeted child); G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(a) </em>(ii), and 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(2) (repetitive and compulsive)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(4), (9)(c)(12) (extravulnerable child); G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K <em>(b) </em>(i), and 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.40(3)(b), (7) (extrafamilial victim). Significantly, the Legislature has determined that two of the above mentioned factors, repetitive and compulsive sexual misconduct and an adult committing a sexual offense against a child, indicate a <em>\u201chigh risk </em>of reoffense and degree of dangerousness posed to the public\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(a) </em>(ii), (iii). As explained by the board in its regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">\u201cThis [\u00b6] actor [repetitive and compulsive behavior] reflects the fact that certain offenders manifest their compulsive behavior by engaging in a continuing course of sexual misconduct involving separate incidents with either the same victim or others. The [b]card considers these offenders as presenting a greater risk to reoffend and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>as posing an increased degree of dangerousness. (For [a]duit [o]ffenders: <em>Hanson &amp; Thornton 1999; Hanson &amp; Bussiere, 1998; Epperson, Kaul &amp; Huot, 1995; McGovern &amp; Peters, 1988).\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(2). Further, with respect to adult sex offenders who target children as their victims, \u00a7 1.40(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">\u201cResearch indicates that [a]duit [ojffenders who target as their victims children who are either extrafamilial or strangers, are more likely to reoffend over time than other sex offenders. <em>(Prentky, Lee, Knight &amp; Cerce, 1997; Abel, Osbourne &amp; Twiggs, 1993; Weinrott &amp; Saylor, 1991). . . . </em>Moreover, such offenders pose a heightened risk to public safety since children normally lack the physical and mental strength to resist an offender. In addition, children can be lured into dangerous situations more easily than adults.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">In view of these two \u201chigh risk\u201d factors, and other risk factors noted, the examiner was not bound to accept Dr. Lapuc\u2019s conclusion that the likelihood of Doe reoffending is \u201cclose to nil,\u201d and the examiner reasonably declined to find that Doe\u2019s risk-reducing factors<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> completely ameliorated his risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness. The examiner carefully considered and weighed all the evidence, concluding that Doe constituted a low level of risk that necessitated a registration obligation. This conclusion was supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">We add that the examiner\u2019s consideration of the filed guilty finding on the second charge of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age is immaterial. In determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ing risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness, the fact that Doe was sentenced on only one charge involving a sex offense on a child by itself indicates a high risk. 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(12) (\u201cPursuant to [G. L.] c. 6, \u00a7 178C, the [Legislature designated certain sex offenses to be sex offenses involving children and/or sexually violent offenses. The [board] has determined that the commission of <em>one </em>or more of these offenses, in and of itself, demonstrates an increased risk to children and other vulnerable persons\u201d [emphasis added]). A single additional judgment of conviction of the same charge against the same victim adds little to the analysis, especially where the misconduct underlying that charge may be considered in assessing whether the misconduct was repetitive and compulsive, see G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(a) </em>(ii), and 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Further, other factors that were not mentioned by the examiner, but that find support in the record, support our conclusion. One such factor is that Dr. Lapuc diagnosed Doe as suffering from pedophilia,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a \u201cmental abnormality\u201d and \u201chigh risk\u201d factor under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(a) </em>(i), and 803 Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(1), linked to sexual recidivism, and which has no cure.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While Doe has not reoffended and his psychologist reported that Doe had progressed in his treatment<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and rehabilitation, Doe has yet to be alone with children (Doe\u2019s wife or another adult is always present). This circumstance may have been motivated \u201cto avoid any perception that he would ever act out.\u201d The fact remains that there is no objective certainty that Doe can be trusted alone with children, Yet, as an Islamic Imam (minister) Doe has placed himself in an environment where he regularly encounters children. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) (\u201cany information useful\u201d may be used to assess risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness posed by sex offender).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Finally, nowhere in his decision does the examiner indicate that, but for the application of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d), </em>and 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.37A, pertaining to relief from registration, he would have relieved Doe from registration. Such a claim constitutes mere speculation, and we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">4. We do not address Doe\u2019s argument, raised in a single sentence, that G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d), </em>and 803 Code Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Regs. \u00a7 1.37A subject him to an unlawful conclusive presumption of registrability because the contention does not rise to the level of acceptable appellate argument. See <em>McClure </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>436 Mass. 614, 615 n.3, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1031 (2002). We also need not speculate on how pending Federal and State legislation may affect Doe. Our decision must rest on present legal and factual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">5.

In making such determination the board shall consider factors, including but not limited to, the presence or absence of any physical harm caused by the offense and whether the offense involved consensual conduct between adults.

The hearing examiner erroneously held that this provision applied to Doe. The provision is not applicable because Doe was not sentenced on the guilty finding on the second charge of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age, that charge being placed on file. Under established Massachusetts law, there is no <em>judgment of conviction </em>on a criminal charge unless a sentence is imposed.

See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178D. As noted in <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 419 n.3 (2001), \u201c[ajlthough offenders previously convicted and not currently incarcerated or under supervision are only required to submit their names[, dates of birth,] and home and work addresses, \u00a7 178E (Z), it would appear that the additional information may be obtained by the board from the already existing arrest, incarceration, or parole records of offenders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b786-5\"> Statutes 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">\u201cThe general court hereby finds that: (1) the danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders, <em>especially sexually violent offenders </em>who commit predatory acts characterized by repetitive and compulsive behavior, to be grave and that the protection of the public from these sex offenders is of paramount interest to the government; (2) law enforcement agencies\u2019 efforts to protect their communities, conduct investigations and quickly apprehend sex offenders are impaired by the existing lack of information known about sex offenders who live within their jurisdictions and that the lack of information shared with the public may result in the failure of the criminal justice system to identify, investigate, apprehend and prosecute sex offenders; (3) the system of registering sex offenders is a proper exercise of the commonwealth\u2019s police powers regulating present and ongoing conduct, which will provide law enforcement with additional information critical to preventing sexual victimization and to resolve incidents involving sexual abuse promptly; (4) in balancing offenders\u2019 rights with the interests of public security and safety, the release of information about sex offenders to law enforcement before the opportunity for an individual determination of the sex offender\u2019s risk of reoffense is necessary to protect the public safety; (5) registration by sex offenders is necessary in order to permit classification of such offenders on an individualized basis according to their risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness; (6) the public interest in having current information on certain sex offenders in the hands of local law enforcement officials, including prior to such classification, far outweighs whatever liberty and privacy interests the registration requirements may implicate. Therefore, the commonwealth\u2019s policy, which will bring the state into compliance with federal requirements, is to assist local law enforcement agencies\u2019 efforts to protect their communities by requiring sex offenders to register and to authorize the release of necessary and relevant information about certain sex offenders to the public as provided in this act.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\"> The Legislature reasonably could have recognized that adult sex offenders who target children are especially dangerous because, as recognized by the board (based on research cited by the board in its regulations), they \u201cpose a heightened risk to public safety since children normally lack the physical and mental strength to resist an offender. In addition, children can be lured into dangerous situations more easily than most adults,\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>\u00a7 1.40(3) (2002). The Legislature also may have relied on research concluding that a clean record for a period of years after a first sex offense does not indicate that a sex offender will not commit another sex offense, and that \u201cchild molesters are at risk to reoffend sexually throughout their lives.\u201d Prentky, Recidivism Rates Among Child Molesters and Rapists: A Methodological Analysis, 21 L. &amp; Hum. Behav. 635, 652 (1997). This is especially so as to Doe, a pedophile, whose condition is incurable. See note 14, <em>infra. </em>A registration requirement for these sex offenders reasonably enables law enforcement to ascertain their relative whereabouts (home and work addresses), to identify them (from the registration data concerning information such as height, weight, eye color), and to take proper precautions for vulnerable persons in the local communities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\"> By statute and regulation, namely G.

The board is not limited to these factors alone and is expressly authorized to consider \u201cany information useful\u201d in its assessment. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1).
