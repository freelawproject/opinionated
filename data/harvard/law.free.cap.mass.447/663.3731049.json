Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gamache, </em>426 Mass. 93 (1997) <em>(Gamache), </em>and its progeny, we articulated an exception to the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d under which parties to litigation generally bear the expense of their own attorney\u2019s fees regardless of the outcome of the case. The <em>Gamache </em>exception allows those who purchase insurance contracts containing a duty to defend provision to recover their attorney\u2019s fees when they must resort to litigation against their insurer to enforce that duty. In the present case, we must consider whether to extend that exception to circumstances where the dispute between an insured and an insurer concerns whether a claim falls within the coverage of a policy, that is, whether the insurer has a duty to indemnify the insured for its loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we decline to expand the <em>Gamache </em>exception beyond the duty to defend. Consequently, although we affirm summary judgment granted to the plaintiff insureds on the issue of coverage, we reverse the award of attorney\u2019s fees to them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">1. <em>Background. </em>This case arises out of a fire at the home of Joseph and Darlene Wilkinson. The fire broke out in the home\u2019s garage and destroyed, among other items, tools and equipment owned by the Wilkinsons but used by their son, Todd, to maintain his racing cars. The Wilkinsons filed a claim under their homeowner\u2019s policy with their insurer, Citation Insurance Company.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The claim included the racing equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>A provision in the policy limited coverage for property used for \u201cany \u2018business\u2019 purpose\u201d to $3,000. The policy defined \u201cbusiness\u201d as \u201ctrade, profession or occupation.\u201d After investigating the Wilkinsons\u2019 claims, Citation denied coverage beyond the $3,000 limit, concluding that the racing equipment was used for a \u201c \u2018business\u2019 purpose\u201d within the meaning of the policy. The Wilkinsons made a written demand under G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D, alleging that, in denying coverage, Citation had construed the policy incorrectly and engaged in an unfair trade practice. Citation responded with a timely letter denying the allegations. The Wilkinsons then instituted the present action. Their complaint sought a judgment of coverage under the policy, along with damages and attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 93A. A Superior Court judge heard the case on cross motions for summary judgment and granted summary judgment for the Wilkinsons on the coverage claim and for Citation on the G. L. c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The Wilkinsons then filed a motion and application for attorney\u2019s fees, arguing that the language of <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>429 Mass. 355 (1999), provided a right of recovery for attorney\u2019s fees in any action in which an insured party must resort to legal action \u201cto obtain the full benefit of his insurance contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, quoting <em>Olympic S.S. Co. </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>117 Wash. 2d 37, 53 (1991). A different Superior Court judge agreed and ordered judgment for attorney\u2019s fees in addition to the indemnity amount owed under the policy. Citation appealed from both judgments to the Appeals Court. The Wilkinsons did not appeal from the dismissal of their G. L. c. 93A claim. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">2. <em>Undisputed facts. </em>The following facts are undisputed in the summary judgment record. Todd Wilkinson is employed full time as an operator of heavy equipment in the excavating business owned by his father, Joseph. Most of Todd\u2019s time outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>of work is devoted to car racing, a pursuit he began in his early teens. Since that time, Todd has taken several specialized training courses in automobile racing and maintenance. Todd races at tracks throughout the northeastern part of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Todd\u2019s racing involves many of his friends and family, who contribute time and effort to help Todd maintain his cars, and who serve as his crew and mechanics during races. In addition to occasional prize money, Todd also receives two types of sponsorships from local businesses in connection with his racing. One type allows him to use engines and other components in his racing cars, with the businesses still maintaining ownership of the parts. The other provides him with revenue in exchange for advertising painted on the side of the car he is racing. On the advice of his accountant, Todd opened up a separate banking account to hold these and other funds used for racing. Although Todd uses the name \u201cWilkinson Racing\u201d in his racing activities, he has not organized a corporation, partnership, or other separate entity by that name. The bank account uses his own Social Security number, and the profit and loss from racing are stated on the personal tax return Todd files jointly with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Todd\u2019s racing activities brought him a substantial amount of income in the years before the fire: approximately $20,000 in both 1998 and 1999, and over $26,000 in 2000. In each of those years, however, the costs of racing exceeded the income it generated, resulting in a net loss for that three-year period of over $12,000. On his tax return, Todd treated those amounts in accordance with the \u201chobby loss\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (I.R.C.). See I.R.C. \u00a7 183(b) (2000). That section allows a taxpayer to offset hobby losses against hobby gains. Any net gain is then taxed at the usual rate for regular income, but a net loss may not be offset against regular income. Accrued hobby losses may only be applied against future hobby gains. This treatment of loss is the opposite of that for \u201cordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred ... in carrying on any trade or business,\u201d which may be applied to reduce taxable ordinary income for the current year. I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">3. <em>Coverage. </em>Citation first asks us to reverse the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>determination that the \u201c \u2018business\u2019 purpose\u201d coverage limits do not apply to the car racing tools and equipment damaged in the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). We therefore construe the facts in the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to Citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Before examining the facts, however, we must first determine the meaning of the relevant contractual provision. This is done \u201caccording to the fair and reasonable meaning of the words in which the agreement of the parties is expressed.\u201d <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982), quoting <em>MacArthur </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Serv., Inc., </em>343 Mass 670, 672 (1962). If some ambiguity remains, \u201cdoubts as to the meaning of the words must be resolved against the insurance company that employed them and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>quoting <em>August A. Busch &amp; Co. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>339 Mass. 239, 243 (1959). The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. See <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The critical provision here is the $3,000 limitation on property \u201cused at any time or in any manner for any \u2018business\u2019 purpose.\u201d The question thus posed is whether Todd Wilkinson\u2019s car racing was a \u201c \u2018business\u2019 purpose.\u201d If so, the equipment he used is subject to the coverage limitation; otherwise, it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The policy gives a brief and general definition of the relevant term, providing only that \u201c \u2018[bjusiness\u2019 includes trade, profession or occupation.\u201d As these predicate words are not further defined, they add little meaning to the term \u201cbusiness\u201d other than to suggest its use in common parlance, which our cases have taken to be \u201can activity engaged in for the purpose of gain or profit.\u201d <em>Newell-Blais Post # 443, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., </em>396 Mass. 633, 636 (1986). We so interpret the contract term.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Citation argues that Todd Wilkinson engages in racing \u201cfor the purpose of gain or profit\u201d by reason of the significant amounts of money he received in contributions and prizes, his extensive training, and the sophistication of his crew\u2019s operation. Yet none of these standing alone helps differentiate an amateur\u2019s hobby from a professional\u2019s occupation. Many people undertake competitive activities that consume much time, energy, and money. Prizes and outside contributions may help defray these costs \u2014 particularly in a pursuit as expensive as racing cars. For the amateur, though, the \u201cgain or profit\u201d is for the purpose of continued engagement in the pursuit, and not (as in business) vice versa. The amateur may manage his affairs in an orderly and responsible way, much as one would run a business. Indeed, Todd did so, both by keeping a separate accounting of his racing on his tax returns and in opening up a separate bank account for \u201cWilkinson Racing.\u201d This does not of necessity make the activity one for gain or profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Citation correctly notes that the fact that Todd reported losses on his racing activities is irrelevant to the determination of a \u201cbusiness purpose.\u201d A reported loss does not make a business into a hobby. Nor is the Wilkinsons\u2019 subjective belief that Todd\u2019s racing was a hobby rather than a business determinative. What does dispel any ambiguity, however, is the tax treatment used consistently by both Todd and his parents. The Wilkinsons never depreciated the value of the equipment as one normally would with business equipment. More important, Todd treated his racing losses under the \u201chobby loss\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, I.R.C. \u00a7 183(b), which do not allow for any excess loss (beyond the offset of hobby-related gains) to be offset against ordinary income. The treatment of profit-seeking business activities is just the opposite. See I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The motion judge interpreted the terms of the policy to give it a fair and reasonable meaning, correctly noting that \u201c [reasonable policyholders would not understand the term \u2018business,\u2019 either in customary usage or under the Policy\u2019s definition, to apply to the weekend avocation of an otherwise gainfully employed individual.\u201d Even viewed in the light most favorable to Citation, the undisputed facts in this case establish that Todd did not at the relevant times race for \u201cgain or profit,\u201d that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>for a \u201c \u2018business\u2019 purpose.\u201d The Wilkinsons were entitled to a judgment of coverage as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Citation next challenges the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the Wilkinsons. The basis of this award is a question of law, which we consider de nova. See <em>Anastos </em>v. <em>Sable, </em>443 Mass. 146, 149 (2004) (\u201clegal conclusions are reviewed de nova\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\u201cThe usual rule in Massachusetts is that the litigant must bear his own expenses . . . .\u201d <em>Waldman </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>413 Mass. 320, 321 (1992).* ****<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is the so-called \u201cAmerican Rule.\u201d In <em>Gamache, </em>we stated an exception to that rule applicable to cases in which an insured successfully establishes an insurer\u2019s duty to defend. While subsequent cases have expanded and clarified the exception, see, e.g., <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Golden, </em>436 Mass. 584 (2002) <em>(Golden), </em>and <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>429 Mass. 355 (1999) <em>(Rubenstein), </em>we have applied it only in the context of litigation between the insured and the insurer regarding the latter\u2019s duty to defend. While the language used in some of our decisions regarding this exception suggested its broader application (as the judge here concluded), we now expressly limit the <em>Gamache </em>exception to duty to defend litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In <em>Gamache, </em>an insurer refused to defend its insured under a homeowner\u2019s liability policy containing a duty to defend, forcing the insured to litigate to establish the duty. We held, \u201cas an exception to our traditional rule disallowing attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, that an insured under a homeowner\u2019s policy, like Gamache, is entitled to the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>expenses incurred in successfully establishing the insurer\u2019s duty to defend under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. We acknowledged that our holding constituted \u201ca deviation from the general rule denying these costs,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 97, but we considered the deviation justified by \u201cthe well-established principle that \u2018the liability insurer\u2019s duty of defense is so extensive and the burden on the insured of a breach of that duty is likely to be so heavy [that] the insurer should not enjoy the usual freedom to litigate without concern about the possibility of having to pay the [insured\u2019s] attorneys\u2019 fees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, quoting <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>673 A.2d 1350, 1354 (Me. 1996). The holding, and its supporting logic, focus exclusively on the \u201cduty of defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><em>Rubenstein </em>also concerns only the duty to defend. In that case, we considered whether the holding in <em>Gamache </em>should extend beyond homeowner\u2019s policies to all forms of liability insurance that include a duty to defend clause. Finding \u201cno sound reason to differentiate between homeowner\u2019s insurance and other kinds of liability insurance in applying the rule in Gamache,\u201d we concluded that an insured \u201cis entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, regardless of which party instituted the declaratory judgment action, whenever the insured establishes that the insurer violated its duty to defend.\u201d <em>Rubenstein, supra </em>at 357, 358. Thus, we clarified that the <em>Gamache </em>rule applies to particular coverage (the duty to defend) and not to any particular type of liability policy (homeowner\u2019s, business, or some other). <em>Rubenstein </em>makes no reference to any other coverage in the insurance contract, such as the duty to indemnify.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Taken together, <em>Gamache </em>and <em>Rubenstein </em>establish that, to be entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees expended in connection with duty to defend litigation, the insured need only show that the insurer was obligated to undertake the defense of the case. This was the circumstance presented in <em>Golden, supra. </em>There, the insurer lost a declaratory judgment action (which it had instituted) seeking a ruling that it was not required to provide a defense under the policy after it had paid the policy limits. Because the insured parties prevailed, we concluded that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>were entitled to collect the attorney\u2019s fees expended to establish the insurer\u2019s continuing duty to defend them. We reached this conclusion even though the insurer had in fact continued to provide a defense for the insured while contesting its contractual obligation to do so. As in <em>Gamache </em>and <em>Rubenstein, </em>the fee award in <em>Golden, </em>and the reasoning supporting it, related entirely to the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Wilkinsons make two arguments for extending the <em>Gamache </em>exception to duty to indemnify cases. First they argue that the <em>Gamache </em>line of cases does not distinguish between the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify in any significant way. By that reckoning, the court addressed the duty to defend issue in those cases only because the facts involved such coverage, and not because it intended to draw a distinction between the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">There is a meaningful difference between an insurer\u2019s duty to defend (and an insured\u2019s reliance on that duty) and a duty to indemnify. The duty to defend arises in situations involving threatened or actual litigation by a third party, a context in which time is of the essence, and in which cost and complexity can compound each passing day. By the time the insurer\u2019s duty to defend has been established through litigation, the insured may already have been denied much of the benefit and protection of that defense, depriving the insured of the benefit of the bargain and requiring an alternative compensatory measure like attorney\u2019s fees. Such is not the case with the duty to indemnify. That duty arises only after the insured\u2019s liability has been established and is between the insurer and the insured. The element of time is less critical.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Payment of claims does not happen immediately on loss, and both parties expect a reasonable delay during which the loss is investigated and evaluated against the policy coverage. Once the duty to indemnify is established, the policy itself, and not an outside measure like attorney\u2019s fees, provides the proper basis for calculating the amount owing. Once that amount is paid, the insured has received the benefit of the policy. That this benefit may in practice be reduced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees is the expected (if difficult) result in a jurisdiction that follows the American Rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The Wilkinsons\u2019 second argument for extending attorney\u2019s fees awards to coverage litigation relies on language appearing throughout the <em>Gamache </em>line of cases asserting \u201cthe existence of a special relationship between an insured and insurer.\u201d See <em>Gamache, supra </em>at 96; <em>Rubenstein, supra </em>at 358; <em>Golden, supra </em>at 587. Because of this \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d the Wilkinsons argue, an insured is unfairly disadvantaged by the need to resort to litigation to enforce coverage. Requiring the insured, after having won on coverage, to bear his own costs \u201cis effectively to deny the insured the benefit of his bargain.\u201d This logic applies, the argument goes, with equal force to the duty to indemnify as to the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The Wilkinsons are correct that litigation costs associated with disputed coverage can consume much of the ultimate award to a successful insured. The coverage becomes, in effect, reduced, and the value of the contract to the insured decreases. Yet the converse is also true: an insurer who successfully litigates a decision to deny coverage also loses contract value because of the need to expend funds to keep from paying for coverage it did not agree to provide. Indeed, one could describe similarly any dispute to which the American Rule applies: one or both parties will come out less than economically whole, even if that party is successful in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">No party to insurance or any other contract wants, expects, or bargains for the cost and disturbance of litigation. It is, though, the settled expectation and rule in this Commonwealth that parties bear their own litigation costs. Whether the American Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>is the best rule or not, it applies across all types of disputes except when, for example, a specific statute (or contract provision) provides otherwise.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Any extension of the <em>Gamache </em>exception to duty to indemnify cases must rely on some significant distinction between insurance and other contracts. Otherwise, we could not justifiably apply such an exception in insurance cases but not in other contract disputes without drawing into question the continued general applicability of the American Rule.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The Wilkinsons suggest that the relative bargaining power of the parties to an insurance contract is a distinguishing feature warranting an exception to the American Rule in insurance cases. They draw our attention to a case decided by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, <em>Hayseeds, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas., </em>177 W. Va. 323 (1986) <em>(Hayseeds). </em>That case modified the American Rule in West Virginia to allow for awards of attorney\u2019s fees in disputes over the duty to indemnify much like the one at bar. In an extensive discussion, the West Virginia court offers a description of the complicated, frustrating, and unfortunate experience some policyholders face when making a claim in the face of an insurer that denies coverage. See <em>id. </em>at 327-328.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">While compelling, particularly on the facts in <em>Hayseeds, </em>this description does not establish that there exists in all insurance cases a particular \u201cdisparity of bargaining power between company and policyholder\u201d that \u201cmake[s] insurance contracts substantially different from other commercial contracts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>328. In fact, many types of commercial contracts involving private consumers and corporate enterprises can be said to involve a \u201cdisparity of bargaining power.\u201d In addition, many insurance contracts and disputes do not involve parties with disparate bargaining power.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">A distinction that does exist between insurance and other contracts is the comprehensive statutory and regulatory framework under which the insurance industry operates. See generally G. L. c. 175 (insurance). See, e.g., G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 3A-17 (powers and duties of Commissioner of Insurance). The significant involvement of the Commonwealth in ensuring consistency and fairness in contracts of insurance does, in a sense, create a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d absent from most other types of contracts. It does so, however, in a way that cautions against judicial modification of the relationship by, for example, expanding the <em>Gamache </em>rule.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In a field such as insurance, where a comprehensive regulatory scheme prevails, we are hesitant to alter the balance created by that scheme through modification of the common-law framework against which it developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In this case, the parties do not contest the judge\u2019s conclusion that the dispute as to coverage was bona fide and not the product of an unfair or abusive trade practice. Yet we are mindful of the concern that denying fee awards in duty to indemnify cases might encourage some insurers to deny coverage (improperly) in cases where they calculate that the policyholder will find litigation too costly. There are, however, other statutory and regulatory avenues available to counter such unfair or abusive tactics. See G. L. c. 175 \u00a7 3A (delegating broad authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Commissioner of Insurance to enforce insurance laws and to promulgate regulations thereunder); 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.00 (1996) (regulations issued under authority of G. L. c. 175). See also G. L. c. 93A (consumer action for unfair or abusive trade practices); G. L. c. 176D (prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices in business of insurance).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Finally, most State courts that have considered whether to create a further exception to the American Rule by extending the entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees beyond disputes regarding an insurer\u2019s duty to defend have reached the same conclusion we do here. See <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 566, 592 (1999) (declining to extend exception to American Rule for duty to defend cases to duty to indemnify cases); <em>American Standard Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dang Van Le, </em>551 N.W.2d 923, 927 (Minn. 1996) (insured can recover attorney\u2019s fees when insurer wrongfully fails to defend but not when insurer litigates duty to indemnify); <em>Emmanuel Baptist Church </em>v. <em>Southern Mut. Church Ins.

Once that amount is established and paid, the insured party has received the benefit of the bargain. The fees incurred in establishing the recovery are separate.

I agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that summary judgment for the plaintiffs should be affirmed because their insurance policy covers their loss. I write separately because I conclude that there is no logical reason not to extend the exception to the American rule concerning who bears the cost of litigation carved out in the <em>Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. Gamache, 426 Mass. 93, 98 (1997) (under a homeowner\u2019s policy, the insured \u201cis entitled to the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred in successfully establishing the insurer\u2019s duty to defend under the policy\u201d), to insured homeowners who successfully establish an insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The court correctly points out, <em>ante </em>at 669, that the issue in the <em>Gamache </em>case, as well as in <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>429 Mass. 355, 356 (1999), and <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Golden, </em>436 Mass. 584 (2002), was limited to whether attorney\u2019s fees and costs should be awarded where a duty to defend existed. However, the <em>Rubenstein </em>case set forth a further explanation of the policy reasons behind the <em>Gamache </em>decision. In particular, as noted by the Superior Court judge, the <em>Rubenstein </em>decision stated that the denial of attorney\u2019s fees and costs would deny the insured the benefit of the bargain they made with the insurance company. <em>Id. </em>at 358. The court also noted that a special relationship between the insurer and insured exists, <em>id., </em>and that \u201c[t]he promise to defend [and] <em>indemnify </em>... is the consideration received by the insured for payment of the policy premiums\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Brohawn </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 409-410 (1975). Moreover, if the insured had to bear the cost of litigation concerning coverage, the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>would be no better off for having a policy. <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., supra </em>at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In highlighting these principles, the court in <em>Rubenstein </em>quoted, with approval, decisions where State courts awarded the insureds attorney\u2019s fees in successful duty to indemnify actions. <em>Id. </em>at 359, 360, quoting <em>Olympic S.S. Co. </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>117 Wash. 2d 37, 53 (1991), and <em>Hayseeds, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas., </em>177 W. Va. 323, 329 (1986). In addition, the court awarded <em>appellate </em>attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the plaintiffs, even though they did not request them. <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., supra </em>at 361. The principles outlined in the <em>Rubenstein </em>case were reiterated by the court in <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Golden, supra </em>at 586-588, in holding that insureds could recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs after successfully establishing an insurer\u2019s duty to defend, even in the absence of a breach of contract. Additionally, in <em>Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gamache, supra </em>at 96-97, the court explicitly rejected the argument that a statutory provision was necessary for the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. See <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Golden, supra </em>at 587 n.3, citing <em>Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gamache, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In this case, as the Superior Court judge noted, without the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the plaintiffs are ultimately worse off for having prevailed on the issue whether the insurer had a duty to indemnify. The costs of litigation have deprived them of the benefit of the bargain they made with the insurance company. Given the principles articulated in the <em>Gamache, Rubenstein, </em>and <em>Golden </em>cases, I do not see a logical reason not to expand the exception to the American rule to cover the duty to indemnify. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from that part of the court\u2019s opinion that vacates the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
