He was denied employment as a fire fighter by the city of Marlborough (city) due to his inability to pass a hearing test based on standards promulgated by the Commonwealth\u2019s division of human resources (division) at the direction of, and later approved by, the Legislature. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61A. As a result, he commenced this action against the Commonwealth, the personnel administrator of the division, and the city,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging handicap discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16); G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103; and art. 114 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Carleton contends that the division should have allowed him to meet the hearing standards with the assistance of his hearing aids. He does not claim that he could perform the essential functions of the job of a fire fighter without the use of his hearing aids or that the level of hearing acuity set by the medical standards is unnecessary to the performance of those functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">A judge in the Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, concluding that Carleton could not establish that he was capable of performing the essential functions of a municipal fire fighter with reasonable accommodation, a necessary element of his discrimination claims. In reach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>ing this conclusion, the judge first accepted the division\u2019s determination that a certain level of unaided hearing (reflected in the hearing standard) was an essential function of the job of a fire fighter, and then found that the only accommodation that would enable Carleton to meet the hearing standard \u2014 the use of hearing aids \u2014 was not a reasonable accommodation because it would force the division and the city to waive or alter that essential function.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *The judge also concluded that Carleton\u2019s art. 114 claim, brought pursuant to G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103, failed because the safety of fire fighters and those they are charged with protecting is an overriding State interest justifying the hearing standards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Carleton appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm, although on different grounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We recount the facts in their light most favorable to Carleton. See, e.g, <em>Mammone </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>446 Mass. 657, 659-660 (2006), and cases cited. Since childhood, Carleton has suffered \u201cbilateral mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss.\u201d He lacks the necessary amplification to hear within a normal decibel range.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To correct this deficiency, Carleton has worn hearing aids in both ears from a very early age.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Carleton\u2019s first formal experience with fire fighting began in 1997, when, at age seventeen years, he participated in a volunteer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>program sponsored by the fire department of Northborough and the Boy Scouts. Carleton took part in \u201call aspects of firefighting, except those involving [entrance to \u2018burning structures\u2019].\u201d He \u201creceived regular on-the-job fire fighting training at weekly meetings.\u201d Carleton learned \u201cto operate fire ladders, fire hoses, [and] water supply\u201d; was taught proper \u201cdrafting\u201d technique (how to find and use nonhydrant water supplies); and practiced \u201cusing hydrants, driving fire vehicles, setting up fighting and fans on fire grounds, assisting with the rehabilitation of fire fighters, and assisting with salvage operations.\u201d In 1998, Carleton became a licensed emergency medical technician (EMT). From August, 1998, to October, 1999, and from July, 2000, to October, 2003, Carleton had been employed by two private ambulance companies as an EMT. fil October, 1999, the city also hired Carleton as a 911 emergency dispatcher, a position, it appears, that he continues to hold. In none of these activities was there ever a problem reported regarding Carleton\u2019s hearing or communicating with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In addition, Carleton served as a \u201ccall\u201d fire fighter\u00ae for the town of Stow from January, 2000, until 2002. As a call fire fighter, he successfully completed the \u201cfire fighter I certification course.\u201d Aside from lectures, this course included three days of \u201cstructural fire fighting inside a burning structure and outside on the fireground adjacent thereto.\u201d During these exercises, Carleton wore his hearing aids as well as head coverings and other equipment. Although sweating, being sprayed intermittently with water, and being exposed to significantly loud background noise, Carleton had no problem hearing or communicating with others, and his hearing aids functioned properly at all times.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">On April 29, 2000, Carleton sat for the division\u2019s fire fighter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>civil service examination. He scored a ninety-nine out of a possible one hundred on the examination. Consequently, his name was placed close to the top of the civil service list from which participating governmental units or municipalities hired. In April, 2001, the division notified Carleton that the city would be hiring two fire fighters. Carleton immediately informed the city that he would like to be considered for the positions. Thereafter, the chief of the city\u2019s fire department contacted Carleton to explain that a preemployment medical examination had been scheduled for him on June 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The city is a municipality within the civil service system. This status requires it to adhere to the Statewide minimum health and fitness standards for police officers and fire fighters promulgated by the division pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61 A, first, second and third pars., inserted by St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 10 (division must devise \u201chealth and physical fitness standards which shall be applicable to <em>all </em>police officers and firefighters\u2019\u2019 [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> One of these standards focuses on hearing ability. See Division of Human Resources, Medical Standards for Municipal Fire Fighters (Initial Hire), at 4-5. At the time Carleton applied for a fire fighting position with the city, the standard set a maximum hearing deficiency threshold. If the applicant\u2019s hearing deficiency exceeded this threshold, he was deemed to have a \u201cCategory A\u201d medical condition. See <em>id. A </em>\u201cCategory A\u201d medical condition is considered incompatible with the performance of the essential job functions of a municipal fire fighter and leads to the applicant\u2019s disqualification.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Carleton underwent the preemployment medical examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>conducted by the MedWorks, a department of Marlborough Hospital. Part of this examination required Carleton to use headphones to listen and identify different tones and different decibel levels. For the first iteration of the test, the examining nurse did not permit Carleton to use his hearing aids. The nurse then administered the test again, this time allowing Carleton to wear his hearing aids, even though their use was not permitted under the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Three days later, on June 7, the supervising MedWorks physician notified Carleton that he had failed the hearing examination. On June 9, Carleton filed an appeal with the division, stating simply that he is \u201cwriting to appeal the failure of [his] Civil Service physical for the Marlborough Fire Department,\u201d and that he \u201c[has] worn hearing aids for fifteen years, [is] currently a member of the Stow Fire Department and [has] never had a problem carrying out [his] duties as a firefighter/E.M.T.\u201d As a result of this appeal, the division asked Dr. James Ryan, the medical director of Boston Medical Center\u2019s occupational and environmental medicine department, to examine the test results.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">On June 29, 2001, Dr. Ryan reported to the division and to Carleton that his review of the Medworks examination revealed that while the applicable medical standard allows a maximum \u201chearing deficit in the pure tone thresholds in the <em>unaided </em>worse ear of. . . 40 dB,\u201d Carleton had a deficit \u201cin the <em>unaided </em>left ear of 75 dB . . .\u201d (emphasis added). And, while the standards permitted a maximum \u201chearing deficit in the pure tone thresholds in the unaided [other] ear of . . . 25 dB,\u201d Carleton had a deficit \u201cin the right ear of 35 dB . . . .\u201d Dr. Ryan noted in his report that sometimes \u201ca single test does not reflect a person\u2019s best hearing.\u201d He explained, however, that in his opinion the testing was accurate, based on the history of Carleton\u2019s disability and on the \u201cwide margin\u201d by which Carleton failed the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Dr. Ryan also reported that Carleton \u201cwears hearing aids . . . and has submitted the results of the audiogram performed while wearing hearing aids,\u201d but that \u201c[h]earing aids are not permitted to be used ... in order to meet the requirements of the Medical Standards.\u201d He explained the reasons for this prohibition: \u201cHearing aids do not permit accurate localization of the direction of sounds; can be swamped by loud background noise; may be subject to failure due to electronic malfunction or weak batteries during an emergency situation; and may act as radio receivers, picking up interference from nearby radio transmitters.\u201d Dr. Ryan added that \u201c[ljoss of effective hearing in such a situation . . . would place the life and safety of the fire fighter and the public in danger.\u201d Finally, Dr. Ryan pointed out that \u201ceven if hearing aids were permitted under the Medical Standards,\u201d the results of the test administered with hearing aids (on June 4, 2001), shows that \u201cCarleton still fails to meet [the division\u2019s medical standards] ... in both ears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">On July 16, 2001, the division sent Carleton a letter denying his appeal because he had \u201cfailed to meet the Public Safety Medical Standards for Municipal Firefighters.\u201d The division upheld \u201cthe examining physician\u2019s assessment that [Carleton] posess[es] a Category A medical condition which precludes [him] from performing the essential functions of a firefighter.\u201d The letter also informed Carleton that he was \u201centitled to a second examination within sixteen weeks\u201d of the denial. According to his affidavit, Carleton understood this to mean that he could be \u201creexamined . . . using the same test under the same conditions.\u201d Carleton did not seek a reexamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">On August 17, 2001, Carleton received another notice from the division that the city was hiring fire fighters. He responded by sending in the required card signifying his interest in these positions, but received no response from the division or the city. In September, 2001, the city filled the positions with persons whose placement on the civil service list was below Carleton\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">On February 25, 2002, Carleton filed an employment discrimination claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), alleging handicap discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (16). Carleton faulted the division and the city for \u201cfail[ing] to allow [him] to wear hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>ing aids while taking the hearing test to determine if he met [the division\u2019s] hearing standards\u201d and explained that he was \u201ca qualified individual with a handicap who is capable of safely performing the essential functions of the job of firefighter with the reasonable accommodation of being permitted to wear hearing aids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">On March 8, 2002, Carleton visited Dr. David Citron, a hearing expert whom he had retained in connection with his MCAD complaint. Dr. Citron informed him that a hearing test with headphones on a person wearing Carleton\u2019s hearing aids (like the second test administered by MedWorks on June 4, 2001) would yield invalid results. Dr. Citron performed a full audiological evaluation on Carleton, both with and without the use of hearing aids. The results of this evaluation appeared to show that even with the use of hearing aids, Carleton\u2019s hearing did not meet the division\u2019s standards. However, Dr. Citron explained that Carleton\u2019s hearing aids did not fit his ears perfectly during this examination and that the misfit likely accounted for the test results. At the suggestion of Dr. Citron, Carleton\u2019s hearing aids were sent back to the manufacturer for repair. On May 9, 2002, Carleton visited Dr. Citron for a follow-up evaluation. By that time, Carleton\u2019s hearing aids had been repaired and fit his ears properly. Dr. Citron examined Carleton with his hearing aids, and concluded in a written report dated June 3, 2002, that Carleton had the hearing ability necessary to \u201cperform the duties of a fire fighter with no difficulties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">On July 12, 2002, during the pendency of Carleton\u2019s MCAD claim, the division sent him information that the city was hiring six \u201cpermanent intermittent firefighters.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Carleton filed suit against the defendants on July 23, 2002. The following day, Carleton\u2019s attorney wrote to the city\u2019s fire department and the division, enclosing a copy of Dr. Citron\u2019s June 3 report, advising that Carleton had filed a discrimination action against them in the Superior Court; that Carleton expected to be considered for the intermittent fire fighter positions; that Carleton met the division\u2019s hearing standard when tested properly while wear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>ing hearing aids; and that Carleton had to be allowed to take the preemployment hearing examination with the assistance of his hearing aids.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Thereafter the city council approved Carleton\u2019s appointment as a permanent intermittent fire fighter, subject to a successful medical examination, which was scheduled to take place on October 7, 2002. Carleton was again examined by MedWorks. He was not permitted to wear his hearing aids during the hearing test. The result of the test again placed him into Category A. Consequently, when the city presented the final list of appointments to the division on October 28, 2002, Carleton\u2019s name was not among them. Accompanying this final list, the city submitted a letter to the division making explicit that Carleton was not hired because he failed to meet the division\u2019s hearing standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">2. <em>The division\u2019s standards. </em>As of the mid-1980\u2019s, the statutory framework governing the civil service system gave the Commonwealth\u2019s personnel administrator discretion to \u201cestablish physical requirements, in addition to those established by statute and rule, as prerequisites for appointment to any civil service position\u201d and to \u201crequire an applicant... to submit to physical examination prior to [his or her] appointment.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 21, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11. Pursuant to this authorization, the division issued guidelines concerning, inter alla, the rejection of candidates based on medical impairment. For example, in 1984, the guidelines, which \u201c[appointing authorities [were] required to use ... in the administration of their own medical examinations,\u201d explained that \u201c[t]he causes for rejection [due to deficient hearing were] [a]ll chronic or acute diseases of the external auditory canal, mastoids, middle ear and tympanic membrane that are non-remediable\u201d and \u201cMeniere\u2019s disease.\u201d The guidelines also noted that an \u201c[applicant must be able to hear the whispered voice in each ear at twenty feet. If not, [the] candidate must undergo full audiometric examination.\u201d See Department of Personnel Administration, Revised Physical Standards for Public Safety Positions (May 1984). The method by which such guidelines were devised \u2014 or even whether there existed any set method for devising them \u2014 is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>In 1987, the Legislature passed and the Governor signed the pension reform act. St. 1987, c. 697. This new law provided that \u201c[t]he administrator, with the secretary of public safety and the commissioner of public health shall establish initial health and physical fitness standards which shall be applicable to all police officers and firefighters when they are appointed to\u201d civil service positions. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61 A. The law mandates that \u201c[s]uch standards ... be established by regulations promulgated by the administrator after consultation with representatives of police and firefighter unions, and the Massachusetts Municipal Association.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The law specified that <em>\u201c[s]uch initial health and physical fitness standards shall be rationally related to the duties of such positions and shall have the purpose of minimizing health and safety risks to the public, fellow workers and the police officers and firefighters themselves\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>The law made plain that \u201c[n]o person appointed to a . . . police or firefighter position after [January 1, 1988<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] shall perform the duties of such position until he shall have undergone initial medical and physical fitness examinations and shall have met such initial standards.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 61 A, also mandated that the division \u201cestablish in-service health and physical fitness standards which shall be applicable to all police officers and firefighters in permanent, temporary, intermittent, and reserve positions.\u201d As was the case with the initial standards, the 1987 statute limited the reach of these standards to persons hired after January 1, 1988.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Police officers and fire fighters hired after that date were to undergo examination at least every two years.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The Legislature further required that the division\u2019s health and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>physical fitness standards were to be promulgated as proposed regulations and transmitted to the Legislature before attaining the force of law. Specifically, the division was to \u201csubmit regulations promulgated pursuant to this section to the clerks of the house of representatives and senate, who shall refer said regulations to the appropriate standing committee of the general court. ... If the general court takes no final action relative to said regulations within forty-five days . . . said regulations shall be filed with the state secretary .... No such regulation shall take effect until filed with the state secretary . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61 A.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Although it is unclear from the record and the regulatory history precisely when standards were first promulgated for fire fighters pursuant to the 1987 pension reform act, in 1997 the personnel administrator reported in a letter to the clerk of the House of Representatives that the division had adopted standards \u201csynonymous with and identical to the National Fire Protection Association\u2019s (NFPA) Document 1582, Medical Requirements for Firefighters.\u201d The NFPA is the preeminent fire code and standards organization in the United States, and NFPA Document 1582 is \u201ca standard that has been adopted by fire fighting organizations throughout the United States.\u201d <em>Sicard </em>v. <em>Sioux City, </em>950 F. Supp. 1420, 1425 (N.D. Iowa 1996).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In 1995, the division began exploring the need to update its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>standards because of concerns, according to the personnel administrator\u2019s letter, that the old standards \u201cno longer representad] the latest research of the relationship between medical conditions and categories and actual job performance\u201d and \u201cneed[ed] revision to keep pace with developing case law around the Americans With Disabilities Act.\u201d To facilitate this task, the division formed a panel of experts (senior officers in city fire departments, physicians, a physical therapist, and a physiologist). The updating process took two years to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The panel engaged a consulting firm to perform a job task analysis for the position of fire fighter (and police officer). The job task analysis \u201cincluded interviews and panel review sessions with job incumbents and supervisors, and the administration of surveys to representative samples of incumbent[] [fire fighters]. The surveys asked respondents to provide judgments regarding the performance, frequency, importance, amount of time, physical effort and speed requirements of the job tasks and physical tasks; the cognitive and physical abilities required to perform major task groups or duties; and the importance of the various abilities relative to one another.\u201d The analysis was used to \u201cdevelop and validate . . . medical standards for selection and retention of municipal fire fighting and police personnel of all ranks.\u201d Consistent with the division\u2019s statutory mandate, the panel made plain to the consulting firm that the \u201cstandards must be based on the physical abilities required to perform the essential functions of [the] jobs\u201d and that the \u201cstandards should minimize adverse impact on women and minorities.\u201d The panel added to this the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">\u201cThe medical standards shall identify all biological systems involved in performing the essential functions of fire fighter and police occupations in Massachusetts. All relevant biological systems must be linked to essential functions of [the] jobs of fire fighters and police officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">\u201cThe standards shall specify all medical conditions affecting those biological systems that would preclude a candidate\u2019s ability to perform the essential functions of the jobs of fire fighter and police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u201cThe standards shall identify acceptable levels of functioning for biological systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">\u201cThe health standards shall be developed based on consultation with medical experts and subject matter experts in the fields of fire fighting and law enforcement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">In December, 1995, the consulting firm issued a report in which it recommended new minimum medical standards. The report noted that \u201cthe purpose of [the] standardfs] [was] to aid examining physicians in the selection and retention of public safety personnel . . . based on medical ability to perform essential job functions without risk to self or the public.\u201d The report explained that its recommendations were based on a \u201ccareful and systematic determination of . . . essential job functions, the physical and physiological constructs necessary to perform those functions, and absolute and relative exclusionary criteria to be used during medical screening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The standards proposed in the report divided medical deficiencies into two categories \u2014 Category A and Category B. \u201cA candidate or current fire fighter shall not be certified as meeting the medical requirements of this standard if the physician determines that the candidate has any Category A medical condition [and] a candidate or current fire fighter shall not be certified as meeting the medical requirements of this standard if the physician determines that the candidate has a Category B medical condition that is of sufficient severity to prevent the candidate from performing the essential functions of a fire fighter without posing a significant risk to the safety and health of him/herself or others.\u201d Included in the report\u2019s recommendations were medical standards concerning a great number of biological systems (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth and throat, gastrointestinal organs, brain and nerves, and cardiovascular system). Also included were standards regarding an applicant\u2019s ability to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">As required by law, the division consulted representatives from the fire fighter unions and the Massachusetts Municipal Association regarding the conclusions of the report. Thereafter, it promulgated proposed new standards. Most of the report\u2019s recommendations, and the report\u2019s proposed hearing standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>in particular, were accepted by the panel and by the division and included in the final proposed standards. In 1997, the proposed standards were transmitted by the division to the public service committee, a standing committee of the General Court, for comment and further action. The committee recommended to the House of Representatives and the Senate that the standards be \u201cplaced on file\u201d with the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The House and Senate accepted this recommendation. See 1997-1998 House J. 1394; 1997-1998 Senate J. 1414; 1997 Senate Doc. No. 1757. The standards were then filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth and became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The 1997 standards were operative in 2001 when Carleton was first denied employment as a fire fighter. Under these standards, a \u201chearing deficit in the pure tone thresholds in the unaided worse ear of greater than 40 dB at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, or 3000 Hz, [or a] hearing deficit in the pure tone thresholds in the unaided better ear of greater than 25 dB at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz or 3000 Hz\u201d constituted a Category A medical condition. The standard did not allow an applicant to overcome the Category A classification by using hearing aids.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The division began considering revisions to its standards in 2001. It again hired a consulting firm to assist it in \u201cupdating] the existing medical standards for the positions of Firefighter and Police Officer within the State of Massachusetts\u201d based on an updated job task analysis report. This revision process included the selection of new expert panels in the fields of vision and hearing. It culminated in 2003 with the promulgation of new standards (including revisions to the hearing standard) and the acceptance of the standards by the Legislature that same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The consulting firm\u2019s report, issued in June, 2002, describes the findings of the job task analysis, the \u201clegal information that would be useful in updating the medical standards,\u201d and the \u201cmedical standards revision process.\u201d The revision process was described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-5\">\u201cThe basic review process involved mailing the existing standards to a number of medical experts for review and comment. These experts included several individuals who participated in the development of the original standards for Massachusetts. In addition, two areas of the standards were targeted for in-depth review and evaluation. The Ears and Hearing section and the Eyes and Vision section of the standards received the added attention. Specifically, panels of experts met in Boston to discuss and edit each of these sections of the standards in a half-day session. Both methods lead <em>[sic] </em>to the updating of the existing standards and the identification of absolute and relative exclusionary criteria to be used during future medical screening. All decisions were tied to essential job functions ... to ensure the relevancy of the resulting physical and physiological constructs that would be part of the updated medical standards.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The consulting firm and the expert panels were cognizant of the requirements of Massachusetts and Federal discrimination laws. The report noted that the approach the consulting firm selected to ensure test components are linked to essential job functions \u201csatisfies the [Americans with Disabilities Act] criterion and ... is required by the 1991 Civil Rights Act.\u201d The report also emphasized that \u201c[i]n view of ADA, it [was] important to have a clear definition of what constitutes the essential functions of the job\u201d and that the method it used to explore essential job functions appeared to be preferred by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Finally, the report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>noted that \u201call medical certification decisions must be based on an individual\u2019s ability to perform the essential functions of the job without risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The panel on hearing standards agreed that an \u201c[ajdequate ability to hear is critical for communicating effectively as a police officer or fire fighter.\u201d The members also agreed that \u201c[fjire fighters are more likely to experience problems with hearing aids during the performance of their duties at the fire scene. A hearing aid can fail due to being soaked or from excessive perspiration, preventing the wearer from performing a critical job function during the failure period.<footnotemark>[23]</footnotemark> It is possible the failure could occur during a circumstance that is life threatening. Police officers are not likely to encounter these types of conditions while performing their normal work duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Based on these findings, the panel recommended that police officer candidates be permitted to use hearing aids to meet the hearing standard, but that fire fighter candidates not be permitted to do the same, unless the hearing aids used were implantable hearing aids.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, while an applicant to the police force would be permitted to pass the hearing standards \u201caided based on sound field testing\u201d (as opposed to booth testing), a fire fighter applicant was required to \u201cpass . . . unaided\u201d or with the use of implantable hearing aids \u201cbased on sound field testing.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The panel also agreed that \u201c[ljocalization of sound (determining where it is coming from) is not critical for policing or fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>fighting because equipment and other background noise can hinder [the] ability to do so, and other cues can be used.\u201d They further found that \u201c[h]earing loss in fire fighters is . . . common over time\u201d; that \u201c[m]any incumbents are able to continue to perform their work, even with impaired hearing\u201d; and that \u201c[t]here is little evidence that modest hearing loss is incompatible with safe performance of essential job functions.\u201d Consequently, although the newly proposed hearing standard contains a Category A hearing deficiency threshold (\u201cHearing deficit in pure tone thresholds in both ears, the deficit in each ear averaging 35 dB HL or worse at 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz),\u201d an applicant who is assessed with a Category A medical problem is no longer automatically excluded from service. Rather, if a person is diagnosed with a Category A problem and still wishes to be considered for appointment, they are given a full audiological examination. This test can be passed if an applicant has \u201c[p]ure tone thresholds in [the] better ear indicating average hearing levels at 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz to be lower than 35 dB HL, and performance score of 80% or better on the speech discrimination test in the better ear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The new hearing standard allows the medical certification of more persons suffering from hearing loss than would have been certified under the 1997 standard. Nonetheless, Carleton would pass neither standard without the use of his hearing aids.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">3. <em>Carleton\u2019s G. L. c. 151B claim. </em>In 1983, the antidiscrimination act (G. L. c. 15 IB) was amended to protect handicapped persons from employment discrimination. See St. 1983, c. 533, \u00a7 6, inserting G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16). Section 4(16) makes it unlawful, with certain exceptions, \u201c[f]or any employer, personally or through an agent, to dismiss from employment or refuse to hire, rehire or advance in employment or otherwise discriminate against, because of his handicap, any person alleging to be a qualified handicapped person, capable of performing the essential functions of the position involved with reasonable accommodation . . . .\u201d Whether an accommodation is reasonable depends on whether it would \u201cimpose an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d Whether there is an undue hardship depends on the consideration of \u201cfactors\u201d that the statute says \u201cinclude,\u201d inter alla, (1) the size of the busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>ness; (2) the type of operation; and (3) the nature and cost of the accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Section 4 (16) permits employers to adopt \u201c[p]hysical or mental job qualification requirement[s] with respect to hiring\u201d so long as they are \u201cfunctionally related to the specific job . . . and . . . consistent with the safe and lawful performance of the job.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16). It also provides that \u201can employer may condition an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted solely for the purpose of determining whether the employee, with reasonable accommodation, is capable of performing the essential functions of the job.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">\u201cThe public policies underlying G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), are clear: to protect \u2018handicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of [employers] as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks.\u201d <em>Dahill v. Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, 240 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Consistent with \u00a7 4 (16), G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61 A, enacted in 1987, directs the division to promulgate medical standards that are \u201crationally related to the duties of [fire fighter] positions,\u201d for the \u201cpurpose of minimizing health and safety risks to the public, fellow workers and firefighters themselves.\u201d Fire fighters perform highly demanding and exceptionally dangerous work, requiring that a wide range of physical abilities be readily available under potentially catastrophic conditions. It is not surprising that the Legislature would specifically seek, through \u00a7 61 A, to ensure that employees in this category of civil service would be able to perform their work safely and protect the public through the establishment of uniform minimum health and physical standards for their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">That the division proceeded to develop and update its medical standards in accord with this legislative directive is indisputable. The Legislature\u2019s ratification of the standards at each point along the way confirms that the standards were consistent with the purposes behind the enactment of the statute, and had the full force of law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>B &amp; W Transp. Inc., </em>388 Mass. 799, 803 (1983), and cases cited (regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>promulgated pursuant to statutory authority treated with same deference as statutes).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Where two statutes relate to the same subject matter and are not irreconcilable, \u201cthey should be construed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spearin, </em>446 Mass. 599, 604 (2006), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975). We see no irreconcilable conflict between G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), and the regulations ratified by the Legislature under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61 A, notwithstanding the fact that the standards do not permit the use of nonimplantable hearing aids to satisfy the minimum hearing requirements necessary to the performance of the essential functions of a fire fighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">In an area where public safety is paramount, we do not read \u00a7 4 (16) to preclude a determination by the division (rather than by a judge or a jury) that an accommodation is not reasonable because it would impose an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\u2019s (in this case the public\u2019s) business due to the dangerous type of work involved and the nature of the risk to public safety that would arise if the accommodation failed (leaving the fire fighter without adequate hearing function) at a critical moment in the work.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This is particularly so where such a determination is based on consultations with medical and occupational experts in the field; is not the product of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear; and is ratified by the Legislature.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Read harmoniously in this fashion, the statutes are consistent with and promote the Legislature\u2019s purposes and policies of protecting \u201chandicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice . . . while giving appropriate weight to . . . avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks.\u201d <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, supra </em>at 240, quoting <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel &amp; Tel Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 383-384 (1993).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Where, as here, a level of hearing acuity reflected in the hearing standard is an essential qualification for a municipal fire fighter (a determination not disputed by Carleton) and the accommodation sought (the use of hearing aids) is not a reasonable one as determined by the Legislature, Carleton has no reasonable expectation of proving that he is a qualified handicapped person.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Summary judgment was therefore properly granted. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">4. <em>Carleton\u2019s G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103, and art. 114 claim. </em>Article 114 was ratified in 1980 by the citizens of the Commonwealth and provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity within the commonwealth.\u201d While the amendment does not further explain or define the meaning of the term \u201cotherwise qualified handicapped individual,\u201d its language is nearly identical to that of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (2000), from which it was largely taken, and which similarly applies to \u201cotherwise qualified handicapped individual[s].\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Layne </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass.

L. c. 151B.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 384. We now further conclude that, for purposes of art. 114, an \u201cotherwise qualified handicapped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>individual\u201d in the employment context is one \u201ccapable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (16).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">\u201cIf a violation of art. 114 rights can be redressed within the ambit of an existing statute . . . there is a well-worn procedural path to relief for such a violation.\u201d <em>Layne </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass.

L. c. 15 IB is or was available to the plaintiff, the plaintiff would have no viable c. 93, \u00a7 103, claim.\u201d <em>Agin </em>v. <em>Federal White Cement, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 669, 672 (1994), citing <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580 (1994).

App. Ct. 585, 604 (2004).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Here, the challenge Carleton brings relates to the denial of employment, and falls squarely within the ambit of G. L. c. 151B. We do not construe Carleton\u2019s art. 114 right to be free from employment discrimination based on handicap more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>broadly than that which is provided him in \u00a7 4 (16).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Because he is unable to establish that he is a \u201cqualified handicapped\u201d person under that statute, Carleton\u2019s constitutional claim must fail as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Summary judgment for the defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-9\"> On April 4, 2003, a stipulation entered that recognized that the city of Marlborough (city) \u201cshall be deemed a nominal party in this action and shall not be held liable to either the plaintiff or the state defendants for any monetary damages, costs, or expenses arising out of this litigation.\u201d The city is a party to this case because Carleton seeks, as partial relief, employment as a fire fighter in the city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-10\"> Carleton also contends that G. L. c. 15 IB, \u00a7 4 (4A) and 4 (5), create liability for the actions of the Commonwealth\u2019s division of human resources (division). However, Carleton\u2019s original complaint and the memorandum of decision on the motion for summary judgment mention only G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), as a ground for such liability. Although Carleton raised the question of the applicability of \u00a7 4 (4A) in his opposition to summary judgment, and requested leave to amend his complaint to include a \u00a7 4 (4A) claim, it does not appear that the complaint was so amended, or that such claims otherwise became live issues in the case.

A call fire fighter, who usually has a primary career, is not required to respond to any particular incident, and does not \u201cman\u201d the fire station waiting for a fire. Rather, he or she is paged when an incident occurs and responds if he or she is able to do so. Generally, call fire fighters are required to respond to some monthly minimum of emergency calls. These fire fighters are not employed under the civil service system and apparently are not required to meet the division\u2019s medical standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\"> Carleton subsequently held another call fire fighter position, and completed other training programs after the filing of this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\"> In relevant part, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61A, states that the \u201cadministrator [of the division], with the secretary of public safety and the commissioner of public health shall establish initial health and physical fitness standards which shall be applicable to all police officers and firefighters when they are appointed to permanent, temporary, intermittent or reserve positions in cities and towns or other governmental units. ...

A determination that an applicant has a Category B medical condition does not automatically disqualify an applicant from being hired. Rather, such an applicant is required to go through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>an individualized analysis of his or her condition in order for the division to determine whether he or she can perform the essential functions of a fire fighter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\"> Dr. Ryan was under contract with the division to serve as an independent medical review officer in such circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\"> Persons hired as permanent intermittent fire fighters by a municipality are placed on a separate reserve waiting list and hired, when job openings appear, before the city consults the full civil service list.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\"> The January 1, 1988, trigger date was later amended.

The NFPA 1582 Standard explains that \u201c[h]earing aid use is <em>not </em>considered a reasonable accommodation . . .\u201d (emphasis in original). Among several reasons the NFPA 1582 Standard cites for justification are the following: \u201cHearing aids are not calibrated to function in areas of high background noise (fire scene, rescue scene, traffic), during radio transmissions, [and] are not reliable after submersion or heavy exposure to water.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\"> The legislative oversight is not simply theoretical. \u201cThe Legislature does not ordinarily display this level of interest in administrative regulations.

If the standards were not updated over time to reflect improvements in hearing aid technology, changes in fire fighting functions, or a shifting consensus on the safety of the use of hearing aid devices, they might, at some point, no longer satisfy the basic standard of rationality. See <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309, 330 (2003) (\u201cAny law failing to satisfy the basic standards of rationality is void\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\"> This case does not require the court to decide whether, or when, an employer not covered by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61A, can categorically apply fitness standards to exclude potential employees. In such circumstances, blanket exclusions are generally disfavored. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 383-384 (1993) (\u201cIn most cases\u201d trial judge \u201cwill need to conduct an individualized inquiry\u201d to determine whether an individual is a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 [16]). See <em>School Bd. of Nassau County </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>480 U.S. 273, 287 (1987) (individualized consideration required \u201cin most cases\u201d claiming handicap discrimination under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973). The present case involves a discrete area \u2014 fitness standards for public safety employees \u2014 where the Legislature has fashioned a deliberate statutory scheme in \u00a7 61A. Upholding the application of \u00a7 61A to Carleton does not diminish the force of decisions such as the <em>Cox </em>case that, in general, discern a strong presumption in G. L. c. 151B against categorical exclusions from employment based on handicap.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b836-9\"> Carleton claims that only novice fire fighters, and not veterans, are subject to medical standards. From the record and the regulatory history of the division\u2019s standards, it appears that many veteran fire fighters are required to submit to an examination governed by substantially similar medical standards (including the hearing aid prohibition). While it is correct that fire fighters hired prior to November 1, 1996, are not required to submit to such examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>tians, the history of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61A, and the adopted regulations suggest that the exclusion of fire fighters hired before November 1, 1996, was a compromise made in order to secure the passage of the legislation and subsequent amendments. That such a compromise was necessary in order to usher in the medical standards does not undercut the necessity of the standards. This is certainly the case where all current fire fighters will eventually have been hired after the trigger date and will thus be subject to the same medical standards. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 16 (1977), quoting <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., </em>348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955) (\u201clegislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\"> Because we have concluded that Carleton\u2019s G.
