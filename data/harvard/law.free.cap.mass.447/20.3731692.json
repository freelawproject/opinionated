L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23 (act). Because the diminution of real estate values is not an injury to an interest that G. L. c. 40B was intended to protect, we conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">In 2002, the zoning board of appeals of the town of Andover (board) issued a comprehensive permit to Avalon at St. Clare, Inc. (developer), to construct a four-story apartment building, with one-quarter of the units to be reserved as affordable rental housing for low and moderate income tenants. The property at issue is located in an area of Andover zoned for single-family homes on one-acre lots. The plaintiffs, abutting and neighboring landowners, appealed to the Superior Court claiming they were \u201caggrieved\u201d by the board\u2019s decision. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court allowed the developer\u2019s, motion for summary judgment, ruling that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the issuance of the comprehensive permit because their claim that the affordable housing project would diminish their property values was \u201cnot a concern recognized by G. L. c. 40B,\u201d and therefore not an injury that could confer standing on the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The Appeals Court reversed, holding that diminution in real estate values is \u201can injury that is a tangible and particularized injury to a private property or legal interest protected by zoning law,\u201d which it held to be \u201ca valid basis for a claim of standing\u201d to challenge the issuance of a comprehensive permit under G. L. c. 40B. <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 341, 342 (2005) <em>(Standerwick). </em>It further concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 presumptive standing as abutters<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was not adequately challenged by evidence submitted by the developer in support of its motion for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 342-344. We granted the developer\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the decision of the Superior Court judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>As described more fully by the Appeals Court, <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 338-339, the developer seeks to construct a 115-unit four-story apartment building on a 9.127-acre parcel at 460 River Road in Andover (site). Twenty-nine units of the building will be designated for low and moderate income housing. The site, which is enclosed by a ten-foot high masonry wall running parallel to three of the property\u2019s boundaries, is currently improved by a four-story brick building built in 1959, and is used as a residence for a religious community. The developer intends to retain the masonry wall but raze the existing building and construct a new building on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In October, 2001, after the board denied the developer\u2019s first application for a comprehensive permit to construct 152 units in eight buildings on the property, the developer appealed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>housing appeals committee (HAC) of the Department of Housing and Community Development, pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23. The developer, the board, and a local citizens\u2019 group known as \u201cProtect Andover Zoning\u201d (composed of the plaintiffs and others) then engaged in HAC-sponsored mediation, during which the developer agreed to reduce the scope of its original proposal to 115 units in a single, four-story building, subject to certain other conditions. The HAC remanded the case to the board for further consideration. After additional public hearings, the board approved the comprehensive permit at issue in May, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The plaintiffs commenced this action in June, 2002, claiming that as abutters and neighbors of the proposed development, they were \u201caggrieved\u201d by the issuance of the comprehensive permit. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response to the developer\u2019s discovery, the plaintiffs identified the following as the adverse impacts of the proposed housing development on them: light and noise pollution, traffic and related safety concerns, an increase in crime or vandalism, adverse drainage effects on septic systems, a decrease in the plaintiffs\u2019 privacy, and a diminution of their property values. Although requested to do so, the plaintiffs offered no expert opinion to support any of the claimed adverse impacts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In March, 2003, the developer filed a motion for summary judgment supported by affidavits on the issue of the plaintiffs\u2019 standing to challenge the comprehensive permit. In one, a civil engineer opined that the development would have no adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>impact on local water and sewer service,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that a new drainage system would adequately handle storm water drainage and run-off in conformance with State environmental standards. In a second affidavit, a traffic engineer stated that the development would not create unacceptable levels of service at various relevant intersections in the area and that development-generated traffic could be \u201cadequately and safely\u201d absorbed by local roads. With respect to other anticipated adverse impacts, the developer argued that the plaintiffs, who had conceded in their own responses to discovery that they had no evidence to support them, would not be able to prove their claims at trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In opposition to the developer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs submitted affidavits from two real estate professionals, each of whom claimed that the proposed development would diminish the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The developer moved to strike the affidavits on the ground that property value diminution cannot confer standing in a G. L. c. 40B case \u201cbecause preservation of property values is not within the scope of interests protected\u201d by G. L. c. 40B.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">A judge in the Superior Court allowed the developer\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tian for summary judgment, concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of light and noise pollution did not raise cognizable health and safety concerns but were \u201cpurely aesthetic\u201d; that the plaintiffs\u2019 traffic claims would not impact safety; and that their claim that drainage might raise health and safety issues was \u201cspeculative.\u201d He concluded that the developer had rebutted the plaintiffs\u2019 presumption of standing on the traffic and drainage issues by expert opinion and that the plaintiffs had proffered nothing to support their \u201capprehension and speculation\u201d that the proposed development would lead to an increase in crime or vandalism. As noted earlier, the judge ruled that the claim of diminution of real estate values could not serve as a basis for standing. The judge allowed the developer\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 real estate value affidavits, although his reason for doing so is not clear. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The Appeals Court held that whether a person is \u201caggrieved\u201d under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, is governed by the \u201csubstantive standards\u201d applicable to standing analysis under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, \u201csuch as property values, traffic, or parking,\u201d <em>Stander-wick, supra </em>at 340. This, it said, included the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that their property values would diminish if the proposed affordable housing development went forward.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Appeals Court further determined that, because of their presumptive standing as abutters, the plaintiffs had no burden to produce any evidence supporting their claims \u201cunless and until the defendants had offered evidence \u2018warranting a finding contrary to the presumed fact,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 342, quoting <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation Ass\u2019n, </em>421 Mass. 106, 111 (1995) <em>(Watros). </em>Concluding that reliance on the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to identify in discovery any evidence to support their claims of aggrievement did not constitute such \u201cevidence,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the court ruled that the developer had not come forward with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sufficient evidence to rebut this presumption of standing. <em>Id. </em>at 344-345 &amp; n.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">2. <em>Legally cognizable injury under G. L. c. 40B. </em>We first address the scope of the cognizable interests protected by G. L. c. 40B, and then turn to the issue of the plaintiffs\u2019 presumptive standing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The developer asserts that the Appeals Court erred in concluding that analysis of the injury that constitutes cognizable \u201caggrievement\u201d under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, is the same as the analysis for injury constituting \u201caggrievement\u201d cognizable under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. It next argues that, in any event, diminution in real estate values is not a legally cognizable injury for purposes of standing to challenge the issuance of a comprehensive permit. We agree with the developer that assertions of harm that confer standing as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under G. L. c. 40A are not necessarily cognizable as a basis for \u201caggrievement\u201d under G. L. c. 40B.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 21, provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by the issuance of a comprehensive permit or approval may appeal to the court as provided in [G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17].\u201d See note 3, <em>supra. </em>While the words \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d are not to be narrowly construed, <em>Marotta </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Revere, </em>336 Mass. 199, 204 (1957) <em>(Marotta), </em>the Legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u201cintentionally limited the class of parties with standing to challenge a comprehensive permit,\u201d and likely sought to avoid \u201cmanipulation of the comprehensive permitting process to thwart the construction of low and moderate income housing.\u201d <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham </em>v. <em>Hingham Campus, LLC, </em>438 Mass. 364, 370 (2003) <em>(Hingham Campus).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In reaching its conclusion that the \u201csubstantive standards\u201d applicable to standing requirements under G. L. c. 40B are the same as those applicable under G. L. c. 40A, <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 340, 342, the Appeals Court relied on this court\u2019s statement in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>429 Mass. 551, 553 (1999) <em>(Bell), </em>that the \u201csame standing requirements apply to appeals under G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c. 40B appeals.\u201d <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 340. In <em>Bell, </em>where it was the abutter plaintiff arguing that G. L. c. 40A was irrelevant to the analysis, we were not required to and did not examine the potential differences between legally cognizable injuries under the two statutes as a consequence of the differing interests the two land use schemes were intended to protect. <em>Bell, supra </em>at 554. Although analyzed using broad language concerning standing under G. L. c. 40A, the plaintiff in that comprehensive permit case did not satisfy the standing requirement of a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under G. L. c. 40A, <em>id., </em>and it was therefore not necessary for the court to consider whether a plaintiff who <em>could </em>satisfy G. L. c. 40A standing requirements would automatically be a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 40B.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Both G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c. 40B use the term \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d; it is this term that we interpret in like manner. See <em>Hingham Campus, supra </em>at 368 (\u201cFor purposes of interpreting the term \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 under the comprehensive permit statute, we look to interpretation of the identical term in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17\u201d). Specifically, a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d as that term is used in both statutes must assert \u201ca plausible claim of a definite violation of a private right, a private property interest, or a private legal interest.\u201d <em>Harvard Sq. Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Cambridge, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 493 (1989). See <em>Barvenik </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 130-132 (1992) <em>(Barvenik). </em>Of particular importance, the right or interest asserted must be one that the statute under which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>plaintiff claims aggrievement intends to protect. See <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Lnc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 431 (1949). Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, <em>Bell </em>does not stand for the proposition that allegations of injury that may establish a claim of \u201caggrievement\u201d under G. L. c. 40A automatically establish \u201caggrievement\u201d under G. L. c. 40B. See <em>Hingham Campus, supra </em>at 367 (it is \u201cinappropriate to rely\u201d on G. L. c. 40A to establish standing where permit was issued pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, and \u201cwe should not look to the more general statutory scheme of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, to determine standing\u201d under G. L. c. 40B).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The interests protected by G. L. c. 40B differ from, and in some respects are inconsistent with, those protected by G. L. c. 40A. Compare <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Medford, </em>273 Mass. 97, 104 (1930) (purpose of zoning law is \u201cto stabilize property uses in the specified districts in the interests of the public health and safety and the general welfare, and not to permit changes, exceptions or relaxations except after such full notice as shall enable all those interested to know what is projected and to have opportunity to protest\u201d); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 476 (1986) (abutters in single-family, one-acre zoning district had standing to challenge G. L. c. 40A special permit because of \u201clegitimate interest in preserving the integrity of the district from the intrusion of multi-family housing\u201d), with <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, </em>436 Mass. 811, 822 (2002) (comprehensive permit process under G. L. c. 40B designed to override local opposition to low income housing). The reference in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, must be construed in a manner that effectuates the intent of the act. Although the Legislature chose in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, to incorporate the judicial review procedure established in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, the substantive standing requirements of G. L. c. 40A are neither the same as nor incorporated into G. L. c. 40B.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We next consider whether diminished real estate values constitute a basis for standing to challenge the issuance of a comprehensive permit. We have long recognized that the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, is \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>provide relief from exclusionary zoning practices which prevented the construction of badly needed low and moderate income housing\u201d in the Commonwealth. <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 354 (1973). See generally <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, supra </em>at 820-824. The statute reflects the Legislature\u2019s considered judgment that a crisis in housing for low and moderate income people demands a legislative scheme that requires the local interests of a town to yield to the regional need for the construction of low and moderate income housing, particularly in suburban areas. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 23. See also <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, supra </em>at 814-815; <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 354-355. As we described in these and other cases, to effectuate this purpose the act establishes a streamlined comprehensive permitting procedure, <em>Hingham Campus, supra </em>at 370, permitting a developer to file a single application to the local zoning board of appeals for construction of low or moderate income housing. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. In cities and towns that have not met the minimum statutory threshold of affordable housing,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a developer may override bulk, height, dimensional, use, and other limitations, often invoked as a pretext to exclude affordable housing. See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 354. See also Krefetz, The Impact and Evolution of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Permit and Zoning Appeals Act, 22 W. New Eng. L. Rev. 381, 386-387 (2001). In addition to streamlining the permitting process itself, the clear intent of the Legislature was to promote affordable housing by minimizing lengthy and expensive delays occasioned by court battles commenced by those seeking to exclude affordable housing from their own neighborhoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>In light of these oft-repeated objectives, we have no hesitation in concluding that granting standing to challenge the issuance of a comprehensive permit under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, to those who claim a diminution in the value of their property frustrates the intent of the Legislature. It is also inconsistent with our long-standing jurisprudence that standing to challenge a zoning decision is conferred only on those who can plausibly demonstrate that a proposed project will injure their own personal legal interests <em>and </em>that the injury is to a specific interest that the applicable zoning statute, ordinance, or bylaw at issue is intended to protect. See <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 431 (1949) (\u201cwe must inquire what peculiar legal rights were intended to be given to the plaintiff by the statute permitting an appeal\u201d). See also <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 293 (1977) (party has standing when alleging \u201cinjury within the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme under which the injurious action has occurred\u201d); B.C. Levey, Massachusetts Zoning and Land Use Law \u00a7 5-26(b) (1996 &amp; Supp. 1998) (plaintiff must show that proposed project \u201cwill injure his legal or property interests <em>and </em>that the injury is to an interest the zoning law was intended to protect\u201d); Healy, Judicial Review of Variance and Special Permits, 1 Massachusetts Zoning Manual \u00a7 11.5.2 (b), at 11-39 (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. 2000 &amp; Supp. 2002) (to be \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s injury \u201cmust relate to a cognizable interest protected by the zoning provisions at issue\u201d). Accordingly, we look to the interest protected by G. L. c. 40B, namely, the expansion of affordable housing throughout the Commonwealth, to resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The preservation of real estate values of property abutting an affordable housing development is clearly not a concern that the G. L. c. 40B regulatory scheme is intended to protect. As the developer points out, such a result is antithetical to the purposes of G. L. c. 40B, which seeks to provide critically needed affordable housing throughout the Commonwealth. It would grant standing to challenge a comprehensive permit to persons who object to the construction of any affordable housing project simply by claims that the introduction of affordable housing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>low and moderate income persons would cause their property values to drop. Rather, the interest in the provision of critically needed affordable housing must be balanced against the statutorily authorized interests in the protection of the safety and health of the town\u2019s residents, development of improved site and building design, and preservation of open space. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In concluding that diminution in real estate values \u201cis an injury that is a tangible and particularized injury to a private property or legal interest protected by zoning law,\u201d <em>Stander-wick, supra </em>at 341, the Appeals Court relied on <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 55, 59 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>415 Mass. 329 (1993). <em>Tsagronis </em>was decided under G. L. c. 40A, and we have already recognized that G. L. c. 40A and c. 40B are separate and distinct statutory schemes. In any event, the ruling in that case is not as sweeping as the plaintiffs posit. The plaintiff-abutters in that case appealed from the issuance of a variance under G. L. c. 40A, claiming that construction of a house on a neighboring nonconforming lot would partially obstruct their water view, thereby diminishing the value of their property. The trial judge found that the plaintiffs were aggrieved persons under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, and this court concluded that the judge was warranted in so finding. <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, </em>415 Mass. 329, 330 n.4 (1993). <em>Tsagronis </em>is consistent with our determination in this case. The plaintiffs identified an injury personal to them: the diminution in value of their property. The attendant legal interest that the zoning scheme at issue protected was the interest in \u201cpreventing further construction in a district in which the existing development is already more dense than the applicable zoning regulations allow.\u201d <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, supra </em>at 58-59, citing <em>DiCicco </em>v. <em>Berwick, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 312, 315 (1989). It was the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the issuance of the variance adversely impacted them directly <em>and </em>that their injury related to a cognizable interest protected by the applicable zoning law \u2014 the interest in preserving a certain level of density in the zoning district \u2014 that conferred standing on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">A claim of diminution of property values must be derivative of or related to cognizable interests protected by the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>zoning scheme. See <em>Tranfaglia </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Winchester, </em>306 Mass. 495, 503-504 (1940) (zoning legislation \u201cis not designed for the preservation of the economic value of property, except in so far as that end is served by making the community a safe and healthy place in which to live\u201d). To untether a claimed diminution in real estate values from an interest the zoning scheme seeks to protect would permit any abutter who claims that any change in property use would diminish the value of property to obtain standing to challenge a zoning decision. A developer may conclusively demonstrate, for example, that an increase of traffic will not adversely impact plaintiffs or their property such that plaintiffs are unable to establish a traffic-related \u201caggrievement.\u201d The developer did so in this case. But a real estate appraiser may then opine that the increase in traffic will nevertheless cause a property to diminish in value, as the plaintiffs\u2019 real estate appraiser did in this case. To confer standing in such circumstances would permit any plaintiff to make an \u201cend run\u201d around the rigorous standing requirements we have consistently recognized. See <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">3. <em>Rebuttable presumption of standing. </em>We turn now to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 other asserted grounds of standing. See note 9, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. The case is before us on further appellate review of a grant of summary judgment and we therefore view the material evidence in its light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). The moving party, here the developer, may satisfy its burden of demonstrating the absence of triable issues, <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 16-17 (1989), by establishing that the plaintiffs will not be able to prove an essential element of their case. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>As abutters, the plaintiffs are entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d under the act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 721 (1996); <em>Watros, supra </em>at 110-111; <em>Marotta, supra </em>at 204. This presumption originates in our jurisprudence concerning G. L. c. 40A, see <em>Marotta, supra, </em>but its reasoning \u2014 that those entitled to notice of the proceedings are presumed to have the requisite interest \u2014 applies with equal force in the context of challenges to comprehensive permits issued pursuant to G. L. c. 40B. Once the presumption is rebutted, the burden rests with the plaintiff to prove standing, which requires that the plaintiff \u201cestablish \u2014 by direct facts and not by speculative personal opinion \u2014 that his injury is special and different from the concerns of the rest of the community.\u201d <em>Barvenik, supra </em>at 132. The developer argues that the Appeals Court misconstrued the evidence required to rebut the presumption of standing. We agree.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Once a defendant \u201cchallenges the plaintiff\u2019s standing and offers evidence to support the challenge ... the jurisdictional issue is to be decided on the basis of the evidence with no benefit to the plaintiff from the presumption.\u201d <em>Barvenik, supra </em>at 131. See <em>Marotta, supra </em>(\u201cIf the issue [of standing] is contested, and any additional evidence is offered, the point of jurisdiction will be determined on all the evidence with no benefit to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>plaintiffs from the presumption as such\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We have explained that to rebut the presumption, the defendant must offer evidence \u201cwarranting a finding contrary to the presumed fact.\u201d <em>Marinetti </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stoughton, </em>440 Mass. 255, 258 (2003). See <em>Watros, supra </em>at 111 (presumption \u201crecedes when a defendant challenges a plaintiff\u2019s status as an aggrieved person <em>and offers evidence supporting his or her </em>challenge\u201d; presumption \u201cis destroyed upon the defendant\u2019s offer of evidence warranting a finding contrary to the presumed fact\u201d). Compare <em>Clifford </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>204 Mass. 358, 361 (1910) (on introduction of evidence that \u201ctends-to control\u201d presumed fact, \u201cthe case is to be determined upon the whole evidence\u201d) with <em>Scaltreto </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>352 Mass. 62, 64 (1967) (rebuttable presumption \u201ccontinues only until evidence has been introduced which would warrant a finding contrary to the presumed fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">A presumption does not shift the burden of proof; it is a rule of evidence that aids the party bearing the burden of proof in sustaining that burden by \u201cthrow[ing] upon his adversary the burden of going forward with evidence.\u201d <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>317 Mass. 297, 302 (1944). See <em>Thornes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store, Inc., </em>268 Mass. 587, 589 (1929) (presumption is not evidence but rule of evidence that \u201cdisappears when the facts are shown\u201d); <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Bay State St. Ry., </em>230 Mass. 370, 378 (1918), quoting <em>Mobile, Jackson &amp; Kan. City R.R. </em>v. <em>Turnip-seed, </em>219 U.S. 35, 43 (1910) (presumption \u201cstands only until the facts are shown\u201d and \u201ccast[s] upon\u201d defendant \u201cthe duty of producing some evidence to the contrary\u201d); <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Whicher, </em>179 Mass. 276, 277-278 (1901) (burden of going forward with evidence to rebut presumption does not change burden of proof).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2487 (c), (d) (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2491 at 304-305. Thus, an abutter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>is presumed to have standing until the defendant comes forward with evidence to contradict that presumption. Our conclusion that this evidence must \u201cwarrant a finding contrary to the presumed fact\u201d does not shift the burden of proof on the issue of standing to the defendant. See <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Whicher, supra. </em>See also <em>Perley </em>v. <em>Perley, </em>144 Mass. 104, 107-108 (1887) (if presumed fact is \u201cmet and encountered\u201d by defendant\u2019s contrary evidence, burden of proof remains with plaintiff and is \u201cnot for the defendant to show that [the presumed fact] does not exist\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In a summary judgment context, a defendant is not required to present affirmative evidence that refutes a plaintiff\u2019s basis for standing. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 714 (1991), citing <em>Celotex Corp. </em>v. <em>Catrett, All </em>U.S. 317, 328 (1986) (material supporting motion for summary judgment \u201cneed not negate, that is, disprove, an essential element of the claim of the party on whom the burden of proof at trial will rest\u201d but \u201cmust demonstrate that proof of that element at trial is unlikely to be forthcoming\u201d). It is enough that the moving party \u201cdemonstrate[], by reference to material described in Mass. R. Civ. R 56 (c), unmet by countervailing materials, that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving\u201d a legally cognizable injury. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra </em>at 716. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974) (summary judgment granted on pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, responses to requests for admission, or affidavits). In this case, the developer presented evidence sufficient to warrant a finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of aggrievement did not confer standing on them under the act, as we now explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">First, through unchallenged affidavits of its experts, the developer established that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of traffic and drainage problems were unfounded. The developer was not required to support its motion for summary judgment with affidavits on each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claimed sources of standing; its reliance on the plaintiffs\u2019 lack of evidence as to the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>claims, obtained through discovery, had equal force. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>429 Mass. 551, 554 (1999) (defendants rebutted plaintiff\u2019s presumption of standing where plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony \u201cfailed to show that the proposed project will impair any interests of the [plaintiff] that are protected by the zoning law\u201d); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 622 (1993) (deponents\u2019 inability to \u201carticulate whether or how the plaintiffs would be injured\u201d were not conclusive but caused presumption of standing \u201cto recede\u201d). Cf. <em>Watros, supra </em>at 108 <em>(defendant\u2019s </em>denials and affirmative defenses insufficient to make presumption of standing recede); <em>Valcourt </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Swansea, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 124, 128 (1999) (defendants\u2019 answer to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and memoranda of law opposing plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment did not qualify as evidence supporting challenge to plaintiffs\u2019 presumptive standing). Through discovery of the plaintiffs, the developer demonstrated that the plaintiffs had no factual basis for their claims of increased crime or vandalism. The judge, in his discretion, determined that this concern was \u201cbeyond the scope of common knowledge, experience and understanding\u201d and that expert evidence was therefore necessary to establish aggrievement. See <em>Barvenik, supra </em>at 137 n.13. Because the plaintiffs offered no expert evidence to support their concerns that crime or vandalism would increase, their responses to discovery were, as the judge found, nothing more than unsupported \u201capprehension and speculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In the context of a challenge to a comprehensive permit issued in G. L. c. 40B, a contrary ruling would place unnecessary and potentially onerous financial burdens on every developer. The construction of multiple-unit housing complexes, which frequently comprise the developments at issue under G. L. c. 40B proceedings, in rural, semi-rural, or suburban areas zoned for single-family use will necessarily increase the population of a community. Every increase in population gives rise to a host of potential consequences \u2014 for example, an increase in the likelihood of contagious diseases, an increase of noise from passing automobiles, or an increase in vandalism. When the persons challenging a permit concede that they have nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>more than unfounded speculation to support their claims of injury, our law does not require that a developer come forward with expert evidence to challenge every such speculative injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">It is not sufficient for a defendant simply to file a motion for summary judgment, or to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. But the developer may rebut a presumption of standing by seeking to discover from such plaintiffs the actual basis of their claims of aggrievement. If a person claiming to be aggrieved can point to no such evidence, a party seeking summary judgment is entitled to rely on that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Once the developer in this case rebutted the plaintiffs\u2019 presumption of standing, the plaintiffs were required to, but did not, meet their burden to establish standing. The plaintiffs relied solely on two affidavits supporting their claim of a potential decrease in real estate values, a concern not protected by G. L. c. 40B. Cf. <em>Denneny </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Seekonk, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 208, 213-214 (2003) (plaintiff did not have standing after defendant rebutted plaintiff\u2019s presumptive standing, and plaintiff offered no evidence in response, other than her own \u201cspeculative and conclusory\u201d testimony). The developer successfully established that the plaintiffs had no reasonable likelihood of proving they were \u201caggrieved\u201d persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-11\">General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 21, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person aggrieved by the issuance of a comprehensive permit or approval may appeal to the court as provided in [G.

See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11; <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation Ass\u2019n, </em>421 Mass. 106, 110-111 (1995).

A licensed real estate sales person, Clarke stated that the proposed development \u201cwill devalue my property by as much as 20%\u201d pointing to \u201clocation, density, traffic, and the impact of non-conforming uses and structures which may impact property value.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 second affidavit was from a certified real estate appraiser who stated that the property of the \u201cimmediate\u201d abutters would suffer a 20% diminution in value because the proposed structure would \u201cbe substantially greater in height\u201d than permitted under current zoning, the development would \u201csignificantly increase area traffic,\u201d and a \u201ctrash compactor\u201d proposed for the rear of the site would \u201caffect\u201d the view of the site\u2019s \u201cimmediate\u201d abutters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b50-10\">The developer also argued that the two affidavits should be struck because they did not disclose facts on which the opinions were based, lacked a basis in any reliable methodology, and were not admissible as expert opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\"> As to the plaintiffs\u2019 other claims of aggrievement, the Appeals Court declined to address \u201cthe merits or viability of all of the bases on which the plaintiffs claim[ed] standing\u201d because, it concluded, the plaintiffs had \u201cat least one valid basis, the claim that their property values would diminish,\u201d sufficient to confer standing. <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 345 n.16 (2005) (Standerwick).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\"> The Appeals Court explained that, in its view, it is not enough for a defendant \u201cmerely to dispute the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of standing and to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the plaintiffs have no evidence to support their position.\u201d <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 342. In so doing, the Appeals Court addressed <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 619 (1993) <em>{Cohen), </em>by stating: \u201cWe can no longer say, as we did in <em>[Cohen, </em>supra] at 621, that the filing of a motion for summary judgment constitutes a \u2018challenge\u2019 sufficient to make the statutory presumption recede, and requires the plaintiffs to come forward with \u2018specific facts\u2019 to support their assertion of status as aggrieved persons, as would be required under <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).\u201d <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 343-344.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\">On appeal, the plaintiffs press two arguments, which we need not address: (1) the judge erred in striking the two affidavits from the real estate professionals submitted by the plaintiffs in opposition to the developer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, see notes 10 and 11, <em>supra-, </em>and (2) the failure of the board to make findings of fact supporting the issuance of the comprehensive permit establishes that material questions of fact exist that precluded summary judgment. We need not address the first issue because, as we shall explain, diminution of real estate values cannot be the basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 standing in this G. L. c. 40B case. See discussion, <em>infra. </em>We do not address the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 second argument because we affirm the judge\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the issuance of the comprehensive permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b55-5\"> A need for affordable housing exists where fewer than ten per cent of the housing units in a city or town qualify as low or moderate income housing.

Relying on <em>Harvard Sq. Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Cambridge, </em>27 Mass.
