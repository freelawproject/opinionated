Clemmey (Clemmey). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The indictments charged the defendants with violations of the Wetlands Protection Act, G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40 (Act), in connection with tree clearing and landfilling activities undertaken by Clemmey on portions of the property owned by the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The defendants moved to dismiss the indictments in the Superior Court on two separate grounds: first, that the Commonwealth had impaired the integrity of the grand jury proceedings; and second, that the Legislature had unconstitutionally delegated to the executive branch the responsibility for defining (by regulation) the criminal offenses punishable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">With respect to the first ground, the defendants argued that the proceedings were impaired because the Commonwealth had failed to inform the jurors that (1) the Act contained an exemption from its provisions for the \u201cnormal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural use\u201d; (2) Clemmey had expressed his belief that the trust property qualified for this exemption, and had acted accordingly; (3) Clemmey had received a certificate from the town of Mansfield to operate a horse farm on the property; and (4) Clemmey had entered into a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) land user-district cooperative agreement identifying the property as a farm. They also argued that the Commonwealth had exacerbated its failure by (1) introducing evidence that Clemmey was well versed in the governing statutes and regulations, leaving the impression that the land clearly fell within the scope of the Act, that Clemmey knew this to be the case, and that he nevertheless intentionally violated the Act\u2019s provisions; and (2) improperly eliciting evidence of prior or irrelevant bad acts committed by Clemmey and others associated with the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">As to the second ground, the defendants argued that the separation of powers clause contained in art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights barred the Legislature from delegating to the Department of Environmental Protection (department) the authority to define the terms of the exemption (\u201cnormal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural use\u201d) by regulation, and that the resulting regulations should be struck as unconstitutional. Once struck, the defendants contended, the statutory language, \u201cnormal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural use,\u201d was unconstitutionally vague as applied to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>After a nonevidentiary hearing, a judge in the Superior Court dismissed the indictments without prejudice, on the ground that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to inform the grand jury that the Act \u201ccontains an agricultural exemption, which specifically exempts from both its civil and criminal prohibitions any and all \u2018work performed for normal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural use,\u2019 \u201d and that Clemmey believed \u201cthis exemption applied to his conduct,\u201d \u201cundermine[d] the credibility of the evidence and is likely to have affected their decision to indict.\u201d Noting that \u201c[t]he prosecutor should have presented this information to the grand jury to allow them to consider the possibility of [Clemmey\u2019s] lack of intent to violate the Act as well as the defense of the agricultural exemption,\u201d the judge concluded that the appropriate remedy was dismissal. In light of his ruling, the judge did not reach the defendants\u2019 unlawful delegation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The Commonwealth appealed, and we transferred the cases to this court on our own motion. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to inform the grand jury of the Act\u2019s agricultural exemption and Clemmey\u2019s claimed reliance on it did not impair the grand jury proceedings. Similarly, the elicitation of evidence regarding prior or irrelevant bad acts did not have a significant effect on the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict. We further conclude that the Legislature\u2019s delegation of authority to the department to promulgate definitional regulations regarding the statutory exemption was sufficiently limited and directed to withstand a constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">1. <em>The governing Act and regulations. </em>General Laws c. 131, \u00a7 40, provides for the protection of flood plains, seacoasts, and other wetlands. It states that \u201c[n]o person shall remove, fill, dredge or alter any bank, riverfront area, freshwater wetland, coastal wetland ... or swamp bordering on the ocean or on any estuary, creek, river, stream, pond, or lake, or any land under said waters . . . without filing written notice of his intention to so remove, fill, dredge or alter . . . and without receiving and complying with an order of conditions . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>The notice of intention is filed with the local conservation commission, which can either grant or deny the request, or condition the work on certain stipulations for the protection of, inter alla, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>wetlands. The Act punishes those who violate its provisions with either criminal penalties \u2014 \u201ca fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both such fine and imprisonment\u201d \u2014 or \u201ca civil penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars for each violation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The provisions of the Act do not apply to \u201cwork performed for normal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As originally enacted, \u201c[l]and used for agricultural purposes shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.\u201d St. 1967, c. 802, \u00a7 1. The language has been amended several times. In 1972, the exemption applied to \u201cwork performed for agricultural purposes,\u201d St. 1972, c. 784, \u00a7 1; in 1974, it was rewritten to read, \u201cto work performed for normal maintenance or improvement of lands for agricultural use,\u201d St. 1974, c. 818, \u00a7 1; in 1975, \u201cin\u201d replaced \u201cfor\u201d preceding the phrase \u201cagricultural use.\u201d St. 1975, c. 363, \u00a7 2. In 1991, the Legislature further amended the Act by adding the following paragraph: \u201cWithin [120] days ... the department, upon the advice and consent of the Commissioner of the Department of Food and Agriculture, shall promulgate rules and regulations . . . which shall establish definitions for the term \u2018normal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural, or in aquacultural use\u2019, for each agricultural commodity, or where appropriate because of similarities in cultural practices, groups or commodities in the Commonwealth.\u201d St. 1991, c. 141, \u00a7 2. The amendment also provided that the department \u201cshall create a farmland advisory board to be appointed by the commissioner consisting of five persons one a member of the cooperative extension service, one a member of the USDA soil conservation service, one a member of a municipal conservation commission who has demonstrated expertise in agricultural issues, and two commercial farmers with expertise in different agricultural commodities to assist the department in the drafting of rules and regulations pursuant to this paragraph.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Legislature required the department to submit its promulgated regulations to the committee on natural resources and agriculture for its review prior to their effective date. St. 1991, c. 141, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In enacting the 1991 amendment, the Legislature explained the original purpose of the exemption, the interpretive and enforcement issues that had frustrated that purpose and made amendment necessary, and how the amendment was intended to further that purpose. The exemption was necessary to balance the need to protect wetlands and other fragile habitats with the \u201cfuture economic viability of . . . farms [in the Commonwealth].\u201d St. 1991, c. 141, \u00a7 1. Those farmers, however, \u201care faced with a growing morass of regulation and restriction which is increasing the cost of farming.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the Act had exempted \u201c \u2018work performed for normal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural use[,\u2019] many routine and long standing farm operations [were] being challenged by local and state agencies, creating confusion, frustration and . . . costly delays.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to correct this problem, the Legislature directed that \u201ca uniform definition\u201d be established \u201cto assist the agricultural community in complying with the [Act] and reducing the current uncertainty that exists.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Pursuant to the Legislature\u2019s statutory command, the department promulgated regulations defining the terms \u201c[l]and in agricultural use,\u201d \u201c[njormal maintenance of land in agricultural use,\u201d and \u201c[n]ormal improvement of land in agricultural use.\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04 (1997). Those regulations provide that \u201c[l]and in agricultural use means land within resource areas [wetlands] or the Buffer Zone <em>presently </em>and primarily used in producing or raising one or more of the following agricultural commodities for commercial purposes: 1. animals, including but not limited to livestock, poultry, and bees . . .\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>They also provide that \u201cland in agricultural use\u201d means \u201cland . . . <em>presently </em>and primarily used in a manner related to, and customarily and necessarily used in, producing or raising such commodities, including but not limited to: existing access roads and livestock crossings; . . . canals/channels; . . . and land under farm structures\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>Of particular significance to the present case, \u201c[l]and in agricultural use may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>lie inactive for up to five consecutive years.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The regulatory definitions of \u201c[n]ormal maintenance\u201d and \u201c[njormal improvement\u201d of land in agricultural use describe in detail the type of work considered \u201cnormal\u201d and explain on what land and structures such work is acceptable under the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">2. <em>Background. </em>The record before the Superior Court judge, which included a transcript of the grand jury proceedings, reflect the following. The trust is an organization with which several members of the Clemmey family are affiliated. In or about September, 2000, the trust purchased property located at 175 Essex Street in Mansfield from other, more distant members of the family. The property encompasses a significant amount of wetlands, fields, a farmhouse, a bam, and various other outbuildings common to farms. The property was once used for farming but the land had not actually been used for that purpose for at least ten years prior to its purchase by the trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After its purchase, the property was, at least informally, named \u201cClemmey Farm,\u201d and in November, 2001, Clemmey, who is a member of the Massachusetts Farm Bureau Federation, Inc., and owns a number of horses in various locations in Mansfield, successfully applied for a Mansfield business certificate to operate a horse farm on the property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In October, 2001, Clemmey invited Richard Lewis, the administrator of the Mansfield conservation commission (commission), to tour the property, and explained to Lewis his long-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>term plan to turn the property into a horse farm. During that same month, Clemmey hired a land clearing company to cut and clear trees, plants, and shrubs on the property. In January, 2002, he also hired a landfilling company to fill much of the land, including wetlands, as soon as the clearing was completed. Although the land clearing company had done some preliminary work in October, 2001, a substantial portion of the tree cutting and clearing, and the subsequent landfilling, was performed in late February and mid March, 2002. In all, approximately 5.8 acres of wetlands were clear cut and filled.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In February, 2002, the town and the commission began receiving complaints regarding the heavy construction activity taking place on Clemmey Farm. In turn, Lewis contacted Edward Burke, a member of a department team that investigates complaints of illegal wetlands filling. On March 12, 2002, Burke and Lewis met with Clemmey, Clemmey\u2019s wife (Carole), Clemmey\u2019s son (Dan), and a representative from the Massachusetts Farm Bureau (Jay Slattery) at the property. According to Lewis\u2019s grand jury testimony, the meeting began in the farmhouse, where Clemmey told them that \u201cwhat he wanted to do with his property was to establish a horse farm.\u201d Lewis also testified that he \u201cdid not see any evidence of farming activities during the March 12 visit\u201d and that during his prior October, 2001, visit, \u201cthere [were] no feed bags present\u201d and \u201cno animals present. There [were] no . . . signs of any farming activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The group then began a walking tour of the property. Lewis testified that this tour revealed significant clearcutting and land-filling of wetlands and wetland buffer zones that had occurred since his October, 2001, visit to the property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, he told Burke, Clemmey, and Dan Clemmey that there had been direct filling of a wetland resource area and that this was a significant problem. In response, Dan Clemmey stated that the Clemmeys \u201ccould have filled the whole fucking thing and dealt with it later\u201d and that if Lewis \u201ctum[s] this into a problem, there\u2019s going to be other things raised and it\u2019s going to be a problem\u201d for Lewis. As to the former statement, Lewis noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>that \u201c[h]aving had a vast amount of experiences with [Dan] Clemmey before, that statement did not shock me.\u201d As to the latter statement, Lewis explained that he took it \u201cto be something of a threat\u201d and \u201cdid not allow myself to be alone with either . . . Clemmey or Dan Clemmey\u201d thereafter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lewis further testified that, once back at the farmhouse, Burke told Clemmey that \u201cunpermitted wetland activity . . . had occurred on the property,\u201d that no more activity should take place, and that Clemmey should hire a wetlands consultant to determine how much damage had been done on the property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When the prosecutor asked what Clemmey\u2019s response to this was, Lewis explained that he did not \u201cremember [Clemmey\u2019s] exact statement,\u201d but that the members of the Clemmey family \u201cacknowledged that filling had taken place\u201d and that Clemmey agreed to hire a consultant.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Subsequently, Clemmey hired wetland consultant Michael Marcus. According to an interview of Marcus conducted by an environmental police officer prior to the presentment of the case to the grand jury, Clemmey told Marcus that \u201che was going to create a horse farm and thought he had the right to clear and grade [fill] the property because of an agricultural exemption [to the Act].\u201d This information was never presented by the prosecutor to the grand jury. However, the grand jury did hear testimony (from Burke) that Marcus toured the property with Burke, Lewis, and Dan Clemmey on March 27, 2002, and that during this visit, Marcus told Burke that the property was \u201ca horror show concerning the wetlands,\u201d that a major violation had occurred, and that it would \u201ctake awhile\u201d to determine how much damage had been done to the wetlands in light of the extensive alterations. They also heard testimony from Marcus that after five or six additional visits to the site to conduct testing and analysis, he determined that 5.8 acres of wetlands were filled, and submitted a wetlands restoration plan to Clemmey in July, 2002. The plan was \u201cprobably a hundred-and-fifty to two-hundred-thousand dollar . . . project,\u201d and Clemmey \u201cthought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>it was excessive\u201d and \u201casked [Marcus] not to submit the . . . plan\u201d to the department. The plan was not submitted, and this interaction ended Marcus\u2019s work for Clemmey.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Of particular relevance to the defendants\u2019 claim that improper evidence of bad acts was presented, the grand jury also heard the following testimony. Marcus testified that \u201cpart of [his] work is [to] work with a lot of people who violate wetlands, either unintentionally or intentionally, and it\u2019s the policy of our company that whenever we work with somebody who\u2019s violated wetland laws, they pay us in full before we begin work and that\u2019s what we did with\u201d Clemmey. Lewis testified that Clemmey had sought permits to perform work in wetlands or wetland buffer zones on four previous occasions, had once appealed a permit issued to an abutting landowner, and thus was \u201cextremely familiar\u201d with and \u201chas full knowledge of the Wetlands Act and regulations.\u201d He also testified that there were two other incidents in which Clemmey appeared to have violated the Act. In one (occurring after the cutting and filling at issue here), Lewis claimed that Clemmey, without a permit, \u201cfilled in probably about two-thirds of [an] isolated wetland area\u201d on another property. He added that \u201cafter [they] issued the cease and desist, he continued to do some additional work on the site.\u201d In the other incident, Lewis explained that Clemmey, in working on a parking lot, violated the conditions of the permit he received from the commission, and had to \u201cget a few things in conformance with the permit,\u201d but that he \u201ceventually got all those things squared away and completed the project.\u201d Lewis also made several oblique references to the \u201chistory\u201d between Clemmey and the town, leaving the impression that Clemmey had used and abused the permitting process a number of times before.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Finally, the grand jury heard Marcus, Burke, and Lewis each testify that, based on their experience and observations, wetlands had been altered and filled on the trust property in violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>3. <em>The integrity of the grand jury process. </em>The judge dismissed the indictments because the grand jury were not informed that the Act included an exemption for \u201cland in agricultural use\u201d and that Clemmey believed this exemption applied to his clearcutting and landfilling activities. The Commonwealth now asserts that the dismissal constituted reversible error because the prosecutor had no duty to introduce such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u201cAlthough generally the adequacy or competency of evidence before a grand jury is not a matter for judicial inquiry ... we will consider whether grand jury evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding of probable cause . . . and whether the defendant has shown that the integrity of the grand jury proceedings was impaired.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass. 615, 619-620 (1986), and cases cited. \u201cIn certain instances, the failure to disclose known information may impair the grand jury proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">While \u201c[pjrosecutors are not required in every instance to reveal all exculpatory evidence to a grand jury,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 150 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGahee, </em>393 Mass. 743, 746 (1985), they must present exculpatory evidence \u201cthat would greatly undermine either the credibility of an important witness or evidence likely to affect the grand jury\u2019s decision,\u201d as well as evidence the withholding of which would cause the presentation to be seriously tainted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>437 Mass. 33, 37 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 447 (1984). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>442 Mass. 135, 143 (2004) (\u201cwe require that prosecutors not \u2018distort the meaning\u2019 of the evidence that they present by withholding certain portions of it\u201d). If the defendant can show that the prosecutor omitted such exculpatory evidence and that the evidence withheld would likely have affected the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict, dismissal is warranted. Because there is no \u201csatisfactory, comprehensive statement of what conduct does, and what conduct does not, impair the integrity of the grand jury process,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, supra </em>at 620, we must deal with the conduct in question \u201ccase by case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In the instant case, Clemmey has not demonstrated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>integrity of the grand jury process was impaired. On the one hand, it is fair to assume that had the grand jury been made aware of the Act\u2019s exemption, and Clemmey\u2019s claim (made after the fact to his environmental consultant) that he thought he could clear and fill the trust\u2019s wetlands under that exemption, they may have viewed some of the evidence before them in a different light.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the other hand, the presentation of evidence regarding the exemption would merely have shifted some of the focus of the inquiry to whether the exemption applied. In those circumstances, the prosecutor would have appropriately relied on the regulatory definitions applicable to the exemption, and the straightforward evidence in his possession that the land had not been used for agricultural purposes for more than ten years, making the exemption inapplicable. We have not required a prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury that a person under investigation claimed a license or exemption, where subsequent investigation demonstrated the claim was invalid. Whether the question of the exemption\u2019s inapplicability (or invalidity) may appropriately reemerge at trial has little bearing on the prosecutor\u2019s obligation to present to the grand jury certain forms of exculpatory evidence (in his possession), the withholding of which would seriously taint or distort the proceedings. While the presentation of the evidence in question here may have altered the discussion and possibly the outcome of the grand jury proceeding, that is an insufficient basis on which to set aside an indictment. In the circumstances of this case, where the evidence in the prosecutor\u2019s possession was that the defendants\u2019 actions did not qualify for the exemption, we cannot say that the withheld evidence would have greatly undermined the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and likely affected the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. Garrity, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 353 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Trowbridge, 419 Mass. 750, 754 (1995) (\u201cAlthough the grand jury were not aware of the existence of the indemnity agreement on which the defendant purportedly relied in making the withdrawals [for which the Commonwealth was seeking to indict him], we conclude that the additional \u2018information would not have greatly undermined the credibility of evidence against the defendant, and would not have affected significantly the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict.\u2019 . . . [T]he agreement did not authorize the defendant to reimburse himself from the estate for the expenses he incurred on the . . . property\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bachman, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 757, 760-761 (1996) (where counsel did not assert exemption to statute criminalizing gun carrying, no new trial because \u201chad [the exemption] been asserted, [it] would have availed the defendant nothing because the defendant would not have been able to establish his entitlement to the exemption\u201d). The indictments should not, therefore, have been dismissed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Biasiucci, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (2004) (\u201cOur decision to uphold the indictment can rest on the simple ground that such exculpatory evidence as may be conceived to have existed was not weighty enough to constitute a substantial challenge to the demonstration of probable cause, and, if laid before the grand jury, would almost certainly have left unaltered the disposition to indict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>We also reject the contention that testimony concerning prior \u201cbad acts\u201d committed by Clemmey and his son (and testimony of a threatening statement made by Clemmey\u2019s son to Lewis) requires dismissal of the indictments. Although some of the testimony was probative of little more than a propensity to violate the Commonwealth\u2019s environmental laws (an improper objective), \u201cthe defendant has not proved that the . . . statements, viewed in the context of all the evidence presented to the grand jury, \u2018probably made a difference\u2019 in their decision to indict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>407 Mass. 279, 283 (1990), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass. 615, 621-622 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Clemmey takes specific exception to Lewis\u2019s testimony that Clemmey \u201cviolated\u201d the order of conditions in another project in which a permit for filling a piece of property to create a parking lot was approved, but soon thereafter Lewis \u201chad to go down to the site, [and] issue[] a stop work order\u201d; that Clemmey recently \u201cwent in and cut down every tree on [a 7,800 square foot] property [and] filled in probably about two-thirds\u201d of this isolated wetlands area despite being denied a permit to do so; that Clemmey\u2019s son (in the presence of Clemmey) threatened Lewis; and that Clemmey had a long history of wetlands violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Assuming that the presentation of some (or even most) of this evidence to the grand jury was either improper or irrelevant, the \u201cpresence of adequate direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of the crimes renders insignificant any arguably improper information contained in the . . . testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 283. Multiple witnesses (experts in the field) testified before the grand jury that Clemmey had engaged in cutting and filling activities on land protected by the Act. In the face of such evidence, evidence of other improper acts (even similar in nature) cannot be considered to have affected the grand jury\u2019s ultimate conclusion. There is little chance that the grand jury could have been led to indict Clemmey on the basis of an apparent propensity to commit such crimes, rather than on the direct and overwhelming evidence that he had done so on the Clemmey farm. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 175, cert. denied, 525 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>1007 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 284 (\u201c \u2018Cases in which we have dismissed indictments usually have involved improper statements made by the <em>sole </em>witness to appear before the grand jury.\u2019... In this case, there were multiple witnesses before the grand jury and the cumulative evidence against [the accused] was powerful\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 198, 199 (1987) (prosecutor\u2019s statements to grand jury that accused was \u201cfive feet tall but... all muscle\u201d and that accused was \u201chot tempered and knows Karate so be careful and don\u2019t get him too mad\u201d were improper but did not impair integrity of grand jury); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>399 Mass. 80, 84 (1987) (defendant \u201chas not shown that presentation of information that he and others had been suspected of previous attacks on inmates was likely to have made a difference in the grand jury\u2019s determination to indict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">4. <em>Nondelegation doctrine. </em>Despite our conclusion that the judge erred in dismissing the indictments based on a perceived impairment of the integrity of the grand jury process, we may affirm his decision on any ground supported by the record. To this end, Clemmey argues, as he did below, that the Legislature\u2019s delegation to the department of the power and responsibility for defining material terms of the agricultural exemption violated the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Article 30 provides that \u201c[i]n the government of this commonwealth, the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them: the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end that it may be a government of laws and not of men.\u201d This doctrine \u201cencompasses the general principle that the Legislature cannot delegate the power to make laws.\u201d <em>Construction Indus, of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>406 Mass. 162, 171 (1989). However, \u201cseparation of powers does not require three \u2018watertight compartments\u2019 within the government.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>372 Mass. 883, 892 (1977). In fact, \u201can absolute division of the three general types of functions is neither possible nor always desirable.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>365 Mass. 639, 641 (1974). The question whether a specific delegation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>power violates the Constitution is a \u201cquestion of degree.\u201d <em>Construction Indus, of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., supra </em>at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">While \u201c[n]o formula exists for determining whether a delegation of legislative authority is \u2018proper\u2019 or not,\u201d <em>Chelmsford Trailer Park v. Chelmsford, </em>393 Mass. 186, 190 (1984) <em>(Chelmsford), </em>we have previously set forth three factors that bear on our determination: \u201c(1) Did the Legislature delegate the making of fundamental policy decisions, rather than just the implementation of legislatively determined policy; (2) does the act provide adequate direction for implementation, either in the form of statutory standards or, if the local authority is to develop the standards, sufficient guidance to enable it to do so; and (3) does the act provide safeguards such that abuses of discretion can be controlled?\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">At the outset, Clemmey contends that we should not apply these factors here, where the Legislature has delegated responsibility to define an exemption to a criminal statute. Specifically, he argues that the Legislature may never delegate the definition of criminal conduct. However, as early as 1914, we upheld a significant delegation by the Legislature to the police commissioner of Boston to define broadly the scope of an exception to what we described as \u201ca penal statute.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>218 Mass. 498, 499-500 &amp; n.* (1914) (commissioner may designate times and places in Boston \u201cwherein, and not elsewhere in the city, it shall be lawful . . . under such general rules as he shall make ... for any hawker ... to stop ... for the purpose of selling merchandise\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>326 Mass. 525, 527 (1950) (upholding delegation from Legislature to agency even though general rule that Legislature cannot delegate legislative authority \u201cis especially true with respect to [the] power to define crimes and establish penalties therefor\u201d). Accord <em>Avatar Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>State, </em>723 So. 2d 199, 205 (Fla. 1998), quoting <em>Ross-low </em>v. <em>State, </em>401 So. 2d 1107 (Fla. 1981) (explaining no delegation violation where statute \u201cgranted the Department of Citrus the authority to establish by administrative rule exemptions from a law making it a crime to sell and transport citrus fruit without a certificate of inspection\u201d). Notably, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>did not delegate to the department either the authority to establish new crimes and penalties regarding wetlands, or to exempt categories of activity from the coverage of the Act. The crimes of altering or filling of wetlands, and the exemption for \u201cwork performed for normal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural use\u201d were set forth directly in the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Nonetheless, unlike other penal statutes we have upheld against delegation challenges, the Act here provides for substantial penalties, including the deprivation of liberty. Such penalties implicate fundamental due process principles, such as the rule of lenity and the void-for-vagueness doctrine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., </em>430 Mass. 219, 227 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass. 178, 180 (1993) (\u201cDue process requires not only fair notice of proscribed conduct, but also that penal statutes be administered in a manner that prevents arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maxim, </em>429 Mass. 287, 292 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kwiatkowski, </em>418 Mass. 543, 547 (1994) (\u201cIt is a central tenet of our constitutional law that, as a matter of due process, a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden should be deemed void for vagueness\u201d). As such, our analysis of the delegation should include not only consideration of the factors set forth in <em>Chelmsford, </em>but also an examination whether fair notice of the conduct proscribed has been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We are persuaded that the delegation provided for in the Act does not violate art. 30. First, the Legislature did not delegate the making of a fundamental policy decision. The Legislature was quite clear as to the policy decision it had made and wanted implemented. That policy was that the interests of environmental protection and agriculture were to be balanced in a way that protected \u201croutine and long standing farm operations.\u201d St. 1991, c. 141, \u00a7 1. The delegation of the definitions of \u201cland in agricultural use\u201d and \u201cnormal maintenance or improvement\u201d of such land simply directed the department to work out the details necessary to the implementation of the policy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra </em>at 527, quoting <em>Field </em>v <em>Clark, </em>143 U.S. 649, 694 (1892) (\u201cone of the exceptions to or qualifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tians of [our nondelegation doctrine] is that the Legislature may delegate to a board or an individual officer the working out of the details of a policy adopted by the Legislature. ... \u2018To deny this [power] would be to stop the wheels of government\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The delegation, which provided that the terms were to be defined with the assistance of an advisory board of persons expert in the particulars and customs of farming operations, and were to be reviewed and approved by the Commissioner of Food and Agriculture (commissioner), was a proper way of accomplishing the balancing of interests sought by the Legislature because it ensured that the scope of the agricultural exemption would be based on the application of real-world farming practices. See <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>427 Mass. 1211, 1217 (1998) (\u201cAuthorizing the city to define the terms \u2018domestic partner\u2019 and \u2018dependents\u2019 is not a fundamental policy decision; rather, the authorization allows the city to implement the Legislature\u2019s previously stated purpose of extending health care coverage to employees, their household members, and their dependents\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Second, the Act provides adequate direction to guide the department in defining the terms of the exemption. The statutory exemption applies to \u201cland <em>in </em>agricultural use\u201d (emphasis added). The 1975 amendment, which changed the word \u201cfor\u201d to \u201cin,\u201d strongly suggests the Legislature\u2019s intent that the exemption apply to land currently being used for agriculture. The 1991 amendment reinforces this intention. The language used in its enactment specifically identifies the Legislature\u2019s concern for the \u201c700,000 acres of land in Massachusetts which is owned and managed by farmers\u201d and the jeopardy to \u201cthe future economic viability of our farms,\u201d and the preservation of \u201croutine and long standing farm operations.\u201d St. 1991, c. 141, \u00a7 1. These phrases are consistent with an intention that the exemption apply to currently functioning farms, and provide adequate direction to the department in exercising its responsibility to enact detailed and certain regulations regarding what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>land was to be considered \u201cin agricultural use.\u201d With respect to the terms \u201cnormal maintenance and improvement\u201d of land in agricultural use, the 1991 enactment language again adequately informs the department that it should balance the needs of farmers against the need to protect wetlands by not overly regulating their traditional activities. The statutory creation of a farmland advisory committee to assist the department in defining these terms adds to this guidance. A commonsense reading of the statute \u2014 and one that the department seems to have followed \u2014 is that the department should determine what activities farmers traditionally and normally engage in to maintain and improve their agricultural land and include such activities within the scope of the exemption. See <em>Opinions of the Justices, supra </em>at 1217 (terms to be defined by delegatee \u201chave meanings evident from the words themselves, and thus impose constraints on the city\u2019s authority to extend benefits\u201d). Cf. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., </em>412 Mass. 119, 128 (1992) (\u201cLegislature has set forth adequate direction for the receiver\u2019s implementation of the Receivership Act. The . . . Act authorizes the receiver to exercise various enumerated powers which, by their terms, provide clear direction as to the manner in which the receiver shall implement the Legislature\u2019s policy decision to improve Chelsea\u2019s financial position\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">There are also sufficient safeguards in the legislation to control abuses of discretion. The farmland advisory committee, the need to obtain the approval of the commissioner, the requirement that the exemption definitions be uniform for all persons, the limited nature of the delegation, the requirement that the regulations be submitted to a legislative committee prior to implementation, and the availability of judicial review \u201csufficiently demarcate the boundaries of regulatory discretion so that the act provides\u201d the necessary safeguards to control abuses of discretion. <em>Tri-Nel Mgt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barn-stable, </em>433 Mass. 217, 226 (2001) (\u201cParties who believe that a board\u2019s regulation has exceeded proper boundaries may seek judicial review of the regulation, pursuant to an action for declaratory relief\u201d)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>; <em>Opinions of the Justices, supra </em>at 1217-1218 (after analyzing first two <em>Chelmsford </em>factors, Justices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>concluded \u201cthere are adequate safeguards for any possibility of abuse of any claimed discretion,\u201d observing that there is a \u201cmechanism that would allow any possible claims that the city has abused its discretion to be heard\u201d). See Note, Reexamining the Massachusetts Nondelegation Doctrine: Is the \u201cAreas of Critical Environmental Concern\u201d Program an Unconstitutional Delegation of Legislative Authority?, 31 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 103, 129 (2004) (\u201cthe second and third <em>[Chelmsford] </em>inquiries seem to encapsulate the \u2018totality of the protection against arbitrariness\u2019 goal\u201d of <em>Arlington </em>v. <em>Board of Conciliation &amp; Arbitration, </em>370 Mass. 769 [1976]). Cf. <em>Corning Glass Works </em>v. <em>Ann &amp; Hope, Inc. of Danvers, </em>363 Mass. 409, 422 (1973) (\u201cRate making . . . may be delegated to a public board or officer with very general guides, but only if provision is made for judicial review of claims of confiscation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Finally, we conclude that the delegation here does not make the statute vague in the constitutional sense. The delegation and subsequent definitions improve the uniformity of, and reduce any prior uncertainty as to, the specific application of the statutory exemption. It requires no extended conversation to conclude that a person of ordinary intelligence would properly be on notice of what conduct falls within the statutory exemption as further detailed in the regulations, especially where the statute itself directs the reader to the applicable regulations. Moreover, the regulations provide that a person uncertain as to whether G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, applies to land or work that may affect an area subject to protection under the statute may submit a request for a determination of applicability to the local conservation commission. 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.05(3)(a)(l) (1997). The conservation commission is required to make a determina-</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>tian within twenty-one days of its receipt of the request. 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.05(3)(b)(l) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because the integrity of the grand jury process was not impaired, and the Act\u2019s delegation was not unconstitutional, we vacate the order dismissing the indictments against the defendants, and we remand the cases to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The defendants were each charged, in several counts, with both altering various wetlands by the \u201cclear cutting of vegetation,\u201d and filling the same wetlands, all without complying with the notice and approval provisions of G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40 (Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The regulation also provides that land may lie inactive for a term longer than five years if it is under a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) contract. 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04 (Agriculture) (a) (1997). There is no claim that the trust land had lain inactive under the terms of such a contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Before the grand jury, testimony was elicited from the administrator of the Mansfield conservation commission, Richard Lewis, that his discussion with others in the town led him to understand that no farming had actually occurred on the property for \u201cprobably ten or fifteen years.\u201d With its opposition to Clemmey\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Commonwealth submitted a number of affidavits from neighbors of long standing as well as affidavits from town officials regarding the tax classification of the property, to the same effect. In response, the defendants note that \u201cthere is no evidence that [the land] has ever been used for anything other than farming.\u201d This, of course, is not inconsistent with the land being inactive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">In November, 2001, Clemmey entered into a USD A land user-district cooperative agreement, in which he identified his property as farm land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In addition, Clemmey had altered a stream bank and the land underneath a stream, and had elongated an existing culvert in the wetland area, to allow for the passage of trucks and heavy machinery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Lewis explained his concern to the grand jury by stating that \u201cthese [Clemmeys] are big guys.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Burke also issued a unilateral administrative order, which requires violators to cease and desist from all unpermitted activities concerning wetlands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The prosecutor did not ask Marcus what Clemmey had told him regarding the exemption and the reasons he had proceeded to clear cut and fill wetlands without serving a notice of his intentions and receiving the approvals that would be required if the exemption did not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b157-5\">For example, testimony regarding Clemmey\u2019s apparent acknowledgment that he had cleared and filled wetlands (without notice of approvals) might not have been considered solely as an admission that he had violated the Act. Additionally, testimony that Clemmey was well versed in the provisions of the Act might have suggested not only his familiarity with what it prohibited, but also familiarity with the .very exemption that might apply to his circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\">This is not a case where the prosecutor withheld substantial evidence of a valid permit or license, the existence of which would have excused Clemmey from any criminal liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In his decision dismissing the indictments, the motion judge referenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the bearing that the withheld evidence might have had on the issue of Clemmey\u2019s intent. While the question is not directly before us, we do not see Clemmey\u2019s intent to violate the statute as being an element of the crimes with which he has been charged. Although the Commonwealth may seek to show that the defendant acted in a calculated manner, intentionally violating statutory provisions he knew were applicable, the only intent required is an intention to commit the acts of filling and altering the wetlands. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belanger, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 31, 33 (1991) (violations of statutes that impose punishment out of public policy concerns \u201chave been described as \u2018public welfare\u2019 or \u2018strict liability\u2019 offenses,\u201d and \u201clack of knowledge of the law or of the fact that the law has been violated does not exonerate the person who may have unwittingly violated the statute\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We do not base our ruling on whether the existence and applicability of the exemption is an \u201caffirmative defense.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>438 Mass. 206, 211 (2002).
