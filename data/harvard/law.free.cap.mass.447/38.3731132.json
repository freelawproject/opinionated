Following his discharge, the plaintiff filed a claim for unemployment benefits, which the division denied. The plaintiff appealed to the division\u2019s hearings department. After a hearing, a review examiner determined that the plaintiff was ineligible for unemployment benefits because the wages he earned from Maimonides were exempt from taxation pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 6 (r).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He appealed from that determination to the division\u2019s board of review (board), which denied his application for further review, making the decision of the review examiner the final decision of the board. See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 41 (c) (if application for review is denied, decision is \u201cdeemed\u201d decision of board for purpose of judicial review). See also <em>Starks </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 640, 640 n.2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>(1984) (where board denies application for review, review examiner\u2019s findings treated as findings of board).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The plaintiff sought judicial review of the board\u2019s determination pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A judge in the Brookline Division of the District Court Department affirmed the board. Relying on <em>Ursuline Academy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>383 Mass. 882 (1981), the judge concluded <em>that to </em>deny Maimonides the statutory exemption for unemployment compensation contributions would violate the establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and \u201cvarious\u201d provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution, because a contrary ruling would prefer a hierarchical religion, such as the Roman Catholic Church, over the Jewish religion. The plaintiff appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. For reasons different from those of the judge, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">2. <em>Facts. </em>We first describe Maimonides, supplementing as necessary the findings of the review examiner with the unchallenged evidence before him. The review examiner found, and the record supports, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201c[Maimonides] was incorporated in 1938 for the purpose of maintaining a place of worship according to the Orthodox Hebrew rite, the instruction of Jewish youth in the [tenets] of the Jewish religion and, among other things, to maintain and operate a school for the dissemination and teaching of Hebrew religious and literary works based upon Orthodox traditional Judaism together with English secular education in co-ordination with and under the supervision of the public school authorities and covering all subjects taught in the elementary and high school grades of our public schools.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Maimonides is governed by a board of directors who are appointed by members of the Maimonides corporation, described by the executive vice-president of Maimonides, Leora Joseph, as a small \u201cself-perpetuating group\u201d that acts as the school\u2019s \u201coverseers.\u201d The board of directors, in turn, appoints a \u201cschool <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>committee,\u201d which oversees the school\u2019s curriculum. According to Joseph, teaching the tenets of Orthodox Judaism is an integral part of the school\u2019s curriculum.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The senior administrators of the school are required to be Orthodox Jews, approximately fifty per cent of the faculty is Jewish, and all teachers of Jewish instruction are Orthodox Jews. All students are required to participate in daily worship services led in a synagogue on the school\u2019s premises by Orthodox rabbis. The school also offers extracurricular programs related to the Jewish faith. Maimonides has close relationships with Orthodox synagogues in the Boston area, from which it recruits many of its students. The synagogues, which are separate entities, are not involved in the internal policies or daily governance of Maimonides, but collaborate with each other and with the school. Joseph described the school\u2019s relationships with the synagogues as \u201csupported relationships of recruitment, of exchanging personnel, of getting speakers, of community building, and community relations.\u201d Tuition is the main source of the school\u2019s funding, although Maimonides engages in its own fundraising and, as found by the review examiner, receives \u201csubstantial funding\u201d from Combined Jewish Philanthropies.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Maimonides employs approximately 120 people full time and twenty part time. It does not make contributions to the Federal or State unemployment systems, in accordance with Federal and State determinations to that effect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>In 1935, responding to widespread unemployment, Congress established a cooperative Federal-State program to provide benefits to unemployed workers. See <em>St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>South Dakota, </em>451 U.S. 772, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>775 (1981). The program, which now appears as the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3311 (2000),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> imposes a Federal excise tax on all employers, except those specifically exempted by Congress. See <em>California </em>v. <em>Grace Brethren Church, </em>457 U.S. 393, 396-397 (1982). Congress further provided that employers could avoid a significant portion of the Federal tax by payment into federally approved State unemployment programs where those were available.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 397. Massachusetts quickly took advantage of the Federal incentive by formulating its own unemployment benefits program, G. L. c. 151 A, inserted by St. 1935, c. 479, \u00a7 5, which governs unemployment benefits in the Commonwealth. All other States have similarly enacted unemployment compensation laws providing at least the minimum coverage mandated by FUTA. See <em>St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>South Dakota, supra </em>at 775 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Under G. L. c. 151 A, employers<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> cover the costs of unemployment benefits by making payroll tax contributions to the Commonwealth for credit to the unemployment compensation fund, G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 13, unless the service performed by their employees is excluded from the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d by the provisions of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7\u00a7 6 or 6A. See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 14 (establishing method for calculation of payroll taxes); G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 14A (alternative payment option for nonprofit organizations and governmental employers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>make contributions); \u00a7\u00a7 6, 6A (excluding certain services from definition of \u201cemployment\u201d). Cf. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309 (exempting from mandatory State coverage services performed for certain employers or by certain individuals). To be eligible for unemployment benefits, an individual must satisfy the requirements of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 24, which provides in part that the individual must have been paid \u201cwages\u201d by his former employer that constituted \u201cemployment\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 151 A. See G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 1 (k), <em>(s) </em>(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The issue in this case is whether the division properly determined that the services provided by the plaintiff to Maimonides fall within the employment exclusion of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 6 (r),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> thereby excluding the plaintiff from unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We review the board\u2019s decision \u201cto determine whether the review examiner applied the correct legal principles in denying unemployment compensation benefits to the plaintiff [and] whether [his] findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Quintal </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, </em>418 Mass. 855, 858-859 (1994). See <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 89, 92 (1984). See also G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The plaintiff maintains that Maimonides does not qualify for exemption under the statute because the school is not a \u201cchurch\u201d as contemplated by the first prong of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 6 <em>(r). </em>See note 11, <em>supra. </em>As to the second prong of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 6 <em>(r), </em>the plaintiff concedes that Maimonides is \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d but argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Maimonides is not \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches,\u201d and therefore not exempt. In this regard the plaintiff notes that Maimonides is entirely internally governed; is not bound by the rulings or authority of any other religious body; sets its own funding, staffing, and curriculum determinations; and is financially supported in the main by tuition, its own fundraising, and an endowment. The plaintiff further argues that, to the extent that it cooperates with any external body, it coordinates with and is under the supervision of the public school authorities with respect to teaching in its elementary and secondary school classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">For its part, Maimonides agrees that, as to the second prong of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6 (r), it operates \u201cprimarily for religious purposes.\u201d But in the District Court and again on appeal it submits that it is not \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches,\u201d interpreting that aspect of the statute narrowly to apply only to \u201chierarchically controlled\u201d schools such as those operating under the authority of the Roman Catholic Church.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>We conclude that neither the plaintiff nor Maimonides correctly interprets the second prong of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 6 (r).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Because the plaintiff and Maimonides agree, and as the review examiner found, Maimonides satisfies the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d component of that statute, the crucial issue in this case is whether Maimonides is \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6 (r). See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(b)(1)(B). We have twice interpreted G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6 (r), as it applies to services performed for an employer operating \u201cprimarily for religious purposes\u201d when the employer has a legal identity separate from a \u201cchurch or convention or association of churches.\u201d In both cases we concluded that the employer was exempt from unemployment contributions because the entity was \u201ccontrolled\u201d by a church. See <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 731, 733 (1985) (separately incorporated education facility for developmentally disabled children and young adults subject to control of Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston qualified for exemption); <em>Ursuline Academy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>383 Mass. 882 (1981) (separately incorporated parochial school subject to control of Roman Catholic Bishop of Springfield qualified for exemption).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cf. <em>St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>South Dakota, </em>451 U.S. 772, 782-783 n.12 (1981) (\u201cTo establish exemption from [FUTA], a <em>separately incorporated </em>church school . . . must satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>requirements of \u00a7 3309[b][l][B],\u201d i.e., that it is \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d and \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches\u201d). In both Massachusetts cases, the schools at issue were subject to the local authority of the Roman Catholic Church, a hierarchically organized religion, and the supervision or control requirements of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 6 (r), could readily be established. In contrast, Maimonides, a Jewish school, is not \u201ccontrolled\u201d by a hierarchical religion. We nevertheless conclude that Maimonides does meet the statutory requirements for exemption from unemployment tax contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Whether an entity is \u201coperated,\u201d \u201csupervised,\u201d \u201ccontrolled,\u201d or \u201cprincipally supported\u201d by a church is an inquiry concerning \u201cfour <em>alternative </em>statutory requirements\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 736. We reject the plaintiffs implicit suggestion that to qualify as an exempt employer, a separately incorporated religious institution must be \u201coperated,\u201d \u201csupervised,\u201d or \u201ccontrolled,\u201d by a church. As the division correctly points out, the Legislature provided that an organization operated primarily for religious purposes may qualify for exemption if it is merely \u201cprincipally supported\u201d by a \u201cchurch or convention or association of churches.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 6 (r), uses \u201cor\u201d to specify the criteria for exemption under its second prong. It is fundamental to statutory construction that the word \u201cor\u201d is disjunctive \u201cunless the context and the main purpose of all the</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>words demand otherwise.\u201d <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>350 Mass. 340, 343 (1966). As long as Maimonides is \u201cprincipally supported\u201d by Jewish religious organizations, it satisfies the statutory exemption. On the undisputed record there can be no doubt that Maimonides is \u201cprincipally supported\u201d by such organizations and that the statutory exemption is therefore satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We recognize that Maimonides is largely self-governing. But the school is grounded in the Jewish religion and derives substantial support from area synagogues and other Jewish organizations. \u201cSupport,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 6 (r), is not limited to financial support. Cf. <em>Nampa Christian Schs. Found., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Dep\u2019t of Employment, </em>110 Idaho 918, 924 (1986) (exemption \u201cdoes not require a church\u2019s or group of churches\u2019 support to <em>be financial </em>in order for that to be recognizable under the statute. . . . The key is the <em>quality </em>of the support\u201d). As the review examiner found, Maimonides is supported by synagogues and other Jewish organizations in diverse ways. The school recruits from area synagogues the students who pay the tuition and fees that account for a significant part of the school\u2019s operating budget. There was uncontested evidence that Maimonides relies on members of surrounding Jewish synagogues to operate the school: the board of directors and school committee both include rabbis and members from local synagogues. The school requires that rabbis, presumably drawn from local Jewish synagogues, head the elementary and high schools, as well as the synagogue on its premises. Teachers providing religious instruction are Orthodox Jews, also presumably drawn from local synagogues. The school raises funds from local synagogues, as well as from Combined Jewish Philanthropies, which is itself an organization that raises and distributes funds to Jewish institutions such as Maimonides. As the division argues, and we agree, the school\u2019s \u201cexistence depends upon these essential relationships with members of other temples, synagogues and Jewish organizations, to provide financial and moral support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">For all of these reasons, the division correctly determined that Maimonides is exempt from the State unemployment tax as an organization \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>is \u201cprincipally supported\u201d by a \u201cchurch or convention or association of churches.\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 6 (r).

Whether Maimonides itself constitutes the Jewish equivalent of a \u201cchurch\u201d is a question we need not resolve in light of our conclusion that Maimonides is exempt under the second prong of the statute.
