Higginbottom filed his complaint after April 26, 1996; therefore, the requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPLRA\u201d) (effective April 26,1996), apply to his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-13\">On appeal, Higginbottom raises an issue of first impression in our circuit: whether his excessive-use-of-force claim is subject to the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirements. Higginbottom also raises several other challenges on appeal: (1) that there are no administrative remedies available to him, because he challenged actions of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections, Wayne Gardner; (2) that the administrative remedies are not \u201cavailable\u201d to provide the monetary damages that he seeks in this lawsuit; (3) that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) is \u201ccomplex,\u201d \u201cnot clear,\u201d and \u201cvague,\u201d as evidenced by interpretive splits among the circuits and district courts; (4) that the claims asserted in his brief \u201care not grievable\u201d; and (5) that the district court erred by vacating a four-month-old order. For the first time on appeal, Higginbottom contends that the prison\u2019s grievance procedures are unconstitutionally \u201cvague,\u201d and that the attorney general\u2019s office should not represent defendants accused of a \u201cknown ... constitutional wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of section 1997e(a)\u2019s exhaustion requirements and application of that section to Higginbottom\u2019s claims. <em>See Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1323 (11th Cir.1998). Issues raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before this court unless one of five exceptions applies. <em>See Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526-27 (11th Cir.1994). None of these five exceptions applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-18\">Higginbottom argues that the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirements do not apply to his excessive-use-of-force claim because the claim did not challenge \u201cprison conditions\u201d as defined in the PLRA. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626(g)(2). Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626(g)(2), which was amended as part of the same legislation as \u00a7 1997e, provides that the term \u201ccivil action with respect to prison conditions\u201d means any civil action arising under federal law \u201cwith respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in prison.\u201d Thus, the plain language of the statute does include claims alleging excessive force. <em>See Freeman v. Francis, </em>196 F.3d 641, 643-44 (6th Cir.1999); <em>see also Booth v. Churner, </em>206 F.3d 289 (3d Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>2000), <em>petition for cert. </em>filed, (U.S. June 5, 2000) (No. 99-1964). Furthermore, reading the term \u201cprison conditions\u201d to include excessive-use-of-force claims is supported by the purpose and legislative history of the Act. Congress passed the PLRA to reduce frivolous prisoner lawsuits. <em>See Freeman, </em>196 F.3d at 644. \u201cA broad exhaustion requirement that includes excessive force claims effectuates this purpose and maximizes the benefits of requiring prisoners to use prison grievance procedures before coming to federal court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">Moreover, the exhaustion requirement cannot be waived based upon the prisoner\u2019s belief that pursuing administrative procedures would be futile. <em>See Alexander, </em>159 F.3d at 1323. \u201cThe plain language of the statute makes exhaustion a precondition to filing an action in federal court.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>196 F.3d at 645. Accordingly, since the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirements encompass excessive-use-of-force claims, Higginbottom was required to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">We see no merit to any of Higginbottom\u2019s remaining arguments. A review of the record demonstrates that the district court did not err by vacating its order denying dismissal, despite the fact that the order was four months old, because the vacatur occurred only six weeks after new, binding case law was issued. In addition, we hold that \u00a7 1997e(a) is not unconstitutionally \u201cvague\u201d because the plain language of the statute adequately puts prisoners on notice that they must exhaust their administrative remedies before pursuing prison-related civil actions in federal court. Finally, Higginbottom offers no arguments supporting his assertion that his claims were \u201cnot grievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"AX3j\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
