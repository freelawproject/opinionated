Casselberry being owners of real estate in Eighth street, Philadelphia, on the 15th of October 1866 leased it to Read &amp; Cole -for five years for the annual rent of $6000 payable quarterly, on the 15th days of .the months of January, April, July and October in each year. On the 16th of September 1867 Read &amp; Cole assigned their lease to Hamrick &amp; Cole, the garnishees. On the 20th of November 1867 Pollock and Casselberry conveyed the premises to Owen Evans, the defendant in the execution; the garnishees had paid the rent up to October 15th 1867; the attachment was served on the garnishees, November 21st 1867. On the 7th of December 1867 the defendant in the execution petitioned the United States Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>trict Court to be discharged as a bankrupt; he was adjudged a bankrupt December 12th, and William Yerkes was appointed his assignee January 6th 1868. The rent, $1500, payable on the 15th of January 1868 is still due, the garnishees being ready and willing to pay it to whomsoever it rightfully belongs; it is claimed by the assignee in bankruptcy. The question for the consideration of the court is, whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover all or any of the rent, and if so, how much ? If the court should be of opinion with the plaintiff, judgment to be entered in his favor for so much as the court may think due without interest. If the court should be of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to any of the rent, judgment to be entered for the garnishees with costs. The District Court entered judgment for the garnishees, which was assigned for error by the plaintiff, who took a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-6\"><em>T.

Owen Evans, the defendant in the judgment, had purchased their landlord\u2019s reversion. The rent in question did not fall due until the following January, after service of the attachment. In the meantime Owen Evans was decreed a bankrupt, and his rights of property including the reversion passed to his assignee in bankruptcy. Clearly the rent which had not fallen due followed the reversion and passed with it to the assignee. It is to be noticed in the outset, this is not a foreign attachment, but an execution attachment. In .foreign attachment the land itself can be attached, and a lien obtained which carries with it the accruing rents. But an attach-, ment in execution cannot be levied of land \u2014 that the fi. fa. must reach \u2014 the attachment is levied only of debts or choses in action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>In this case there was not even a personal covenant, and the garnishees were liable to Owen Evans only through privity of estate. But this is of no moment, as had he been their landlord by covenant, then the rent not yet due was not a debt. It was an incident of the reversion, a part of it, and was itself therefore a part of the realty; and a levy on the reversion which it was competent for the plaintiff to have made on a fi. fa. would have fastened upon the rent as its incident, and carried it over by a sale to the purchaser of the reversion: Menough\u2019s Appeal, 5 <em>W. </em>&amp; S. 432; Boyd <em>v. </em>McCombs, 4 Barr 146; Johnson <em>v. </em>Smith, 3 Penna. R. 500; Bank of Pennsylvania <em>v. </em>Wise, 3 Watts 404. When the attachment was laid in the hands of the garnishees they were not debtors to Owen Evans. Had the rent fallen due afterwards, then on the principle of after-accruing funds coming into their hands, the attachment might have held the rent. But before this event happened, the reversion to which the rent was incident passed out of Evans into his assignee in bankruptcy by operation of law. There was, therefore, no debt for the attachment to operate upon. The land, that is the reversion-, in the hands of Owen Evans was not subject to the lien of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment. Nor had he even the lien of a fi. fa. on the land. There was nothing therefore to arrest the passing of the title to the reversion and preserve it for the plaintiff. The judgment was right and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
