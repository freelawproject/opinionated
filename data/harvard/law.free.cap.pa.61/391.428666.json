The coin was sent the next day by the cashier of the bank to Cronise &amp; Co., Philadelphia, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>sale, with instructions to deposit the proceeds to the credit of the hank in the Manufacturers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank, Philadelphia. On the 12th of December, Cronise &amp; Co. sent to the bank a statement of sales of the coin, showing the amount to be $493.22, and informed the bank that the amount was to their credit in the Manufacturers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank. On the 13th the cashier of the bank transmitted to the savings institution the note and statement of Cronise &amp; Co., with a memorandum at the foot by the cashier, saying that $492.72, the amount less expenses, were to the credit of the savings institution in the Allentown Bank. On the 22d December Cronise &amp; Co. deposited with the Manufacturers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank, to the credit of the Allentown Bank, their check on the Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank for-$493.22. On the same day the Manufacturers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank advised the Allentown Bank as follows: \u201c Cronise <em>&amp; </em>Co. have deposited to your credit $493.22.\u201d The check of Cronise &amp; Co. was protested. This suit was brought to recover the amount of this credit given by the plaintiff to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">The ease had been tried in November 1867, and resulted in a verdict for the defendants. The judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court, because the court had rejected evidence offered by the plaintiff, and taken the case from the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">The case was tried again in June 1868. The main question in the case was, whether in the sale of the coin, under the evidence, Cronise &amp; Co. were the agents of the plaintiffs or of the defendants, and therefore which was responsible for their fraud. Evidence was given by both sides on the question of the agency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">The plaintiffs and defendants respectively submitted a number of points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-8\">The court (Jones, P. J.) charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-9\">\u201c This case, tried once before, went up to the Supreme Court, by which, for rulings of this court, its judgment was reversed, and it was sent back for another trial. It is now on that trial. The opinion of the Supreme Court, which is the law of the case, is this:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-10\">\u201c \u2018 The court assumed from letter of Cooper to Cronise <em>&amp; </em>Co., 10th December 1860, that the Allentown Bank had treated the ! coin and proceeds as its own, and therefore directed verdict for Dimes Savings Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-11\">\u201c \u2018This excluded the evidence which tended to explain the letter. There was testimony that tended to show that Cronise &amp; Co. were selected by Dimes Savings Bank as their own agents, evidence of cashier Dimes Savings Bank and Saeger, cashier Catasauqua Bank \u2014 evidence (pretty strong) that the bag was not delivered to Allentown Bank as its own property, but was intrusted to Mr. Cooper only to forward to Cronise &amp; Co. Cooper suggested so sending it, because his contract with express company would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>lessen expenses. He directed Bush to put it in hag, direct it, seal it, mark amount on it. The hag was so sent to Allentown Bank, delivered without counting or changing it. That at delivery it was said Cooper knew what to do with it, and the Allentown Bank gave no credit, as Cooper had undertaken to forward the coin, it would follow that he would give these instructions to Cronise &amp; Co. to convert it at best rates, which was the object in sending it to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\">\u201c \u00a3To this point the letter is not at variance with the evidence of Bush, and the fact that Cronise &amp; Co. were the agents of the Dimes Savings Bank to convert the coin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">\u201c \u00a3 How far were the directions of Cooper to Cronise &amp; Co. to deposit proceeds in Manufacturers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank to credit of Allentown Bank an assumption of control without the authority of the Dimes Savings Bank ? True, Bush says there was nothing said about the proceeds to go to the credit of Dimes Savings Bank in the account with Allentown Bank, but there was evidence from which that might have been inferred, though not expressed in words.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">\u201c \u00a3 Then on 10th December 1860 the Dimes Savings Bank owed the Allentown Bank $524.65 for over-draft, their checks being to that amount in excess of their deposits. About that time the notes of the Allentown Bank were running in for redemption in Philadelphia pretty rapidly. After 10th December 1860 Bush admits that Cooper told him the Dimes Savings Bank could no longer depend on Allentown Bank for advances. Bush calculated to charge Allentown Bank with proceeds, to which may be added the actual disposition of the proceeds by the parties themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">\u201c \u00a3 On 13th December 1860 Cronise &amp; Co.\u2019s letter was received and sent by Cooper to Dimes Savings Bank with pencil note, showing amount credited by Allentown Bank on that day, and Dimes Savings Bank thereupon charged the amount to account of Allentown Bank. All this is some (not very weak) evidence to show that it was understood between Cooper and Bush that the proceeds of coin were to go to credit of Dimes Savings Bank, and so to account for Cooper\u2019s directions to Cronise &amp; Co. to deposit to credit of Allentown Bank in Manufacturers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-9\">\u00a3\u00a3 \u00a3 The court below should have submitted the facts to jury to say whether Cronise &amp; Co. were the agents or brokers of the Dimes Savings Bank for the conversion of the coin, and to account for its proceeds; whether the coin was intrusted to Cooper to be forwarded by express for the Dimes Savings Bank, and whether it was the understanding (tacit it may be) that the proceeds were to go to the credit of the Dimes Savings Bank in its account with Allentown Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201c <em>\u2018 </em>If such were the facts, they would account for the tenor of Cooper\u2019s letter to Cronise &amp; Co., and the fraud of Cronise &amp; Co., the chosen agents of Dimes Savings Bank, which misled all parties till 26th December 1860, ought not to be visited on the Allentown Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">\u201c <em>\u2018 </em>The case ought therefore to have gone to the jury.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\">\u201c Reading to you the evidence in the case, which does not in any substantial particular vary from what it was on the former trial, it is our plain duty to submit it to you under the instructions of the Supreme Court, as I have detailed them to you. If you find from that evidence that Cronise &amp; Co. were the agents or brokers of the Dimes Savings Bank for the conversion of the coin, and to account for its proceeds \u2014 if you find that the coin was intrusted to Cooper to be forwarded by express for the Dimes Savings Bank \u2014 if you find that it was the understanding (tacit it may be) that the proceeds were to go to the credit of Dimes Savings Bank in its account with the Allentown Bank, \u2014 those facts would account for the tenor of Cooper\u2019s letter to Cronise &amp; Co., and the fraud of Cronise &amp; Co., the chosen agents of Dimes Savings Bank, which misled all the parties\" till 26th December 1860, ought not to be visited on the Allentown Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\">\u201c The points presented by the plaintiffs are answered affirmatively.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-9\">The court did not answer the defendants\u2019 points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-10\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs for $714.26.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-11\">The defendants took a writ of error.

The judge thought it proper to read to the jury the opinion of this court reversing his former judgment and to submit the case thereon. Why he did so, it is difficult to know. The opinion of this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>upon the case as exhibited in the former trial was not a fair presentation of the case on the second trial. It was in no sense a charge to the jury, its purpose being wholly different. In the first trial the judge had taken the case away from the jury, without submitting to them the facts on part of the plaintiff bearing on the disputed credit. We thought he erred in this, inasmuch as there were facts and circumstances the plaintiff was entitled to have submitted for consideration, tending to show that Cronise &amp; Co. were the agents of the Dimes Bank instead of the Allentown Bank, and that the credit of $493.22 might have resulted from their fraud as agents of the Dimes Bank. It became necessary, therefore, to state.in our opinion these circumstances, in order to show the possibility that the Dimes Bank and not the Allentown Bank might be responsible for the fraud of Cronise &amp; Co. Hence, the very purpose of the opinion made it one-sided, and was to develop the strength of the evidence which the judge had dismissed as unimportant; and not to state that of the other side, which might have been its counterpoise.. When that opinion, therefore, was converted into a charge to the jury, it was not a fair presentation of both sides of the case, and the error was greatly augmented by omitting to answer the defendants\u2019 points. These errors of commission and omission made the charge too limited, and tended to exclude from a full consideration the views of the evidence taken by the defendant. \u2022 The error was heightened when the judge told the jury that the evidence in this trial did not, in any substantial particular, vary from what it was. on the former trial. Whether this is true we do not remember, and certainly the jury had no means of knowing. The effect of the whole charge was to. lead the jury to believe that the case was precisely that upon which we had passed, and had been decided by this court in favor of the plaintiff. It left very little room for a successful defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
