B. Kingston, freight agent of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, testified that the rate in the bill of lading applied to the whole route, was divided <em>pro raid </em>between that company and the defendants and paid at Red Hook. Leech &amp; Co. were the transfer agents of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company; the oil was delivered by them at Washington street wharf, Philadelphia, and transported by boat through the Raritan canal.

Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-11\">Walter Freeman, freight agent of the defendants, testified that barges had been established by them in 1862. Oil saturated the floors of the cars and the decks of the steamers and was prohibited being carried into the city of New York, it was therefore put into barges and run direct to Red Hook. In this case the reason why no bill of lading was issued by the defendants was because of the issue of a through bill by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Appley had authority to sign the receipt, but no authority to make a special contract such as a bill of lading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-12\">J. J. Matthews, captain of the barge \u201cYoung James,\u201d testified that he put part of the 800 barrels of oil on deck and some in the hold; there were twelve barges besides his own in tow of the steamer Princeton, a large tug steamer of low pressure and high stacks and not known to emit sparks: there were two barges between the steamer and the \u201cYoung James.\u201d There was no light on the barge, except a lamp enclosed in three white and one green panes of glass, which was at the stern. About eight miles below New Brunswick in the Raritan river, witness was in the cabin and a light suddenly sprang up ahead of him; a barrel then exploded, the barge took fire, and he cut the boat loose from the tow. He testified that the barrels were not leaking; his was the only coal-oil boat in the tow. There was much evidence by the defendants of the inflammable and dangerous character of coal-oil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The plaintiffs submitted the following points, amongst others: \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">1. The liability of the defendants for the loss of goods, the subject of this suit, is to be ascertained from the written contract as contained in the receipt, given by them to Leech &amp; Co., of November 9th 18\u00a73, and by the terms of the said contract their liability as common carriers extends to loss by fire, from whatever cause the same may have occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">2. The exemption of the liability of carriers from loss by fire to plaintiffs\u2019 oil, contained in the bill of lading of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in evidence in this cause, extends only to the same while in charge of the said Pennsylvania Railroad Company and of the said Leech &amp; Co., while in transit from Pitts-burg to Philadelphia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-8\">The court charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-9\">\u201cI confess to some change of opinion from my first impressions in regard to the principles of law to be laid down in this case. They are not without difficulty; but whatever views we take of the law, bind you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-10\">\u201cThe 1st point of the plaintiffs I answer in the affirmative. I see no other contract with the defendants than the receipt of their shipping agent for the oil. That it was received on board the barge \u2018 Young James\u2019 and destroyed by fire while in charge of the defendants is admitted. This receipt has no limitation of a common carrier\u2019s liability, and as the defendants were common carriers and insurers for the carriage of the property against everything but the act of God and the public enemies, they are liable to the plaintiffs for the oil shipped (with the exceptions named), as shown by the receipt, and the parol evidence in the ease does not change or alter the liability of the defendants, for it does not seem to me to bring their case within the exceptions named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-11\">\u201c 2. I affirm the plaintiffs\u2019 2d point also. I regard the exception in the bill of lading issued by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to the plaintiffs, as extending no further than the line of their road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-12\">\u201c These views render answers to the 3d, 4th and 5th points of the plaintiffs unnecessary, and leave to you, gentlemen of the jury, nothing but to find that the oil was delivered to the defendants to be carried; its loss, if other than by what is called the act of God or public enemies, and the amount which the plaintiffs are, under the evidence, entitled to recover, if the loss was by any other than the causes mentioned. That will be the value of the oil at the place of destination, less cost of transportation, to which you should add interest. The gross sum thus made up, will be what plaintiffs are entitled to recover, if your verdict is with them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-13\">The jury found for the plaintiffs for $2804.98.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The defendants had the ease certified to the court in banc, and in two specifications assigned the charge of the court for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-6\"><em>J. E. Gowen, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap3\">Does the last limitation in the bill of lading of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company avail the defendants ? The limitation would have availed the Pennsylvania Railroad Company: Farnham <em>v. </em>The Camden and Amboy Railroad, 5 P. F. Smith 53, and therefore should protect the carriers associated with that company. All parts of a contract and all its language must have validity: 1 Parsons on Cont. 17, 18; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Danner, 2 Harris 29; Rutherford\u2019s Inst., b. 2, ch. 7; Chitty on Cont. 70; Smith on Stat., \u00a7 527; Ward <em>v. </em>Whitney, 4 Seld. 446; Westcott <em>v. </em>Thompson, 4 Smith (N. Y.) 364. It is not to be presumed that the defendants would take the risk of so dangerous an article without other limitations than the common-law liability: Collins <em>v. </em>Bristol and Exeter Railway, 11 Exch. 789; s. c. 5 H. &amp; N. 969; Muschamp <em>v. </em>Lancaster Railroad, 8 M. &amp; W. 421; 2 Redfield on Railways 99; Id., \u00a7 12; 1 Parsons on Cont. 687, note K; Jennison <em>v. </em>C. and A.

The defendants cannot take advantage of the limitation in the bill of lading of the Pennsylvania Railroad: Garnett <em>v. </em>Willian, 5 B. &amp; Ald. 53; Sleat <em>v. </em>Flagg, Id. 342; Davis <em>v. </em>Garnett, 6 Bing. 716; Nutting <em>v. </em>Conn.

A through rate in a bill of lading does not make the transporter a contractor over the whole line: McMillan <em>v. </em>Mich. S. and N. I. Railroad, 16 Michigan 79; Collins <em>v. </em>Bristol and Exeter Railway, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered, February 25th 1869, by</p>\n<author id=\"b85-9\">Sharswood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmYL\">The contract of the plaintiffs with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, was to carry the barrels of oil received at Pittsburg to Philadelphia and there deliver them to Leech &amp; Co., at the company\u2019s freight station. If there was any undertaking implied from the fact that the ultimate destination of the goods appeared on the bill of lading to be Red Hook, and the freight was to be there received for the carriage over the whole route, it would be only an engagement to forward to that place. This is now the received doctrine in the American courts, as is ably shown by Judge Stroud in Jennison <em>v. </em>The Camden and Amboy Railroad Co., 4 Am. Law Reg. 234, who cites and comments on all the leading authorities. The limitations and stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tions contained in the contract in regard to the liabilities of the Pennsylvania Company as carriers, naturally apply only to that portion of the route in which they act as such, and not to the part in reference to which they are forwarders. 'Not that they could, not as agents for the carriers, beyond the terminus of their own road, stipulate for a limitation also of their liability. The question is, have they done so in this instance ? It is argued that whatever stipulations are contained in the bill of lading given for the goods when originally received, ought to be presumed to extend over the whole route. \u201cThe American cases upon the subject, with rare exceptions,\u201d says Judge Redfield, \u201crecognise the right of a railway company to enter into special contracts to carry goods beyond the line of their own road. And when different roads are united in one continuous route, such an undertaking in regard to merchandise received and booked for any point upon the line of the connected companies is almost matter of course:\u201d 2'Redfield\u2019s Law of Railways 104. If this could be construed to have been a contract by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to carry to Red Hook, then, indeed, it would be a natural and necessary presumption \u2014 that all its terms and limitations should apply to the 'carriers over every part of the route. The counsel on both sides in this case have relied on The Bristol and Exeter Railway <em>v. </em>Collins, 7 House of Lords 197. The contract there by the company, who received the goods, was to carry to the point of ultimate destination on another road. This was the decision of the court of the last resort, and hence Lord Chancellor Chelmsford said: \u201cI think, therefore, that the contract was entire, was for the whole journey from Bath to Torquay, and was made with the Great Western Railway Company alone; that the goods were carried over the defendants\u2019 railway under the contract, and that the defendants are consequently either not liable at all, as no agreement was entered into with them, or that if the contract in any way attaches to them, the exception as to loss by fire accompanies it and exonerates them from liability.\u201d In the Exchequer Chamber the receipt-note was considered as plainly showing that the contract of the Great Western Company was merely to carry to Bristol and to forward them by another carrier, and the exemption from liability provided for by the contract, was held to apply to the Great Western Company alone: 1 Hurlst. &amp; N. 517. It is evident that the decision in the Exchequer Chamber is that which is applicable to this case if the Pennsylvania Railroad were carriers only to Philadelphia and forwarders beyond.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The part of the bill of lading relied on as containing a stipulation relieving the defendants from liability, is the written memorandum subscribed in these words: \u201c This oil is carried only on open cars, and entirely at the owner\u2019s risk from fire and leakage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>while in possession of the railroad company or carriers while standing or in transit.\u201d The first part certainly only applies to transportation by rail. Now, beyond Philadelphia the transportation was by barges through the Delaware and Raritan Canal to Red Hook. If the memorandum looked beyond the terminus of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, it would not have been stipulated that the oil should be carried only on open cars. \u201cWhile in the possession of the railroad company\u201d certainly means the Pennsylvania company, \u201c or carriers while standing or in transit,\u201d naturally following in the same track, means just as certainly \u201c their carriers, whether standing at stations or depots, or in cars while actually moving.\u201d It would be a violent construction to conjecture that subsequent carriers were those meant. Doubtless it would have been so expressed if it had been so intended. The court were perfectly right, therefore, in instructing the jury that there was no other contract with the defendants than the receipt of their shipping agent for the oil, which contained no limitation of a carrier\u2019s liability at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
