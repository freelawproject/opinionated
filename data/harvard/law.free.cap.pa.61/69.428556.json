Burroughs, treasurer of a corporation, drew a note in blank and obtained the endorsement of Beilis, \u201c Pres\u2019t,\u201d for a debt due by the company to Sharpe, Beilis refusing to endorse as an individual. The note was afterwards filled up with Beilis\u2019s name as payee, and the amount and \u201cPres\u2019t\u201d erased by Burroughs. It was then handed to Sharpe, who had no knowledge of the erasure, but knew of Beilis\u2019s connection with the company, in payment for the debt due by the company and so receipted for. <em>Held, </em>under the circumstances, that Beilis was not individually liable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-8\">2.

Beilis. The writ was issued December 13th 1867. The plaintiffs declared against the defendant as endorser of a note dated March 19th 1867, at 60 days, drawn to his order by G. S. Burroughs, treasurer, for $2039.06. The defendant was president of the Port Richmond Pottery Company. The plaintiffs gave in evidence the deposition of Henry J. Martindale. He testified, that he acted as salesman of the Pottery Company, and purchased coal and supplies.for them; G. S. Burroughs was the superintendent, secretary and treasurer. He had purchased the coal which was the consideration of the note, and it had been delivered. The plaintiffs asked for payment for the coal, and declined to take the company\u2019s note. Witness having gone to see them by the direction of Burroughs, asked them if they would take the defendant\u2019s note, and referred them to a Mr. Salter for his standing. The plaintiffs were to make inquiries on the subject, and witness left them without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>understanding whether they would take the defendant\u2019s note. The plaintiffs afterwards sent word to Burroughs that they would take the defendant\u2019s individual note. Witness then went to the defendant\u2019s house in Trenton, N. J., with the note in suit; \u201c it was not then filled up \u2014 being merely a blank note.\u201d Burroughs asked the defendant if he would give his note to plaintiffs: he said he would not, but would endorse the note as president.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">He then wrote on the back of the note which had not been filled up \u201c G. S. Bellis, Pres\u2019t.\u201d At this interview Beilis repeatedly declared, that he would not as an individual assume any of the company\u2019s debts, and particularized the note in suit. The note was taken by witness and Burroughs to the company\u2019s office in Philadelphia, \u201cBurroughs made out the amount and filled up the note,\u201d and said he would scratch \u201cPres\u2019t\u201d off, which he did with a penknife in the presence of witness. The note was delivered to the plaintiffs, who were not then informed of the alteration that had been made, nor afterwards until the note fell due. There was no authority from Bellis to erase the word \u201cPr.es\u2019t\u201d in case the plaintiff should refuse to take the note without the defendant\u2019s individual endorsement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\"><em>Or. </em>B. Newton, the general agent of the plaintiffs, testified for them: Witness received the note from Martindale for the Pottery Company, as the company\u2019s note endorsed by the defendant. Martindale had offered the defendant\u2019s individual endorsement as security, which witness took after some inquiry. The note was given for coal sold to the company for cash. Witness first heard of or saw the erasure after the note had been protested, when the plaintiff\u2019s agent went to see the defendant about payment. The coal was charged to the company. The receipt given for the note was for the bill of coal \u201cwhen paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">The note which was as follows, was offered in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\">\u201c($2039.06.)

An alteration to be material must be one varying the tenor of the bill or adding to the parties\u2019 responsibility: Struthers <em>v. </em>Kendall, 5 Wright 229; Byles on Bills 253, note 1, 255; Gardinier <em>v. </em>Sisk, 3 Barr 327; 2 Parsons on Bills 582; Wheelock <em>v. </em>Freeman, 13 Pick. 165. A person acting for another in a written instrument, must make his agency apparent on its face to bind his principal: 2 Parsons on Bills 95; Dewitt <em>v. </em>Walton, 5 Selden 571; Pentz <em>v. </em>Stanton, 1 Am. L. Cases 620, 628, 629, 635. The case should have gone to the jury: Fisher <em>v. </em>Rhodes, 4 Phila. R. 694; Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Earp, 4 Rawle 385; Meyer <em>v. </em>Barker, 6 Binn. 228; Campbell <em>v. </em>Baker, 2 Watts 84; Tassey <em>v. </em>Church, 4 W. &amp; S. 346. An endorsement in blank is in effect a letter of credit: Byles on Bills 127.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-6\"><em>S. Dickson, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqy\">The plaintiffs are not bond fide holders without notice. The note was taken for an antecedent debt, and there was therefore no consideration: The only exception to this would be accommodation paper: Appleton <em>v. </em>Donaldson, 3 Barr 386; Lord <em>v. </em>Ocean Bank, 8 Harris 384. The rule is that the name of the principal must appear on the face of the paper when the signature is an endorsement or paper drawn by another: Roberts <em>v. </em>Austin, 5 Whart. 313; Mott <em>v. </em>Hicks, 1 Cowen 514.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AJK\">The opinion of the court was delivered, March 1st 1869, by</p>\n<author id=\"b71-8\">Thompson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANH\">If Sharpe, Weiss &amp; Co. had been entire strangers to the defendant Beilis and to the fact of his connection with the \u201c Port Richmond Pottery Company,\u201d as president, it could hardly be contended, we think, that the abbreviation \u201cPres\u2019t,\u201d after his name, could, in the absence of anything on the face of the note to indicate his possession of it in a representative character, be regarded as a restrictive endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The promise contained in it to him as payee, was personal and there was no designation of a company of which he wras president, to which the afiix to his name would apply.. No company was disclosed as the principal intended to be bound. In such a case the rule seems to be well settled, that when an agent does not mean to be personally bound by a writing he must disclose the name of a principal whom he intends to bind: 1 Pars. on Con. 95; 1 Am. Lead. C. 602, in note; De Witt <em>v. </em>Walton, 5 N. Y. 571; Spencer <em>v. </em>Field, 10 Wend. 87. There can be no difference in principle between simply adding the word \u201cagent\u201d when no principal is disclosed, and the word \u201c Pres\u2019t\u201d,when no corporation or company is disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">On this note so endorsed, without extrinsic proof of knowledge on part of the plaintiffs, this endorsement, we think, would have imported a legal, personal obligation, and in this aspect the era<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>sure of the affix would be an immaterial alteration, which it is the rule now to hold as not affecting the instrument: Tassey <em>v. </em>Church, 4 W. &amp; S. 346, and subsequent cases, not important to cite.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">If, however, the plaintiffs did know the official relation of the defendant to the company, the erasure was material. It changed the nature of the defendant\u2019s obligation from an official representative act to a personal undertaking. It was then not admissible in evidence, provided that fact sufficiently appeared before its offer; that it did in the proof made by the plaintiffs, is clear beyond controversy. The claim for which the note was given was for coal sold to the company by the plaintiffs. They applied to the company for payment and the treasurer, Burroughs, and the witness, Martindale, a stockholder and salesman of the company, endeavored to get the plaintiffs to agree to take a company note for their debt. This they declined, but agreed to take Mr. Beilis\u2019s note. Mr. Beilis, when applied to by the treasurer of his company to give his individual note for the demand, positively refused, but endorsed a blank note, signing as president. This, Burroughs filled up with his name as payee and erased very skilfully the word \u201c Pres\u2019t\u201d from his signature as endorser and passed the note over to -the plaintiffs; thus committing a gross fraud on him, as well as practising a great deception on the plaintiffs. Eo other inference could arise from the testimony than that the plaintiffs knew that Beilis was the president of the pottery company at the time they received his note. They were the creditors of his company and had presented their claim against the company, and pressed it for payment. This was the proof. The erasure was also clearly proved by the plaintiffs before the note was offered. They then stood in the position of a party offering in evidence a note with a material alteration fraudulently made and proved, without being holders for value, the note having been given for a precedent debt and without the surrender of any security and upon a receipt given on the claim \u201cby note when paid.\u201d The note was therefore not admissible on the ground of the fraudulent alteration. Eor would it have sustained the plaintiff\u2019s <em>narr., </em>taking it as it was endorsed; for if the plaintiffs knew, as we have shown they must have known, that he was the president of the pottery company, when he endorsed as president, then it was the note of the company, and not his individual note, and as the company was not sued it was not evidence in the case on trial. In both views the note, under the plaintiffs\u2019 proof, was inadmissible, and the learned judge committed no error in rejecting it. As there was no other ground of recovery against the defendant, the non-suit was properly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
