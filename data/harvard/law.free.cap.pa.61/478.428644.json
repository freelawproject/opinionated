The will was proved in -New Jersey October 5th, and letters testamentary issued to John Brown Parker and Frederick Watts, the executors named in it. Assets of the estate were in Pennsylvania, and on the 80th of November 1865 administration c. t. a. was granted in Philadelphia to the executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-19\">Amongst other provisions of his will, the testator bequeathed to his daughter Mary, wife of Johnston Moore, the sum of $50,000, the interest to be paid to her during life, and the principal to her children at her death. To his daughter Euphemia Grubb, $50,000 in like manner.

He directed that the residue of his estate should be divided between his children, Mary Moore, Euphemia Grubb, John Brown Parker, Marcia Preeman, Thomas B.

On the 15th of June 1867'Mary Moore and Euphemia B. Grubb, with their husbands, presented a petition to the Orphans\u2019 Oourt of Philadelphia setting forth the grant of administration in Pennsylvania, and that the greater portion of the assets were in that state, and prayed for a citation to the executors requiring them to settle an account in the register\u2019s office in Philadelphia. John B. Parker, one of the executors, answered the citation, an'd set out the facts as above given and that soon after the testator\u2019s death the petitioners for the citation obtained an injunction from the Oourt of Common Pleas of Cumberland county restraining the executors from intermeddling with the estate of the testator in Pennsylvania, that the injunction remained in force until September 1866, preventing the executors until that tim\u00e9 from exercising any control of the estate in Pennsylvania, and since then, being lesb than a year, they have endeavored to the best of their ability without delay to settle the administration of the estate; that under the advice of counsel an account had not been filed in the time fixed by law, because they hoped shortly to be able to settle a final account. The executor further answered as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-8\">\u201cUnder the circumstances aforesaid, I am advised that it is within the discretionary powers of this court either to distribute the fund raised under the letters granted in Pennsylvania, or to remit the parties to the forum of the domicil of the testator for that purpose.

J., in Mothland <em>v. </em>Wireman, 3 Penna. Rep. 188, in these words :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">\u201c \u2018 An administrator here, though admitted to be but auxiliary to the administrator at the place where the decedent was domiciled, is bound to remit the assets to be administered there, <em>only in ease there are no domestic claimants, in the character of creditors\u2019 legatees or next of Jcin ; </em>but that where these appear, the assets are to be retained for administration, according to our own laws.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-10\">\u201c The question has been considered in a number of cases, there being, generally, two sets of administrators, one of them being called the <em>administrator domicilii, </em>the principal and the primary administrator, and the other being variously styled the administrator of the <em>situs, </em>the ancillary, and the auxiliary administrator. But as Lewis, J., aptly said, in his learned opinion, (Dent\u2019s Appeal, 10 Harris 519,) \u2018 It does not matter what terms are used to designate the distinction in <em>fact, </em>as to the objects of the different administrations, so that we guard ourselves against the conclusion that there is a distinction in <em>law </em>as to the rights of the parties entitled as distributees.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-11\">\u201c And as was said in Harvey <em>v. </em>Richards, 1 Mason R. 381, \u2018 There is no magic in words; and each of these administrations may properly be considered as a <em>principal </em>one, with reference to the limits of its exclusive authority; and each might, under circumstances, justly be deemed an <em>auxiliary </em>administration.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-12\">\u201c It would be wearisome and useless to attempt the task of extracting from all the reported cases. Even those in our own books present an array of burdensome authority. The student will find the law upon this subject fully discussed and learnedly illustrated in Brodie <em>v. </em>Bickley, <em>2 </em>Rawle 431; Miller\u2019s Estate, 3 Id. 312; Willing <em>v. </em>Perot, 5 Id. 264; Short\u2019s Estate, 4 Harris 66; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Smith, 5 Barr 142.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-13\">\u201c The principle dedueible from all the cases seems to be, that while the law of the domicil is to control the succession to the personalty, the administration of the estate must be in that jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>tion wherein it is held under lawful authority: Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, ch. 13, sec. 518. So rigidly was this rule adhered to In the goods of the Duchesse d\u2019Orleans, 28 Law J. Rep. N. S., Prob. and M. 129, 1 Swabey and Tristram 253, that the English court refused to grant administration to a minor, although, by the law of the domicil, the minor might be entitled to administer to the estates of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">\u201c In this estate, one of the petitioners is a resident of this state, both of the executors also reside here; two other devisees, making four in all out of nine parties in interest, are within our jurisdiction. Here, also, as before observed, is the great bulk of the property. We do not decide this question, however, upon the array of figures, for if there were but a single claimant here we cannot close our doors to him and send him into another jurisdiction, it might be thousands of miles distant, to obtain his share of the Pennsylvania assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-7\">\u201c We do not apprehend that there can be any conflict of orders between the two forums, and the charge of two partial settlements ought not to exceed the cost of a lumping distribution. |</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">\u201c Nor is the fact conclusive against these petitioners that they have cited the executors, and procured a decree for an account in the court of the domicil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\">\u201c That was their right or it would not have been so decreed, and it is no estoppel here, for the judgments operate upon different assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-10\">\u201cAnd now, upon consideration of the petitioners\u2019 answers, examiner\u2019s report, and arguments of counsel for petitioners and respondents, it is ordered'that the respondents file an account within thirty days from the service upon them of notice of the entry of this decree.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-11\">On the 4th of December 1867, the executors filed an account with the surrogate of Burlington county, New Jersey, which included all the assets of the testator without regard to the jurisdiction in which they were found. By this account it appeared that the balance in their hands was $1,521,051.71. Of the credits claimed in New Jersey were certain evidences of debt, amounting to $14,802.50, which had not been collected on account of not having arrived at maturity and for other causes, but which were not alleged to be worthless. It also included payments to the legatees. This account was, by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Burlington county, New Jersey, \u201c allowed in all things as reported.\u201d The account in Pennsylvania was filed February 13th 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-12\">By this account there were credits for payments to the legatees, and the balance in their hands of Pennsylvania assets was shown to be $542,377.59.

The reason for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>is stronger when the rule of distribution is a will. Legatees and next of kin are claimants who will not be sent to a foreign jurisdiction: Mothland <em>v. </em>Wireman, 3 Penna. R. 188; Stokely\u2019s Estate, 7 Harris 476. The New Jersey account does not purport to be a final one.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered, May 11th 1869, by</p>\n<author id=\"b484-7\">Thompson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY0\">The cases of Mothland <em>v. </em>Wireman, 3 Penna. 188, and Dent\u2019s Appeal, 10 Harris 514, abundantly show that assets are not to be transmitted to the administrator or executor of the domicil when there are domestic claimants or claimants within the jurisdiction of the ancillary administration. It would be a waste of time to discuss what we see so ably discussed in the opinion of Lewis, C. J., in the last-mentioned case.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">There are a number of legatees under the will of Isaac Brown Parker in this Commonwealth, and it being admitted that there are no debts to be paid in New Jersey, there is no reason whatever for sending the Pennsylvania assets there for distribution, especially as the same persons are accountants in both states. The rule against transmission when there are domestic claimants, creditors or legatees, is too firmly settled upon authority, and is not to be departed from or doubted. The auditor and court were entirely right in maintaining, as they did, this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Implied trusts to executors result from the intention of their testators, to be gathered from the terms and provisions in wills, and have always been more or less common.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Several English cases have been cited, and among them Bush <em>v. </em>Allen, 5 Mod. 63, and South <em>v. </em>Allen, Id. 101, in which trusts to executors are implied from provisions very similar to the case in hand, and it is not improbable that we might feel ourselves impelled to imply such a trust in this and cases like it, were it not that the legatees for life are placed on the footing of trustees for those in remainder, in regard to the thing, or the principal of the fund devised for life, by the 44th section of the Act 24th of February 1834. That act requires legatees to give security in the Orphans\u2019 Court having jurisdiction of the account of the executors, to protect the interest of those in remainder, before the executors shall deliver the property or pay over the money to the legatees for life, and which security, like that of trustees by appointment, is liable to the supervision of the Orphans\u2019 Court at all times. The existence of the law is a reason for inferring that no trust in the executors was contemplated by the testator in this case. But these considerations, while they persuade us, we will not say they rule our decision, for it rests also upon our own precedents. Our courts follow the rule, whenever it is applicable, that <em>\u201c </em>the bequest of the use of a thing, or the product or interest of a fund, is as a rule to be regarded as a bequest of the thing itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The bequests in question, although restricted in extent, are direct as to the <em>corpus. </em>They are: \u201cI bequeath to her (the legatee) $50,000, the interest of which to be paid to her during life, and the principal to her children at her death.\u201d This is a direct bequest of the principal for life, and is not to be overcome by the implication arising from the words \u201c to be paid\u201d or \u201c shall be paid,\u201d that it is to be paid by the executors, and thus continue their duties to an indefinite period. Implications often yield to counter implications, and always to positive and clear directions. These implicative words, or claimed to be such, seem to me to depend mainly on the use to which the interest is to go, rather than an implication of a trust. As the principal fund was necessarily intended to be invested in some way in order to produce an interest, it was not an uncommon mode of expression to say it was \u201c to be paid\u201d to the legatee entitled to receive it. If invested, the interest would be paid by somebody to the party entitled, and in this sense we may regard the words to have been used, especially in the presence of the clear bequest of the fund to the legatee. The cases of Rodgers <em>v. </em>Rodgers, 7 Watts 15, and Clevenstine\u2019s Appeal, 3 Harris 495, are cases like the present; they were bequests of the principal, coupled with a trust, the interest to be enjoyed for life on giving security under the Act of Assembly to preserve the principal or property for children. The learned auditor was entirely right, therefore, in the view he took of these bequests, and in holding the principal payable to the legatees for life, on giving security, as required by the Act of Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We see no good reason for setting aside the decree in this case on the ground that a credit of $14,802, uncollected bonds, in New Jersey, was not credited to their account in this state, instead of being included in their account in adjusting the proportions to be distributed under the account here. I see no difficulty in correcting that, in the account not yet settled in New Jersey, or in the final account of the executors. If they account for moneys of the estate here, strictly within the jurisdiction of the surrogate in New Jersey, there cannot be a doubt but that it would be allowed as a credit there, a final account of the New Jersey assets not having passed, and the executors and claimants being the same in both states.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Nor do we think we ought to reverse the decree of distribution in the Orphans\u2019 Court, because it was made on the report of an auditor, the decree itself being right. There being no exceptions to' the account, the court might have decided the questions of law in the ease without an auditor. Still we see nothing in the Acts of Assembly, applicable to the Orphans\u2019 Court of this county, to prevent the appointment of an auditor or auditors to make distribution in the absence of exceptions ; while there is, in other parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>of the state, by the Act of 14th April 1835, \u00a7 1: Rhoads\u2019s Appeal, 3 Wright 187. Even if we were in error as to this, the report of the auditor would not vitiate the d\u00e9cree predicated of it. The only redress would be to strike off the compensation allowed to the auditor. The business of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia is so large that it is hardly possible for the court to get along without the aid of auditors, and we do not see that the court are confined to the cases where there are exceptions in appointing them; but unconscionable charges should be guarded against. The auditor should be allowed compensation according to his work, and not measured by the ability of the estate to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We do not see any solid reasons for charging the costs incident to the citation in this case upon the shares of Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Grubb in the estate of their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">More than a year had elapsed without an account filed by the executors, consequently <em>they were liable to a citation to quicken their movements. </em>It enured to the benefit of all the heirs; and because the executors were not held to have been in default, owing to certain proceedings in equity, and therefore not liable to the costs and expenses of it, that was no reason they should interfere to put the costs on the heirs who acted, instead of upon all equally benefited. This portion of the decree was unexceptionable under the circumstances. The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court appearing to be right in all the particulars complained of it is affirmed, the costs to be paid out of the estate, and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">After the foregoing decision John Brown Parker, acting executor and one of the legatees, on the 9th of September 1869 filed a bill of review in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia county, setting forth that there were errors in the report upon which the decree was founded, and in the decree itself, which, if not corrected, would be injurious to his rights and interests; and prayed the court to review the said report and decree thereupon, and to grant a rehearing of that part thereof, alleged to be erroneous, to cause said errors to be corrected, and the report and decree to be modified, and for such relief as equity might require, in accordance with the Act of Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">On December 7th 1869 he filed his petition in the Supreme Court, setting forth his foregoing application to the Orphans\u2019 Court, and that in order to remove any technical objection against the consideration by that court, of the petition for review, and to prevent a seemingly improper interference by the Orphans\u2019 Court, in its action upon the petition, with a decree of the Supreme Court, prayed for a rule to show cause why there should not be added to the decree of this court, these words:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201c Any party in interest having the right, before the payment of the sums awarded by the auditor\u2019s report, to correct by petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>or bill of review, in the Orphans\u2019 Court, mistakes and errors, not of judicial judgment, apparent on the face of the account, and report of the auditor, if any such there are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">A rule to show cause was granted, and on the return thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\"><em>E. H. Hanson </em>and <em>Daniel Dougherty </em>argued in support of the rule. \u2014 The bill of review was filed in the court below, under the Act of October 13th 1840, \u00a7 1, Pamph. L. of 1841, p. 1, Purd. 301, pl. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In Counts of Chancery, additions which do not affect the principles of the decree, but correct evident mistakes, are allowed even after action taken under the decree: Eyles <em>v. </em>Ward, 1 Dickens 58; Spearing <em>v. </em>Lynn, 2 Vernon 376; Newhouse <em>v. </em>Metford, 12 Vesey 456; Tomlins <em>v. </em>Polk, 1 Russell 475; Shine <em>v. </em>Gough, 2 Ball &amp; Beatty\u2019s Rep. 33; Hughes <em>v. </em>Jones, 26 Beav. 24; Viney <em>v. </em>Chaplin, 3 De Gex &amp; Jones 282. Where errors in a decree are obvious, the court will rectify them, even after enrolment: Fearon <em>v. </em>Desbrioay, 21 L. J. Chan. 511, 16 Jurist, part 1, p. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The courts of law have a similar power of amendment: Short <em>v. </em>Coffin\u2019s Executor, 5 Burr. 2730; George <em>v. </em>Howard, 7 Price 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The power to correct mistakes in decrees exists in the inferior courts of this Commonwealth: Crutcher <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 Wharton 340; Chew\u2019s Appeal, 9 W. &amp; S. 151; Smith <em>v. </em>Hood, 1 Casey 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">Permission for review by the lower court should be first given by the Supreme Court: Southard <em>v. </em>Russell, 16 Howard 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\"><em>W. L. Hirst </em>and <em>Strong </em>showed cause against the rule. \u2014 They contended that amendment must be made during the term at which &gt; the decree was passed, and that when the term had gone by, such an addition, as is here asked for, could not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">The opinion was delivered January 22d 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">Per Curiam. \u2014 We are clearly of opinion, that the Orphans\u2019 Court can entertain a bill of review, under the Act of 1840, notwithstanding the decree of afiirmance of this court. The amendment asked for is, therefore, unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">Bule dischai\u2019ged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
