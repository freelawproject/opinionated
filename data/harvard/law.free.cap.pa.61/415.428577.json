The goods were placed in possession of Pierce. Shortly afterwards he directed the sheriff to proceed. About the same time a petition in bankruptcy was filed against Hanley and an injunction issued to restrain the sheriff. Hanley was afterwards adjudicated a bankrupt.

Hanley, [l. s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AvWE\">Joshua Pierce, =l. s._</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABXi\">W. A. Green, [l. s/</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-8\">After this agreement Pierce and Green took possession of the goods to sell them under the agreement. The testimony in- the case is not set out in the paper-books; but it appears by the statements in them that Hanley was at this time insolvent, his indebtedness being about $5000, and his assets about $3000. On the 12th or 13th of August 1867 Pierce directed the sheriff to proceed under the fi. fa., and on the 13th one of Hanley\u2019s creditors filed a petition in the District Court of the United States to have him declared a bankrupt on the ground that within six months he had committed an act of bankruptcy by giving the above-mentioned judgment-notes to Pierce &amp; Neyhart and Green, with a view to give them a preference. On the same day the District Court issued an injunction against the sheriff, under which the deputy marshal took possession of Hanley\u2019s goods. On the 22d of August Hanley was decreed a bankrupt, he having made no opposition to the decree. About the 12th of September Evans was appointed his assignee, and took such possession of the goods as he could, but did not meddle with them further, the injunction being still in force. The injunction was dismissed about the 1st of November. The sheriff then attempted to sell the goods, but was restrained by an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Warren county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-9\">An arrangement was then made between the sheriff and the assignee in bankruptcy, by which assignee was to sell, the goods and apply enough of proceeds of sale to pay balance due on writs in sheriff\u2019s hands, but the agreement was not to prejudice the legal rights of either party. The money arising from the sale was received by the sheriff and paid into court; this issue was framed to try the right to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-10\">The points, which by the order for the issue were to be determined, were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-11\">1. Whether a levy was actually made by the sheriff before the service of the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>2. Whether the lien of this <em>levy </em>was released by the agreement of August 6th, and not renewed or attempted to be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">3. Whether these judgments were confessed, and the aforesaid agreement made in fraud of the United States Bankrupt Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\">The following are points of the plaintiffs, with the answers of the court: \u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-8\">\u201c 2. The agreement between Hanley, Joshua Pierce and Green, dated August 6th 1867, if made by request of said Hanley, and for the purpose of realizing more for the property levied on than could be made by a forced sale on executions, does not prejudice the rights of the plaintiffs, there being no other execution-creditors claiming the fund.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9\">Answer: \u201c We think the agreement referred to was an abandonment of the fi. fas. by the plaintiffs, and answer this point in the negative.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-10\">\u201c 3. There was no consideration to support said agreement, and plaintiffs had a right to disregard the same, and if they did so, and ordered the sheriff to proceed with the sale of the property levied on the executions before any intervening rights of other creditors, then their legal rights are not affected by said agreement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-11\">Answer: \u201cWe think there was sufficient consideration for said agreement, and that it was binding on the parties to it. We therefore answer this in the negative.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-12\">The following are points of the defendants, with their answers:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-13\">\u201c 5. The agreement of the 6th of August 1867, with the subsequent taking possession and disposal of goods under the same by plaintiffs, was void as an assignment as against the assignee, even though the jury believe that the plaintiffs had no reasonable cause to believe that a fraud on the Bankrupt Act was intended.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-14\">Answer: \u201cWe cannot so charge. There must be a fraud intended to avoid the acts of parties; whether that has been proven or not is for you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-15\">\u201c 6. The agreement of 6th August 1867 was an assignment or conveyance in contemplation of bankruptcy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-16\">\u201c Answer: \u201c This involves a mere fact for you to pass upon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-17\">The court (Yincent, J.), after stating the facts, further charged :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-18\">\u201c Being of the opinion that plaintiffs cannot claim it under their respective writs and levies, we must next inquire whether they are entitled to it under the agreement before referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-19\">\u201c The order to the sheriff to go on under the writs would seem to indicate an abandonment of the agreement, but we think their rights under that remain, unless it is void under the provisions of the Bankrupt Act of March 2d 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-20\">[\u201cThere can be no legal doubt that Hanley contemplated bankruptcy at the time of the agreement, for the petition against him so alleges, and he did not contest it.] In addition to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>you have evidence that about that time he contemplated bankruptcy. If this be so, his transfer of his goods was in fraud of the Bankrupt Act, so far as he is concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">\u201c The Bankrupt Act provides in the 85th section that if an assignment, such as was made in this case, is not made in the usual and ordinary course of the business of the debtor, it shall be primd facie evidence of fraud, and this we think applies to the assignee of such goods as well as to the assigning debtor. Was this transfer made in the usual and ordinary course of business of the debtor ? We think it would be difficult to answer in the affirmative, for it was under an extraordinary pressure. [He transferred all his goods, and thus broke up his business for the time being, and the whole transaction is some evidence of an intention to prefer these creditors, .which they must rebut to your satisfaction.] Hanley was in debt about $5000, and had about $3000 worth of property with which to pay, so far as we learn from the evidence. [Unless the plaintiffs satisfy you that this transaction was in the usual course of Hanley\u2019s business your verdict should be for the defendant; or if you believe from the evidence that the plaintiffs had reasonable cause to believe that the transfer to them was done with intent to evade, &amp;c., the provisions of the Bankrupt Law, your verdict should be for the defendant.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-7\"><em>\u201c </em>If you believe from the evidence that plaintiffs had no such reasonable cause for believing a fraudulent intent, or if you are satisfied that the transfer was in the usual and ordinary course of Hanley\u2019s business, your verdict should be for the-plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-8\">The verdict was for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-9\">The plaintiffs removed the case to the Supreme Court, and assigned for error the answers to their points, and the parts of the charge included in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-10\"><em>L. D. Wetmore </em>(with whom was <em>C. W. Stone), </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARmo\">The agreement recognised the continuance of the executions. By the agreement there was no benefit to plaintiffs or loss to Hanley. No other execution had come to the sheriff\u2019s hands: Deacon <em>v. </em>Govett, 4 Philad. R. 7; Freeburger\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 247. There was doubt that Hanley contemplated bankruptcy, and the question should have been submitted to the jury. Several requisites are necessary to make a conveyance void under the bankrupt law: James on Bankruptcy 157; Act of Congress of 1867, \u00a7 35; Wilkinson\u2019s Appeal, 4 Barr 287. The bankruptcy was produced by the pressure of the plaintiffs: Haldeman <em>v. </em>Michael, 6 W. &amp; S. 128; Richards <em>v. </em>Nixon, 8 Harris 24; Hilliard on Bankruptcy 342; James on Bankruptcy 161, 165.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-11\"><em>O. O. Trantum, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALq\">An execution is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>for security, but to enforce payment: Truitt <em>v. </em>Ludwig, 1 Casey 149. The right of the assignee relates to the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy: Bankrupt Act of 1867, \u00a7 14; Ex parte Foster, 2 Story 131. The seal to the agreement imports a consideration: Yard <em>v. </em>Patton, 1 Harris 285. As to Hanley\u2019s contemplating bankruptcy \u2014 a party is presumed to contemplate the natural result of his acts: Everett <em>v. </em>Stone, 3 Story 451; Hilliard on Bankruptcy 336, 344; Ex parte Bailey, 19 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 51.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered, May 11th 1869, by</p>\n<author id=\"b420-7\">Agnew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP1\">It. seems to us there was no substantial error in the charge of the court in this case. The agreement of the 6th of August 1867 between Hanley and Pierce and Green certainly operated as an abandonment of the executions of Pierce &amp; Neyhart and of Green. They were inconsistent and could not stand together. The goods were to be sold by the plaintiffs and not by the sheriff \u2014 it was to be by private and not public sale, and without the notice that the law requires. If anything is settled it is that sheriff\u2019s sales must be public and not private, and on the notice required by law: Gibbs <em>v. </em>Neeley, 7 Watts 305; Bingham <em>v. </em>Young, 10 Barr 396; Keyser\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 411; Ricketts <em>v. </em>Unangst, 3 Id. 90; McMichael <em>v. </em>McDermott, 5 Id. 353. The tendency of all arrangements for a private sale under execution is to fraud, and hence it is against public policy. The proceeds of the sales were to be paid to the plaintiffs and not to the sheriff, as argued for the plaintiffs in error. The residue of the goods not needed for satisfaction of the claims was to be returned to Hanley, and indeed the whole scheme of the agreement was aside from the proceeding upon the writs. The writs were referred to in the agreement only for the purpose of description, to identify the claims of the plaintiffs. The objection that there was no consideration for the agreement is untenable. The covenants were mutual and the writing was under seal. The fact that the property was levied in execution does not alter the case. The plaintiffs chose to take a present private transfer and possession; in lieu of a future official sale at public auction, for reasons they deemed most beneficial to themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Upon a careful examination of the whole charge we do not think that the portion set forth in the 3d assignment of error was a binding legal instruction to the jury that Hanley contemplated bankruptcy at the time of the agreement. It was certainly a pretty strong assertion of the opinion of the judge on the question of fact, but what follows it immediately, as well as the answer to the defendant\u2019s 6th point, and other portions of the charge show that the court left the question as to the agreement being made in contemplation of bankruptcy by Hanley, as a fact to be found by the jury. The plaintiffs in error have not furnished us with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>testimony bearing on this question, but as we find the facts stated by the judge in his charge, and by the defendant in error, it would seem beyond question that Hanley was largely insolvent before he gave the judgments to the plaintiffs. The allegation of the fact of bankruptcy, and that the judgments were given and the agreement entered into in order to prefer the plaintiffs set forth in the creditors\u2019 petition; Hanley\u2019s default and the decree against him thereupon by the bankrupt court, were certainly sufficient to justify a very strong assertion of opinion on part of the judge unless it were meant to be binding on the jury. But we think the whole charge could not be misunderstood by the jury, and this fact was therefore submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Nor do we discover any error in the portions assigned for error in the 4th and 5th assignments. Clearly the transfer of all of Hanley\u2019s goods and the lease of the storehouse in which they were kept, and putting others into possession with authority to sell all his stock, and apply the proceeds to the payment of debts in execution, was not in the usual course of business; did break up his business; and was not only some, but very strong evidence of an intent to prefer these creditors, Hanley being at the time clearly insolvent. What is the usual course of a retail merchant\u2019s business ? It is to sell his goods at his usual place of business to customers as they come, to keep up an ordinary stock and continue in business in the usual way that such merchants do. Certainly it is not in the usual course of a retail merchant\u2019s business when in a state of actual insolvency to confess judgment to certain creditors, suffer executions to be levied by them, and. then to assign over to them all his stock and his place of business, put them in possession, and provide that the surplus over payment of their claims shall be returned to himself. Such a state of facts undoubtedly did justify the court in saying that it was required to be rebutted by some evidence that the transaction was not intended as an undue preference contrary to the provisions of the Bankrupt Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
