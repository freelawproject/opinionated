J., the persons appearing as subscribing witnesses to the bond having been called by the plaintiff, testified, that the respective signatures were theirs, but that they were not present when the bond was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>signed. The plaintiff then called George Shimer who on his <em>voir dire </em>testified, that he was member of the board of school directors when the bond was received by the board ; the bond was deposited with the president and the board, he being a member, directed this suit to be brought. The defendants objected to the examination of the witness in chief, on the ground that he might be liable to the district on a failure to recover in this suit. The witness was rejected and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">The plaintiff called William Apple, who, on his <em>voir </em>dire, testified that he was a school director when the bond was received by the board. The defendant objected to the examination of the witness in chief. The court rejected the witness, and sealed a bill of exceptions. The plaintiff then called William Bush, the principal in the bond. The defendants objected to his admission, and showed a record of his conviction for embezzlement, at April Sessions 1866, his sentence of imprisonment for one year, and his imprisonment accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\">The court excluded the witness and sealed a bill of exceptions. There was evidence tending to. show the due execution of the bond. There were also other offers of evidence, which were rejected and bills of exception sealed, but which it is not important to notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-8\">The plaintiff then offered the bond in evidence. Its admission was objected to by the defendants:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-9\">1st. Because the execution of the bond is not sufficiently proved. And 2d. Because it is not such an instrument as will sustain an action against the sureties, the names of the sureties not having been inserted in the body of the bond; which objection was'sustained by the court and the bond rejected, and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-10\">Under the direction of the court, the jury found a verdict for the defendants.

Bush,\u201d and purported to be signed and sealed by him and the four other defendants. This is a joint and several obligation of the five defendants: Knisley <em>v. </em>Shenberger, 7 Watts 193; Parks <em>v. </em>Brinkerhoff, 2 Hill 663; Smith <em>v. </em>Crooker, 5 Mass. 538, 540; Ex parte Fulton, 7 Cowen 484. \u201c Thus, if the words are \u2018 I promise to pay,\u2019 and there are many promissors, it is the several promise and the joint promise of all:\u201d Parsons on Notes and Bills 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">George Shimer was called as a witness by the plaintiff, and on his <em>voir dire </em>testified that he was a school director and officer of the board of the school district of Saucon township. The plaintiff thereupon proposed to examine the witness in chief, but the defendants, by their counsel, objected on the ground that the witness might be liable to the district in the event of a failure to recover on the bond, which objection was sustained by the court and the evidence rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">The manner of the objection was hasty, as it did not permit the plaintiff to state what he proposed to prove by the witness, and the decision of the court entirely prevented it, by ruling that he could not be a witness for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">The bond, on its face, was a valid one, and nothing had been alleged or proved to show it was otherwise. It is, however, clear that the remote contingency of possible liability on the part of the witness was not such an interest as to render him incompetent to testify. He was therefore improperly rejected, as also was William Apple.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">As this cause must go back for trial, it is not necessary to express a positive opinion as to the rejection of William H. Bush, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>as both sides will be prepared to prove his actual <em>status, </em>and, if necessary, a pardon will no doubt be procured to make him a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In the stage of the cause at which the questions were asked which form the subjects of the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th specifications of error, they do not appear to have any such relevancy as could make them in any way material to the plaintiff or the case, and therefore the court did the plaintiff no injury in rejecting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Our opinion as to the form of the bond is expressed in the commencement of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
