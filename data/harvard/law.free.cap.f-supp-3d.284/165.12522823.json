INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The plaintiff, Anwar Shakir, Sr., (\"Shakir\"), is currently incarcerated at Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institution, in Uncasville, Connecticut. He brings this civil rights action\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pursuant to section 1915 of title 28 of the United States Code against Derby Police Detective Charles Stankye, Department of Children and Families (\"DCF\") Supervisor Kathie Marotta, and DCF Social Worker Michele Fratta.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\") (Doc. No. 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before the court is a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Fratta and Marotta and a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Stankye.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fratta and Marotta Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Fratta MFSJ\") (Doc. No. 198); Stankye Motion\n   for Summary Judgment (\"Stankye MFSJ\") (Doc. No. 201). For the reasons below, Fratta and Marotta's Motion is granted, and Stankye's Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 15, 2011, Shakir filed a Complaint against Stankye, Marotta, Fratta, the Derby Police Department, and Assistant State's Attorney Charles Stango.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (\"Compl.\") (Doc. No. 1). On March 31, 2015, the court granted a Motion to Dismiss all claims against Stango.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruling Granting Stango's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 101). On April 27, 2015, Shakir filed an Amended Complaint naming only Stankye, Marotta, and Fratta as defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. The court then denied Shakir's Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint to clarify some of the allegations in his first Amended Complaint and to add additional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruling (Doc. No. 175). Thus, the first Amended Complaint remains the operative complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 31, 2016, the court granted in part and denied in part a Motion to Dismiss filed by Stankye and a separate Motion to Dismiss filed by Fratta and Marotta.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruling on Stankye's Motion to Dismiss (\"Ruling on Stankye MTD\") (Doc. No. 176); Ruling on Fratta and Marotta's Motion to Dismiss (\"Ruling on Fratta MTD\") (Doc. No. 177). Following these Rulings, Shakir's federal conspiracy claim, his Fourth Amendment search and seizure claims, his Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process claims, and his Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim remain pending against Stankye in his individual capacity, and Shakir's claim for declaratory relief remains pending against Stankye in his official capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruling on Stankye MTD. Against Fratta and Marotta, the claims that remain pending are Shakir's Fourteenth Amendment procedural and substantive due process claims and his federal conspiracy claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruling on Fratta MTD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On September 26, 2016, Stankye filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, and Fratta and Marotta filed a separate Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye MFSJ; Fratta MFSJ. The court addresses both Motions together in this Ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On May 5, 2017, the court appointed\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel for Shakir.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Appointing Pro Bono Counsel (Doc. No. 303). The court granted Shakir's Oral Motion to Reopen Discovery (Doc. No. 314) to give counsel an opportunity to conduct and file supplemental briefs on behalf of Shakir.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry (Doc. No. 315). After the reopened discovery period expired, Shakir filed a Declaration of additional evidence, but counsel did not file any supplemental briefings on his behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration by Plaintiff to Provide Court with Additional Evidence (\"Pl.'s Suppl. Decl.\") (Doc. No. 320). Having received no supplemental briefings, the court decides the Motions for Summary Judgment based on Shakir's initial\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order (Doc. No. 324).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A motion for summary judgment may be granted only where \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Summary judgment is inappropriate when the admissible materials in the record make it arguable that the claim has merit, for the court in considering such a motion must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Rogoz v.

(Fratta) at 3 \u00b6 10. In December of 2008, Gandy returned temporarily to Connecticut and, on January 5, 2009, she reported to Stankye that Shakir had sexually assaulted T.G. when they had lived together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fratta L.R. 56(a)1 at 3 \u00b6 7; Stankye L.R. 56(a)1 at 1 \u00b6 2; Plaintiff's Local Rule 56(a)2 Statement of Facts in Response to Stankye's MFSJ (\"Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Stankye\") (Doc.

Stankye reported Gandy's allegations to DCF, and Marotta assigned Fratta to investigate the allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye L.R. 56(a)1 at 1 \u00b6 3; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Stankye at 3 \u00b6 3; Fratta L.R. 56(a)1 at 1 \u00b6 3.

It also stated that Shakir would \"allow [A.S.] to stay with his paternal grandmother pending further investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Service Agreement. The parties do not dispute that the signed agreement contains this language, but do disagree as to the interpretation of the requirement. Fratta and Stankye interpret the agreement to require\n   A.S. to stay with Shakir's mother, Khalila Shakir Browning, and to require Browning to care for A.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye L.R. 56(a)1 at 3 \u00b6 9; Fratta L.R. 56(a)1 at 8 \u00b6 32.

In response to Shakir's question, \"Do you\n   <em>\n    deny\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    admit\n   </em>\n   that you told the officers to leave Anwar, Jr. with the plaintiff's ex, as long as she does not leave CT, she can have Anwar in her care?,\" Marotta answered, \"Deny in part and admit in part. DCF Hotline received a phone call from New Haven Police Officer Mastriano\n   and he reported the paternal grandmother was attempting to get Anwar, Jr. back in her care.\" Pl.'s Exhibits, Ex. A1 at 4. Her statement admits neither that the alleged statement was made nor that she was the one who spoke with Officer Mastriano. Shakir attempts to reason that her answer supports an inference that she made the statement because it is not a straight denial, as is Fratta's answer to the same question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 60. This reasoning, however, misreads Marotta's answer and relies purely on speculation. Therefore, as neither Marotta's answer nor Shakir's Affidavit presents admissible evidence that Marotta spoke with either NHPD officer, Shakir has not raised a genuine issue of fact that Marotta directly participated in a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Under the second\n   <em>\n    Colon\n   </em>\n   category, Shakir argues in the alternative that Marotta was aware of the conspiracy to violate his constitutional rights and failed to remedy the violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-62. Again, however, he has not introduced admissible evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to her awareness of the key components of the alleged conspiracy or underlying constitutional violations. In her Affidavit and answers to Shakir's interrogatories, Marotta denies being informed by Stankye of the arrest warrant prior to its execution, agreeing to or participating in the interview of A.S. at the police department, or being aware of Gandy's plans to leave Connecticut with A.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exhibits, Ex. A1 at 3, 5; Marotta Aff. at 5 \u00b6\u00b6 22-25. She avers that she was only informed of the arrest, interview, and release of A.S. to Gandy after the fact, in the late afternoon on February 6, 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Marotta Aff. at 5 \u00b6 23. Even then, she does not admit to knowledge of any plans for relocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   She was, however, aware of Grayson's decision to advise Gandy to contact the police department if Shakir attempted to retake A.S. after his release on bond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 \u00b6 24. None of this information, relayed after the fact, was communicated as a report or appeal to alert her to a constitutional violation. Based on this limited information alone, Marotta would not have been reasonably apprised that a violation was occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Shakir has introduced no admissible evidence contradicting Marotta's Affidavit. He cites Stankye's deposition as evidence that Stankye told Marotta about the arrest warrant, but Stankye's deposition states merely that he called \"DCF\" and does not specify to whom at DCF Stankye spoke.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 60-61; Pl.'s Exhibits, Ex. H at 88-89. Shakir presents no corroborating evidence indicating that person was Marotta. Additionally, he attempts to reason from the fact that Marotta was Fratta's supervisor that Fratta conveyed all of the information of which she was aware to Marotta.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 61-62. This assumption, however, is unfounded, has no evidentiary basis, and relies on speculation, as Shakir has no personal knowledge of what information was or was not communicated between Fratta and Marotta. Moreover, there is no evidence that Marotta received a report of any wrongdoing or unconstitutional action. Therefore, Shakir has not created a genuine issue of material fact that Marotta was informed of a constitutional violation that had to be remedied. Her failure to take action to remedy a violation of which she was not sufficiently aware cannot be the basis for a finding of personal involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, Shakir argues that Marotta created a policy or custom that sanctioned the constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 62-66. Shakir mistakenly cites\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), to support his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp to Fratta\n   at 62-66. However,\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   establishes the standard for finding municipal liability, not supervisory liability, and therefore is not applicable to Marotta. Additionally, Shakir has introduced no evidence of a policy or custom created by Marotta. Instead, he again relies on the actions of Fratta and attributes them to Marotta merely because Fratta was under Marotta's supervision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-63. As noted above, he presents no evidence that Marotta authorized Fratta's conduct, including the interview of A.S. or the release of A.S. to Gandy. Therefore, Shakir has raised no general issue of material fact as to whether Marotta created a policy or custom permitting the constitutional violation he alleges occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Because Shakir has offered no evidence on which a reasonable jury could find that Marotta was personally involved in the deprivation of Shakir's rights under any of the three categories for supervisory liability, no genuine issue of material fact exists as to Marotta's liability, and she is entitled to summary judgment. Accordingly, Fratta and Marotta's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted as to all claims against Marotta. The remainder of the Ruling only addresses claims as to Fratta and Stankye.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Due Process (Fratta and Stankye)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Shakir claims that Stankye and Fratta violated his procedural due process rights by depriving him of custody of A.S. without a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 14 \u00b6 55, 17-18 \u00b6 65. Stankye and Fratta both argue in their respective Motions for Summary Judgment that their conduct did not constitute a deprivation of custody and thus did not implicate Shakir's procedural due process rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye Mem. in Supp. at 12-13; Fratta Mem. in Supp. at 19-26. Stankye additionally argues that, even if his conduct did implicate Shakir's due process rights, those rights were not violated because a pre-deprivation hearing was unnecessary due to emergency circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye Mem. in Supp. at 13-16. Finally, both Stankye and Fratta argue that, even if a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether their conduct violated Shakir's due process rights, they are protected by qualified immunity because their conduct was objectively reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye Mem. in Supp. at 25-28; Fratta Mem. in Supp. at 37-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Although Shakir's Memoranda are not expressly clear, the court reads his argument liberally to identify four actions by which Shakir asserts that Stankye and/or Fratta deprived him of the custody, care, and management of A.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum in Opposition to Stankye's MFSJ (\"Mem. in Opp. to Stankye\") (Doc. No. 215-1) at 19-21; Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 16-43. First, Shakir argues that Stankye deprived him of custody by physically removing A.S. from his residence after Shakir's arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 19-20. The bulk of Shakir's argument against Stankye focuses on this conduct. Second, Shakir argues that Fratta's interview of A.S. at the DPD, which Stankye permitted and facilitated, deprived him of his liberty interest in the care and management of A.S. because he did not consent to the interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 34-36; Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 20-21. Third, Shakir argues that Stankye and/or Fratta improperly released A.S. into the custody of Gandy in violation of their Service Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 16-19; Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 21. Finally, Shakir argues that Stankye and Fratta conspired with Gandy to assist her in relocating A.S. to California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 52-59; Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 21.

In one instance, the Second Circuit did consider a due process claim when the children were removed from a neighbor's custody while the mother was receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment, but the case contained additional facts, such as emergency placement of the children and refusal to return the children after the mother was released, that went significantly beyond the actions taken by Stankye here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duchesne v.

First, Shakir's legal rights with respect to his son were not changed by Stankye's actions on February 6, 2009, nor does Shakir allege that they were. Although Gandy ultimately took his son to California, Shakir had recourse in state court to seek a court order regarding custody of A.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 46b-56(a). Second, Shakir did not have physical custody of A.S. at the time that Stankye removed A.S. from the residence and brought him to the police station.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shakir had already been arrested and taken into police custody by the time Stankye and the other officers entered the residence to search for A.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Aff. (Stankye) at 11-13 \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48-55; Stankye Aff. at 5 \u00b6\u00b6 19-23. Shakir himself states that he left A.S. in his brother's care before turning himself in.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Aff. (Stankye) at 13 \u00b6 55; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Stankye at 10 \u00b6 30(f); Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 30 (stating that \"he [Shakir] specifically left his son in the care of his brother, who was now Jr.'s [A.S.'s] guardian\"). This reflects Shakir's own awareness that he could not maintain physical custody of his son while he was detained in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Because Shakir does not claim to have had physical custody of A.S. at the time, then, he has not raised a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Stankye removed A.S. from his custody when he took A.S. from the house to the police station. Thus, the evidence, interpreted in the light most favorable to Shakir, is insufficient for a reasonable jury to find a deprivation of custody triggering due process, and Stankye is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Because there was no deprivation of custody, the court need not consider the parties' dispute over emergency circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Alternatively, even if Stankye's removal of A.S. from the house to the police station did deprive Shakir of a protected liberty interest, Stankye is entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity. Although Stankye focuses his qualified immunity argument on the second prong of objective reasonableness,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Stankye Mem. in Supp. at 27-28,\n   the court concludes that the first prong is more appropriate. Given the court's own difficulty in finding case law as to whether removal of a child after the parent has already been arrested constitutes a deprivation of custody, the court concludes that the law was not clearly established at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court is not aware of, nor has Shakir identified, any Second Circuit precedent holding that a removal under such circumstances deprives the plaintiff of a protected liberty interest under the Due Process Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the ambiguity in the law, Stankye is alternatively entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   3. Interview of A.S. at Derby Police Department\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Next, Shakir argues that Fratta's interview of A.S. at the Derby Police Department deprived him of the care and management of A.S. because it occurred without his consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 34-36; Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 20-21. It is undisputed that Fratta interviewed A.S. at the police station,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the parties do dispute who authorized the interview and the degree to which Stankye was involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye L.R. 56(a)1 at 8 \u00b6\u00b6 34-35; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Stankye at 11 \u00b6\u00b6 34-35; Fratta L.R. 56(a)1 at 11 \u00b6\u00b6 44-46; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Fratta at 27 \u00b6\u00b6 44-46. Again, however, because the court concludes that no genuine issue of fact exists as to whether Fratta's interview deprived Shakir of a protected liberty interest, the court need not determine whether the evidence in the record is sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to the issue of responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The court concludes as a matter of law that an unconsented interview by DCF, without more, does not amount to a deprivation of care or management under the Due Process Clause.

In this case, Fratta did not physically remove A.S., but merely conducted the interview at the police station where A.S. was already located after being taken there by Stankye. The court has already determined above that no deprivation of custody occurred when A.S. was removed from Shakir's house and brought to the police station. Therefore, only the interview itself is at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   While no court in this Circuit has considered an interview at a police station, a change in the location of the interview does not change its effects on the parent's rights. The court in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   reasoned that it had found no authority to support a conclusion that the right to care, custody, and management includes \"the parents' right to teach their children not to speak to strangers ... about their intimate home life and their private parts\" or \"the parents' right to be present to offer comfort and consolation to their child when being questioned.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278798\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/894/345/#p374\">\n    894 F.Supp.2d at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, such analysis focuses on the relationship of the interview to the parents' purported right, rather than on the location of the interview. Therefore, the court concludes that occurrence of the interview alone, regardless of location, does not raise a genuine issue as to whether Shakir was deprived of a protected liberty interest. Thus, Fratta is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Furthermore, even if Fratta's interview did deprive Shakir of his right to the care and management of A.S., Fratta is nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity because the law at the time had not clearly established that an interview alone-held in a location the child was already at-could constitute a deprivation of custody, care, or management that would trigger due process requirements. \"[O]utside of removal or the compulsory provision of medical care, the Second Circuit has not specified what other kinds of government action may violate a parent's protected liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of his or her child in the child abuse context.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278798\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/894/345/#p374\">\n    894 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   374 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    K.D. ex rel.

These decisions have not been reviewed by the Second Circuit. Therefore, relying only on Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent, the court cannot say that every reasonable officer at the time\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   would have known that interviewing a child at a police station without parental consent would require procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, Fratta is also entitled to summary judgment for the interview of A.S. on the ground of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   4. Release of A.S. to Gandy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Shakir also appears to challenge the defendants' decision to release A.S. into the custody of Gandy while Shakir was being detained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 17-18; Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 21. Again, it is undisputed that A.S. was transferred to Gandy's custody after his interview by Fratta, but the parties dispute who was responsible for authorizing Gandy to take custody of A.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye L.R. 56(a)1 at 9 \u00b6 36; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 at 11 \u00b6 36; Fratta L.R. 56(a)1 at 11-12 \u00b6\u00b6 48-57; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 at 28-31 \u00b6\u00b6 48-57. Stankye and Fratta argue that releasing A.S. to Gandy was appropriate and not a deprivation of Shakir's custody because Gandy was a joint guardian of A.S. with legal rights equal to those of Shakir.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fratta Mem. in Supp. at 22-26; Stankye Mem. in Supp. at 12-13. The court agrees with Stankye and Fratta that no deprivation of custody occurred and therefore needs not determine whether a genuine issue exists as to who authorized the release of A.S. to Gandy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Section 45a-606 of the Connecticut General Statutes states, \"The father and mother of every minor child are joint guardians of the person of the minor, and the powers, rights and duties of the father and the mother in regard to the minor shall be equal.\" Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 45a-606 (2017). The rights of guardianship include \"the obligation of care and control\" and \"the authority to make major decisions affecting the minor's education and welfare.\" Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 45a-604 (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, Shakir acknowledges that no court order had been issued altering the equal distribution of parental rights established by section 45a-606.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Stankye at 13 \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. Although Shakir had filed a petition in Derby Probate Court to remove Gandy as joint\n   guardian and to obtain sole or temporary custody of A.S. on December 31, 2008, the Derby Probate Court had not made a determination in the case by February 6, 2009, when Gandy received custody of A.S. at the police station.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Aff. (Stankye) at 5 \u00b6 21; Pl.'s Aff. (Fratta) at 10; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Stankye at 13 \u00b6 43; Shakir Dep. Tr. at 30-31. The probate court hearing did not occur until February 25, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fratta and Marotta L.R. 56(a)1 at 20 \u00b6 88; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Fratta at 41 \u00b6 88. Therefore, as of February 6, 2009, Gandy was a joint legal guardian of A.S. with rights equal to those of Shakir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Shakir argues to the contrary that Gandy's parental rights were diminished or eliminated because she had abandoned A.S. when she moved first to Kansas and then to California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 36, 43-44; Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 21-23. To support this argument, he cites section 45a-610 of the Connecticut General Statutes, which authorizes removal of a parent as guardian for grounds including abandonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta and Marotta at 36, 43; Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 45a-610(2) (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Shakir's reliance on this statute is misplaced because the statute only authorizes removal of the parent as guardian by the probate court on a finding of clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 45a-610 (\"If the Court of Probate finds that notice has been given or a waiver has been filed, ... it may remove a parent as guardian, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence one of the following ....\"). Absent a decision by the probate court, Shakir's arguments for abandonment do not alter Gandy's status as joint guardian, and therefore he has not raised a genuine issue of fact indicating that her parental rights were not equal to his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Thus, because Gandy was a joint guardian of A.S., Stankye and Fratta did not deprive Shakir of custody by releasing A.S. to Gandy while he was still detained at the police station. Shakir could not have taken physical custody of A.S. at the time that he was detained, and the transfer did not alter his legal rights, as he had recourse in probate court to ascertain the division of custodial rights with Gandy. That he was later unsatisfied with the probate court's decision does not change the court's analysis of Stankye and Fratta's conduct. Indeed, had they refused to release A.S. to Gandy, Stankye and Fratta may have been liable for interfering with her right to custody. Accordingly, Stankye and Fratta are entitled to summary judgment regarding these actions because no genuine issue of fact exists as to whether they deprived Shakir of a protected liberty interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Alternatively, even if Stankye and Fratta did deprive Shakir of custody by releasing A.S. to Gandy, the law was not clearly established at the time that such conduct would constitute a deprivation of custody\n   triggering Shakir's procedural due process rights. The court is not aware of-nor has Shakir pointed the court to-any Supreme Court or Second Circuit precedent that releasing a child to one parent, who has joint legal custody, deprives the other parent of his or her custodial rights. At most, the court has identified some district courts in the Ninth Circuit that have considered the question, but these courts do not clearly enunciate a rule, nor can they provide clearly established law for courts in this District for qualified immunity purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dees v.

Stankye and Fratta are entitled to summary judgment on this ground as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   5. Conspiracy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Finally, Shakir argues that Stankye and Fratta conspired with Gandy to deprive him of custody of A.S. by facilitating A.S.'s relocation to California with Gandy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Fratta at 52-59; Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 21. Among other things, Shakir cites as evidence of the conspiracy the fact that Stankye and Fratta were aware that Gandy planned to take A.S. to California after assuming custody of him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exhibits, Ex. Z at 2; Pl.'s Exhibits, Ex. J at 3, 5. Shakir also points to evidence that Stankye advised Fratta and Gandy to leave the police department before Browning arrived to avoid an altercation, as well as evidence that Fratta advised Gandy to call the police should Shakir attempt to retake custody of his son.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exhibits, Ex. Z at 3-4; Fratta Aff. at 14 \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   First, Stankye and Fratta argue that Shakir has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that his due process rights were violated, which precludes a claim of conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fratta Mem. in Supp. at 30; Stankye Mem. in Supp. at 22-23. Second, they argue that, even if his rights were violated, Shakir has failed to present evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact that the defendants reached an agreement to violate those rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fratta Mem. in Supp. at 31-32; Stankye Mem. in Supp. at 24-25. Finally, Stankye and Fratta argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity because their actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fratta Mem. in Supp. at 35-39; Stankye Mem. in Supp. at 25-28. The court agrees that Shakir has not presented evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact that his underlying due process rights were violated. Therefore, the court considers it unnecessary to decide whether he raises a genuine issue as to the existence of an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   A conspiracy claim under section 1983 has three elements: \"(1) an agreement between a state actor and a private party; (2) to act in concert to inflict an unconstitutional injury; and (3) an overt act done in furtherance of that goal causing damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Ciambriello v.

Additionally, a plaintiff must prove an actual violation of the underlying constitutional right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singer v. Fulton Cty.

Therefore, the deprivation of custody that he alleges must hinge on Gandy's decision to relocate A.S. to California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Shakir, however, has pointed the court to no case law indicating that one parent's decision to relocate a child deprives the other parent of a protected liberty interest, such that procedural due process requirements are triggered. In most such instances, the Fourteenth Amendment is not a relevant consideration because such actions are taken by the parent, a private actor, rather than by the state. Therefore, the court has little guidance from precedent in determining whether a child's relocation with the other parent is a deprivation requiring due process when state actors facilitate or assist with the relocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In the absence of guidance from Fourteenth Amendment cases, the court finds instructive the existence of state law restrictions on relocation that apply in some instances, but not others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   For instance, when a court order has determined the division of custody between two parents and one parent seeks to relocate with the child, the Connecticut General Statutes require the relocating parent to bear the burden of justifying the relocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Conn. Gen. Stat. 46b-56d(a) (2017). Such statute, however, is limited to proceedings \"before the Superior Court arising after the entry of a judgment awarding custody of a minor child and involving the relocation of either parent with the child, where such relocation would have a significant impact on the existing parenting plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057535\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/106/#p109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, when an action for custody of a minor child is pending before the Connecticut Superior Court, its Rules require entry of an automatic order in an action for custody of a minor child that requires,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"[n]either party shall permanently remove the minor child or children from the state of Connecticut, without written consent of the other or order of a judicial authority\" while the action is pending. Conn. R. Super. Ct. Fam. Sec. 25-5; Conn. R. Super. Ct. Fam. Sec. 25-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Neither of these rules applies in Shakir's case. Shakir acknowledges that, at all times relevant to this case, no formal court order existed governing his and Gandy's custodial relationship to A.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shakir Dep. Tr. at 120. Thus, Gandy was not required, pursuant to section 46b-56d, to seek court approval before relocating with A.S. Additionally, the custody proceeding\n   Shakir initiated on December 31, 2008, was in Derby Probate Court rather than a Connecticut Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shakir Aff. (Fratta) at 10; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Stankye at 13 \u00b6 43 Thus, the automatic order required by Connecticut Superior Court Rules did not apply, nor has Shakir introduced evidence that a similar order was issued by the Derby Probate Court in his case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, then, where neither rule applies, state family law is silent on where a child should live or whether a parent can relocate. Nothing indicates that Gandy was not within her rights as A.S.'s parent and guardian to move him to California. Nor has Shakir alleged that Gandy refused to permit him to see or contact A.S since the relocation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Gandy's relocation with A.S. in no way terminated or altered Shakir's legal rights.

Nor has Shakir pointed the court to any such case law. Thus, even if Stankye and Fratta reached an understanding with Gandy to assist her in taking A.S. to California, those facts do not raise a genuine issue as to whether they conspired to violate Shakir's constitutional rights because Gandy's removal of A.S. did not deprive Shakir of a protected liberty interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Additionally, given the lack of precedent in the case law, even if assisting Gandy was a deprivation of custody requiring due process, the law was not clearly established at the time.

Therefore, Stankye and Fratta are entitled to summary judgment on Shakir's substantive due process claims on the same grounds as his procedural due process claims. Additionally, in the alternative, they are also entitled to qualified immunity for the same reasons because\n   the law was not clearly established as to whether their conduct constituted a deprivation of a protected liberty interest.

Instead, he contends that the court should appoint him counsel and permit counsel to add his son as a plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 33-35.

On March 31, 2016, the court denied his Motion to Amend because Shakir, as a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   party and non-attorney, could not assert claims in order to vindicate the constitutional rights of his son.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruling Denying Motion to Amend (Doc.

Tr. at 101. Instead, he argues that his rights were violated by Stankye's conduct during his detention at the DPD after his arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 37-39. Shakir alleges that Stankye ordered him to strip down to one layer of clothing, taunted him, placed him in a holding cell, and turned up the air conditioning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 13 \u00b6 52, at 15 \u00b6 56; Shakir Dep. Tr. at 89-90; Pl.'s Aff. (Stankye) at 14-15 \u00b6\u00b6 63-68. Shakir alleges that he became sick as a result of the cold temperatures in his cell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 13 \u00b6 52., Pl.'s Aff. (Stankye) at 14 \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Shakir has presented sufficient admissible evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Stankye made him strip down to one layer of clothing, but not as to whether Stankye turned on the air conditioning. Stankye avers in his Affidavit that he did not \"transport plaintiff from his residence to the DPD,\" \"play any role in his booking and processing on February 6, 2009,\" or \"have any contact with plaintiff at the DPD on February 6, 2009.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye Aff. at 6 \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Shakir offers evidence in part to the contrary in his own Affidavit. He states that, after being taken to the holding area at the DPD, Stankye made him strip of his clothing down to his underwear and took his clothing away from him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Aff. (Stankye) at 14 \u00b6\u00b6 63, 65. Shakir then avers that he was left in his cell without his clothes when the air conditioning was turned on.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Aff. (Stankye) at 14 \u00b6 67; Shakir Dep. Tr. at 86. Thus, Shakir's Affidavit and deposition transcript are sufficient to raise a genuine issue as to whether Stankye caused him to strip down to his underwear and left him in the holding cell without his clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   As to Stankye's responsibility for causing the cold temperature in Shakir's cell, however, the court concludes that there is no genuine factual dispute. Stankye states in his Affidavit that he did not adjust the air-conditioning on that date, did not know how to do so, did not order anyone else to do so, and did not have any knowledge that anyone had done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stankye Aff. at 6 \u00b6 30. Shakir presents no admissible evidence that contradicts these facts. Rather, his deposition testimony asserts merely that he knew the air conditioner\n   had been turned on because he could feel the change in temperature and hear the sound of the air conditioner working.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shakir Dep. Tr. at 90-91. He testified that he did not see Stankye or anyone else actually turn on the air conditioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 90. In his Affidavit, Shakir claims to know that Stankye turned on the air conditioner,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Aff. (Stankye) at 14 \u00b6 67, but he lacks personal knowledge to testify to that fact. Instead, his deposition testimony reveals that his basis for that alleged knowledge is merely an inference drawn from Stankye's prior conduct toward him, which Shakir's describes as \"vulgar.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shakir Dep. Tr. at 89-90. He similarly attempts to reason from the fact that Stankye gave orders to the officers at his residence earlier that day that Stankye was also in charge of his cell conditions at the DPD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)1 to Stankye at 12 \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The court concludes that Shakir's inference is unsupported because other officers were also present at the station and could have been responsible for the change in temperature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Aff. (Stankye) at 14-15 \u00b6 68; Mem. in Opp. to Stankye at 38. Nor does the court believe that a detective's authority over the execution of an arrest warrant necessarily translates to authority over the conditions of holding cells at the police station. Combining this with Shakir's lack of personal knowledge, the court concludes that Shakir has not presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Stankye was responsible for air conditioning in Shakir's cell. Accordingly, the court considers Shakir's Fourth Amendment claim solely on his allegation that Stankye required him to strip and left him in his cell without clothing in the winter time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Courts in this Circuit have held, under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment standard, that requiring a detainee to strip and endure a \"prolonged period\" of cold is an unconstitutional condition of confinement, but that temporary deprivation of clothing and exposure to cold is not.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Although countervailing government interests in maintaining security may require a strip search for weapons or contraband under certain conditions, a jury could reasonably conclude that, even if the strip search was objectively reasonable, the security interest does not extend after the search has been completed and no weapons have been found.

Thus, a genuine issue exists as to whether Stankye was aware of the doctor's appointment, but the court considers this fact only of minimal relevance to the question of exigent circumstances because, in either case, it is A.S.'s absence from school that contributes to Stankye's concern about his whereabouts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    Shakir also argues that another genuine dispute exists as to whether Stankye was aware at the time that the adult male in the house was Shakir's brother, but the court concludes that there is no genuine dispute as to this fact because the evidence Shakir relies on to raise this issue would not be admissible at trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Stankye L.R. 56(a)1 at 8 \u00b6 31; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 to Stankye at 10 \u00b6 31.
