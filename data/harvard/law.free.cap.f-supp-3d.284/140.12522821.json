The charges arose from a \"sting\" operation in which Mr. Prout, his co-defendant, and a confidential informant (\"CI\") planned to rob a heroin stash house. Pursuant to a written Plea Agreement, Mr. Prout pled guilty to Counts I, III, and IV. Count II was dismissed by the Government. Mr. Prout was sentenced on March 9, 2016, to a term of imprisonment of 156 months. An Amended Judgment was entered on March 11, 2016. Under the terms of the Plea Agreement, Mr. Prout did not appeal the judgment of conviction or sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Prout timely filed the instant Motion to Vacate on March 10, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
