The final clause, highlighted above, is known as the \"residual clause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In June 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/#p2557\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2555-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a consequence, the scope of offenses constituting violent felonies narrowed considerably. In the wake of the\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   decision, a prior conviction only qualifies as a violent felony if it either (1) \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\" (the \"elements clause,\"); or (2) \"is burglary, arson, or extortion, [or] involves the use of explosives,\" (the \"enumerated offenses.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Courts use the \"categorical approach\" to determine whether a prior conviction is a predicate offense under the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Using the categorical approach, courts \"compare the elements of the statute forming the basis of the defendant's conviction with the elements of the 'generic' crime-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the offense as commonly understood.\"\n   <em>\n    Descamps v.
