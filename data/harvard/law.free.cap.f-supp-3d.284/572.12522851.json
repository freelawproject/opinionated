Am. Comp. \u00b6 10. In September 2008, the plaintiff injured his right rotator cuff in a motorcycle accident and was placed on paid sick leave for approximately one month and then on light duty until December 2008, when he returned to full duty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.

City of New York\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Braun I\n   </em>\n   \"), 2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 6269, at *1 (N.Y. Co. Sept. 10, 2014). In his opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss, the plaintiff alleges that BITS officers subsequently visited him while he was incarcerated after his arrest. Braun Decl. at 1. On November 22, 2010, the plaintiff pleaded guilty in federal court to two felony counts of conspiracy to distribute marijuana and ecstasy.\n   <em>\n    Braun I\n   </em>\n   , 2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 6269, at *1. The plaintiff did not report his guilty plea to the FDNY. The records relating to the plaintiff's criminal proceedings were initially sealed. Thereafter, by an order dated March 31, 2014, Judge Edward R. Korman of the Eastern District of New York unsealed the records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about March 4, 2011, approximately three months after the plaintiff's guilty plea, the FDNY Medical Committee examined the plaintiff and found him permanently unfit for duty as a firefighter due to his previous injuries. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; Lichtmacher Decl. Ex. 5. The plaintiff alleges that this was the first of three stages necessary to receive permanent disability benefits, known as Disability Retirement. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. The plaintiff did not complete the subsequent two stages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By letter dated December 9, 2013, the FDNY informed the plaintiff that pursuant to New York Public Officers Law \u00a7 30(1)(e) he had vacated his position as a firefighter by virtue of his guilty plea. Lichtmacher Decl. Ex. 3. The plaintiff alleges that on or about December 10, 2013, he showed up to work and was informed that his employment had been terminated. Am. Compl. \u00b6 25. On or about February 8, 2014, the plaintiff again submitted an application for Disability Retirement, which the FDNY denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 27, 2013, as part of a BITS investigation of the plaintiff's arrest, the plaintiff testified that he understood that if he pleaded guilty or was convicted of a felony, he forfeited his position as a firefighter by operation of the New York Public Officers Law.\n   <em>\n    Braun I\n   </em>\n   , 2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 6269, at *2. However, the plaintiff refused to answer questions about his guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. The plaintiff alleges that in connection with the BITS investigation, the defendants showed the plaintiff records from the plaintiff's criminal\n   case. Am. Compl. \u00b6 34. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants refused to grant him access to those records and to medical records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 17, 2014, the plaintiff commenced an action in New York State Supreme Court under Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, seeking all documents upon which the defendants based his termination as a firefighter, and alleging that the FDNY had improperly failed to act on his application for disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braun I\n   </em>\n   , 2014 N.Y.

By an order dated September 10, 2014, the\n   <em>\n    Braun I\n   </em>\n   court dismissed the plaintiff's action and dismissed his application for disclosure of records because the plaintiff had not demonstrated that a valid cause of action existed for the termination of his employment, the denial of his application for Disability Retirement, or for the violation of any right to privacy in his criminal records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8.

Charter \u00a7 396. The plaintiff's claims are therefore construed to have been brought against the City and Assistant Commissioner of BITS Wallace.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Public Officers Law \u00a7 30(1)(e) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    1. Every office shall be vacant upon the happening of one of the following events before the expiration of the term thereof:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    e.

Because of the disposition in this Opinion, it is unnecessary to reach that argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    As explained above, this claim is also barred by collateral estoppel as a result of\n    <em>\n     Braun I\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
