The court also emphasized that Commerce did not, with sufficient clarity, explain why it deviated from its practice of \"requiring that the government either actually appoint management or be directly or indirectly involved in the management of the company,\" relying instead \"solely upon the government's potential to nominate a manager or a board member with control over day-to-day company operations.\"\n   <em>\n    An Giang\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201256\">\n    203 F.Supp.3d at 1291-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

In both Steel Wire Rod Decision Memo and Tetra Decision Memo, Commerce explained that a majority government shareholder will not be able to rebut the presumption of government control because it is reasonable to assume that, notwithstanding a lack of evidence of actual control, the majority shareholder is constantly in possession of the ability to exercise actual control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Steel Wire Rod Decision Memo at 6-7; Tetra Decision Memo at 8.\n   On remand, Commerce explains that despite the Defendant's prior statement at oral argument that Plaintiff has to rebut the presumption of actual control to obtain a separate rate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument at 01:14:26-01:14:28, Dec. 8, 2016, ECF No. 120,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the separate rate test is only satisfied upon a respondent rebutting the potential of control by the minority government shareholder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.

Where a majority shareholder has potential control that control is, for all intents and purposes, actual control. In such a situation actual control is inherent in the fact that the majority shareholder can typically control the operations of a company without actually removing directors or management since it is clear that directors or management could be removed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Advanced Technology &amp; Materials Co. v.

However, the phrase \"potential control\" suggests something less than actual control and, when used in a case such as here where the government is only a minority shareholder, the phrase \"potential control\" could be taken to mean something less than the ability to actually direct management. Commerce's practice has been to find that government minority ownership alone does not preclude the ability to rebut the presumption of control, whether that control be termed \"actual\" or \"potential.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 53-Foot Domestic Dry Containers from the [PRC]: Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value at 48-53, A-570-014, (Apr. 10, 2015),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://enforcement.trade.gov/frn/summary/prc/2015-08903-1.pdf (last visited Jan. 16, 2018) (\"Containers Decision Memo\"); Truck and Bus Tires from the [PRC]: Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Affirmative Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Critical Circumstances at 10, A-570-040, (Jan. 19, 2017),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://enforcement.trade.gov/frn/summary/prc/2017-01861-1.pdf (last visited Jan. 16, 2018) (\"Truck &amp; Bus Tires Decision Memo\"). Here, Commerce cites to Containers Decision Memo and Truck &amp; Bus Tires Decision Memo as examples of prior determinations where the separate rate test was applied to a government shareholder with minority ownership.\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 5 (citing Containers Decision Memo at 43-53; Truck &amp; Bus Tires Decision Memo at 8-10). However, in both determinations, Commerce relies on more than the presence of government-owned minority shareholders, and cites to record evidence demonstrating how the minority shareholders may exert actual control over the respondent company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Containers Decision Memo at 49-50; Truck &amp; Bus Tires Decision Memo at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Indeed, Commerce has required additional indicia of control prior to concluding that a respondent company could not rebut the presumption of de facto government control where the government owns, either directly or indirectly, only a minority of shares in the respondent company. In Containers\n   Decision Memo, Commerce determined that China Merchants Group (\"CMG\") and COSCO, shareholders in the respondent company, were able to exercise de facto control despite being minority shareholders with 48.26 percent of the capital shares. Containers Decision Memo at 48-53. Commerce found that the two minority shareholders were each wholly-owned by the government and that the total number of shares between the two shareholders made the government a \"controlling shareholder,\" per the respondent company's Articles of Association.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In Truck &amp; Bus Tires Decision Memo, Commerce likewise found de facto control by the government-owned minority shareholders. Truck &amp; Bus Tires Decision Memo at 9-10. Commerce determined that four of the respondent company's shareholders were owned by a State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (\"SASAC\"), and together held 49.06 percent of the respondent company's total shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. In reaching that determination, Commerce found it relevant that \"there [was] additional information on the record which is business proprietary that further supports our determination that [the respondent company] is under the PRC government control through its [state-owned enterprise] owners.\" Truck &amp; Bus Tires Decision Memo at 10. Commerce did not refer to the potential for control, and in fact, only addressed potential control in the context of a majority government shareholder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13, 20-24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, because of this prior practice of requiring more indicia of control in minority situations, Commerce cannot focus solely on potentiality here, without more. Without more, \"potential control\" suggests the potential to influence management rather than the potential to actually control management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    An Giang\n   </em>\n   , the court remanded for further explanation or reconsideration Commerce's determination that CASEAMEX failed to demonstrate autonomy in its selection of management. Specifically, the court stated that it was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   unclear whether Commerce relied upon the potential for the government to nominate an individual to CASEAMEX's board or to management based on its ownership in the company alone, or whether Commerce found that the government indirectly nominated all of its board members and managers by nominating a representative who appointed [ [ ] ] board members and managers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    An Giang\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201256\">\n    203 F.Supp.3d at 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).

The court does not find Commerce's reliance on retrospective evidence of actions taken by the minority government shareholder at the formation of CASEAMEX persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Commerce's retrospective argument is based on the minority government shareholder's actions when it divested Can Tho Agriculture and Animal Products Import-Export Company, a state-owned enterprise, to create CASEAMEX.\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 8-11. Commerce argues that at the time of divestment, the minority government shareholder put in place the board of directors that continued to exist throughout the POR, and chose Mr. X as the person through whom it would exert indirect control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For the period of time where CASEAMEX is able to point to record evidence of restrictions placed upon the minority government shareholder, Commerce does not explain how these appointments nonetheless support the potential to actually control during the POR.

Commerce's beholden theory, as far as it relates to events surrounding the inception of CASEAMEX, is not reasonable. These events occurred prior to the POR and do not demonstrate how the minority government shareholder was able to influence Mr. X's decision-making as to the day-to-day operations of CASEAMEX or the selection of CASEAMEX's management during the POR. Simply put, even assuming that the minority government shareholder selected all of CASEAMEX's board members, as well as Mr. X,\n   prior to the POR, the relevant question is whether for the period of time where CASEAMEX is able to point to record evidence of restrictions placed upon the minority government shareholder, did the minority government shareholder nonetheless retain control over management.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The prospective component of Commerce's beholden theory in this review is reasonable.

Therefore, the 2012 Articles of Association only relate to a portion of the POR. For a period of approximately 61 days at the beginning of the POR, the 2006 Articles of Association were in effect. The parties do not direct the court to where on the record a copy of CASEAMEX's 2006 Articles of Association has been reproduced. The parties do not agree whether the 2006 and 2012 Articles of Association are substantively the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Compare Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 12-13\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   CASEAMEX Resp.

Therefore, the court cannot presume that the 2006 Articles of Association restrict the minority government shareholder in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a result, Commerce's view that CASEAMEX has failed to rebut the presumption of de facto government control because during the POR Mr. X was beholden to the minority government shareholder, and the employees of CASEAMEX were beholden to Mr. X for their employment,\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 13-14, is reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without knowing the contents of CASEAMEX's 2006 Articles of Association, the court cannot say that it is unreasonable for Commerce to presume that the minority government shareholder would have been able to direct and control Mr. X\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   and,\n   through him, control the CASEAMEX employees. It may be that the 2006 Articles of Association are similar to the 2012 Articles of Association. However, it may also be that the 2006 Articles of Association had provisions similar to those in Containers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Containers Decision Memo at 46-47 (reproducing, in relevant part, the Articles of Association of the respondent company in Containers Decision Memo, which include a provision allowing for a minority shareholder, acting alone or with others, to be a \"controlling shareholder,\" while holding a minority of shares). The 2006 Articles of Association are not on the record and it is not unreasonable for Commerce to have assumed that they were not identical to the 2012 Articles. Therefore, for this review, it is not clear that CASEAMEX sufficiently showed that the minority government shareholder was restrained by CASEAMEX's 2012 Articles of Association. It is CASEAMEX's burden to populate the record with evidence rebutting the existence of de facto government control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sigma Corp v.
