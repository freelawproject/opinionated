LARIMER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On August 17, 2013, plaintiff Dwayne Ivery was arrested by two officers of the Rochester (New York) Police Department (\"RPD\"). The arrest followed a 911 call by plaintiff's girlfriend, in connection with an argument between her and plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 27, 2014, plaintiff brought this action against the City of Rochester (\"City\"), the two arresting officers (Alexander Baldauf and Rickey Harris), and James Sheppard, who at the time of the arrest was the Chief of Police for the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff has asserted ten claims against the defendants, as set forth in more detail below. Defendants have moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the evening of August 17, 2013, Officers Baldauf and Harris arrived at plaintiff's residence on East Main Street in Rochester, in response to a 911 call. That call had been placed by plaintiff's girlfriend, Winnette Delancy, during an argument between her and plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"DSUF\"), Dkt. # 28-2, \u00b6 5; Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"PRDSUF\"), Dkt. # 31 \u00b6 5. Not surprisingly, the parties' versions of what transpired next differ in some respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   What is undisputed is that at one point after the officers arrived, Baldauf agreed to Delancy's request that he help remove the license plates from a truck in the driveway. Delancy told the officers that the truck was registered in her name, and that she wanted the plates removed. Plaintiff testified at his deposition that he held title to the car, but that it was registered in Delancy's name, and that he agreed to let her take the plates. Ivery Depo. (Dkt. # 28-3 Ex. F) at 24 lines 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that as Baldauf was removing the front plate, plaintiff \"calmly and slowly\" approached Baldauf to ask him a question, and that Baldauf responded by grabbing plaintiff and punching him in the head. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants contend that the officers \"calmly spoke to Ms. Delancy and Mr. Ivery in a non-threatening manner,\" but that plaintiff \"aggressively approached\" Delancy, \"while acting in a belligerent manner.\" According to the Incident Report filed after this incident, plaintiff was screaming obscenities at the time. Dkt. # 28-3 at 40. Defendants allege that when Baldauf stepped between plaintiff and Delancy, in order to protect Delancy, plaintiff shoved or poked him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Regardless of how it started, it is not disputed that a physical altercation occurred between Baldauf and plaintiff. That altercation was captured, to some degree, on video taken by a security camera on the adjacent building. Although the image resolution is not the best, what can be seen is that while Baldauf and Delancy are at the front of a parked vehicle in the driveway, plaintiff walks toward them. At that point, Harris is standing near the rear of the vehicle, on the right side of the screen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because of the distance of the parties from the camera, the lighting conditions (the incident occurred after dark), and the general lack of resolution in the video, the images are not crystal clear, but it can be seen that a scuffle breaks out between Baldauf and plaintiff. Precisely what precipitated the scuffle is not obvious from the video, which has no audio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When the scuffle begins, Baldauf attempts to grab plaintiff, who eludes Baldauf's grasp and runs around the far side of the vehicle. Baldauf gives chase, and he and Harris, who moves to intercept plaintiff, bring plaintiff to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At this point, the glare from one officer's flashlight further obscures the images, but one of the officers (presumably Baldauf) can be seen cocking his arm back and punching plaintiff several times, while plaintiff is on the ground. It is not clear from the video whether plaintiff is physically struggling while this is occurring. But after several seconds, plaintiff is subdued and led away, on foot, apparently in handcuffs. The entire incident, from the start of the scuffle near the front of the vehicle to plaintiff being subdued and taken away, lasts roughly half a minute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to plaintiff, he did not shove or menace Baldauf or Delancy, but simply walked toward them, and only ran away after Baldauf's unprovoked, unwarranted attempt to grab him. Plaintiff also alleges\n   that Baldauf unnecessarily punched and kicked him while plaintiff was on the ground and not resisting. Plaintiff alleges that Harris eventually said, \"All right, all right, that's enough,\" and that Baldauf finally stopping hitting him. Plaintiff alleges that he sustained various physical injuries as a result of Baldauf's actions. As stated, defendants contend that plaintiff initiated the confrontation, and that Baldauf used no more force than was reasonably necessary to subdue plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After his arrest, plaintiff was charged with harassment in the second degree and with resisting arrest. He received an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal (\"ACD\") from the state court, as to both charges. DSUF \u00b6 24; PRDSUF \u00b6 24. Apparently the charges were later dismissed, as is the norm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on these events, plaintiff filed suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , asserting ten claims: (1) a \u00a7 1983 claim against Baldauf, Harris and the City for false arrest and illegal search and seizure of plaintiff's person; (2) a \u00a7 1983 claim against Baldauf, Harris and the City for excessive force, in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution; (3) a claim (ostensibly premised on \u00a7 1983 ) against Baldauf and Harris for conspiracy to violate plaintiff's civil rights; (4) a \u00a7 1983 claim against the City for failure to adequately train, discipline or supervise its police officers with respect to conspiracies to deprive individuals of their constitutional rights; (5) a \u00a7 1983 claim against the City and Sheppard, which is similar to Count 4, but which relates to the use of excessive force, unlawful arrests, and so on; (6) a state-law claim against Baldauf, Harris and the City for battery; (7) a state-law claim against Baldauf, Harris and the City for assault; (8) a state-law claim against Baldauf, Harris and the City for intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as (9) a similar claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (10) a state-law claim for negligence against all defendants.

Ivery Aff. (Dkt. # 31-5) \u00b6\u00b6 5-17. On the contrary, Baldauf alleges that the incident was precipitated when plaintiff (who Baldauf had been informed had recently used physical force against his girlfriend) \"walked over aggressively\" and \"poked\" Baldauf in the chest. Baldauf testified that when he attempted to grab plaintiff's arm, plaintiff ran, and that Baldauf used a reasonable degree of force to subdue plaintiff.

If Baldauf gratuitously punched and kicked plaintiff, in the course of an unlawful arrest, then he would presumably not be entitled to qualified immunity. But if the facts were as Baldauf described them, and plaintiff had been behaving in a verbally and physically aggressive, threatening manner, then Baldauf may well have reasonably believed that the force he used was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The qualified-immunity analysis further supports the dismissal of the claims against Harris, however. As explained above, the evidence shows that Harris had reasonable grounds to believe, correctly or not, that probable cause existed for plaintiff's arrest. Harris testified that he did not know whether plaintiff had shoved or pushed Baldauf. Harris Depo. (Dkt. # 28-3 Ex. H) at lines 16-19. Having reviewed the video recording and the other evidence, I see no basis to question that assertion. What is clear is that Harris was suddenly confronted with a foot chase and physical struggle between a fellow officer and a citizen, not knowing exactly what happened immediately beforehand. In those circumstances, Harris is entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKnight v.

Claims Against the City and Sheppard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Even construing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, I conclude that his claims against the City and Sheppard must be dismissed. The undisputed facts do not provide a basis for a claim of municipal liability, nor do they support an inference of Sheppard's personal involvement in the alleged violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   With respect to the City, it is well established that \"[t]here is no\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability under \u00a7 1983.\"\n   <em>\n    Jemmott v.

In other words, the City cannot be held liable based on the mere fact that one of its employees violated the plaintiff's civil rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Rather, to succeed on a claim against a municipality, the plaintiff must show that \"the alleged unlawful action [was] implemented or was executed pursuant to a governmental policy or custom.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

Generally, a defendant's personal involvement may be established in one of four ways: (1) direct participation; (2) learning of the deprivation but failing to remedy the wrong; (3) creating a policy or custom under which the deprivation occurred, or allowing such a policy or custom to continue; or (4) gross negligence in managing subordinates who caused the deprivation.\n   <em>\n    Aguirre v.

Plaintiff alleges that he \"never did hear back\" from Sheppard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4028832\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/419/#p423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As plaintiff's papers relating to the pending motions demonstrate, his theories of liability against Sheppard and the City are closely related.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Mem. (# 31-6) at 16-18 (discussing Sheppard's alleged actions, with respect to plaintiff's claims against both the City and Sheppard). In general, they relate to the City's and Sheppard's alleged indifference to claims of excessive force by RPD officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In support of his claims, plaintiff asserts that the RPD has failed to investigate past cases of excessive force. In support of that allegation, plaintiff has cited several actions brought in this Court. The records in none of those cases support plaintiff's claims here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Turner v. City of Rochester\n   </em>\n   , 11-CV-6200, the parties settled the action before trial. There was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by either side. The same is true of\n   <em>\n    Libbett v. City of Rochester\n   </em>\n   , 12-CV-6697. In\n   <em>\n    Jones v. City of Rochester\n   </em>\n   , 12-CV-6082, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the four individual RPD officer defendants. The other cases cited by plaintiff are similar, and do not indicate that defendants turned a blind eye to past alleged uses of excessive force by RPD officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In short, plaintiff has cited a handful of past cases in which similar allegations were made, but never proved. As recently stated by another district court from this circuit, \"a plaintiff's citation to a few lawsuits involving claims of alleged [constitutional violations] is not probative of the existence of an underlying policy by a municipality.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Sept. 27, 2017) (citing cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Regarding Sheppard, his alleged statement that he would \"look into\" plaintiff's claims is not enough to give rise to a genuine issue of material fact, sufficient to defeat defendants' motion for summary judgment. Assuming that statement was made, plaintiff has not alleged the context in which Sheppard made the statement, what he actually knew about the incident, or what if anything happened afterwards. At the summary judgment stage, that is not sufficient. No reasonable factfinder could conclude, based on that bare allegation, that Sheppard was \"personally involved\" in the alleged deprivation, under the standards laid out above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 28) is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   All of plaintiff's claims against defendant Rickey Harris, James Sheppard, and the City of Rochester are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiff's claims against defendant Alexander Baldauf for conspiracy (Count 3), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count 8), negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count 9), and negligence (Count 10), are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In all other respects, defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied. Therefore, the only claims remaining are plaintiff's claims against defendant Baldauf for false arrest/illegal search and seizure (Count 1), excessive force (Count 2), battery (Count 6), and assault (Count 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The issues of the officers' qualified immunity, and the City's liability, are addressed separately, below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    There is some evidence that Harris assisted in the arrest, and that he placed handcuffs on plaintiff. But as explained above, he could reasonably have believed that probable cause existed for plaintiff's arrest. At the very least, then, Harris would be entitled to qualified immunity, as explained below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    My conclusions in this regard render it unnecessary for the Court to determine whether any of defendants' acts were or could be considered sufficiently \"extreme and outrageous\" to support an emotional-distress claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
