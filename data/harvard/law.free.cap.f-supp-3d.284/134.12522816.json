(Docket No. 3.) Roman commenced this action\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pursuant 42 U.S.C. section 1983 (\" section 1983\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Roman, he suffers from lower back pain due to herniated discs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. Torres, Roman's treating physician, \"has been with this case since day one and has given [Torres] therapy and also different medications with no good results.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, Torres prescribed Roman an eight-day supply of Gabapentin, also referred to as Neurontin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Gabapentin relieved Roman's back pain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Roman alleges that in the following three months, Torres refused to prescribe Gabapentin, \"making it very hard for [Torres] to deal with the pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, Torres denied Roman's request to prescribe Gabapentin on a permanent basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Roman completed a section 1983 complaint form on February 27, 2017, naming Torres and the Correctional Health Services Corporation as defendants. Roman requests that this Court order Torres to prescribe Gabapentin \"every day until the pain decreases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. Additionally, Roman seeks $200,000 in damages for pain and suffering.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court granted the Correctional Health Services Corporation's motion to\n   dismiss. (Docket Nos. 13 &amp; 21.) Accordingly, the only claim remaining before the Court is the section 1983 cause of action against Torres.
