BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Christine M. Mills, a long-time employee of the Library of Congress's Collection Access, Loan Management (CALM) Division, brings this suit alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16, and of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a. She principally claims that the Library passed her up for a promotion on the basis of her race, national origin, color, and sex, and in retaliation for engaging in protected activity. Librarian Carla Hayden now moves to dismiss on two grounds. First, she argues that Plaintiff's entire suit is time-barred; second, she alternatively asserts that Mills failed to properly exhaust her national-origin claim. Disagreeing on both scores, the Court must deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to her Complaint, which the Court must presume true at this stage, Mills is a 34-year veteran of the (somewhat inaptly named) CALM Division.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 5. Starting in 2007, she repeatedly applied for-and was denied-promotions, watching the Library fill each position with employees from outside the Division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. Finally, in 2016, she sought one of two open positions as a Reference Library Technician within CALM, but the Library once again tapped out-of-house employees for the slots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Apparently reaching a tipping point after having been denied at least eight positions in ten years, Mills filed an informal complaint with the Library on June 16, 2017, attributing her non-selection to her race, sex, and age, and to retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. A (Informal Complaint). Shortly thereafter, she followed up with a formal complaint along the same lines, tacking on color and national origin as additional bases for the alleged discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. 3 (EEO Complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After an investigation, the Designee of the Chief of the Library's Equal Employment Office/Diversity Program (EEO/DP) issued a Decision Letter, dated February 3, 2017, finding insufficient evidence to support Plaintiff's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. 1 (Decision Letter) at 1, 8. Consistent with the Library of Congress's internal regulations, the letter advised Mills that she would have five workdays after receipt to request reconsideration or fifteen workdays to request a hearing or a Final Agency Decision without a hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (citing LCR 2010-3.1 \u00a7 10). Finally, it alerted her: \"If you do not timely seek a hearing or Final Decision from the Librarian without a hearing, this decision shall constitute the Library's Final Agency Decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff failed to meet either deadline. Her request for reconsideration came due on February 10, but she waited until February 24 to ask for an extension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. B at 1. The agency declined to excuse the delay, informing her as much on two separate occasions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4. Likewise, Mills needed to request a hearing (or a Final Decision without a hearing) by February 27 but took no such action until March 21.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Once again, the agency denied her request as untimely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. She ultimately brought this suit on June 27.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Librarian first argues that Plaintiff's suit is untimely and the Court should thus dismiss it under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). That Rule provides for the dismissal of an action where a complaint fails to \"state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Although \"detailed factual allegations\" are not necessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

At first blush, the answer might seem to be February 27. Plaintiff received a written decision on February 3, along with notice that the decision would become final absent timely action on her part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decision Letter at 1, 8; Compl., Exh. B at 7 (\"The EEO/DP notified you of the Chief's decision on February 3, 2017.\"). Plaintiff let the due dates for action slide by, missing both the February 10 deadline to request reconsideration and the February 27 deadline to seek a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. B at 1, 5. As such, the Decision Letter became the agency's final decision by the latter date-the last day Plaintiff might have challenged the letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Continental Resources v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141377\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/1232/#p1234\">\n    846 F.3d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1234 (D.C. Cir. 2017). To file within 90 days of that decision, Plaintiff would need to have commenced her action by May 28. As she did not do so until June 27, she appears out of luck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But, as an old aphorism teaches, appearances can be deceiving. While Mills does not seriously dispute this timeline, she pleads that she did not \"receive[ ] a notice of her\n   <em>\n    right to sue\n   </em>\n   \" until May 10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 2 (emphasis added).

But the letter references her right to file a civil action only once: if the Library had \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   issued a Final Agency Decision on [her] complaint of discrimination within one hundred and eighty (180) days.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1171139,3687101\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/663/183/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). It made no mention of her right to file\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a final decision, much less did it include the 90-day time limit for bringing such an action. Instead, the agency waited until May 10 to inform Mills by email that \"an individual who is dissatisfied with the Library's Final Agency Decision has the right to file a civil action with the appropriate federal district court within ninety (90) days of his/her receipt\" of that decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh.

That is true even though the Decision Letter, when issued, did not yet constitute final agency action. As the Court of Appeals reasoned, \"It would frustrate the very purpose of the notice regulations\" to allow a decision, such as the Letter, to \"automatically trigger the statute of limitations without providing notices equivalent to those required by \u00a7 1614.110.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334232,12310570\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/85/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Staropoli v.

Running the clock would be especially pernicious here, as the agency expressly notified Plaintiff of her right to file suit if it\n   <em>\n    failed\n   </em>\n   to take final action.

To bring a civil action under Title VII, an employee must first timely file an administrative claim with the employing agency (here, the Library of Congress) and exhaust all internal remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

In her 2016 EEO Complaint, she checked boxes to indicate discrimination based on race (African American), color (Black), gender (Female), age (54), retaliation, and\n   <em>\n    national origin\n   </em>\n   (African American).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant nevertheless takes issue with this latter charge because the EEO Complaint repeats the same basis-\"African American\"-for her national-origin claim as for her race claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 9. She believes, as a result, that Plaintiff never \"state[d] a national origin claim separate from her race claim prior to the Final Agency Decision,\" and has thus failed to exhaust that charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This argument finds no traction. It is true that courts in this district have sometimes treated race and national-origin discrimination as \"two separate claims,\" both of which must be exhausted at the EEO stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nyunt v.
