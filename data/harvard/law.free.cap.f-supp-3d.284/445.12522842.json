The alleged acts of the charged RICO conspiracy include the execution-style murders of two KMC members, Paul Maue (\"Maue\") and Daniel \"DJ\" Szymanski (\"DJ Szymanski\"), which occurred outside the KMC North Tonawanda Chapter clubhouse during the early morning hours of September 6, 2014. Defendants are currently on trial for the charges alleged in the Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During jury selection, Defendants objected to the presence of members of DJ Szymanski's family in the courtroom; one\n   of those family members, Kristen Szymanski (\"Kristen\"), has been identified by the Government as a potential witness in the case. The Court has sequestered witnesses in this case pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 615. Notwithstanding her status as a potential witness, the Government moved to assert Kristen's right not to be excluded from any public court proceeding as a family member of a crime victim. (Dkt. 1021). Given Defendants' professed concerns that the presence of members of the public-and, more specifically, victims' family members\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -could impede juror candor during individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   the Court considered alternative modes of conducting individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   proceedings, such as conducting the questioning in chambers. As discussed on the record, the Court ultimately determined that it would not exclude Kristen from the courtroom nor would it conduct the individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in chambers. Instead, the Court elected to conduct the individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in the open courtroom, but it invited prospective jurors to discuss personal matters at sidebar. The purpose of this Decision and Order is to memorialize the Court's rationale for those determinations in greater detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Jury Selection Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury selection process in this case was extensive, having been conducted over the course of several weeks and consisting of three phases: (1) hardship screening followed by completion of a 10-page written questionnaire; (2) individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire;\n   </em>\n   and (3) group\n   <em>\n    voir dire.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jury selection began on January 16, 2018, with the hardship screening phase, and lasted for four days. During the hardship screening phase, the Court first questioned prospective jurors regarding hardship excuses related to the expected four-month length of the trial. It then dismissed certain prospective jurors on hardship grounds and instructed the remaining prospective jurors to complete a juror questionnaire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Those questionnaire responses are subject to this Court's Protective Order, which states,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that they are to be used only in connection with jury selection, and may not be disclosed, shown, or distributed in any manner to third parties. (Dkt. 983). Moreover, the questionnaire informed each prospective juror that the information provided would be used only by persons associated with the case for purposes of selecting a jury. (Dkt. 983-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   which began on January 24, 2018, took place over the course of five separate days. The Court individually questioned certain prospective jurors about their questionnaire responses. After the individual questioning of each prospective juror, the Court either dismissed the prospective juror or instructed them to return for group\n   <em>\n    voir dire.\n   </em>\n   The parties made additional cause challenges, and ultimately, group\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   proceeded on February 7, 2018, with a jury of 18 persons (12 jurors and 6 alternates) selected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Attendance by a Victim's Family Members\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DJ Szymanski is one of the victims of the alleged murders on September 6, 2014. As alleged in the Indictment, Jenkins, acting at the direction of Pirk, shot DJ Szymanski and Maue behind the North Tonawanda KMC Chapter clubhouse. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   33 at 24). Among the individuals listed on the Government's witness list are Sigmund Szymanski, father of DJ Szymanski, and Kristen, sister of DJ Szymanski. (Dkt. 923 at 68). The Government contends that Kristen Szymanski \"will testify regarding her general knowledge of the operations and details of the KMC as well as her late brother's activities related to the KMC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Kristen, at times accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Szymanski,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   has attended some days of jury selection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants objected to the presence of Kristen during the jury selection. The Government filed a motion to assert Kristen's right not to be excluded from any public court proceeding as a family member of a crime victim. (Dkt. 1021 at 1). The Government contended that the right to be present includes\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   and that Defendants had provided \"no evidence, let alone clear and convincing evidence, that her testimony will be altered by her presence at the voir dire.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The Government also argued that the Court should allow prospective jurors to discuss sensitive matters at sidebar if they preferred to do so, rather than conduct all individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in chambers or close the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants maintained that Kristen should be excluded in light of the unique characteristics of the Court's individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   procedure, involving prospective jurors' confidential questionnaire responses. Defendants argued that, if a prospective juror ultimately served on the trial jury and later became aware that Kirsten had observed the individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   and was privy to the juror's personal information, then that may influence the prospective juror's decision as to a verdict. As a result, Defendants asked that the Court conduct individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in chambers and agreed to waive their appearance for that portion of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As noted above, the Court ultimately agreed with the Government, and conducted the individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in the public courtroom, explaining that prospective jurors could ask to discuss any sensitive or personal matter at sidebar. Very few prospective jurors opted for the sidebar. Over the course of the five-day individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   as well as throughout the entire jury selection process, Kristen and Mrs. Szymanski, as well as other members of the public, sometimes occupied the courtroom gallery. The Court observed no difference in the candor of prospective jurors during individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   where members of the public attended (including Kristen and Mrs. Szymanski), as compared to questioning without any members of the public in attendance. Likewise, the Court did not observe any behavior by Kristen or her mother that could in any way be construed as attempting to influence the prospective jurors. Rather, when present, the Szymanskis simply sat and observed the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

This is also consistent with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 60, which implements several provisions of the CVRA and provides that \"[t]he court must not exclude a victim from a public court proceeding involving the crime, unless the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the victim's testimony would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding.\" Fed.

For the reasons set forth below, the Court concluded that it would not be appropriate to conduct individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in chambers; instead, the Court invited prospective jurors to discuss any sensitive or personal matters at sidebar and otherwise allowed the individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   proceedings to remain open to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
