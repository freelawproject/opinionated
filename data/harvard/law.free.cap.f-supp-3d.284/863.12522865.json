The Court previously denied motions to dismiss filed by defendants Washtenaw County Road Commission (WCRC) and Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT).\n   <em>\n    Mote v. City of Chelsea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274028\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/642/\">\n    252 F.Supp.3d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. 2017). The plaintiffs since have filed a second amended complaint, and discovery has closed. Defendants WCRC and MDOT now have filed motions for summary judgment, presenting many of the same legal arguments raised and rejected earlier. Each defendant has raised additional arguments, however, some of which merit dismissal of part of the plaintiffs' claims. The Court will grant in part and deny in part the defendants' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs are individual disabled persons, who live, work, or frequently travel to and within the City of Chelsea, Michigan, and who each require the use of a wheelchair, braces, cane, or other assistive devices in order to get around, along with the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living (AACIL), which is an association that represents disabled persons such as the plaintiffs throughout southeastern Michigan, including in Chelsea. Together, and on behalf of persons similarly situated, the plaintiffs complain that the public streets and sidewalks in the City of Chelsea are less than fully accessible, at least in part because of construction and renovation work done on public sidewalks and streets by the City of Chelsea, the WCRC, and MDOT, which either removed, omitted, or improperly constructed accessibility features. The plaintiffs also initially complained about accessible public parking, but they have not developed those claims and appear to have abandoned them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties have furnished drawings and diagrams of some of the intersections. Their \"Ramp Location Index\" identifies each intersection's potential ramp location with ordinal numbers \"1\" through \"8,\" beginning with the northwest corner of an intersection-ramp \"1\" is the south-facing location-then proceeding clockwise until the southwest corner, with \"8\" being the north-facing location. (In the case of a \"T\" intersection, at least two of the ordinal locations would be inapplicable.). Those designation will be used here. The following fact summary is taken from the parties' affidavits, declarations, and authenticated documents. We begin with the circumstances of the individual and institutional plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Individual Plaintiffs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Shauna Mote\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2005, plaintiff Shauna Mote was in a car accident, and her injuries resulted in the amputation of both her legs. She now uses an adapted van with hand controls for transportation, which has a side fold-out ramp that she uses to exit the vehicle. Before her accident, she never used the sidewalks or curb ramps along US-12, but in 2015 a new friend suggested to her that a good way to meet people was to participate in the fairs and parades held in town. In August 2016 Mote attempted to travel the pedestrian route along US-12 for the first time, in order to meet with her friend for the \"Old 12 Childrens Fair Parade.\" She also attempted to attend the \"Chelsea Summer Fair Children's Parade\" on an unspecified date in 2016. While traveling the sidewalk route along US-12, Mote observed several ramps with excessive running slopes, one of which was so steep that it caused the front wheels of her wheelchair to come up off the ground at the top. She also found it hard to navigate the ramps across US-12; at one location an excessive cross-slope on the ramp almost caused her to roll into traffic, and at another crossing police had to stop traffic to allow Mote and her friend to try to cross the street. However, upon crossing the street Mote and her friend were \"confronted with a very steep curb ramp that was also covered with mud, weeds, and gravel several inches deep,\" and as \"a result we had to avoid that curb ramp entirely and use a different ramp, which forced us to travel along Old 12, with our police escort.\" On other occasions, Mote has found many of the curb ramps to be flooded with water and mud, requiring her husband to push her wheelchair with great difficulty; Mote averred that she would not have been able to make the passage in her wheelchair without his aid. As a result of these and other problems with the US-12 curb ramps, Mote has not been able to access the Lake Pierce Boardwalk either alone or with the assistance of friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mote did not identify the specific intersections with the offending ramps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As to M-52, Mote attested only that there are no accessible or handicapped-placarded parking spaces anywhere in the street parking along M-52; the normal spaces marked out on that street do not have enough width to allow deployment of her van's ramp; and, as a result, she has had to forego attending music festivals in town, or is forced to \"park far away, and risk [her] health and safety using the very inaccessible and unsafe curb ramps, street crossings and sidewalks along SR-52 (Main Street).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Deborah Clark\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff Deborah Clark has a wheelchair-modified van and a motorized wheelchair that she uses to get around. She first met friends who lived in Chelsea and visited there in 2014. Before August 2014, she never had occasion to visit the City or use any of the sidewalks there. In August 2014 Clark attended the Chelsea Summer Fair Parade, which ran along US-12, and, after\n   parking in an accessible space by the shopping mall, she used six curb ramps installed by defendant WCRC to reach a spot where she could view the parade. The excessive slope on some of those ramps caused her wheelchair to tip, and gaps where some ramps met the sidewalk caused her wheels to get stuck, resulting in Clark having difficulty controlling her chair and her service dog. In 2015 Clark decided not to attend the parade, to avoid facing the same difficult trek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2015 or 2016, Clark learned that a new pedestrian crossing was installed across US-12 leading to the Lake Pierce Boardwalk. However, when it rains Clark has observed that the entire cross-walks and ramps are submerged and filled with pooled water and mud, which causes her wheelchair tires to lose traction, leaving her unable to traverse the ramps. As a result, Clark was not able to access the boardwalk despite the new crossing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2016, Clark tried to attend one of the Thursday Night Sights and Sounds events in downtown Chelsea with her friend, fellow plaintiff Brenda Baraniak. The event features musical acts on ten stages arranged along M-52 (Main Street). Clark attested that \"[v]irtually every transition from each crosswalk to and from each curb ramp had an abrupt change in level, (large lips) that risked tipping our wheelchairs\"; almost \"every painted crosswalk had one or more divots, potholes, rips or other defects in the road surface that were tipping hazards\"; and a \"few times we had to go outside of the painted crosswalk, to find the least risky place to transition from the street onto or off of a curb ramp.\" Clark stated that \"[a]t one location, we abandoned the crosswalks and curb ramps entirely,\" and instead \"both traveled in heavy vehicular traffic and used a commercial driveway apron to leave the street and enter onto the sidewalk, and later to leave the sidewalk and enter the traffic.\" As a result, Clark and Baraniak were able to get close to only two of the performing stages, were unable to reach two others, and ended up giving up and going home without enjoying most of the festival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As with Ms. Mote, Clark did not identify the specific intersections with the offending ramps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   3. Brenda Baraniak\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff Brenda Baraniak is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair that she pushes by her own power. She has a device that lifts the wheelchair and stores it on top of her car when she travels, and her car is modified to use hand controls. Baraniak stated that she had not visited Chelsea or used any of the pedestrian crossings there before August 2014. However, sometime after July 2014, Baraniak believed her granddaughter had reached an age where she could enjoy the parades in Chelsea and decided to attend the Chelsea Community Fair and its associated parade along US-12. Baraniak described nearly verbatim the same difficulties encountered by plaintiff Clark during her visit to the US-12 parade route. She also described similar difficulties and a lack of access to the Lake Pierce Boardwalk via the new pedestrian crosswalk across US-12, and she related the same difficulties encountered while attempting unsuccessfully to attend the downtown music fair with Clark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   4. Karen and Merlyn Street\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff Karen Street lives in Chelsea, is a survivor of polio, and has trouble walking. In 2014 she had an orthotic brace made for her ankle to assist her, but she still has trouble ambulating. She can walk for short distances, but she uses a motorized scooter to get around most of the time, and as her condition has worsened in recent years she has relied on her scooter more and more. Before August 2015, she never had any reason to use the curb\n   ramps or sidewalks along US-12. But in January 2017 a friend of hers moved into a retirement home across US-12 from the Lake Pierce Boardwalk, and Street attested that she wants to visit the boardwalk with her friend, but has been unable due to the same flooding and debris accumulation at the US-12 crossing which was described by other plaintiffs. Street also stated that in 2015 she attended one of the Thursday evening music festivals along M-52 in Chelsea, and while trying to negotiate a particularly dangerous transition from a curb ramp her scooter tipped over into traffic along the street. Since that time Street and her husband have taken the dangerous-but in her view less risky-alternative of passing along the street among parked cars and passing traffic, rather than risk tipping over again on that particular curb ramp. However, even by that risky avenue Street was unable to reach most of the stages during the festival, due to the number of curb ramps that she found dangerously impassable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Street attested that almost every transition from ramp to street or sidewalk along M-52 has large lips that cause her scooter almost to tip over, and she often is forced to go outside the painted crosswalks to find a place to safely enter or exit the ramp. Even when walking short distances, Street stated that she often has to turn sideways in order to safely traverse the ramps, due to the steep slopes and poor transitions, which increases her risk of falling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff Merlyn Street submitted a declaration generally corroborating his wife's account of her difficulties traversing the US-12 and M-52 curb ramps and sidewalks, which he also has had the same problems with as an elderly survivor of polio. Neither identified specific problematic intersections along US-12 or M-52\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   5. Lee Benton\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff Lee Benton attested that he moved to Ann Arbor in 2014, and in 2015 and 2016 he rode the WAVE bus from Ann Arbor to Chelsea, where his parents live. He has cerebral palsy, cannot use his legs, has limited use of his arms, and uses a powered wheelchair. He described problems similar to those encountered by Mote, Clark, Baraniak, and the Streets while traveling from his bus stop to the Chelsea summer fair and parade, and while attempting to access the Thursday night summer music festivals; but he did not point out the specific intersections where the ramps were problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   6. Joanne Ladio\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Joanne Ladio attested that she is the full-time caregiver for plaintiff Carlos Gray-Lion, and that the two have lived together in Chelsea since 1999. She attested to difficulties pushing Carlos's wheelchair on the pedestrian routes along US-12 and M-52, stating that she had similar difficulties as other plaintiffs with the US-12 crossing to the Lake Pierce Boardwalk. She also attested that in 2014, 2015, and 2016 she and Carlos only have been able to attend the one stage nearest to their home during the summer music festivals, due to the many (unspecified) impassable curb ramps along M-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   7. Other Individual Plaintiffs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs Jennifer Kundak, who has difficulty walking, and J.N. (by his next friend), a minor who has spina bifida and uses a wheelchair and forearm crutches to ambulate, submitted similar declarations describing their difficulties traversing the same curb ramps discussed by the plaintiffs mentioned above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   8. Plaintiff Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living (AACIL)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Carolyn Grawi, director and CEO of plaintiff AACIL, submitted a declaration in\n   which she attested that she is blind, cannot drive, and walks using a cane. AACIL provides services to disabled individuals that include information, peer mentoring, training in individual living skills, advocacy, and assistance with community transitions. Grawi was contacted in late 2015 or early 2016 by plaintiffs Mote, Clark, and Baraniak. She drove to Chelsea to meet with the plaintiffs, where she observed for the first time that many of the businesses along main street had inaccessible entrances, and that much of the street parking in the City was inaccessible. Grawi referred the plaintiffs to their counsel of record for advice about their legal rights, and she \"spent hours inspecting sidewalk, curb ramp and crosswalk barriers to access throughout Chelsea, which is in AACIL's service area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Several weeks later, Grawi was driven to Chelsea to meet with City officials about the accessibility barriers she had encountered; evidently unsatisfied with the City's response, the AACIL board of directors later voted to file suit against the City under the ADA. While this lawsuit has been pending, Grawi has had to spend time answering discovery inquiries and attending a deposition, and her involvement in the case has diverted her from work that had to be covered by other employees. Grawi attested that \"[d]ue to funding cuts, and layoffs, AACIL is stretched very thin,\" and \"[a]ny time spent on the Chelsea matters is a drain, in people, resources and time that I and other employees would otherwise spend on other AACIL work.\" Grawi also attested that her organization's ability to negotiate with commercial businesses in Chelsea to persuade them to make their premises accessible is hampered because of the time and resources diverted to dealing with accessibility defects in the public way, and because Grawi must be \"accompanied and assisted by a non-disabled person even to reach the establishments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B. The Chelsea Thoroughfares\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   1. State Road 52 (M-52)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In 2003 defendant MDOT resurfaced the part of State Road 52 (M-52, a.k.a. \"Main Street\") that runs through the City of Chelsea. MDOT's representative also testified that the agency periodically \"refreshes\" painted pavement markings along the M-52 corridor, on an approximately five-year cycle, and that the agency also periodically \"salvages\" or \"replaces\" street signs along the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Beyond those preliminary and apparently undisputed facts, it was difficult to discern any coherent information that could be pertinent to the applicable construction standards from the record submitted by the plaintiffs relating to M-52. The plaintiffs attached to their response to MDOT's motion a vast catalog of inscrutable diagrams and photographs, which perhaps are meant to depict the dimensions and condition of numerous curb ramps at locations along M-52. However, unlike the description of conditions along US-12, the defects purportedly identified at those locations were not summarized in any affidavit by the plaintiffs' inspectors, and no deposition or other affidavit testimony was included to explain them. The plaintiffs also do not cogently summarize or identify the specific defects of those M-52 curb ramps with respect to particular regulations anywhere in their briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After reviewing all of those exhibits, without the benefit of any testimonial guidance from the plaintiffs' inspectors or any explanatory briefing to illuminate the significance of the depictions, the Court could say that there appear to be some locations depicted in the exhibits that are in some degree of disrepair, but cannot draw any conclusions about what a factfinder could ascertain relating to any specific defects at those locations that contravene an applicable regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court discussed that difficulty with the plaintiff's attorney at oral argument, and invited supplemental briefs that might cure the problem. However, the plaintiffs' brief fails to address the lack of information required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), regarding the supposed defects along the M-52 (Main Street) corridor. Contrary to the Court's direction, the plaintiffs refused to actually enumerate the defects at each of the sidewalk ramps, and instead cited only \"one example\" of purported defects, referencing the same inscrutable engineering sketches previously submitted. The plaintiffs' only explanation for their failure to produce an inventory of defects is that it would take a lot of pages to make such a list, so they apparently believed they should not try.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   2. Old U.S. 12 (US-12)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In 2007, WCRC carried out the \"Old U.S. 12 Resurfacing Project,\" which was referred to in project documents as being undertaken \"in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Transportation.\" The log stated that the \"improvements covered by [it would be] constructed in accordance with the Michigan Department of Transportation 2003 standard specifications for construction,\" and it included drawings and specifications for, among other things, \"sidewalk ramp details,\" \"concrete sidewalks,\" and \"concrete curb[s].\" The project log stated that \"all sidewalk ramps\" within the work zone would be \"replaced and/or relocated with ADA compliant ramps.\" An accompanying letter from WCRC officials stated that the County required a permit to be issued by the City for work to be performed within the City limits, before it could \"submit a final engineering package to the Michigan Department of Transportation Local Agency Section.\" That letter noted that the work would include \"reconstruction of the sidewalk drops to become compliant with ADA requirements\" at the intersections with Lane Street, Arthur Street, and Old Manchester Road. Subsequently, the WCRC entered into a contract with MDOT to procure financing for the project from MDOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On October 19, 2016, Derik Bollinger and Ray Schmidt, two superintendents of the City of Chelsea Public Works Department, inspected several of the intersections along US-12 that were included within the 2007 resurfacing project. Bollinger and Schmidt stated in their affidavits that they observed that at the Wilkinson, Arthur, and Lane street \"T\" intersections, there were only two curb ramps placed at crossings of US-12, meaning that the ramps designated as \"1\" and \"8\" according to the plaintiff's diagram were omitted (i.e., one ramp at the northwest corner of each intersection and one corresponding ramp at the southwest corner). They also observed that at the \"+\" or \"plus\" intersection with Taylor street, there also were only two ramps crossing Taylor, with ramps \"4\" and \"5\" omitted from that intersection. At Wilkinson Street, at ramps \"4\" and \"5\" crossing US-12, the superintendents observed \"evidence of ponding water, such as staining and debris covering part of the detectable warnings and collected at the transition of each curb ramp to Old U.S. 12.\" At that location ramp \"4\" also \"had a running slope of 10%.\" Similarly, at Lane Street they also observed evidence of ponding water, at ramps \"2,\" \"3,\" \"4,\" and \"5,\" and they noted that ramp \"4\" had a running slope of 9%. At Arthur Street, they noted evidence of ponding water at ramps \"2,\" \"3,\" and \"4,\" and ramp \"2\" had a running slope of 10.4%. At ramps \"4\" and \"5\" they also observed a \"3/4 to 1 inch abrupt change in level at the transition from the curb ramp to the street-an 'asphalt reverse lip.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At Taylor Street, they observed that curb ramps \"1,\" \"2,\" and \"8\" had evidence of ponding water, and ramps \"6\" and \"7\" (across Taylor Street) had \"missing expansion\n   joints leaving a gap in the surfaces approximately 1.5 inches wide and more than 1 inch deep for the entire widths of the ramps.\" They also noted a \"hole in the asphalt approximately 1.5 inches deep and 7 inches wide\" in the road surface crosswalk between ramps 6 and 7, and they recorded that ramps 2 and 7 had 1/2 inch \"asphalt reverse lips.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mark McCulloch of the WCRC confirmed at his deposition that the work during the 2007 project included removing two of the four curb ramps that previously had existed at Arthur and Lane Streets. McCulloch testified that the ramp locations were removed because there were some ramps in place on one side of the street with no \"receiving\" ramp on the other side, and because it was determined that reducing the number of \"conflict points\" between cars and pedestrians along US-12 would improve safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   C. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The plaintiffs filed their putative class-action complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the local and state government defendants on April 28, 2016, followed by an amended complaint to correct procedural defects on August 4, 2016, and a second amended complaint on May 22, 2017. The amended complaint alleges violations of ADA Title II (Count I) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Count II) against the City of Chelsea, the City's Downtown Development Authority, and MDOT. The complaint also raises a congruent claim against the City of Chelsea only under Michigan's Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA). With leave granted, the City of Chelsea filed a third-party complaint against the WCRC, which the City contends has exclusive control over and responsibility for certain roadways within its city limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant MDOT filed an answer to the original complaint and a motion for judgment on the pleadings; WCRC responded in similar fashion to the third-party complaint. The plaintiffs later entered into a consent decree with the City of Chelsea, and they filed their second amended complaint naming WCRC as a principal defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After discovery closed, defendants WCRC and MDOT filed their summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Under Rule 56, the party bringing the summary judgment motion has the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute over material facts.\n   <em>\n    Mt.

Depriving a disabled individual of the ability to traverse the public spaces used by his or her fellow citizens certainly amounts to a severe burden on his or her participation in public life-perhaps among the most severe impairments that can be imposed.

They have failed to put forth any coherent evidentiary presentation to identify what specific defects they believe exist, at which specific curb ramps along M-52 that they contend are defective. Certainly the testimony of the individual plaintiffs suggests that some of the curb ramps on Main Street have dangerous defects that made them difficult to navigate and obstructed the plaintiffs' ability fully to access and enjoy public events (such as the Thursday evening music festivals). However, none of that testimony identifies with any specificity what ADAAG-violating aspects of the design or construction of any particular curb ramps led to those difficulties that the plaintiffs encountered. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record tending to suggest that MDOT constructed or altered any of those ramps after 1992, or identifying which ramps the agency constructed or altered that now have cognizable defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In their briefing the plaintiffs rely solely on general citations to a prolix, undifferentiated mass of inscrutable technical diagrams and scrawlings, which they contend illustrate numerous instances of ADAAG violations. That is insufficient. The mere reference to those technical drawings, inviting the court to cull through them in search of a fact question, \"falls well short of 'direct[ing] the court's attention to those specific portions of the record upon which [the plaintiff sought] to rely to create a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Bormuth v.

They have not met their burden under Rule 56. Fed. R. Civ. P 56(c)(1) (\"A party\n   <em>\n    asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion\n   </em>\n   by: (A)\n   <em>\n    citing ... particular parts of materials in the record\n   </em>\n   , including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits\n   or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or (B)\n   <em>\n    showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute\n   </em>\n   , or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Calling that defect to the plaintiffs' attention at oral argument, the Court invited plaintiffs' counsel to address the problem in a supplemental brief. To tame the impenetrable record they submitted, the Court suggested that the plaintiffs identify those specific curb ramps along M-52 that they contend are defective, stating (1) the exact location of each allegedly defective ramp; (2) the defects identified in each ramp, with pinpoint citations of exhibits in the record evidencing those defects, and citations of the specific ADAAG provision that the plaintiffs contend was violated by each defect; and (3) any evidence in the record tending to show that each of the ramps complained of was built or modified by defendant MDOT, and when the construction or alteration of the ramp occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The plaintiffs have not capitalized on that opportunity. Contrary to the Court's direction, the plaintiffs refused actually to enumerate the defects at each of the sidewalk ramps, and instead cited only \"one example\" of purported defects, referencing the same inscrutable engineering sketches previously submitted. The plaintiffs' only explanation for their failure to produce an inventory of defects is that it would take a lot of pages to make such a list, so they did not do it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   There also are two other major problems with the mass of materials submitted in support of the plaintiffs' response, which were not addressed at all in the plaintiffs' supplement. One is that the documents they submitted are unauthenticated by any accompanying affidavit testimony by anyone who was involved in producing them, at least with respect to M-52. Nor were they accompanied by any comprehensible summary of defects correlating the discrete measurements with identifiable ADA Guideline transgressions. Such affidavits or declarations are necessary to show that the documents would be admissible at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038861\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/576/551/#p558\">\n    576 F.3d at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the party opposing summary judgment must show that she can make good on the promise of the pleadings by laying out enough evidence\n   <em>\n    that will be admissible at trial\n   </em>\n   to demonstrate that a genuine issue on a material fact exists, and that a trial is necessary\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   A second problem is that the plaintiffs' documents probably would not be admissible even if they were authenticated and properly summarized so that the Court could understand them. They obviously represent information collected by parties to this litigation, for the purpose of supporting their positions, which are materially adverse to defendant MDOT. Those documents likely amount to inadmissible hearsay statements, not subject to any apparent exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). Although they might be fodder for properly documented and disclosed expert opinion testimony about the sidewalk conditions via Rule 702, no such testimony has been submitted in opposition to the summary judgment motion, and the documents themselves likely would not be admissible.

The record does not establish a material fact question for trial. Therefore, MDOT's motion for summary judgment will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   C. WCRC's Motion for Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, including an amended reply brief filed after the plaintiffs filed their response, defendant WCRC argues that: (1) the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Babcock v. Michigan\n   </em>\n   inevitably points to the conclusion that sidewalks are not \"services\" within the meaning of the ADA and therefore not subject to its regulations; (2) even if the Court finds that sidewalks are a \"service,\" any such \"service\" must be viewed in its entirety, \"the entire system of sidewalks would be the service, and the plaintiffs would have to show that they were denied meaningful access to that system; (3) none of the plaintiffs testified at their depositions about any place they were unable to get to via the pedestrian routes along Old US-12; (4) the DOJ regulations unlawfully \"impose obligations on public entities that are not imposed by Title II,\" where they require \"that facilities be 'to the maximum extent feasible...constructed [or altered] in such manner that the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,' \" (quoting 28 C.F.R. 35.150(a) ); (5) as to the placement of new curb ramps that do not already exist, the road commission must be allowed discretion to decide what locations are safe for pedestrians to cross, and the agency should not be required to place crosswalks (and therefore curb ramps) at unsafe or impractical locations; and (6) all of the alleged deficits in the existing ramps based on their present condition are issues of \"maintenance,\" not \"construction\"; maintenance is the obligation of the local municipality under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   WCRC also asserts that the plaintiffs' accessibility claims are untimely under the applicable three-year statute of limitations. Finally, WCRC argues that plaintiff AACIL lacks organizational standing to participate in this lawsuit because its executive director could not identify at her deposition any financial harm suffered by the organization as a result of the alleged discrimination, and she admitted that the organization does not have \"members\" as such on whose behalf the AACIL could pursue the claims raised in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   1. Sidewalks are \"Facilities\" Under the ADA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Defendant WCRC argues with great vigor about the purported distinction between \"services\" and \"facilities,\" contending that sidewalks are not \"services,\" and therefore are beyond the reach of Title II of the ADA. However, the distinction is of little consequence, since sidewalks certainly are \"facilities\" under the plain language of the ADA, and it is beyond dispute that the ADAAG guidelines promulgated under the ADA that govern the construction of public facilities built or altered after 1992 therefore apply to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The term \"facility\" is defined under the applicable ADA regulations to include \"all or any portion of buildings, structures, sites, complexes, equipment, rolling stock or other conveyances,\n   <em>\n    roads\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    walks\n   </em>\n   , passageways,\n   <em>\n    parking lots\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    other real or personal property\n   </em>\n   , including the site where the building, property, structure, or equipment is located.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.104\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant's roadway, the sidewalks adjoining it which the defendant built or altered, and the curb ramps connecting them all\n   plainly qualify as \"facilities\" under that definition. And the ADA regulations also plainly require that any \"alterations of facilities commenced after January 26, 1992, 'by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ability Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319259\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/901/#p904\">\n    385 F.3d at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.151\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ).

Denial of \"Services\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As noted below, there is evidence in the record identifying the specific ADAAG-violating defects at several specific sidewalk intersections along Old US-12. The plaintiffs also have alleged adequately that they were denied \"meaningful access\" to the service provided-or supposed to be provided-by the defendant's construction of those sidewalks, because they have pointed to specific instances when they were prevented from accessing public events such as the City's summer parade, or denied access to a public venue such as the Lake Pierce Boardwalk, due to the defects in the curb ramps along US-12. Two of the plaintiffs even identified one instance where they were forced at great risk to traverse their intended route along US-12 by traveling along the roadway in their wheelchairs, at considerable risk due to the passing traffic, and with a \"police escort,\" because they could not safely navigate the curb ramps along their route. That presentation certainly suffices to suggest that the plaintiffs have been denied \"meaningful access\" to the service offered by a properly constructed roadside pedestrian walkway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   4. Specific Defects\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Although the plaintiffs' factual presentation in response to WCRC's summary judgment motion is not much more elucidating than its response to MDOT's motion, the plaintiffs did attach affidavits from Derik Bollinger and Ray Schmidt, two superintendents of the City of Chelsea Public Works Department, who inspected several of the intersections along US-12. They reported their observations of those intersections and some measurements of their features. By applying what appeared to be the pertinent portions of the ADAAG to those observations, the Court was able to reach its own conclusions on those points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The plaintiffs have identified at least three defects in the curb ramps at several\n   of the intersections between sidewalks and the roadway on US-12, and those defects sufficiently suggest that the curb ramps in question are not compliant with relevant provisions of the ADAAG. Among other things, the plaintiffs' inspectors stated their observations, based on an October 2016 inspection of several intersections, that several of the ramps within the scope of the work done in 2007 featured defects such as (1) running slopes exceeding the 1 in 12 or 8.33% maximum allowed by the ADAAG specifications, ADAAG 4.8.2 (\"The maximum slope of a ramp in new construction shall be 1:12.\"); (2) transitions or \"lips\" at the transition from the ramp to the sidewalk exceeding the maximum allowable untreated vertical deviation of 1/2 inch,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ADAAG 4.3.8; 4.5.1-4.5.2; and (3) propensity for the ramps to allow water to accumulate, resulting in obstructive accumulations of dirt, debris, mud, and grass,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ADAAG 4.8.8 (\"Outdoor ramps and their approaches shall be designed so that water will not accumulate on walking surfaces.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The defendant contends that there is \"no evidence\" that the curb ramps in question were not fully ADA-compliant as built. But of course that position necessarily disregards the evidence that they are not compliant now, and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, a factfinder fairly could infer that the curb ramps are too steeply sloped, obstructed by dangerous asphalt protrusions, and prone to accumulate water because they were designed and constructed to be so. And the defendant has not offered any evidence conclusively to rebut that inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Plaintiffs have met their obligation under Rule 56 to establish a material fact issue for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   5. Eliminated Curb Ramps\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The plaintiffs also complain of one defect in particular at several intersections, which does not comprise a violation of any ADAAG standard on point: the alleged \"omission\" of one pair of ramps at some intersections. The plaintiffs contend that the \"omission\" of a ramp to transition from one of the two sidewalks along a side street that intersects with US-12 is non-ADAAG-compliant. But they have not pointed to any ADAAG specification purporting to control the number or orientation of ramps at an intersection. Instead, the pertinent regulations merely require that (1) \"[n]ewly constructed or altered streets, roads, and highways must contain curb ramps or other sloped areas at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a street level pedestrian walkway,\" and (2) \"[n]ewly constructed or altered street level pedestrian walkways must contain curb ramps or other sloped areas\n   <em>\n    at intersections to streets, roads, or highways\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.151\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In this case, it is apparent that the configuration of the intersections in question does, in fact, include ramps at each spot where a sidewalk \"intersects\" a roadway. In those locations where ramps were omitted, the sidewalk in question terminates early, into the side of a perpendicular sidewalk running along US-12, and does not extend to the roadway. The plaintiffs have not pointed to any authority in the ADAAG or elsewhere mandating that the defendant construct sidewalks so that they intersect with a roadway at any particular point. Instead, all that the regulations require is that where a sidewalk does intersect with a road, a ramp must be installed. In this case that obligation appears to be fulfilled at all of the locations in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   6. Construction vs. Maintenance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The defendant contends that, even if the sidewalks that it built were defective according to the ADAAG, it is not liable for their present condition because the issues\n   identified are caused by lack of \"maintenance\" rather than as a consequence of improper \"design\" or \"construction.\" But the defendant has not offered any evidence to substantiate its position that the sidewalks properly were designed and constructed in the first instance. Instead, it merely posits, without any supporting evidence, that its efforts during the 2007 reconstruction project were ADA-compliant, and it invites the Court to conclude that the defects that now exist must be due to lack of maintenance of the curbs and sidewalks, which it contends is exclusively the responsibility of the City after the construction was completed. The defendant points out that state law assigns to the City the responsibility of maintaining sidewalks within its borders.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20691\">\n    Mich.

As between the City and the County, the decision which is liable, and to what extent, for the identified defects will have to await the development of an adequate record on those points at a trial before the Court.

However, as noted above, the state of Michigan imposes an affirmative duty by statute on\n   <em>\n    the City\n   </em>\n   to maintain sidewalks within its boundaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20691\">\n    Mich.

The ADA regulations also impose an express requirement on a responsible public entity to \"\n   <em>\n    maintain in operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment that are required to be readily accessible\n   </em>\n   to and usable by persons with disabilities by the Act or this part.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.133\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). As between the City and the County, the present evidentiary record is insufficient to allow the Court to hold as a matter of law that the City has no liability for maintenance of the sidewalks in question, if, in fact, some of the present accessibility defects are due to deterioration of ADA-compliant construction over time, coupled with a lack of maintenance, instead of defective construction or design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Moreover, the City cannot escape liability for the condition of the sidewalks and curb ramps merely because it was the County and not the City that carried out the original work, because the ADA regulations impose obligations on a public entity to ensure that accessibility features are incorporated and that the ADAAG specifications are complied with any time that a public facility is altered or newly constructed, after 1992, \" '\n   <em>\n    by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity\n   </em>\n   in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility' \"\n   <em>\n    Ability Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319259\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/901/#p904\">\n    385 F.3d at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.151\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ) (emphasis added). The \"project log\" and the letter regarding the permit process that were submitted by defendant WCRC plainly suggest that the City was involved at the very least in issuing required permits to allow the project to proceed, and it is a fair inference from the record that the sidewalks and curb ramps were constructed either \"on behalf of\" or \"for the use of\" the City, despite the funding of the project with state and federal funds and the handling of the work by the County authority. And the City has not pointed to any authority suggesting that it cannot be held jointly liable with the County for any resulting ADA defects in the sidewalks and curb ramps under those circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Although the sovereign immunity defenses asserted by defendant MDOT lack\n   merit, the plaintiffs have not offered evidence to satisfy their burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) of demonstrating a material fact issue for trial. Their claims against MDOT, therefore, fail as a matter of law. MDOT has not offered good reason for the Court to reconsider its order striking its latest brief; its motion for reconsideration will be denied. Although the plaintiffs have met their Rule 56(c) burden on most of their claims against defendant WCRC, they have not demonstrated an entitlement to relief for their claim that certain curb ramps along Old U.S. 12 were eliminated during reconstruction.
