(\"Sterling\"), filed this putative class action on March 18, 2008 alleging that Sterling discriminated against them in pay and promotion on the basis of their gender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Dkt. 1. Subsequently, plaintiffs moved to compel arbitration pursuant to a dispute resolution agreement (the \"RESOLVE agreement\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25, which motion this Court granted by Order dated June 18, 2008,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52. There followed extensive proceedings before the Arbitrator, this Court, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, some of which are briefly summarized below and more specific familiarity with which is here presumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now before the Court is Sterling's motion to vacate a Class Determination Award issued by the Arbitrator certifying, for plaintiffs' Title VII disparate impact claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, a class that, Sterling estimates, includes over 70,000 \"absent\" class members,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Sterling employees other than the named plaintiffs and several hundred individuals who have affirmatively opted in to the class proceedings before the Arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 137-1-3. According to Sterling, even though the Arbitrator is planning to permit members of the certified class to opt out, the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by purporting to bind this larger group in any way as they never submitted to her authority or presented to her the question of whether the RESOLVE agreement permits class action arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of its Renewed Motion to Vacate the Arbitrator's Class Certification Award (\"Def.

Plaintiffs timely appealed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 88, and a divided panel of the Second Circuit reversed, with the majority finding that (1) the parties had squarely presented the question of whether the RESOLVE agreement allowed for class arbitration to the arbitrator and (2) \"whether the arbitrator was right or wrong in her analysis, she had the authority to make the decision, and the parties to the arbitration are bound by it.\"\n   <em>\n    Jock v.

Specifically, given\n   <em>\n    Jock I\n   </em>\n   , which affirmed the Arbitrator's prerogative to decide whether the RESOLVE agreement permitted class action procedures, the Court reasoned that there is \"no basis for vacating the Class Determination Award on the ground that the Arbitrator has now exceeded her authority in purporting to bind absent class members.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415902\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/113/#p124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sterling, once again, appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 145.

The panel further instructed the parties and this Court that the issue \"pertinent\" on remand is: \"whether an arbitrator, who may decide ... whether an arbitration agreement provides for class procedures because the parties 'squarely presented' it for decision, may thereafter purport to bind\n   <em>\n    non-parties\n   </em>\n   to class procedures on this basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=703%20Fed.%20Appx.%2015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=703%20Fed.%20Appx.%2015\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the Arbitrator may\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   so bind non-parties to class action procedures where, as here, the Court has determined that the arbitration agreement does not, in fact, permit class action procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Federal Arbitration Act provides that a district court may vacate an arbitration award where the arbitrator has exceeded her powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).
