Plaintiffs assert\n   that rescission of the DACA program was unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") both (1) as an arbitrary and capricious decision and (2) for failure to follow notice-and-comment procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-58.

Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief on the basis of equitable estoppel both as to the DACA rescission itself and its information sharing policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-59.

Unfortunately, that 2011 observation still holds true today-perhaps even more so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case is yet another example of the damaging fallout that results from excessive political partisanship. The highly politicized debate surrounding the DACA program has thus far produced only rancor and accusations.

For over a decade at\n   the start of the 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   century, Congress quarreled over policies regarding illegal aliens who entered the country as children, and who may have no memory or connection with their country of origin. Would the world's beacon of freedom-a nation founded by immigrants-cast out an immigrant population that was likely brought here without choice and who likely now knows no other home? While \"no\" would seem to be the obvious answer, ordinary logic has eluded our Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Dreamers\" are neither constitutionally nor statutorily defined. Rather, the concept of protection for \"Dreamers\" arises from repeated congressional failures to act, and presidential action taken in their wake. A series of congressional sessions marked by bitter strife and inaction left the country without any protections for persons brought here illegally as children. The first attempt at a Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (\"DREAM\") Act came in 2001, and although it took on many names in subsequent years, the repeated attempts to pass this legislation were filibustered, abandoned, or defeated on the floor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As illustrated by the frequency of bills proposed, Dreamer legislation reached its zenith during late 2010 in the 111\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Session of Congress. On December 8, 2010, the House of Representatives actually passed the DREAM Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, like all other iterations of this controversial legislation, its fate was doomed-this time, less than two weeks later on the Senate floor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DACA-an Act of Desperation Born of Frustration with a Paralyzed Congress\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   President Obama's administration, faced with the reality that Congress could do little more than squabble regarding the Dreamers, decided to take action on its own. On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, issued a memorandum promulgating by executive action what is now known as DACA (\"DACA Memo\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   DACA protections were afforded to the same class of immigrants foreseen by the various failed iterations of Dreamer legislation. The primary qualifications for DACA protections were that an individual must (1) have come to the U.S. before the age of sixteen, (2) meet various education or military service requirements, (3) not have a criminal record, and (4) register prior to the age of thirty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DACA was issued under a theory of \"prosecutorial discretion\" and \"deferred\n   action\" and essentially permitted otherwise illegal aliens to remain in the United States without fear of deportation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   While some heralded DACA as a victory, others decried it as executive overreach-usurping the powers of Congress to promulgate immigration policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the course of the next five years, approximately 800,000 Dreamers registered for DACA protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Phase II: DAPA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Soon thereafter, the executive branch sought to expand its use of deferred action beyond the Dreamers. On November 20, 2014, then-Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Charles Johnson, issued a pair of memoranda in an attempt to promulgate what is now known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (\"DAPA\"), as well as a series of minor expansions for DACA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Less than a month later, DAPA was met with a legal challenge when Texas and twenty-five other states sued to enjoin implementation of the program.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas v.

In June 2016, an equally divided Supreme Court affirmed the decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Texas\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598061\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2271/#p2272\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2272,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598061\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2271/#p2272\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). In addition to finding DAPA and the expansions of DACA unlawful, the judicial decisions throughout the DAPA litigation illustrate two key realities: (1) challenges to DAPA or analogous immigration programs promulgated by DHS without approval by Congress are justiciable; and (2) reasonable legal minds may differ regarding their lawfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Aside from the classes of immigrants to which each applies, DACA and DAPA are largely similar programs addressing different classes or subcategories of immigrants. While DACA affects a population of approximately 800,000 otherwise illegal aliens, DAPA would have affected nearly half of the 11,000,000 immigrants currently in the United States unlawfully.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227854\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/733/#p745\">\n    787 F.3d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745 (5th Cir. 2015). DAPA was challenged and defeated before the program was ever successfully promulgated, while DACA has run for approximately half of a decade before the threat of any litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A Change in Administration and a Corresponding Change in Immigration Philosophy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The 2016 presidential election brought a change in leadership of the executive branch and, with it, significant changes in immigration views and philosophies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June of 2017, and with the defeat of DAPA directly in the rear-view mirror, Texas and other state plaintiffs sent a letter threatening to challenge DACA if it were not rescinded by September 6, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attorney\n   General Jeff Sessions advised the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Elaine Duke, that DACA was likely unlawful and headed for another legal battle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 5, 2017, Acting Secretary Duke issued a memorandum (\"DACA Rescission Memo\") outlining a six-month wind down of DACA to expire March 5, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to the Administrative Record, the basis for the decision to rescind DACA was its presumed unlawfulness in the wake of the DAPA litigation and the threat of imminent legal challenge. The agency's reasoning is substantiated by the legal advice of the Attorney General and the fact that the memorandum was issued the day before the state parties had threatened to act. A six-month wind down period was provided to avoid the potential for chaos if a court decision resulted in immediate termination, and the President urged Congress to pass Dreamer-protection legislation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Complicating the picture for some observers is the unfortunate and often inflammatory rhetoric used by President Trump during the campaign, as well as his Twitter pronouncements, both before and after his election. Thoughtful and careful judicial review is not aided when the President lobs verbal hand grenades at the federal courts, the Department of Justice, and anyone else with whom he disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As disheartening or inappropriate as the President's occasionally disparaging remarks may be, they are not relevant to the larger issues governing the DACA rescission. The DACA Rescission Memo is clear as to its purpose and reasoning, and its decision is rationally supported by the Administrative Record.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kleindienst v.

Under the Constitution, it is the responsibility of\n   Congress to determine immigration policy, and the executive branch must only act within its constitutional and delegated legislative authority. Although Congress has repeatedly failed to pass Dreamer legislation in the past, the ball is again in its court. And with 87 percent of Americans favoring some sort of DACA-esque protections, the elected members of Congress should understandably feel the pressure now that the President has deferred to them-in short, Congress needs to get the job done now that their authority has been recognized by court decisions and the President.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Other DACA Litigation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Various plaintiffs have filed lawsuits seeking to enjoin the DACA rescission throughout the country-specifically in this Court, the Eastern District of New York, the Northern District of California, and the District of the District of Columbia.

Respectfully, this Court disagrees.

Casa De Maryland and the rest of the organizational plaintiffs are special interest groups directly focused on aiding immigrants and their communities. The fact that one of their primary functions has been assisting their members with \"tens of thousands of DACA initial and renewal applications\" is sufficient for standing in and of itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 29 at 33. In addition to direct standing, the organizational plaintiffs possess association standing. Each organization has identified a number of its members who are Dreamers, and who unquestionably would have standing in this case. Furthermore, the purpose of these organizations is to aid and represent immigrants in their communities, including compliance with immigration procedures. Therefore, the rescission of DACA has an absolute nexus to the organizations' purpose. Additionally, the relief sought is injunctive and declaratory relief-not damages or any other remedy requiring the individual Dreamers. Hence, these organizational plaintiffs are the prototypical examples of possessing association standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds all Plaintiffs have standing in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c.

Furthermore, the DACA Rescission Memo was not immediately binding, but rather a statement of intended policy beginning March 5, 2018. To the extent that Plaintiffs aver that, in practice, immigration reviews absent DACA protections lack individualized discretion, their dispute is merely with how the agency applies its policy, and not with the policy itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although a substantial paradigm shift, the DACA Rescission Memo neither curtails DHS's discretion regarding individual immigration reviews, nor does it prevent the agency from granting Dreamers deferred action status again in the future.

Therefore, it is irrelevant whether this Court, a judge in California or New York, or even a justice on the Supreme Court might have made a different decision while standing in the shoes of DHS on September 5, 2017. Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether the decision was made with a \"satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   DHS's rationale provided in the DACA Rescission Memo was a belief, based on recent court decisions and the advice of the Attorney General, that DACA was unlawful. Assuming that a reasonable basis for that belief exists in the Administrative Record, how could trying to avoid unlawful action possibly be arbitrary and capricious? Quite simply, it cannot. Regardless of whether DACA is, in fact, lawful or unlawful, the belief that it was unlawful and subject to serious legal challenge is completely rational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   DAPA-an analogous program, promulgated by analogous means-had been defeated less than a year prior. The litigation that stopped DAPA included expansions of DACA itself. The same plaintiffs who defeated DAPA threatened to challenge DACA imminently. The Attorney General of the United States-the nation's chief legal officer-provided legal advice that DACA was likewise unlawful and likely ill-fated\n   against a legal challenge. All of this is in the Administrative Record-the remnants of the DAPA litigation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   the threatened legal challenge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Attorney General's advisory letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Therefore, what did the Acting Secretary of DHS do? She opted for a six-month wind-down period instead of the chaotic possibility of an immediate termination, which would come at a time known only to the judge resolving a future challenge to the DACA program. This decision took control of a pell-mell situation and provided Congress-the branch of government charged with determining immigration policy-an opportunity to remedy it. Given the reasonable belief that DACA was unlawful, the decision to wind down DACA in an orderly manner was rational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs' APA claims to lack merit; the rescission of DACA neither required notice-and-comment procedures, nor was it decided arbitrarily or capriciously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     d.

Plaintiffs believe they have met this burden by alleging a discriminatory intent in DACA's rescission-an allegation unsupported by the record before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The rescission of a policy relating to prosecutorial discretion does not shock the conscience of this Court. Absent congressional action, the benefits given to Dreamers by DACA were in potential violation of congressional immigration laws; the only thing that has changed is that deferred status will expire, and enforcement of immigration laws may recommence in the absence of action by Congress, which the President has requested. There is nothing surprising or unfair about policies, laws, or enforcement thereof changing with an election cycle. Furthermore, the election process, and not federal litigation, is the appropriate method for resolving any fairness implicated in DACA's rescission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs' substantive due process claim to lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     g.

In general, \"equitable estoppel is comprised of three basic elements: (1) a voluntary misrepresentation of one party, (2) that is relied on by the other party, (3) to the other party's detriment.\"\n   <em>\n    Chawla v.

In this Circuit, when raising such a claim against the government, there is a heightened standard for the first element, and an additional showing of \"affirmative misconduct\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   by the government actors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dawkins v.

The rescission of a policy relating to prosecutorial discretion does not amount to a misrepresentation by the government. DACA was promulgated with an express disclaimer that it was not conferring any rights. Nothing in the DACA Memo or in DACA's implementation suggested to Dreamers that the program was permanent, and individuals in the program were aware that their protections were subject to renewal every two years. DACA's rescission lacks any serious injustice-let alone, affirmative misconduct by any of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   However, while estoppel does not apply to DACA's rescission, it potentially would apply to any use for immigration enforcement of the information collected from Dreamers during DACA registrations. With regard to this narrow issue, and based on the evidence before it, the Court finds that the Government promised not to transfer or use the information gathered from Dreamers for immigration enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 29 at 42-44, 60-61; ECF No. 29-3 at 15-27, 32-41, 52-76, 96-98, 109-13. And now that the government is in possession of this information, the potential for use or sharing of it is theoretically possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On the one hand, the Government claims that no changes have been made to the information-sharing policy. However, at oral argument, counsel for the Government was unable to provide any assurance that the Government would not make changes.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Mr. Shumate:\n   </em>\n   ] The rescission policy that is being challenged here says nothing about the sharing of information for enforcement purposes. There's nothing more that the plaintiffs have raised other than a speculative fear that this might happen in the future. But DHS has been quite clear and they said on the FAQ section-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    The Court:\n   </em>\n   Are you prepared to say that from representing the defendants that there is no intention of changing the information-sharing assurances that were given in connection with DACA?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Shumate:\n   </em>\n   No. I'm not making that representation, Your Honor. Even from the beginning, DHS has been quite clear that this policy on information-sharing can change.... But they also I think take liberties with what that policy is. There has never been a promise or assurance that that information would never be changed. FAQ 19 quite clearly says that the information is generally protected and will not be shared for enforcement purposes, but there may be circumstances where it will be to adjudicate a DACA application or for law enforcement purposes if the individual meets the status of the test for notice to appear. But also quite clearly, DHS has said from the start that the information policy-sharing policy can change, but it has not. So that really should be the end of the debate about the information-sharing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Tr. of Mot. Hr'g (Dec. 15, 2017) at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court disagrees that this \"should be the end of the debate about the information-sharing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337320\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/606/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Logic would dictate that it is possible that the government, having induced these immigrants to share their personal information under the guise of immigration protections, could now use that same information to track and remove them. This potentially would be \"affirmative\n   misconduct\" by the government, and the Dreamers' detrimental reliance would be self-evident in the information-sharing itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Therefore, while the Government will not be enjoined from rescinding DACA, given the substantial risk for irreparable harm in using Dreamers' DACA-provided information, the Court will enjoin the Government from using information provided by Dreamers through the DACA program for enforcement purposes. In the event that the Government needs to make use of an individual Dreamer's information for national security or some purpose implicating public safety or public interest, the Government may petition the Court for permission to do so on a case-by-case basis with\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

If a court were to find that campaign skeletons prevented an official from pursuing otherwise constitutional policies, what could he do to cure the defect? Could he stand up and recant it all (\"just kidding!\") and try again? Or would we also need a court to police the sincerity of that mea culpa-piercing into the public official's \"heart of hearts\" to divine whether he really changed his mind, just as the Supreme Court has warned us not to?\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McCreary\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p845\">\n     545 U.S. at 862\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p845\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2722\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna &amp; Anthony Salvanto,\n    <em>\n     Most Americans support DACA, but oppose border wall\n    </em>\n    , CBS News (Jan. 20, 2018), https://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-americans-support-daca-but-oppose-border-wall-cbs-news-poll/.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v.

But where there is affirmative agency action-as with DAPA's issuance of lawful presence and employment authorization-and in light of the INA's intricate regulatory scheme for changing immigration classifications and issuing employment authorization, the action at least can be reviewed to determine whether the agency exceeded its statutory powers....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n    At its core, this case is about the Secretary's decision to change the immigration classification of millions of illegal aliens on a class-wide basis. The states properly maintain that DAPA's grant of lawful presence and accompanying eligibility for benefits is a substantive rule that must go through notice and comment, before it imposes substantial costs on them, and that DAPA is substantively contrary to law. The federal courts are fully capable of adjudicating those disputes. Because the interests that Texas seeks to protect are within the INA's zone of interests, and judicial review is available, we address whether Texas has established a substantial likelihood of success on its claim that DAPA must be submitted for notice and comment.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Plaintiffs' APA claim regarding DACA's information sharing policy also lacks merit.
