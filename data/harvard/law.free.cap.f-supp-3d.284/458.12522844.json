Compl.\") \u00b6 1; Declaration of Patrick J. Monaghan, Jr., Esq., dated Feb. 12, 2016 (D.I. 20) (\"Monaghan First Decl.\") \u00b6 28). Aquino sold her share of KBA to plaintiff and Kinder in or about 1985, at which point plaintiff believed that the name of the corporation changed from \"Kinder, Bryant &amp; Aquino Ltd.\" to \"Kinder &amp; Bryant Ltd.\" (\"K &amp; B\") (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Monaghan First Decl. \u00b6 28). In 1989, plaintiff and Kinder dissolved their partnership and entered into a new agreement (Am. Compl. \u00b6 24; Agreement, dated Nov. 8, 1989 (\"1989 Separation Agreement\"), annexed as Ex. A to Complaint, dated October 26, 2015 (D.I. 1) (\"Complaint\") ). Pursuant to that agreement, Kinder agreed to pay plaintiff a sum totaling less than $30,000.00 and to remove any reference to plaintiff from the corporation's name, including her name or initials (Am. Compl. \u00b6 24; 1989 Separation Agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In or before 1991, plaintiff retained Monaghan as her attorney to investigate Kinder for allegedly breaching the 1989 Separation Agreement, and in 1991 Monaghan filed suit on plaintiff's behalf against Kinder in New York State court, asserting that Kinder had failed to pay plaintiff certain royalties pursuant to that agreement or to provide an accounting (\"1991 N.Y.S. Action\") (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryant v. Kinder\n   </em>\n   , Index No. 8721/91, Complaint dated Nov. 8, 1991, annexed as Ex. K to Complaint). The 1991 N.Y.S. Action was settled in 1994 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff retained Monaghan again in 2000 to sue Kinder and others in New York State court for breaching the settlement of the 1991 N.Y.S. Action (\"2000 N.Y.S. Action\") (Am. Compl. \u00b6 25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryant v. Broadcast Music Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Index No. 5192/00, Complaint, excerpts annexed as Ex. L. to Complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 13, 2007, while the 2000 N.Y.S. Action was pending, plaintiff retained Monaghan for a third time to sue Kinder and numerous corporate defendants including some of the same defendants named in the 2000 N.Y.S. Action, such as Sunbow Productions, Inc. (\"Sunbow\"), for allegedly failing to pay royalties and other sums owed to plaintiff (\"2007 S.D.N.Y. Action\") (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Byant v. AB Droits Audiovisuels\n   </em>\n   , 07 Civ. 6395 (PAC)(HBP) (S.D.N.Y.), Complaint dated July 13, 2007 (D.I. 1) ). The 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action was stayed on September 30, 2009 by the Honorable Sidney H. Stein, United States District Judge, to whom the matter was then assigned, until the 2000 N.Y.S. Action was resolved (\n   <em>\n    Bryant v. AB Droits Audiovisuels\n   </em>\n   , 07 Civ. 6395 (PAC)(HBP) (S.D.N.Y.), Order of Judge Stein, dated Sept. 30, 2009 (D.I. 68) (\"Sept. 30, 2009 Order\") ). The 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action remains stayed (\n   <em>\n    Bryant v. AB Droits Audiovisuels\n   </em>\n   , 07 Civ. 6395 (PAC)(HBP) (S.D.N.Y.), Order of the undersigned, dated Mar. 8, 2017 (D.I. 147) (\"Mar. 8, 2017 Order\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In or around 2012, plaintiff claims to have discovered that KB was never a valid legal entity, and that her former music production business had continued to operate under the name \"Kinder, Bryant &amp; Aquino Ltd.\" from 1983 through 1996 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 7). In my Report and Recommendation dated December 16, 2016, I described the events that transpired after this discovery as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Plaintiff] instructed Monaghan to write to the judge presiding over the 2000 N.Y.S. Action and disclose these facts (Am. Compl. at 6-7, n.1-2). Monaghan declined to do so, and against his advice, plaintiff herself wrote a letter to the court detailing her discoveries (Letter to Hon. Margaret Garvey, J.S.C., dated Sept. 28, 2012, annexed as Ex. C to Complaint; Am. Compl. at 6-7 n.1-2[) ] .... Monaghan thereafter moved to withdraw from further representation of plaintiff in that case, and that motion was granted on November 23, 2012 (Am. Compl. at 6-7 n.1-2). In 2014, Monaghan also moved to withdraw from the federal court action and that motion was granted in November of 2014 (Pl. Opp. at 53)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Report and Recommendation of the undersigned, dated Dec. 16, 2016 (D.I. 65) (\"Dec. 16, 2016 R &amp; R\") at 8). Plaintiff retained attorney Anthony Motta\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to replace Monaghan in the 2000 N.Y.S. Action, but proceeded,\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   in the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action (Pl. Reply Mem. at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on October 26, 2015 (Complaint). The Amended Complaint asserted fraud and legal malpractice claims against Monaghan\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-42). Plaintiff's fraud claims against Monaghan were premised on his alleged failure to discover or to disclose to plaintiff, and the courts in all three actions, that KBA was still a \"valuable[ ] legal [New York] corporation in 1991\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-40). Plaintiff's claim for malpractice\n   was predicated on four factual specifications arising from Monaghan's representation of plaintiff during the 2000 N.Y.S. Action (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41). Specifically, plaintiff alleged that Monaghan had committed malpractice in connection with the 2000 N.Y.S. Action by: (1) failing to make certain filings, including applications for a default judgment, for attorney sanctions and for two subpoenas; (2) simultaneously representing Kinder; (3) failing to discover and inform plaintiff and the court that KBA had not been renamed K &amp; B in 1985 and (4) withholding key documents from plaintiff and Motta (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41). Notwithstanding the passage of more than three years-the applicable limitations period-since the occurrence of the alleged incidents of malpractice, plaintiff alleged that the statute of limitations did not bar her malpractice claim because Monaghan had a continuing relationship of trust with her as demonstrated by his appearance on her behalf in the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action through November 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 10, 2016, Monaghan filed a motion to dismiss the fraud and malpractice claims against him (Motion to Dismiss of Patrick J. Monaghan, Jr., Esq., dated May 10, 2016 (D.I. 48) ). By Opinion and Order dated March 6, 2017, which adopted my December 16, 2016 Report and Recommendation in its entirety, Judge Crotty granted summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claim for legal malpractice to the extent that it was predicated on either Monaghan's alleged (1) failure to discover and inform plaintiff and the courts that KBA had not been renamed K &amp; B and (2) withholding of documents after he withdrew as plaintiff's counsel (Opinion and Order of Judge Crotty, dated Mar. 6, 2017 (D.I. 76) (\"Mar. 6, 2017 Order\") at 8-9; Dec. 16, 2016 R &amp; R at 45-60). However, Judge Crotty found that summary judgment was not appropriate with respect to plaintiff's claim for legal malpractice predicated on both Monaghan's failure to make certain applications or his alleged conflict of interest with Kinder during the 2000 N.Y.S. Action (Mar. 6, 2017 Order at 12; Dec. 16, 2016 R &amp; R at 45-60). In particular, Judge Crotty rejected Monaghan's contention that plaintiff's malpractice claim was barred by the applicable three year statute of limitations, finding that Monaghan had failed to show that the statute of limitations could not be tolled by the continuous representation doctrine (Mar. 6, 2017 Order at 9-10; Dec. 16, 2016 R &amp; R at 61-62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Judge Crotty also granted dismissal of the fraud claims, finding that plaintiff had failed to allege her claims with particularity as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) (Mar. 6, 2017 Order at 12-13; Dec. 16, 2016 R &amp; R at 34-45). In light of plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   status, Judge Crotty afforded her one final opportunity to replead her fraud claims and permitted her to file a Second Amended Complaint no later than thirty days after the issuance of the Order,\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ., April 17, 2017 (Mar. 6, 2017 Order at 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff requested and was granted several extensions of time to amend her complaint and was ultimately given until May 24, 2017 to file her Second Amended Complaint (Order of the Undersigned, dated May 3, 2017 (D.I. 86) at 4). Plaintiff sent a letter to Judge Crotty dated May 23, 2017 indicating that she would not be filing a Second Amended Complaint and that she wished to proceed with the surviving aspects of her claim for malpractice (Letter of Anne Bryant to Judge Crotty, dated May 23, 2017 (D.I. 92) (\"Bryant Letter\") at 2). In that same letter plaintiff stated that she had \"newly discovered information that [was] pertinent to [her claim for legal malpractice] and [also] appear[ed] to make out a prima facie case for NY JUD. LAW \u00a7 487 Attorney Deceit or Collusion [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ]\" (Bryant Letter at 2). She advised Judge\n   Crotty that she would be submitting a motion to file \"Supplemental Pleadings\" pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15(c) and (d) (Bryant Letter at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff did not file a Second Amended Complaint on May 24, 2017. Instead, she filed a notice of motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) 5 and (d) to \"supplement\" her pleading (Plaintiff's Motion to Amend the Pleadings, dated May 24, 2017 (D.I. 93) (\"Pl. Mot.\") at 1-2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and attached her proposed amended pleading to her motion (Pl. Mot. at 5-17). Her proposed amended pleading alleges that, during the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action, Monaghan had (1) failed to serve, or obtain waiver of service from, several defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) failed to object to Sunbow's motion to dismiss dated January 4, 2008 on the grounds that the attorney who filed the motion had never filed a notice of appearance on behalf of Sunbow (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryant v. AB Droits Audiovisuels\n   </em>\n   , 07 Civ. 6395 (PAC)(HBP) (S.D.N.Y.), Notice of Motion to Dismiss dated Jan. 4, 2008 (D.I. 32) (\"Sunbow's Motion to Dismiss\") )\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) failed to object to Sunbow's January 8, 2008 corporate disclosure statement on the ground that it had been filed after Sunbow had moved to dismiss (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryant v. AB Droits Audiovisuels\n   </em>\n   , 07 Civ. 6395 (PAC)(HBP) (S.D.N.Y.), Corporate Disclosure Statement of Sunbow dated Jan. 8, 2008 (D.I. 38) (\"Sunbow's Corporate Disclosure Statement\") ). Plaintiff alleges that this conduct amounted to violation of New York Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1\n   (Attorney Competence), 3.1 (Non-Meritorious Claims and Contentions) and 3.2 (Delay of Litigation) (Pl. Mot. 10-14).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Comp.%20Codes%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%201200.0\">\n    N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, \u00a7 1200.0\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Rules 1.1, 3.1, 3.2. Plaintiff asserts that Monaghan's negligence damaged her reputation for honesty, caused significant delay in the 2007 S.D.N.Y. action at a cost to her and deprived her of \"decades of royalty payments that have been misdirected to others through various schemes and artifices\" (Pl. Mot. at 14). Accordingly, plaintiff argues that there are three additional bases for her claim of legal malpractice (Pl. Mot. at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff also appears to seek to allege a claim for attorney deceit pursuant to New York Judiciary Law Section 487 based on those same facts (Pl. Mot. at 14). Specifically, plaintiff alleges that Monaghan's deficient representation of her throughout the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action rose above the level of ordinary malpractice and \"indicate[d] deceit[ ] and strongly suggest[ed] collusion\" between Monaghan and named defendants (Pl. Mot. at 14-15). Plaintiff also alleges that Monaghan, in concert with defendants in the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action, \"designed a Complaint that could spin in the [f]ederal [c]ourts through years of [m]otion [p]ractice\" resulting in excessive cost to plaintiff (Pl. Mot. at 13). Plaintiff seeks treble damages based on either the amount that she expended on litigating the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action or the amount that she lost as a result of Monaghan's alleged misrepresentation (Pl. Mot. at 15). Plaintiff does not appear to replead any of the other fraud claims that she had previously alleged but were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Monaghan argues that plaintiff's attempt to amend her complaint is futile and that her motion should, therefore, be denied (Memorandum of Law of Patrick J. Monaghan, Jr., Esq., in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion, dated June 21, 2017 (D.I. 97) (\"Def. Mem.\") at 6-9). Furthermore, Monaghan argues that plaintiff's additional factual allegations in support of her claim for malpractice are barred by New York's three year statute of limitations for legal malpractice and that the doctrine of continuous representation does not save plaintiff's claim (Def. Mem. at 8). In support of this argument, Monaghan proffers a declaration with exhibits, including an email from Monaghan to plaintiff dated October 1, 2012 which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I will not perform any more services for you since you have effectively terminated me and you have taken actions directly on your own behalf in the case. I suggest that you continue your ongoing search for alternate counsel. I will send you the papers I file with the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Monaghan's Email to Anne Bryant dated Oct. 1, 2012, annexed as Ex. 4 to Declaration of Patrick J. Monaghan, Jr., Esq., dated June 21, 2017 (D.I. 98) (\"Monaghan Second Decl.\") ). Accordingly, Monaghan asserts that even if the doctrine of continuous representation applies, it would only toll the statute of limitations until the end of 2012 at the latest. (Def. Mem. at 11). Monaghan admits that he remained plaintiff's counsel in the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action through 2014, but notes that the case was stayed from 2009 through his withdrawal as counsel in 2014 and, therefore, \"there was nothing to do in the case\" (Def. Mem. at 11). Monaghan also argues that plaintiff fails to allege damages sufficiently (Def. Mem. at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With respect to plaintiff's replead claim for attorney deceit under New York Judiciary Law Section 487, Monaghan contends that it is fatally deficient because it still fails to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) (Def. Mem. at 8). Specifically, Monaghan argues that plaintiff failed to identify a possible\n   motive that would have led him to collude with defendants in the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action to plaintiff's detriment (Def. Mem. at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standards-Procedural Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Amend a Pleading Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As an initial matter, plaintiff inaccurately describes her motion as one for leave to serve supplemental pleading under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(d) (Pl. Mot. at 1). Rule 15(d) provides, in pertinent part, that \"the court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence or event that happened\n   <em>\n    after the date\n   </em>\n   , of the pleading to be supplemented.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(d) (emphasis added). Plaintiff's proposed amendments are based on events that occurred nearly a decade before she filed her original Complaint. Accordingly, plaintiff's motion is properly characterized as a motion to amend her pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cummings-Fowler v.

First, plaintiff proposes to add three new bases for her claim of malpractice against Monaghan in connection with his representation of plaintiff in the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action (Pl. Mot. at 8-9). Second, plaintiff argues that those same facts establish a claim for attorney deceit under New York Judiciary Law Section 487, a claim which she previously raised in both the Complaint and the Amended Complaint, albeit on different factual grounds, and which was dismissed without prejudice by Judge Crotty in his March 6, 2017 Order (Pl. Mot. at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Additional Factual Bases for Plaintiff's Malpractice Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As noted above, plaintiff seeks to assert three new bases for her legal malpractice\n   claim: (1) Monaghan committed malpractice by failing to object to Sunbow's motion to dismiss on the ground that it was filed by an attorney who had never filed a notice of appearance on Sunbow's behalf; (2) Monaghan improperly failed to object to Sunbow's corporate disclosure statement on the ground that it was filed after Sunbow's motion to dismiss and (3) Monaghan improperly failed to serve, or obtain a waiver of service from, several corporate defendants against whom plaintiff had claims (Pl. Mot. at 8-9). Plaintiff alleges without any explanation that Monaghan's conduct amounted to violations of several Rules of Professional Conduct under New York law. Furthermore, she claims that Monaghan's negligence proximately caused damages to her in the form of (1) harm to her reputation and honesty; (2) costs and expenses incurred in litigating the protracted 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action and (3) deprivation of past due royalties allegedly owed to her (Pl. Mot. at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Monaghan argues that the proposed amendments are futile (Def. Mem. at 8-11). He principally argues that plaintiff's malpractice claim is barred by New York's statute of limitations, and has submitted a declaration and supporting exhibits indicating that his professional relationship with plaintiff ended in October 2012 and that her new specifications are time-barred (Def. Mem. at 8-11). However, Monaghan's declaration and his exhibits cannot be considered at this stage. Because the futility analysis under Rule 15(a) is essentially the same as the analysis used to resolve a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), the court cannot consider an affirmative defense that is not clear from the face of the proposed amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Journal Publ'g Co. v.

(\"Materials outside the pleadings ... cannot be considered on a motion for leave to amend.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Monaghan also argues that plaintiff has failed to allege sufficiently that plaintiff was damaged as the result of his alleged malpractice (Def. Mem. at 4). As explained above, even if an attorney-client relationship is found and an attorney's negligence has been established, in order to state a claim for legal malpractice the complaint must plausibly allege that plaintiff suffered, actual damages and that the attorney's malpractice was the proximate cause of those damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirk v.

Plaintiff does not allege what the legal bases for these objections were nor does she assert that a favorable determination would have likely been made with respect to these objections. Sunbow's Motion to Dismiss was never decided (Pl. Mot. 13-14). Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Sunbow and the other corporate defendants who jointly filed Sunbow's Motion to Dismiss from the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action, without prejudice, on March 21, 2017 before any ruling on the motion (2007 S.D.N.Y. Voluntary Dismissal). In addition, because a corporate disclosure statement has nothing to do with the merits of an action, it is a near certainty that the absence of an objection to Sunbow's corporate disclosure statement had no impact on plaintiff's claims. Thus, plaintiff's first two \"new\" specifications of malpractice are futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Monaghan committed malpractice by failing to serve several defendants who never made an appearance in the 2007 S.D.N.Y.

However, notwithstanding this conclusory allegation, plaintiff does not identify what claims she would have asserted against these defendants or when those claims arose, nor does she allege facts explaining why she likely would have prevailed on her claims against those defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stonewell Corp. v.

Plaintiff has again failed to allege specific facts would support an inference that Monaghan harbored an intent to deceive the court or any party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed claim for \"Attorney Deceit\" in her proposed Second Amended Complaint differs from that alleged in her Amended Complaint. In her Amended Complaint, plaintiff alleged that Monaghan deceived the court in all three actions by \"propounding the misrepresented 'fact' that Kinder &amp; Bryant Ltd[.] was the legal [New York] Corporation of which Plaintiff was a co-owner,\" causing plaintiff to enter into fraudulent settlements (Am. Coml. \u00b6\u00b6 23-40). In my December 16, 2016 Report and Recommendation, I found that this allegation was insufficient to state a claim for attorney deceit because the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Amended Complaint assert[ed] that Monaghan \"knew or should have known\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   that KBA's name had not actually been changed to K &amp; B and that his failure to discover and disclose this fact to plaintiff in connection with the actions he litigated for her was deceitful .... [P]laintiff does not allege how or when Monaghan knew or could have learned that KBA's name had not actually been changed nor does she identify what motive he had to conceal these facts from her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Dec. 16, 2016 R &amp; R at 40-41). Put simply, I concluded that plaintiff had failed to allege facts sufficient to establish either of the two elements of a Section 487 claim-that Monaghan was guilty of deceit and had an intent to deceive the court or plaintiff-warranted dismissal of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed amendment to her claim for attorney deceit is premised on Monaghan's deficient performance as counsel throughout the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action. Plaintiff alleges that Monaghan's conduct during the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action suggests collusion between Monaghan and defendants (Pl. Mot. at 13). Plaintiff further alleges that Monaghan prepared a faulty complaint in concert with defendants to delay the ultimate resolution of the case (Pl. Mot. at 13). Despite its new factual allegations, the proposed claim is deficient for largely the same reasons as her previous Section 487 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff's claim fails because she does not plausibly allege facts that imply collusion between Monaghan and defendants, or that Monaghan had an intent or motive to deceive the court or any party. Rather, plaintiff makes conclusory allegations of collusion with no supporting facts to suggest motive. She does not identify any particular statements in or omissions from the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Complaint that were fraudulent nor does she explain how it was deficient. She does not, for example, explain why the complaint was somehow advantageous to the defendants in the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action, which is what one would expect to see if a plaintiff's attorney had colluded with the defendants in an action. She also fails to allege facts suggesting a reason for Monaghan to prolong the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiff also appears to claim that Monaghan's alleged failures, discussed in the preceding section, amounted to more than malpractice, and, in the aggregate, Monaghan's actions somehow suggest that he had colluded with defendants in order to protract the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action. However, plaintiff does not explain how these failures were fraudulent or how they imply collusion with defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mazzone v.

Instead, plaintiff attempts to raise a strong inference of intent to collude by pointing to the fact that she incurred costs and expenses in the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action, and that that financial burden grew in correlation with the amount of time it has taken to resolve the 2007 S.D.N.Y. Action.
