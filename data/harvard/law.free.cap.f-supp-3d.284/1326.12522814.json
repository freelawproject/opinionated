PANNELL, JR., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a civil rights action brought by the plaintiff Devon Brown against the City of Atlanta (the \"City\"), and the individual defendants Bryant Burns, Kelvin Walls, Alfred Watkins, Gary Smith, Richard Dillon, Robbie Scandrick, Gordon Cabanaw, Ritchie Newell, and Stanley Reynolds (the \"Individual Defendants\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging an unlawful search and seizure and various related claims. Before the court are the defendants' motion for summary judgment [Doc. No. 47], Brown's motion for partial summary judgment against the City [Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   No. 54], and Brown's motion for sanctions against the City [Doc. No. 52].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As an initial matter, the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the defendants' motion to file their motion for summary judgment in excess of twenty-five (25) pages [Doc. No. 47-2]. In addition, because Brown concedes that summary judgment against him is appropriate for Count IV of the amended complaint (intentional infliction of emotional distress), the defendants' motion [Doc. No. 47] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Brown's remaining claims are for unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution against both the City and the Individual Defendants (Count I) and for false arrest and battery against the Individual Defendants under state law (Count II).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also seeks punitive damages against the Individual Defendants. Brown asserts that the defendants violated his federal and state rights by entering his private clubhouse without a warrant under the guise of a city business and alcohol license compliance check and arresting him for violating the related city ordinances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendants have moved for summary judgment, arguing: (1) that Brown cannot establish the elements for municipal liability; (2) that the Individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity (for the federal claim); (3) that the Individual Defendants are entitled to official immunity (for the state law claims); and (4) that punitive damages are unavailable. Brown has filed a cross-motion for summary judgment solely for his federal claim against the City. He has also filed a motion for sanctions against the City, asserting that both Rule 30(b)(6) designees that the City offered were not adequately prepared for their depositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After reviewing the record and the parties' submissions, the court enters the following order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the early hours of February 8, 2014, the Individual Defendants (six police officers and three compliance officers from other departments) gathered to conduct a compliance check at a business on Campbellton Road in southwest Atlanta. Undercover officers had previously witnessed misconduct at the location, including alcohol sales to minors. The officers also knew the business to be open past legal business hours. The plan was to enter and inspect the business for compliance with Atlanta's Code of Ordinances (the \"City Code\") and issue appropriate citations. They had both a search warrant and an arrest warrant to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   But they did not conduct that search. The business was closed, which prevented their inspection-apparently regardless of the warrants. All was not lost. Sergeant Walls recalled receiving information that other establishments in the nearby areas had been operating outside legal business hours and conducting other illegal activity. Because they had the resources ready for their initial target, the officers decided to \"attack\" some of these areas. Burns Dep. at 63:4-6 [Doc. No. 50]. They began checking the Metropolitan Parkway corridor, working their way up the road, and eventually came upon the unit that the plaintiff Devon Brown rented as a clubhouse for the Dirty South Slab Riders (\"DSSR\") motorcycle club.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The DSSR had signs on the premises that read \"no trespassing,\" \"keep out,\" and \"private club.\" However, the officers believed that the location was a commercial property open for business. When approaching the DSSR, they noted several cars in the parking lot, loud music playing, and tinted windows on the building. They also saw a person leave from the front door and noted that the door was unlocked. They then decided to enter without knocking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The officers did not have a warrant to search the DSSR, nor to arrest anyone on the premises, including Brown. They simply began conducting a compliance check of the DSSR based on their observations. Once inside, they also saw that alcohol was available on the premises. The parties dispute the length of the search and each others' conduct. However, it is undisputed that Brown (either initially or after some time) presented himself to the officers as the president of the establishment. When asked for the DSSR's business and alcohol licenses, Brown answered that he did not have either license and that he did not believe he needed them. The officers thought otherwise, and arrested Brown for violating City Code Sections 30-55 (failure to obtain a business license) and 10-3 (failure to comply with liquor licensing provisions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Brown was initially found guilty of violating City Code Sections 30-55 and 10-3 in Atlanta municipal court. That ruling was overturned on appeal by the Fulton County Superior Court, and Brown was cleared of the charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Superior Court held that the DSSR (1) is not a \"business\" subject to City Code Section 30-55; and (2) is not a \"business\" or a \"bottle house\" subject to City Code Section 10-3. Brown then brought this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During discovery, Brown issued a notice of deposition to the City under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6). The notice instructed the City to designate a representative to testify on its behalf on two topics: (1) \"[t]he City's legal justification for the entry and search of Plaintiff's property, and the arrest of Plaintiff, on February 8, 2014\"; and (2) \"[t]he policies and procedures of the City pursuant to which the entry and search of plaintiff's property was carried out, and pursuant to which Plaintiff was arrested\" [Doc. Nos. 36, 39, 41]. The City first presented Major Darin Schierbaum for deposition. His deposition was short lived. Brown's counsel believed that Schierbaum was not prepared to speak on the designated topics and requested a substitute 30(b)(6) designee. The City then provided Detective Edward Miles as its representative four weeks later. Brown's counsel again felt that the deponent was not prepared to testify on the noticed topics, but continued to depose Miles on the information that he knew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the close of discovery, the parties filed the instant motions: (1) defendants' motion for summary judgment [Doc. No. 47]; (2) Brown's motion for partial summary judgment against the City [Doc. No. 54]; and (3) Brown's motion for sanctions against the City [Doc. No. 52].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In the absence of a carefully defined exception, a warrantless entry into a private commercial property is presumptively unreasonable and violates the Fourth Amendment. The question is whether the defendants' search falls within one of those exceptions such that their conduct was reasonable and not in violation of Brown's Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The City does not dispute that the officers entered the DSSR without a warrant or consent. Rather, it argues that the officers had a right to be there under the City Code. Specifically, the City asserts that its warrantless entry into DSSR was a lawful administrative inspection to check for compliance with the City's business and alcohol license provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   An administrative inspection may qualify as an exception to the Fourth Amendment's general rule against warrantless entry.\n   <em>\n    Bruce v.

Brown counters that DSSR was not subject to either provision because it was neither a business establishment nor an alcohol distributor, and thus, the administrative inspection exception cannot apply. On the same basis, Brown argues that there is no genuine dispute that the search and seizure violated his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   City Code Section 10-32 authorizes Atlanta police officers \"to inspect establishments licensed under [Chapter 10] during the hours in which the premises are open for business. These inspections shall be made for the purpose of verifying compliance with this chapter.\" City Code \u00a7 10-32. The City argues that the DSSR was subject to this provision because it was a \"private club\" as defined in Section 10-1. In support, the City points to Sergeant Burns' testimony that Brown referred to the DSSR as a \"private club\" during the inspection. Even if true, Brown using of the term \"private club\" is not enough to make the DSSR Clubhouse subject to Chapter 10 compliance checks. Chapter 10 defines the term \"private club\" as \"a corporation chartered, organized and existing under the laws of the state\" and continuously maintaining \"not less than 250 members.\" City Code \u00a7 10-1. Brown argues that the DSSR was never formally incorporated in Georgia and does not have a formal charter. And the evidence shows that, even at its height, the DSSR had no more than about twenty members. So despite the City's contention, the express terms of the City Code show that the DSSR was not a \"private club\" subject to inspections under Section 10-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The City's argument that the inspection was authorized under Section 30-76 is similarly doomed. That provision states that \"[t]he certificate issued for any business location shall be available for inspection at the address listed on the certificate and shall be displayed to any authorized enforcement officer of the city when so requested. This requirement may also be satisfied by posting the certificate in some conspicuous place at the address listed on the certificate.\" City Code \u00a7 30-76. The City offers no additional argument for why the DSSR fell under this ordinance beyond its \"private club\" assertion, which the court rejects. Setting that aside, the City also acknowledges that administrative inspections must be limited to \"closely regulated businesses\" to avoid the warrant requirement. Defs' Br. at 13 [Doc. No. 47]. Simply being a business in general is not enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , 436 U.S. at 313,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490680\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/307/#p312\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So even if the DSSR was subject to Chapter 30 as a \"business,\" a compliance check for an ordinary business license cannot qualify for the exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition, the Superior Court of Fulton County has already determined that the DSSR was not subject to either of these provisions. The Superior Court found \"as a matter of law\" that the DSSR was \"not a 'Business' under Chapter 30 of the Atlanta City Code\" and that it \"was neither a 'Business' nor a 'Bottle House' and thus Atlanta City Code \u00a7 10-3 [ (failure to comply with liquor licensing provisions) ] does not apply\" [Doc. No. 60-5 at 4]. The state court's findings also preclude any ruling to the contrary due to collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The City offers no adequate basis for a rational trier of fact to find that the DSSR was otherwise subject to Sections 10-32 or 30-76 of the City Code. Accordingly, the court finds that the compliance check was not an administrative inspection that qualifies for an exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The City also asserts that the officers were operating in good faith when entering the DSSR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Supreme Court has held that a \"municipality may not assert the good faith of its officers or agents as a defense to liability under \u00a7 1983.\"\n   <em>\n    Owen v.

Allowing the City to evade liability based on the qualified immunity of its officers would \"contraven[e] the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Owen.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Askins v.

While the City also argues that the officers' arguable probable cause relieves it of liability, that argument similarly lacks merits because the purpose of showing arguable probable cause is to receive qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Further, the court finds that arguable probable cause is not available to the Individual Defendants. Probable cause to enter without a warrant requires exigent circumstances.\n   <em>\n    O'Rourke v.

Brown has adequately shown that there were no such exigent circumstances here. And while arguable probable cause may afford qualified immunity for a warrantless arrest,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687432\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/608/724/#p734\">\n    608 F.3d at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , nothing uncovered during an unlawful inspection can be used to support arguable probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Bruce v.

So, because the officers' entry into the DSSR was unlawful from the start, there can be no supporting probable cause to arrest from the ensuing search.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629284\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/498/1232/#p1239\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds that the warrantless search and seizure does not qualify for the administrative inspection exception, and the defendants point to no\n   other applicable exception to the warrant requirement. Brown has successfully proven that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The court must now determine if Brown has established that the City had a custom or policy that deprived him of his constitutional rights. He alleges that the City had a custom or policy permitting its officers to conduct a warrantless search of any commercial property for a business or alcohol license compliance check. The City responds that Brown has failed to show that the inspection was not an isolated incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As noted above, a \"single incident of a constitutional violation is insufficient to prove a policy or custom even when the incident involves several employees of the municipality.\"\n   <em>\n    Craig v. Floyd Cty., Ga.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5647332\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1306/#p1311\">\n    643 F.3d 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1311 (11th Cir. 2011). But that is not all that Brown has presented. In addition to showing that the officers entered the DSSR and arrested Brown without a warrant, Brown puts up the testimony of Sergeant Bryant Burns and Detective Edward Miles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Burns is a defendant in this case. He was at the inspection and arrested Brown. During his deposition, Burns said that regardless of City Code Section 10-32, he \"can still walk into any business, whether this is a licensed establishment or not, to find out, to check for compliance.\" Burns Dep. 17:14-17 [Doc. No. 50]. He said that it was part of his general law enforcement authority to do so, and that this authority was based in City policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. (By [Brown's attorney] ) So I'll read into the record. You state here: Additionally, if the door was closed and unlocked, this is a commercial building zoned C1 commercial, which gives the City of Atlanta the authority to come in to check if the building was in compliance and all necessary licenses were presented. Is that a fair statement of what you believe the basis of your authority was to enter into the premises without a warrant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. Okay. And is it City policy that any building that is zoned C1 commercial can be entered into without a warrant to check for licensure?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. Regardless how it's zoned, the police department or the business license department can enter into any business during the hours that it is open and the door is unlooked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:19-19:11. Burns also indicated that entering an establishment without a warrant was a common practice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   We often find that a lot, more often than not, we'll sometimes devote our time to just checking business licenses. So there may be a building that has multiple suites in it, so we'll go from suite to suite, checking on that business license. As long as they're doing business, we\n   can enter into that business-and the doors are unlocked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:18-25. The court notes that this practice was for general business license inspections, not solely for inspections of closely regulated businesses that might otherwise qualify for an exception to the warrant requirement. Burns' testimony tends to show that the City had a policy or custom of conducting unlawful, warrantless searches of commercial properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Miles, the City's 30(b)(6) designee, provides even more evidence in Brown's favor. Miles is not a defendant and was not involved in the events that led to this lawsuit. In fact, during his deposition, he revealed that he apparently had no factual knowledge of the inspection of the DSSR-an aspect that the court will separately address as to Brown's motion for sanctions. Yet Miles repeatedly stated that he was prepared to testify on the City's policies and procedures, and the City's attorney also stressed that Miles was prepared to testify on that topic throughout the deposition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Miles Dep. at 7:9-11, 10:17-22 [Doc. No. 49]. In doing so, Miles essentially confirmed that the City had a policy or custom for officers to enter private property without a warrant to check compliance with its business and liquor license provisions. For instance, Miles confirmed that policy when asked about a written statement by Burns:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q. Okay. And Sergeant Burns writes: Additionally, if the door was closed and unlocked, this is a commercial building, zoned C1 commercial, which gives the City of Atlanta the authority to come in and check if the building was in compliance and all necessary licenses were presented. That statement that because the premises was zoned C1 commercial, that that fact permits the officers to come in without a warrant and do a compliance check, is that an accurate statement of City policy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. Yes, that is accurate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. So under City policy, any building that is zoned C1 commercial, officers can do a warrantless entry to check for licensure?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. Right. An inspection, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:9-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Miles also said that the City did not limit an officer's discretion in determining whether a location was subject to inspection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. So as far as City policy goes, there's nothing that could limit sort of what basis an officer could cite as his basis for believing that an establishment may be licensed under this [Chapter 10]; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. Okay. And any time an officer states that they believe an establishment should be licensed under [Chapter 10], is it City policy that that person can enter the premises without a warrant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Yes, that's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. Okay. And that's official City policy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. Yes. What happens during the course of inspection, [an] officer is allowed to enter the premises, and once he enters the premises, then he may develop other probable cause, which will lead him to go further into the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:3-19. Miles would again indicate that City policy allowed officers to enter without a warrant for a general business license inspection, and then develop probable cause after the fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   It's just an inspection. So the warrant and the warrantless entries and stuff like that, it won't apply to just doing an inspection. It's once we get inside, determine whether there's other crimes or violations being committed, that's when we'll determine whether or not we have probable cause to move forward with the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:6-12. The City does not dispute that Miles spoke on its behalf when making these statements. Nor does it not offer any evidence to contradict his testimony. At most, the City argues that Brown mischaracterizes the testimony. Having reviewed the transcript, the court finds otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, the evidence weighs in Brown's favor. Burns' testimony shows one instance of officers entering a building without a warrant under the alleged policy and further shows that this type of entry was a common practice for the City police. And Miles, someone completely unrelated to the inspection and authorized to speak on the City's behalf, confirmed that the City had a policy in line with Brown's allegations. Thus, the court finds that Brown has established a custom or policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The final piece is whether this custom or policy caused Brown's rights to be deprived. The court finds that it did. Burns stated that this policy was the basis of his authority to enter the DSSR. Burns Dep. at 19:1-4 [Doc. No. 50].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Count I against the City is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   Brown's cross-motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   such that the City is liable for violating Brown's Fourth Amendment rights. The amount of damages will be determined by a jury at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Brown's Federal Claim Against the Individual Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Individual Defendants also move for summary judgment on Brown's Section 1983 claim based on qualified immunity. Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense that protects government actors from being sued in their individual capacities for their discretionary acts.\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Brown explicitly conceded this element in his response to the defendants' summary judgment motion [Doc. No. 60 at 19 n.2]. Accordingly, Brown must show that qualified immunity is not available to the Individual Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity for his discretionary acts involves a two step inquiry.

These topics are straightforward and specific, meeting the requirements of Rule 30(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strategic Solutions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202091714\">\n    2015 WL 2091714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7 (finding that topics such as \"[t]he services provided by Strategic Solutions\" and \"Defendant's use of the Investment Proposal and/or any parts of the Investment Proposal between January 2011 and present\" satisfy Rule 30(b)(6) ). Thus, the court will now assess whether the City met its duty to prepare the 30(b)(6) designee on the noticed topics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The City offered Major Darin Schierbaum as its 30(b)(6) designee on May 3, 2017. Schierbaum was not prepared. He had not seen the deposition notice, and confirmed that he was not prepared to testify on either of the designated topics. Schierbaum Dep. at 6:14-16, 15:1-16:22 [Doc. No. 48]. He also indicated that the City's attorney had only instructed him to review the training that the Individual\n   Defendants received and nothing further. Id. at 15:1-16:2. Brown's counsel ended the deposition and requested that the City provide a properly prepared designee as a substitute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   About four weeks later, the City provided Detective Edward Miles as its substitute 30(b)(6) designee. Brown provided the same topics for that deposition, yet Miles was also unprepared to speak on the noticed topics. He conducted \"very minimal\" preparation for the first deposition topic-essentially he reviewed the related City Code sections but not the incident itself-and he even admitted that he could not give any information about that topic. Miles Dep. at 6:16-7:2, 7:16-20 [Doc. No. 49]. On the second topic, he had no factual knowledge of the DSSR inspection or Brown's arrest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:13-11:2. Nor did he review materials to familiarize himself with the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Miles could speak generally on the City's policies and procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And like Schierbaum, Miles said that no one directed him to prepare to testify about anything further.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:7-9. The deposition continued, but only as to the information Miles was prepared to provide, not as to the topics actually designated by Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The court finds that the City failed its obligations under Rule 30(b)(6). The City was required to provide someone who was prepared to testify for the City on the noticed topics. Neither Schierbaum nor Miles was prepared to do so, amounting to a failure to appear for a 30(b)(6) deposition.\n   <em>\n    Black Horse Lane Assoc., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11227393\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/275/#p304\">\n    228 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the City points to no justifiable reason for its failure. It does not assert, for instance, that the information that Brown sought was unavailable. Instead, the City argues that it was Brown who failed to meet his Rule 30(b)(6) obligations, primarily asserting that the noticed topics were unreasonably vague. As noted above, the court finds otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The City offers three more arguments which the court also rejects: (1) that Brown's motion is untimely under Local Rule 37.1; (2) that Brown did not make a good faith attempt to conduct a pre-filing conference with the City before filing the instant motion; and (3) that Burns-a fact witness and not a 30(b)(6) designee-provided sufficient testimony to satisfy the City's obligations. First, Local Rule 37.1 does not apply to Brown's motion. Local Rule 37.1 sets a 14-day time limitation on motions to compel a disclosure or discovery under Rule 37(a) ; it sets no such limitation on the instant motion for sanctions brought under Rule 37(d). Second, and in the same vein, the City's reference to Rule 37(a)(1)'s requirement for a pre-filing conference does not apply here. That provision also governs motions to compel a disclosure or discovery, not motions for sanctions under Rule 37(d). In fact, courts have held that no such pre-filing conference is required for a motion for sanctions under Rule 37(d).\n   <em>\n    Nationstar Mortg., LLC v. Flamingo Trails No. 7 Landscape Maint. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352944\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/316/327/#p335\">\n    316 F.R.D. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335 (D. Nev. 2016) (\"[A] pre-filing conference is not required under Rule 37(d) in relation to a motion for sanctions arising out of a nonappearance at a deposition.\" (citing 8B Wright, Miller &amp; Marcus, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 2291, at p. 638 (2010))). And third, the City's contention that Burns answered questions on the topics during his deposition is irrelevant. He was deposed in his individual capacity, not as the City's 30(b)(6) designee. The whole point of the 30(b)(6) deposition was to provide the City's position on the noticed topics, not the position of the other defendants in the case. Because Burns' testimony does not speak for the City, it does nothing to satisfy the City's 30(b)(6) requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Despite being given two chances, the City simply did not to provide a properly prepared 30(b)(6) designee. That failure\n   cannot be excused under these circumstances. Accordingly, the court finds that sanctions under Rule 37(d) are appropriate and Brown's motion for sanctions [Doc. No. 52] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Brown is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   to file a petition within 21 days of this order for reasonable attorney's fees and expenses associated with the 30(b)(6) depositions on April 28, 2017 and May 31, 2017, and for those associated with Brown's motion for sanctions [Doc. No. 52]. The City shall have 21 days from the date the petition is filed to file a response. Any such response by the City shall be limited to the reasonableness of the fees sought by Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Accordingly, the defendants' motion for summary judgment [Doc. No. 47] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n   It is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Counts II and IV of the amended complaint. It is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count I and as to Brown's request for punitive damages against the Individual Defendants. Brown's motion for partial summary judgment against the City [Doc. No. 54] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   on the issue of liability. Damages for Count I against the City will be determined by a jury at trial. Finally, Brown's motion for sanctions against the City [Doc. No. 52] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Brown is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   to file a petition within 21 days of this order for reasonable attorney's fees and expenses associated with the 30(b)(6) depositions on April 28, 2017 and May 31, 2017, and for those associated with Brown's motion for sanctions [Doc.

The state court action was between the City and Brown, and whether the DSSR fell within those definitions was fully litigated and decided.

First, in their affirmative summary judgment motion, the defendants argue that Brown cannot establish a custom or policy because he fails to show that the officers acted with deliberate indifference. They cite\n    <em>\n     Franklin v. Tatum\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20Fed.%20Appx.%20761\">\n     627 Fed.Appx 761\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (11th Cir. 2015) -and no other cases-in support. Yet deliberate indifference is not required here. Indeed,\n    <em>\n     Franklin\n    </em>\n    addressed a claim for supervisory liability against a county sheriff-not a municipality.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20Fed.%20Appx.%20761\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20Fed.%20Appx.%20761\">\n     at 764-66\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, this argument fails. Second, the City argues that Brown has not proven that the constitutional violation was caused by the acts of a final policymaker. But \"not all theories of municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 require (or depend on) a single final policymaker.\"\n    <em>\n     Hoefling v.

Thus, this argument also fails.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The court notes that Count II of the amended complaint begins by alleging that the Individual Defendants violated Brown's rights under the Georgia constitution by unlawfully searching and entering the DSSR.
