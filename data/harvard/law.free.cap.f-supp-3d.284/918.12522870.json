Also before the Court is Defendant's Combined Motion for Summary Judgment and to Dismiss under Rule 9(b) (Picht) [Civil File No. 11-958 Docket No. 25].\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Overview of the Hardieplank Product\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant James Hardie Building Products Inc. (\"Hardie\") originated in Australia in 1888, but now sells fiber-cement products around the world. ( [Docket No. 260] Moriarity Decl., Ex. B, Exponent Report at 6.) Fiber-cement is a composite material made of sand, cement, and cellulose fibers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hardie first began selling its exterior fiber-cement siding, Hardieplank, in the United States in 1987. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Since that time, Hardie has made at least seven major changes to Hardieplank, including changing formula additives, design changes (such as altering the shape of the planks to improve water shedding), and manufacturing method improvements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   18-20.) Some Hardieplank versions are sold with Hardie's factory-coated paints, while other versions are sold as primed-only products, which can be painted either in a factory or in the field. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Hardieplank Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Until 2009, Hardie provided a 50-year prorated limited warranty with Hardieplank (\"Limited Warranty\"). (Exponent Report at 6; [Docket No. 273] Allport Decl., Ex. 4, Limited Warranty.) The Limited Warranty warrants that Hardieplank complies with ASTM C1186, the American Society for Testing and Materials standard, when manufactured and \"is free from defects in material and manufacture.\" (Limited Warranty \u00a7 1.) With regard to freeze-thaw resistance in exterior fiber-cement products, ASTM C1186 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The specimens, when tested in accordance with Test Method C1185 [ ], for 50 [freeze-thaw] cycles, shall not show visible cracks or structural alteration such as to affect their performance in use. The ratio of retained strength as calculated\n   from the [flexural strength] test results shall be at least 80%.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ( [Docket No. 273] Allport Decl., Ex. 6, ASTM C1186 \u00a7 S.7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Limited Warranty also states that, when \"properly installed and maintained according to Hardie's published installation instructions, the Product for a period of 50 years from the date of purchase ... will not crack, rot or delaminate.\" (Limited Warranty \u00a7 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Limited Warranty extends to the first retail purchaser of the siding, the first owner of the structure to which the siding is applied, and the first transferee of the structure. (Limited Warranty \u00a7 1.) The Limited Warranty excludes coverage for performance of any third-party paints, stains, or coatings applied to Hardieplank. (Limited Warranty \u00a7 3.) The Limited Warranty also excludes from coverage damage or defects resulting from \"any cause other than manufacturing defects attributable to Hardie.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As for a remedy, the Limited Warranty provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   If during the Warranty period, any Product proves to be defective, Hardie, in its sole discretion, shall replace the defective Product before it is installed, or, during the first year, reimburse the covered person for resulting losses up to twice the retail cost of the defective portion of the Product. During the 2nd through the 50th year, the warranty payment shall be reduced by 2% each year such that after the 50th year no warranty shall be applicable. If the original retail cost cannot be established by the covered person, the cost shall be determined by Hardie in its sole and reasonable discretion. Hardie's replacement of the defective Product or granting of a refund pursuant to Section 1 of this Warranty SHALL BE THE SOLE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY available to the covered person with respect to any defect. Hardie will not refund or pay any costs in connection with labor or accessory materials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Limited Warranty \u00a7 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Alleged Defects in Hardieplank Siding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Hardieplank is manufactured using the Hatschek process, in which a roller applies multiple fiber-cement layers or \"laminas.\" (Exponent Report at 7-8.) When the laminas in the substrate separate, the board \"delaminates.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that Hardieplank has a common design defect of low interlaminar bond (\"ILB\") strength, which makes it easier for moisture to invade the substrate and push the laminas apart, causing delamination and coating adhesion problems. They further claim that Hardieplank has design defects causing gapping, warping, cracking, and fading or discoloration. They assert that Hardieplank fails prematurely before its expected life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Warranty Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   From 2001 through 2015, Hardie sold billions of square feet of Hardieplank in the United States and received warranty claims on a very small percentage of the siding sold. ( [Docket No. 273] Allport Decl., Ex. 8, Sealed Priest Report at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs' experts opined that, based on warranty claims, delamination was the primary cause of Hardieplank failure and that such failures occurred more often in cold, wet conditions. (Exponent Report at 48, 57; Moriarity Decl., Ex. 13, Steffey Dep. 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Hardie's Advertising\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 2000, Hardie was reaching 32 million consumers through its advertising. (Moriarity Decl., Ex. 23, 2000 HardiAdvantage Alliance Training Manual at 649.) In 2000 and 2002, Hardie advertised in several major home-living magazines, in newspapers,\n   on the radio, and on television; it also conducted one-on-one presentations with marketing and management teams for dealers and builders throughout the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Moriarity Decl., Ex. 24, 2002 Sweet's Catalog Hardie Advertisement at 95.) Hardie's marketing strategy used intermediaries to transmit its representations about Hardieplank to consumers through cooperative marketing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moriarity Decl., Ex. 27, 2004 Hardie Factory Build Housing Handbook at 790-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A 1997 Hardie advertisement stated that Hardieplank is \"low maintenance,\" \"resists moisture damage,\" \"won't crack, rot or delaminate,\" and \"offer[s] a lifetime of low maintenance backed by a 50-year product warranty\" (Moriarity Decl., Ex. 28, 1997 Hardiplank Hardipanel Brochure at 514-15.) In 2000-2004, it advertised that Hardieplank was \"backed with a 50-year limited transferable warranty\" and asserted that Hardieplank is \"low maintenance,\" \"resists moisture damage,\" \"won't crack, rot or delaminate,\" or other similar statements. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Moriarity Decl., Ex. 29, 2000 Hardie Siding Brochure; Moriarity Decl., Ex. 30, 2001 Hardie Advertisement; Moriarity Decl., Ex. 31, 2001 Hardie Brochure; Moriarity Decl., Ex. 32, 2002 Hardie Brochure; Moriarity Decl., Ex. 34, 2003 Sweets Catalog Hardie Advertisement; Moriarity Decl., Ex. 35, 2004 Sweets Catalog Hardie Advertisement.) A 2008 brochure stated: \"James Hardie siding is tough. Remarkably so. And to prove it, most of our products come with a 50-year transferable warranty. Rain. Hail. Impact. Wind. Fire. Fluctuations in humidity. Even hurricanes. None of its stands a chance against James Hardie.\" (Moriarity Decl., Ex. 39, 2008 Hardie \"A Siding for All Seasons\" at 549.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs point to a 1993 article from the Journal of Consumer Research, in which the authors note the theory that manufacturers might use the warranty as a \"signal\" of the durability of their goods, and attempt to test whether consumers do view the length of a warranty as a signal of durability. (Moriarity Decl., Ex. 43, William Boulding and Amna Kirmani,\n   <em>\n    A Consumer-Side Experimental Examination of Signaling Theory: Do Consumers Perceive Warranties as Signals of Quality?\n   </em>\n   , 20 J. Consumer Research 111 (1993).) The study's authors opined that their laboratory experiment showed that, if a firm has high credibility, consumers are more likely to see a long warranty as a signal of quality, but that this is not true for a low credibility firm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119.) They further explained that their research was limited to one laboratory experiment with one fictional company that made personal computers, so generalizations could not be made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   119-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In March 2011, Plaintiff Heidi Picht sued Hardie in Minnesota state court and the matter was removed to this Court. Hardie moved for summary judgment and to dismiss. (Civil File No. 11-958 [Docket No. 25] ) The motion was stayed until the remainder of the MDL cases were also at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After their individual cases were consolidated in this Court as a Multidistrict Litigation, eleven Plaintiffs from eight states filed a Consolidated Complaint. [MDL Docket No. 33] On July 15, 2013, this Court denied in part and granted in part Defendant's motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint. [MDL Docket No. 60] On August 9, 2013, Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Consolidated Complaint (\"ACC\"), which names the following as named Plaintiffs: Heidi Picht (Minnesota), Jonathan Bowers (Minnesota), Hugh Fenwick (Nevada), Michael Swiencki (Georgia), the Susan S. Buchanan Personal Residence Trust through its trustee Susan\n   Buchanan (Florida), James Dillingham (California), John Brown (Illinois), Mark Kostos (Illinois), Richard Treece (Illinois), Masoud Kavianpour (Virginia), and Brian Bethel (Ohio). [MDL Docket No. 63]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On June 30, 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendant's motion to dismiss the Complaint in a tag-along action filed by Wisconsin Plaintiff Steven Schindler. [MDL Docket No. 116] Schindler has since left the litigation and has been replaced with Wisconsin Plaintiffs David and Sharon Angelici (Civil File No. 14-285 [Docket Nos. 33-1, 36].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On April 27, 2015, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendant's motion to dismiss the Complaint in a tag-along action (Civil File No. 14-4655) filed by Colorado Plaintiff John Hernandez. [MDL Docket No. 135]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Based on the ACC, the Angelicis' Complaint, and Hernandez's Complaint, remaining before the Court are 1) breach of express warranties by all Plaintiffs except Illinois Plaintiffs Treece and Kostos, 2) breach of implied warranties by Minnesota Plaintiff Picht and Colorado Plaintiff Hernandez; 3) a negligence claim by Picht; 4) declaratory and injunctive relief claims for all Plaintiffs; 5) statutory consumer protection claims by all Plaintiffs; 5) an unjust enrichment claim by Wisconsin Plaintiffs the Angelicis; and 6) a failure of essential purpose claim by Hernandez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if, viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

(SWIENCKI: GEORGIA) DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [DOCKET NO. 306]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts Related to Plaintiff Michael Swiencki\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On September 24, 2008, Plaintiff Michael Swiencki purchased his house in a new housing development in Douglasville, Georgia. ( [Docket No. 383] Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 1, Swiencki Dep. 16.) At the time of Swiencki's purchase, the house already had Hardieplank siding, which had been installed during the original construction earlier in 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   16-20.) He purchased the house from Homestead Bank, which had foreclosed on the housing development after the developer went out of business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   16, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Swiencki did not know that Hardieplank was on the house when he purchased the house; he did not know what manufacturer's siding was on the house. ( [Docket No. 310] Frakes Decl., Ex. A, Swiencki Dep. 25.) Swiencki has \"no idea\" from where the siding was purchased or what entity purchased the siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   20.) He had never seen or heard anything about Hardie siding from any source before he purchased his house in 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   26, 28-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Before Swiencki purchased the house, he received a brochure created by RE/MAX, the real estate agent, which stated that the housing development houses had\n   \"[c]oncrete siding with life time warranty.\" (Frakes Decl., Ex. B.) The brochure also stated: \"All information herein believed to be accurate but not warranted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Swiencki admitted that the brochure did not mention Hardie or Hardieplank. (Swiencki Dep. 25-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In April 2011, Swiencki noted that the Hardieplank siding was gapping, bending, shrinking, and warping. (Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 2, Swiencki's Answers to Defendants' First Set of Interrogatories at 7; Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 3, Swiencki's Amended Answers to Defendants' First Set of Interrogatories, at 4.) He further asserts that the siding has, at some point, exhibited flaking, cracking, and delamination. (Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 2, Swiencki's Answers to Defendants' First Set of Interrogatories at 11; Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 3, Swiencki's Amended Answers to Defendants' First Set of Interrogatories, at 4.) The conditions worsened over time, and Swiencki has noticed that the other homes in his subdivision with Hardieplank have suffered the same deterioration. (Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 1, Swiencki Dep. 53, 62-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On November 3, 2011, Swiencki submitted a warranty claim to Hardie asserting that he had noticed warping and gapping. (Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 4, Warranty Claim.) On November 8, Hardie emailed Swiencki and denied his claim, stating that it \"found nothing to indicate that the siding is defective or resultant of any observed manufacture related failure.\" (Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 5.) \"[A]s a good will gesture,\" Hardie offered Swiencki \"replacement product that [he] may wish to use when making repairs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During a telephone call with Hardie on November 7, a Hardie representative told Swiencki that the photographs he sent showed that the issues were a result of something behind the siding and were related to how it was installed. (Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 1, Swiencki Dep. 76.) Hardie did not inspect his home before deciding the claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Swiencki did not accept the offer of replacement product because he thought that the replacement product would perform the same as the original siding. (Swiencki Dep. 71-72.) He received an estimate from a roofing and construction company that it would cost $9,000 to remove and replace his Hardieplank siding. (Second Polakoff Decl., Ex. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On February 17, 2012, Swiencki filed suit against Hardie in the Central District of California. (Civil File No. 12-1392 [Docket No. 1].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The use of the word \"manufacture\" makes it clearer that the warranty covers only manufacturing defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court notes that Hardie's Limited Warranty also states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   When used for its intended purpose, properly installed and maintained according to Hardie's published installation instructions, the Product for a period of 50 years from the date of purchase ... (c) will not crack, rot or delaminate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   (Limited Warranty \u00a7 1.) However, any potential ambiguity as to whether cracking, rotting, or delamination caused by a design defect is covered by the Limited Warranty is explicitly addressed in the exclusions. The Limited Warranty Exclusions section, Section 3, excludes from coverage damages or defects resulting from \"any cause other than manufacturing defects attributable to Hardie.\" Thus, the Limited Warranty clearly disclaims coverage for cracking, rotting, or delamination if it is caused by something other than a manufacturing defect, such as by a design defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Swiencki points out that Hardie's warranty provides that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   warrants (for installation in the U.S. and Puerto Rico) ... that when manufactured, the Hardie Fiber-Cement Plank or Panel Product HARDIPLANK or HARDIPANEL, (the \"Product\") complies with ASTM C1186, and is free from defects in material and manufacture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (Limited Warranty \u00a7 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   ASTM C1186 is the industry standard that supplies the requirements for the strength and composition of fiber-cement siding. Swiencki reasons that these compositional requirements necessarily implicate the design of the siding. Thus, Hardie cannot suggest that \"material and manufacture\" excludes design defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The fact that the warranty stated that the siding complied with an industry performance standard, ASTM C1186, has no bearing on Plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs do not claim that the siding fails to comply\n   with ASTM C1186. Plaintiffs' own expert admitted that he had \"no reason to dispute that [the siding] complies with C1186.\" ( [Docket No. 390] Second Frakes Dillingham Decl., Ex. G, Wolf Dep. 318-19.) The statement that the siding will be \"free from defects in material and manufacture\" simply means that Hardie also warrants against defects in materials and manufacturing defects. There is no inconsistency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In sum, the Limited Warranty does not cover design defects, and Swiencki only alleges a design defect.

Facts Related to Plaintiff Masoud Kavianpour\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In March 2005, Plaintiff and Virginia resident Masoud Kavianpour bought a townhouse in Leesburg, Virginia, from home developer Arcadia-Potomac Crossing, L.C., (\"Arcadia\") as an investment property. ( [Docket No. 315] Frakes Kavianpour Decl., Ex. A, Kavianpour Dep. 24-26, 35; Frakes Decl., Ex. B, Kavianpour Answer to Interrogatory No. 2.) Kavianpour owns approximately 15 rental properties and manages an additional 25 properties. (Kavianpour Dep. 26.) The house at issue was built by Arcadia. (Kavianpour Answer to Interrogatory No. 2.) Arcadia purchased Hardieplank siding for the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Arcadia had the Hardieplank installed in February or March 2005 by Best Siding Corp. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Kavianpour Dep. 37-38.) Kavianpour did not choose the Hardieplank; rather, Arcadia required that it would install Hardieplank on all of the houses in this development and Kavianpour could not choose a different siding product. (Kavianpour Dep. 39.) Kavianpour does not know from whom Arcadia purchased the siding or how much it paid for the siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   44, 56.) He understood that Arcadia was not employed by Hardie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Before the purchase, Arcadia sales manager Holly Horne Poole told Kavianpour that Hardieplank was \"top-of-the-line,\" required little maintenance, did not require painting, and was covered by a lifetime warranty. ( [Docket No. 381] Wanta Decl., Ex. 1, Kavianpour Dep. 40, 46, 65.) He understood a warranty to mean that, if Hardieplank failed, Hardie \"would take any corrective action to either replace those product or whatever is required to fix them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Horne Poole obtained information about Hardieplank from a sample board she received from Arcadia. She showed the board to all interested homebuyers. (Wanta Decl., Ex. 2, Horne Poole Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-8.) Horne Poole claims that she showed Kavianpour the Hardie sample board and that he relied on that information. (Horne Poole Decl. \u00b6 9.) Kavianpour has now submitted\n   a declaration in which he states that, when deciding whether to buy the townhome, he relied on Horne Poole's statements that Hardieplank was \"a top-of-the-line product,\" \"the best product available at the time,\" \"would require little maintenance and no painting,\" and \"came with a 50-year warranty.\" (Wanta Decl., Ex. 3, Kavianpour Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 10; Horne Poole Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Kavianpour never interacted with anyone from Hardie before he bought the house. (Frakes Kavianpour Decl., Ex. A, Kavianpour Dep. 32.) He has never received or reviewed any Hardie marketing material and never received any information from Hardie before he bought the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   49-50, 54; Frakes Decl., Ex. B, Answer to Interrogatory Nos. 1, 10.) He only interacted with Arcadia. (Kavianpour Dep. 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Based on statements by Arcadia, Kavianpour believed that Hardieplank had a lifetime warranty. (Frakes Kavianpour Decl., Ex. A, Kavianpour Dep. 45-46, 61; Frakes Decl., Ex. B, Kavianpour Answer to Interrogatory No. 1.) Hardie avers that it has never offered a lifetime warranty on any of its siding products. ( [Docket No. 314] Klein Decl. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In June or July 2006, Kavianpour noticed a \"spotting\" problem on the house: there were about 6 spots on the front and 6 spots on the back for a \"[t]otal of about 12 pieces between the front and the back of the house.\" (Kavianpour Dep. 66-68, 70.) He believed that there was a problem with the siding, but he \"did not do anything at that time\" about the problem because he \"just wanted to be sure that this is an ongoing issue or this is just an initial issue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   68, 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In 2009, Kavianpour contacted Arcadia with concerns about his siding, and Arcadia referred him to the company that installed the Hardieplank, Best Siding, and told him to ask if Best Siding had \"used some kind of wrong touch-up on the areas where they install the siding.\" (Wanta Decl., Ex. 1, Kavianpour Dep. 68, 75, 82.) Kavianpour asked Best Siding if it had \"used any kind of touch-up [paint] for installation of this siding[ ],\" and Best Siding stated that it had not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   82-83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   On April 15, 2010, Kavianpour submitted a warranty claim to Hardie, stating that his only concern was spotting on the siding. (Frakes Kavianpour Decl., Ex. A, Kavianpour Dep. 89; Wanta Decl., Ex. 4.) He \"had several conversations with [Hardie] that [Hardie] wanted to send one of their own painter, someone over there to examine and test before they send me the rejection.\" (Wanta Decl., Ex. 1, Kavianpour Dep. 90.) He does not know if someone from Hardie did inspect his house or not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On June 8, 2010, Hardie denied Kavianpour's claim, finding that the problems were \" 'installation' related\" and that there had been improper application of touch-up paint.

This issue is due to improper touchup.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on this information, Hardie told Kavianpour that the \"spotting\" issue was not due to the Hardie finish, but due to the builder's application of touch-up paint, and told him that he would be getting a letter about this. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On August 28, 2012, Kavianpour filed this lawsuit against Hardie in the Eastern District of Virginia.

Code \u00a7 59.1-200(A)(5) ; and Count 11: Violation of the VCPA, Va. Code \u00a7 59.1-200(A)(6).

Under the Virginia UCC, an express warranty is created by an affirmation of fact or promise \"made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.2-313\">\n    Va.

If the buyer was never exposed to the alleged affirmation, the affirmation cannot be part of the basis of the bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Kavianpour testified that, before he bought the townhouse, he never received or reviewed any Hardie marketing materials. In fact, Kavianpour did not even have an option of deciding what type of siding would be on the house. According to Kavianpour's testimony and interrogatory answers, his builder told him that the siding had a lifetime warranty, not a 50-year warranty. Further, he testified that he did not remember anyone telling him, before he bought the house, that the siding had a 50-year warranty. (Frakes Decl., Ex. A, Kavianpour Dep. 45-46, 61.)

As a practical matter, accepting signal theory would eviscerate warranties by requiring that if a manufacturer provided any type of limited warranty, it would become a guarantor for its product for that length of time, regardless of the terms and limitations of the written warranty. Moreover, the law review article cited by Plaintiffs actually rejects signal theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   George L.

Virginia law imposes a four-year statute of limitations for breach of express warranty claims. Va. Code \u00a7 8.2-725(1). A cause of action accrues \"when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party's lack of knowledge of the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Yale%20L.J.%201297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (2).

With regard to the future performance exception, \"courts have vigorously enforced the U.C.C.'s statutory explicitness requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Marvin Lumber &amp; Cedar Co. v.

In Kavianpour's interrogatory answers, he names three express warranties as the basis for Count 1: 1) Hardie's representation that the siding was covered by a 50-year warranty; 2) Arcadia's statement that Hardieplank had a 50-year warranty; and 3) Arcadia's statement that Hardieplank \"would require little maintenance and not require\n   painting.\" (Frakes Kavianpour Decl., Ex. C, Kavianpour Answer to Interrogatory No. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Hardie's representation that the siding came with a 50-year transferrable warranty does not constitute a warranty of future performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hardieplank Fiber Cement Siding Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-MD-2359,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202987657\">\n    2014 WL 2987657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D.

There is no evidence that\n   <em>\n    Hardie\n   </em>\n   made such a statement to Kavianpour. Rather, the evidence shows that Hardie made no statements to Kavianpour. Furthermore, \"little maintenance\" is not an explicit warranty of future performance. \"The overwhelming weight of authority requires a buyer ... to prove that its seller specifically warranted the product for a defined period of time in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Econ.

Finally, there can be no estoppel claim because Kavianpour's first contact with Hardie was in April 2010, when he submitted a warranty claim.

Kavianpour admitted that he noticed spots appearing on the Hardieplank in approximately June or July 2006. Furthermore, he testified that, in June or July 2006, he knew that there was a problem with the siding. Virginia law is clear that the express warranty claim accrues when the first injury occurs, no matter how slight and whether or not the damages continue to worsen. Thus, the statute of limitations expired four years later in 2010, but he did not file suit until 2012. Furthermore, the Court notes that for the reasons explained with respect to Plaintiff Swiencki, the Limited Warranty does not provide coverage for design defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Count 5: Violations of the California UCL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Court grants Hardie's motion for summary judgment on the UCL claim because the UCL has no applicability here. Kavianpour is a Virginia resident, injured in Virginia by a product installed in Virginia. He received no representations from Hardie at all, let alone any emanating from California. Thus, there is no basis to apply California law to his claims. Moreover, to the extent Kavianpour bases Count 5 on a claim that his warranty claim was mishandled, Kavianpour did not identify his own claim as a claim that had been mishandled in response to interrogatories. (Frakes Kavianpour Decl., Exs. B-C, Kavianpour Answer to Interrogatory No. 16.) And because Kavianpour is asserting a design defect, which is not covered by Hardie's Limited Warranty, the fact that Hardie denied his warranty claim is insufficient to sustain a UCL claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Counts 10 and 11: Violations of the VCPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Kavianpour's VCPA claims fail because Hardie's sale of siding was not a consumer transaction, as Plaintiffs concede. The VCPA only applies to \"fraudulent acts or practices\" committed \"in connection with a consumer transaction.\" Va. Code \u00a7 59.1-200(A). \"Virginia courts have interpreted this definition to exclude transactions in which goods are first sold to an intermediary-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a contractor or subcontractor-and used as components in larger construction projects.

The VCPA does not apply. Moreover, Kavianpour did not buy the house \"primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\" Va. Code. \u00a7 59.1-198 (defining \"consumer transaction\"). Rather, he bought it as an investment and lives in a different house.

Roger Buchanan understood Berry to be \"referring to the frequency with which it would need to be repainted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   25.) Because the siding has not needed to be repainted since it was installed, Roger Buchanan testified that the siding has required little to no maintenance as he understood the builder's statement.

C, Buchanan Trust Answer to Interrogatory No. 5; S. Buchanan Dep. 30-32; R. Buchanan Dep. 25-26, 37-42.) Roger Buchanan contacted Berry, because he thought that something was wrong with the siding, and Berry attempted to fix the problem by nailing the boards back flush. (R. Buchanan Dep. 25-26, 38-39.) Berry nailed three or four boards and did not say anything about the siding at\n   that time. (Second Peterson Decl., Ex. 1, R.

Formal Express Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Court grants summary judgment on the formal express warranty claim. As explained with respect to Plaintiff Swiencki, the Limited Warranty does not provide coverage for the design defect of warping alleged by Plaintiff. Additionally, the Buchanan Trust sued Hardie one week after submitting its warranty claim, so Hardie did not have the opportunity to consider the warranty claim. Plaintiff has no evidence that Hardie did not or would not have honored the warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Count 5: Violations of the California UCL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Court grants summary judgment on the UCL claim because the UCL does not apply. Plaintiff is a Florida resident who was injured in Florida and had no exposure to Hardie's marketing or representations before purchasing the siding, so Plaintiff cannot show that the challenged conduct emanated from California. Furthermore, because the Buchanans did not see or rely on any marketing materials from Hardie before buying and installing the siding, they cannot show reliance. No unfair practices claim exists because Plaintiff filed suit one week after submitting the warranty claim to Hardie, so there is no evidence of how Hardie would have handled the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

Furthermore, statements by an independent third party, such as Berry, cannot serve as the basis for a FDUTPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   To the extent that Plaintiff's FDUPTPA claim is based on an allegation of unfair practices in handling its warranty claim, the Court also grants summary judgment to Hardie. First, the Buchanans submitted a warranty claim to Hardie only one week before filing this lawsuit. Hardie did not have the opportunity to process the warranty claim, and the claim was never rejected. The Buchanans provide no basis to\n   argue that their warranty claim was unfairly handled. Second, in response to its interrogatory asking the Buchanan Trust to \"identify by homeowner name each of the warranty claims that you allege were improperly handled\" by Hardie, the Buchanan Trust did not identify its own claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Frakes Buchanan Trust Decl., Ex. C, Interrogatory No. 16.) Because it did not identify its own claim as being mishandled, it cannot now assert a claim based on the purportedly unfair handling of its claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Count 4: Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Because the Court grants summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's substantive claims, the request for declaratory and injunctive relief in Count 4 necessarily fails. Additionally, because the Buchanan Trust no longer owns the property in question and has now been terminated, the Trust does not face a real or immediate threat of future injury.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Breakstone v.

Facts Related to Plaintiff James Dillingham\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In 2003, Charles Stanley purchased Hardieplank siding from Meek's Lumber and had it installed on a house located in South Lake Tahoe, California. ( [Docket No. 323] Frakes Dillingham Decl., Ex. A, Dillingham Dep. 39-42, 65; Frakes Dillingham Decl., Ex. C.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In October 2011, Plaintiff James Dillingham, along with his wife and mother-in-law, purchased the house from Stanley as a vacation home, 8 years after the siding had been installed. (Dillingham Dep. 35-36.) Dillingham is a licensed professional engineer and construction contractor who has personally installed exterior siding products, including fiber-cement siding. (Dillingham Dep. 17-21, 30-31.) Before Dillingham purchased the South Lake Tahoe house, he personally observed the \"spalling\" or delamination of the siding and he thought, at the time, that there was a problem with the siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   43-44.) He observed that \"[c]hunks of siding with the paint and underlayment [were] coming off\" \"[a]ll over the house.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   44.) Also, before the sale, Stanley \"fully disclosed\" to Dillingham the problems with the siding, told him that it was \"just going to keep getting worse,\" and Stanley informed him that he had previously submitted a warranty claim to Hardie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   44-47.) Stanley told Dillingham that he thought the siding could not function \"in a freeze/thaw environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   47.) Stanley said that he had reported the problem to Hardie, and Hardie had attributed the problem to the \"coating manufacturer.\" ( [Docket No. 375] Moreland Dillingham Decl., Ex. 1, Dillingham Dep. 51-52; Moreland Dillingham Decl., Ex. 3, Dillingham Answer to Interrogatory No. 7 at p. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   At that time, Stanley also showed Dillingham a 50-year transferrable warranty for the Hardieplank. (Moreland Decl., Ex. 1, Dillingham Dep. 45.) Dillingham thought that the Hardieplank would outlast its warranty and that, if there were any problems, Hardie would take care of it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   47-48, 127-28.) Dillingham voluntarily chose to buy the house despite knowing of the siding issues. (Frakes Dillingham Decl., Ex. A, Dillingham Dep. 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Within the first month after Dillingham bought the home, he called Hardie about the siding. (Moreland Dillingham Decl., Ex. 1, Dillingham Dep. 80.) The Hardie representative subjected him to \"the most abrasive conversation I have had in such a short amount of time.\" (Dillingham Dep. 80-81.) Dillingham told the representative where the house was and the problems he had with the siding, and the representative, \"in a very aggressive manner,\" cited multiple warranty exclusions and said that the siding must have been installed incorrectly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   81.) Dillingham testified that the employee \"was so abrasive right off the start he didn't even want the street address. He wanted me off the phone is what he wanted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   81-82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Dillingham testified that he could not recall reviewing any particular advertisement or marketing material from Hardie before purchasing the house. (Frakes Dillingham Decl., Ex. A, Dillingham Dep. 58-59.) He \"[m]ost likely\" had reviewed Hardie product literature and viewed its web site, but he cannot recall any particular statements, other than installation instructions for Artisan siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   59-62.) He did not see any television commercials or hear any radio advertisements about Hardie siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   63.) He could not recall seeing any of the statements from any of the advertisements described in the ACC. (Frakes Dillingham Decl., Ex. B, Dillingham Supp. Answer to Interrogatory No. 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   In 2009 or 2010, a Hardie sales representative cold called Dillingham to solicit him to sell and install Hardie siding, and the two spoke for about 30 minutes. (Frakes Dillingham Decl., Ex. A, Dillingham Dep. 56-57.) During the discussion, the Hardie representative gave Dillingham brochures and materials for Hardieplank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   58.) Dillingham does not remember anything about the product literature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This discussion had no impact on Dillingham's decision in 2011 to buy his house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   57-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   In 2010, Dillingham visited Hardie's website because he was personally installing a different Hardie fiber cement siding product, Artisan, on a different structure that he owns in Placerville, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   32-33, 60-62.) He only looked at installation instructions and photographs of installation of Artisan siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   60-62.) Dillingham has had no problems with his Artisan siding and is not making any claim against Hardie concerning that siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   32-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   On March 16, 2012, Dillingham filed suit against Hardie in the Eastern District of California.

Moreover, there was no privity between the Stanley and Hardie because Stanley purchased the siding from Meek's, not from Hardie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Additionally, Dillingham cannot show reliance. He cannot recall any particular advertisement, brochure, or marketing material that he reviewed before buying the house in 2011. Dillingham testified that his contact with a Hardie sales representative did not have any impact on his decision in 2011 to buy the house. He admitted that the web pages he reviewed on Hardie's website had nothing to do with the siding on the house he purchased. Rather, he visited the website because he was installing a different Hardie siding product, Artisan, on a different structure that he owned. Dillingham has not experienced any problems with his Artisan siding and is not asserting any claim regarding that siding. Nor could he have reasonably relied on general product literature when he had specific knowledge of delamination issues with the Hardie siding on the house that he was purchasing. Stanley told Dillingham that he thought the siding could not function in a freeze-thaw environment. Stanley said that he had reported the problem to Hardie, and Hardie had attributed the problem to the coating manufacturer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The Court further notes that Dillingham's claim is barred by the statute of limitations.

Here, any breach of an informal express warranty accrued in 2003 upon delivery of the siding, unless the warranty fits within the future performance exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The Court concludes that the future performance exception does not apply. Dillingham claims that Hardie consistently represented that Hardieplank was covered by a 50-year warranty and that these representations were often commingled with other statements relating to future performance, such as that Hardieplank offered a \"lifetime\" of low maintenance. Hardie accurately represented that Hardieplank was covered by a 50-year warranty-Dillingham admits that he saw a copy of the Limited Warranty before he purchased his house. As previously explained with regard to Plaintiff Kavianpour, the Court holds that Hardie's statement in its advertising that its siding came with a 50-year warranty does not constitute a warranty of future performance. Additionally, \"[v]ague statements concerning product longevity do not comply with the requirement of a 'specific reference to a future time' that would create a warranty of future performance.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hardieplank Fiber Cement Siding Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-MD-2359,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202987657\">\n    2014 WL 2987657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D.

Ct. App. 2002) ). Finally, Dillingham points to no evidence that he received a representation that Hardie warranted a lifetime of low maintenance. Because the future performance exception does not apply, the statute of limitations expired in 2007, yet Dillingham did not file suit until 2012. Therefore, his informal express warranty\n   claim is barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Moreover, the statute of limitations bars this claim because Stanley noticed problems with the siding and made a warranty claim to Hardie regarding those problems by 2005.

First, Dillingham did not submit a warranty claim to Hardie. (Second Frakes Dillingham Decl., Ex. H, Dillingham\n   Dep. 83.) Thus, Hardie did not have the opportunity to handle his warranty claim. In fact, the former owner of the same house had submitted a warranty claim in 2005, and, in 2006, Hardie had made a goodwill payment of $9,500 in response. (Frakes Dillingham Decl., Exs. C-D.) Dillingham's claim is based on one short telephone call with an unnamed Hardie representative. Even if the call was abrasive, Dillingham was not prevented from submitting a warranty claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Second, Dillingham responded to Hardie's interrogatory requesting that he \"identify by homeowner name and each of the warranty claims that you allege were improperly handled\" by Hardie and did not identify his own warranty claim.

( [Docket No. 327] Frakes Fenwick Decl., Ex. B, Fenwick Answer to Interrogatory No. 2; Frakes Fenwick Decl., Ex. A, Fenwick Dep. 15-16, 21-22.) Northstar purchased Hardieplank siding for the house from Meek's Lumber and Hardware in Carson City, Nevada, and installed it on the house in September 2006. (Fenwick Dep. 19-21; Fenwick Answer to Interrogatory No. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Before the Hardieplank was installed, Fenwick never spoke with anyone employed by Hardie; did not review a brochure or advertisement about Hardie siding; did not visit Hardie's web site; and had not seen or heard television or radio advertisements about Hardie siding. (Fenwick Dep. 25-28.) He did not \"review any documents or information prior to the purchase of the siding,\" and had never heard of Hardie lap siding before going to Meek's in 2006. (Fenwick Answer to Interrogatory No. 1; Fenwick Dep. 27, 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   During Fenwick's deposition, he testified that he went to Meek's in 2005 or 2006 and spoke with a manager about Hardie siding. (Fenwick Dep. 25-26, 28-30.) The lumberyard manager \"mentioned a warranty, and I remember thinking that's longer than I will be alive for. So that makes us happy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   28-30.) Fenwick also saw a wood display board that had lap siding samples on it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   29-30.) The siding pieces mostly filled the board and there was no room for any writing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   30-31.) Aside from the word \"Hardie,\" Fenwick did not remember any words on the wood board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   In an answer to an interrogatory, Fenwick stated that he saw that Hardie provided a 50-year warranty for the siding \"on the wrapper that the James Hardie Siding he purchased came in, on a point-of-sale display at Meeks Construction [ ], and repeated to him [by] the manager of Meeks Construction.\" (Frakes Fenwick Decl., Ex. B, Fenwick Amended Answer to Interrogatory No. 11.) However, during his deposition, Fenwick testified that, after the Hardieplank was delivered to his new house, he walked by and saw the wrapper sitting there. (Fenwick Dep. 87-89.) When asked if, when he completed that interrogatory answer, he recalled any words on the wrapper, he testified: \"God, no.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   In a September 2016 declaration completed after his December 2014 deposition,\n   Fenwick claims that he purchased Hardieplank siding from Meek's lumberyard in August 2006. ( [Docket No. 377] McShane Decl., Ex. 1, Fenwick Decl. \u00b6 3.) He further claims that, before he bought the siding, he saw an in-store display that stated that Hardieplank was pre-stained and would never require painting. (Fenwick Decl. \u00b6 4.) A Meek's employee told Fenwick that Hardieplank was covered by a 50-year warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fenwick chose the Hardieplank and believed that the warranty would continue \"longer than I will be alive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; McShane Decl., Ex. 2, Fenwick Dep. 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   In October 2007, Fenwick noticed that the siding was starting to peel, crack, flake, and delaminate. (Frakes Fenwick Decl., Ex. A, Fenwick Dep. 35; Fenwick Decl. \u00b6 5.) He contacted Meek's about the issues, and Meek's told him to contact Hardie. (Fenwick Decl. \u00b6 6.) Before November 2007, Fenwick also contacted Northstar about the \"problem\" he saw and told Northstar: \"There is something wrong with the siding, can you come and have a look.\" (Frakes Fenwick Decl., Ex. A, Fenwick Dep. 80-81.) In November and December 2007, Northstar made some repairs by repainting portions of the siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   On August 1, 2008, Fenwick submitted a warranty claim to Hardie asserting the following issue: \"siding cracking &amp; peeling many locations.\" (McShane Decl., Ex. 4.) On August 29, 2008, Hardie denied his claim on the grounds that, based on the photographs submitted, the claim was not covered because the warranty did not cover third-party coatings and only the paint had failed. (McShane Decl., Ex. 5.) Fenwick asserts that, since 2008, boards that originally showed no flaws have started to peel, crack, flake, blister, and delaminate. (Fenwick Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   On February 6, 2012, Fenwick filed a lawsuit against Hardie in the Central District of California.

Furthermore, the Hardieplank was purchased in Nevada and Fenwick has never lived in California. (Fenwick Dep. 147.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Summary of the Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Fenwick asserts three claims against Hardie: Count 1: Breach of Express Warranty; Count 4: Declaratory and Injunctive Relief; and Count 5: California UCL. Hardie moves for summary judgment on all three claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In his deposition, Fenwick admits that he was never exposed to any marketing materials from Hardie and did not review any documents or information before buying the siding. The Nevada UCC provides that an affirmation of fact or promise \"made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20104.2313\">\n    Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 104.2313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a). Here, no affirmation was made by Hardie to Fenwick. An oral statement by an employee of Meek's lumberyard cannot be imputed to Hardie as an express warranty because Fenwick fails to point to evidence to support an agency relationship between Hardie and Meek's. Moreover, in response to an interrogatory asking Fenwick to identify Hardie's agents and their statements, Fenwick did not identify Meek's or its employee. (Frakes Fenwick Decl., Ex. B, Fenwick Answer to Interrogatory No. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Fenwick's recent declaration claiming that he saw a Hardie point-of-sale display at Meeks that represented that the siding would come pre-stained and would never require painting directly contradicts his interrogatory answer swearing that he did not review any documents or information before purchasing the siding and his deposition testimony that the wood point-of-sale display board that he saw had no room for any writing and that he did not remember any words on the wood board aside from, perhaps, the word \"Hardie.\" A plaintiff cannot create a genuine issue of material fact by contradicting his own prior sworn interrogatory answers and deposition testimony without explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Finally, as the Court has previously explained, there is no evidence that Hardie breached a promise to provide a 50-year warranty with the siding-it is true that the siding did come with a 50-year warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Additionally, Fenwick's claim of breach of the informal express warranty is untimely. The statute of limitations for breach of warranty is four years.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20104.2725\">\n    Nev.

Fenwick's informal warranty claim is based on the alleged promise that Hardieplank was \"covered by\" a 50-year warranty. This is a promise about the present-whether the siding came with a 50-year warranty when sold-not about the future. For the reasons previously explained, the future performance exception does not apply to this representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Equitable tolling does not apply to save Fenwick's claim. Nevada allows equitable tolling to stop the running of the limitations period when the only bar to a timely filed claim is a procedural technicality, there is no danger of prejudice to the defendant, and the interest of justice require tolling.\n   <em>\n    State Dept. of Taxation v.

Fenwick does not dispute that this is when the claim accrued. However, he asserts the same equitable tolling argument that he made with respect to his informal express warranty claim. For the reasons previously explained, equitable tolling does not apply. Thus, the four-year statute of limitations bars the formal express warranty claim. Moreover, for the reasons explained with respect to Plaintiff Swiencki, the Limited Warranty does not cover Swiencki's design defect claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

However, in Fenwick's answer to Hardie's interrogatory asking him to identify each homeowner whose warranty claims were improperly handled by Hardie, Fenwick identified other individuals but did not identify himself. (Frakes Fenwick Decl., Ex. B, Fenwick Answer to Interrogatory No. 16 and Amended Answer to Interrogatory No. 16.)

Facts Related to John Brown\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   In 2004, Plaintiff John Brown browsed siding selections at Stock Building Supply for his soon-to-be-built house located in Winthrop Harbor, Illinois. ( [Docket No. 371] LaDuca Decl., Ex. 1, Brown Dep. 61-62; [Docket No. 332] Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. A, Brown Answer to Interrogatory No. 2.) At Stock Building Supply, Brown picked up and reviewed a brochure for Hardie siding. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. B, Brown Dep. 87-88, 96.) The brochure stated: \"To prove the quality of our products, James Hardie backs most of its lap and panel siding with a 50-year limited transferable product warranty.\" (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 2 at 23.) It also stated, among other things, that Hardie could provide \"a more substantial siding\"-\"[o]ne that provides durability and low-maintenance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Brown testified that the brochure described a \"limited warranty.\" (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. B, Brown Dep. 95.) He also testified that, in fact, the Hardieplank\n   he purchased is covered by a 50-year warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   At some point, Brown also spoke with Stock Building Supply salesman Ryan McMahon, who stated that Hardieplank was low maintenance and was covered by a 50-year warranty. (Brown Dep. 81-82.) Brown understood that McMahon was not a Hardie employee, and McMahon never told Brown that he was an agent of Hardie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   85-86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Eventually, Brown chose Hardieplank, and its low maintenance and 50-year warranty were driving factors in his decision. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 1, Brown Dep. 55-56, 82, 89-90.) On October 30, 2004, he purchased the Hardieplank from Stock Building Supply. (Brown Dep. 61-62.) When the Hardieplank was delivered to Brown's home, he received three limited warranties: one for Hardieplank, one for the ColorPlus finish on the siding, and one for the trim. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. B, Brown Dep. 103; Frakes Brown Decl., Exs. D, E. F.) These were the only warranties that Hardie gave to Brown in connection with the siding and trim and they are the only warranties that Brown claims Hardie breached. (Brown Dep. 105, 127.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Brown never spoke with anyone at Hardie before he purchased the siding for his house. (Brown Dep. 82, 118.) Nor did he visit the Hardie website, hear a radio advertisement regarding the siding, or see a television advertisement regarding the siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   118.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   In 2006 or 2007, Brown discovered fading problems with his siding. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. B, Brown Dep. 133-36.) By 2008, the fading eventually became so \"ridiculous\" and extreme that he discussed it with his wife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   133; LaDuca Decl., Ex. 1, Brown Dep. 132.) However, he did not raise any issues about the fading with anyone because he is \"a terrible procrastinator.\" (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 1, Brown Dep. 132.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   In 2011, Brown noticed that the Hardieplank was cracking and peeling. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 1, Brown Dep. 180.) He submitted a warranty claim to Hardie in December 2011, stating that \"most\" of the Hardieplank on his home was affected, but not specifying the problem on the warranty form. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 3.) In February 2012, Hardie offered Brown two proposals: $3,000 to repaint a portion of the Hardieplank and release his claim against Hardie and Hardie would remove and replace a 650 square foot portion of the Hardieplank on his home. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 1, Brown Dep. 194-97; LaDuca Decl., Ex. 4; LaDuca Decl., Ex. 5.) Brown rejected both offers. (Brown Dep. 198-99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   On September 11, 2012, Brown filed suit against Hardie in the Northern District of Illinois. (Civil File No. 12-2817)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Facts Related to Mark Kostos\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   In 2010, Plaintiff Mark Kostos purchased a house in Yorkville, Illinois. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 6, Kostos Dep. 23.) The house had been built in 2003. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. H, Kostos Inspection Report at 2.) At some point before Kostos purchased the house, Hardieplank had been installed on it, likely when the house was built. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. G, Kostos Dep. 28-29; LaDuca Decl., Ex. 6, Kostos Dep. 30.) Kostos believes that the siding was sold by Pierce Wholesale Roofing and Siding in Oswego, Illinois, but he does not know who paid for the siding. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. G, Kostos Dep. 109-10, 137.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Before Kostos purchased the house, he had a home inspector inspect the home on April 5, 2010; Kostos was present for the entire inspection. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. G, Kostos Dep. 36-37; Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. H, Kostos Inspection Report.) The inspection report stated that portions of the siding were damaged, eroded, and pulling out at the bottom, and that repairs\n   were needed. (Kostos Dep. 41-42, 54-56, 59-60; Inspection Report at 8, 14.) Kostos received the report on April 5, 2010, and reviewed it before closing on the purchase of the house. (Kostos Dep. 39.) The inspector orally told him that Hardieplank came with a 50-year warranty and would \"outlive\" Kostos. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 6, Kostos Dep. 34.) Despite knowing of the damage to the siding, Kostos voluntarily chose to purchase the house. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. G, Kostos Dep. 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Before Kostos purchased the house, he did not speak to anyone from Hardie, review any Hardie brochures, see any Hardie written advertisements, or visit Hardie's website. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. G, Kostos Dep. 66-67.) Kostos testified that he saw one or more television commercials about Hardie siding at some point between 1998 and 2004. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   67.) He recalls that the commercials talked about the durability of Hardie siding and gave examples of the different products that were available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   68-69.) He did not review or rely on anything else related to Hardie siding before he purchased the house in 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Kostos moved into the house in May 2010. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 6, Kostos Dep. 112.) The siding issues \"got progressively worse to the point that [he] just realized [he] needed to get some work done and get it fixed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   161.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   In the fall of 2011, Kostos went onto the Hardie web site and saw information about how to submit a warranty claim. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 6, Kostos Dep. 103-04.) He does not \"recall [anything] in particular\" that prompted him to try to get the warranty form off of the web site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   112.) He called Hardie, explained that he had Hardie siding on his house that had some problems that needed repair, and requested information on how to file a warranty claim for the siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   104-05.). On November 2, 2011, Hardie emailed Kostos a packet with the claim form and instructions on how to fill out a warranty claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   103-04.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Kostos never submitted the warranty claim to Hardie. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. O, Kostos Dep. 111-12.) He agrees that Hardie never had the chance to fulfill the terms of the warranty and that he does not know how Hardie would have responded if he had sent in the warranty claim information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   On March 16, 2012, Kostos filed suit against Hardie in the Northern District of Illinois. (Civil File No. 12-1497)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Facts Related to Richard Treece\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Plaintiff Richard Treece is co-trustee of the Treece Family Trust, which owns a commercial building located in West Frankfort, Illinois. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 7, Treece Dep. 18.) The building was built in the 1950s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   In 2004, Treece was considering new siding for the front of the building and visited a Lowe's hardware store in Mt. Vernon, Illinois, where he spoke with a Lowe's employee who told him that Hardieplank came with a 50-year warranty and a \"lifetime\" warranty. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. I, Treece Dep. 31, 35, 49-50.) Treece did not seek clarification about which warranty length was correct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   49-50.) Hardie has never offered any siding product with a lifetime warranty. ( [Docket No. 309] Klein Decl. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   While at Lowe's, Treece also viewed a Hardie brochure that \"showed the different styles and on the back it had the warranty information.\" (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. I, Treece Dep. 52.) He cannot recall the specific words on the brochure but remembers that it \"had a statement of the warranty on the back from what [he] remember[s].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   53.) The brochure was from a display with the Hardie logo on it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   51-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Treece testified that the Lowe's sales representative's statement that Hardieplank had a lifetime warranty was important to his purchasing decision. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. I, Treece Dep. 134.) He expected that Hardieplank would maintain its integrity and color for 50 years. (LaDuca Decl., Ex. 7, Treece Dep. 122-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Treece knew that Lowe's and Hardie were two separate entities and that Lowe's sales representatives are not Hardie employees, are not agents of every manufacturer whose products Lowe's sells, and are not speaking on behalf of every manufacturer of every product in the store. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. I, Treece Dep. 50-51, 141-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   Treece never spoke to anyone at Hardie before buying Hardieplank. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. I, Treece Dep. 67.) Other than the Lowe's employee's statement and the brochure at Lowe's, no other materials influenced Treece's decision to purchase Hardieplank in 2004. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   In 2004, Treece purchased and installed Hardieplank from Lowe's on the front of the building. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. I, Treece Dep. 31, 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   During the summer of 2006, Treece saw that the Hardieplank was fading and the boards were pulling apart from one another. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. I, Treece Dep. 76-77, 79-80.) At that time, he believed that there was a problem with the siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   78, 80-81.) He relayed his concerns about the siding fading to Lowe's several times that summer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   89-90.) Lowes gave him inaccurate information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   94.) (The parties appear to agree that Treece testified that Lowe's told Treece that because Hardieplank was installed on a commercial structure, all Hardieplank warranties were void.) Treece did not contact Hardie; nor has he ever submitted a warranty claim to Hardie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   94.) He had no interactions with Hardie before his filed this lawsuit in 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   On June 27, 2012, Treece filed suit against Hardie in the Southern District of Illinois.

He also points to the statements of the sales person at Stock Building Supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   As to the representation that the siding would come with a 50-year warranty, Brown testified that the statement in the brochure was true-he did receive a 50-year limited warranty on the siding. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. B, Brown Dep. 124.) Therefore, he cannot assert a breach of informal express warranty based on the promise of a 50-year warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   As for Brown's new allegation that Hardie represented Hardieplank as \"low maintenance\" in the brochure, this assertion is contrary to both his deposition testimony and his answers to interrogatories identifying the only applicable warranty as the promise of a 50-year warranty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Dep. 127; Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. M, Brown Amended Answer to Interrogatory No. 11 (identifying applicable warranty as warranty that the siding is covered by a 50-year warranty).) Even if the Court did consider Brown's new assertion that Hardie also breached its promise that the siding would provide durability and be low-maintenance, the Court concludes that this representation is inactionable puffery under Illinois law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   \" 'Puffing' denotes the exaggerations reasonably to be expected of a seller as to the degree of quality of his or her product, the truth or falsity of which cannot be precisely determined.\"\n   <em>\n    Avery v.

The only mentions of a time period are 1) the statement that \"Hardie has the ability to excite consumers with an exterior that retains its beauty for decades with very little care,\" and 2) the statement that the siding had a \"50-year limited transferable product warranty.\" (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. C.) The statement that the siding would \"retain its beauty for decades with very little care\" is too vague to constitute a future performance warranty.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cooper Power Sys., Inc. v.

As to the second statement, Brown admitted that, in fact, the siding did come with a 50-year warranty and that he understood that the siding only came with a \"limited\" product warranty. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. B, Brown Dep. 95, 124.) As the Court has previously explained, the future performance exception does not apply to a promise that a product comes with a warranty of a particular length. Generally, a statement that the siding was \"low maintenance\" does not constitute a warranty of future performance because it does not contain a specific reference to a future time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v.

For the reasons explained with respect to Plaintiff Kavianpour, the Court holds that Kostos cannot base a claim on signal theory-the theory that a promise that Hardieplank was covered by a 50-year warranty can reasonably be construed as a representation of Hardieplank's useful life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   The statement that the siding would \"outlive\" him was made by a home inspector that Kostos hired, not by Hardie or its agent. Hardie is not liable for statements made by unrelated third parties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2025\">\n    116 Cal.Rptr.2d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Kostos cannot show reasonable reliance on statements about durability that he heard in advertisements many years before he purchased the house, because when Kostos purchased the house he knew that the siding was already damaged, deteriorated, and eroded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   <strong>\n    c) Treece\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   Treece cannot point to a statement by Hardie on which he relied. Treece claims that he bought Hardieplank because he expected it to last for decades based on its 50-year warranty. (Treece Dep. 122-23.) For the reasons previously explained, the Court rejects signal theory. A statement that Hardieplank came with a 50-year warranty was true. Statements by a Lowe's sales representative that Hardieplank had a lifetime or 50-year warranty are not attributable to Hardie.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2025\">\n    116 Cal.Rptr.2d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Unfair Practices Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   The Court further holds that Hardie is entitled to summary judgment to the extent the Illinois Plaintiffs' claims are based on an unfair practices theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   Treece admits that he did not submit a warranty claim to Hardie, so he cannot pursue a claim that Hardie unfairly handled his warranty claim. Similarly, Kostos testified that he never actually submitted a warranty claim to Hardie. He further testified that, because he never submitted a warranty claim to Hardie, it never had a chance to fulfill the terms of the warranty. Hardie could not have unfairly handled a non-existent claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   Brown did pursue warranty relief from Hardie. Hardie offered to repaint the siding and/or replace a part of it. Brown found these offers inadequate and concludes Hardie effectively denied him relief under the warranty. However, in response to interrogatories asking Brown to \"identify\n   by homeowner name each of the warranty claims that you allege were improperly handled\" by Hardie, Brown identified certain persons but did not identify himself. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. M, Amended Answer to Interrogatory No. 16.) Thus, he is barred from now claiming that his claim was unfairly handled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   Moreover, Brown fails to point to evidence that Hardie's response to his warranty claim was anything more than a simple breach of warranty. Initially, the Court notes that the Limited Warranty does not provide coverage for design defects. Additionally, Hardie offered to have a contractor replace the affected siding and reimburse Brown $3,000. Brown declined Hardie's offer because he wanted them to replace all of the siding-something he admitted was not required by the warranty. (Frakes Brown Decl., Ex. R, Brown Dep. 206.) He has not offered any evidence as to how his warranty claim was mishandled. Even if Hardie's claim determination were wrong, it would have breached the contract but, without further evidence of wrongdoing, it could not have violated the UCL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sybersound Records, Inc. v.

Facts Related to Plaintiff Brian Bethel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Plaintiff Brian Bethel is an Ohio resident. In 2011, he purchased a house in Lebanon, Ohio, that had been built in \"approximately 2000 or 2001.\" ( [Docket No. 336] Frakes Bethel Decl., Ex. A, Bethel's Answer to Interrogatory No. 2; Frakes Bethel Decl., Ex. B, Bethel Dep. 18.) Hardieplank had been installed during the home's original construction in 2000 or 2001. (Bethel's Answer to Interrogatory No. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Before Bethel bought the home, he hired a home inspector to inspect the house on January 25, 2011. (Bethel Dep. 26; Frakes Bethel Decl., Ex. C, Inspection Report.) Before closing on the house, Bethel reviewed the inspection report and discussed the issues in the report with the inspector by telephone. (Bethel Dep. 26-28.) The inspection report stated that the Hardieplank was solid but that there was \"gapping observed at joints.\" (Bethel Dep. 33-34; Inspection Report at 12.) The inspector recommended \"sealing these areas to prevent possible water penetration and damage.\" (Bethel Dep. 34; Inspection Report at 12.) Bethel thought that the gapping was a \"relatively minor issue.\" (Bethel Dep. 34.) He chose to buy the house despite knowing of the gaps; however, as of November 2014, he had not yet sealed the gaps to prevent possible water penetration and damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   35, 38, 142-43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   Before Bethel bought the house, he reviewed Hardie's website \"relatively quickly\" and give it a \"quick once over.\" (Bethel Dep. 62-63.) Bethel remembers seeing statements during his review of the website regarding the 50-year warranty and other statements such as that \"it holds up to anything, it doesn't rot, doesn't burn,\n   bugs don't eat it, stands up to hot temperatures, cold temperatures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   62-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   Before Bethel bought the house, he never spoke with anyone employed by Hardie; did not review any brochure or advertisement about Hardieplank; and did not see or hear any Hardie radio or television advertisement. (Bethel Dep. 54-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   Bethel first noticed that the siding was shrinking in January 2011, that it was cracking in May or June 2012, and that it was loosening from its fasters, sagging, and warping in May or June 2012. (Frakes Bethel Decl., Ex. A, Bethel Answer to Interrogatory No. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   On July 5, 2012, Bethel submitted a warranty claim to Hardie. ( [Docket No. 367] First Peterson Decl., Ex. 2 at 184-85.) He reported that the siding was \"shrinking and or sagging\" and that \"[i]n other spots, the paint is peeling off and the plank is breaking apart.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   On September 10, 2012, Hardie offered to replace up to 1,000 square feet of the Hardieplank and to paint the remainder of the siding. (First Peterson Decl., Ex. 2 at 255.) Bethel rejected Hardie's proposal because he thought that it would not resolve the pervasive failures of his Hardieplank; and because he interpreted the offer to mean that Hardie \"would consider the claim closed and no other damages could be filed.\" (First Peterson Decl., Ex. 1, Bethel Dep. 181-84, 189-90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   On October 2, 2012, Bethel filed suit against Hardie in the Southern District of Ohio. (Civil File No. 12-2728)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Choice of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   Ohio applies the \"most significant relationship\" test and \"the law of the place of injury controls unless another jurisdiction has a more significant relationship to the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Pilgrim v.

The Court applies Ohio law because Bethel is an Ohio resident, his home and the Hardieplank are located in Ohio, and his injury occurred in Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Summary of the Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   Bethel asserts four counts against Hardie: Count 1: Breach of Express Warranty; Count 4: Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: Count 5: Violation of the California UCL; and Count 9: Violation of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. Hardie moves for summary judgment on all four counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

( [Docket No. 366] Bethel Opposition Brief at 15.) Bethel argues that these Hardie statements that he saw in 2011 on its website are substantially similar to statements Hardie made in 2001 and 2002, when the original homeowners chose Hardieplank\n   for their house. Bethel concludes that Hardie consistently communicated these warranties in order to successfully influence the behavior of Bethel and other consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   <strong>\n    a) Whether Hardie Made an Informal Express Warranty to Bethel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Hardie never entered into a bargain with Bethel involving the sale of siding, yet the statute requires an affirmation of fact or promise made \"by the seller to the buyer\" that \"becomes part of the basis of the bargain.\" Hardie could not have made a representation that became part of the basis of the bargain with Bethel because the previous owners of his house had purchased and installed the Hardieplank more than 10 years before Bethel bought the house.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lester v.

The siding on the house had been purchased and installed by 2001 by someone other than Bethel. Bethel saw nothing from Hardie before the sale of the siding in 2000 or 2001. Thus, Hardie had no bargain with Bethel involving the sale and purchase of the siding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   Additionally, there is no evidence that any of the alleged informal warranties were ever made to the original purchasers. Nor is there any evidence that Hardie made any representations that induced the original purchasers to buy Hardieplank. In sum, there is no evidence of any statements by Hardie that became part of the basis of the bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Whether Hardie Breached an Informal Express Warranty to Bethel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   Even if the representations at issue were part of the basis for the bargain, Hardie would be entitled to summary judgment. There is no evidence that Hardie breached a purported informal warranty that Hardieplank is covered by a 50-year warranty. It is undisputed that Bethel did receive the 50-year transferrable warranty because he was the first transferee of the warranty. In fact, Bethel submitted a warranty claim to Hardie under the Limited Warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   Bethel also claims that he viewed a statement on Hardie's website that Hardieplank is \"superior to wood or vinyl.\" However, during Bethel's deposition, he did not testify that he had seen such a statement; rather, he testified that he saw a statement that Hardie had a 50-year warranty which, to him, meant that \"[i]t should be a superior product compared to, let's say, wood or vinyl.\" (Frakes Bethel Dep., Ex. B, Bethel Dep. 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   Furthermore, even if Hardie made representations that its siding \"resists hot and cold temperatures\" and is \"superior to wood or vinyl,\" these representations are inactionable puffery. \" 'Puffery' is generally defined as exaggerated blustering or subjective boasting upon which no reasonable consumer would rely.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

First, in response to Hardie's interrogatories, Bethel identified homeowners whose warranty claims were mishandled by Hardie, but did not identify himself. (Frakes Bethel Decl., Ex. A, Bethel Amended Answer to Interrogatory No. 16.) Second, the Limited Warranty does not provide coverage for design defects.

Facts Related to Plaintiff Jonathan Bowers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   Plaintiff Jonathan Bowers is a Minnesota resident who, in 2002, purchased a vacant lot located in Zimmerman, Minnesota. ( [Docket No. 340] Frakes Bowers Decl.,\n   Ex. A, Bowers Dep. 16.) From 2002 through March 2003, he had a home built on the lot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   25-26.) On September 5, 2002, Bowers' builder, Morning Star Homes, Inc., purchased Hardieplank siding for the house from Oak Grove Stock Building Supply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   16, 24-25.) Bowers directed his builder to buy Hardieplank because he heard about it on the radio and \"wanted something as close to worry-free, maintenance-free as [he] could get, and as far away from vinyl as [he] could get.\" ( [Docket No. 369] Moreland Decl., Ex. 1, Bowers Dep. 22.) He also testified: \"It's a great warranty. 50 years is awesome. That's what sold me on the product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   132.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   At least three years before Bowers built his home, he \"continually\" heard radio advertisements for Hardieplank on AM 1500 KSTP in Minnesota. (Moreland Decl., Ex. 1, Bowers Dep. 22, 32, 35, 153-54.) He remembers that the advertisements generally stated that the siding was cement siding that was \"maintenance-free\" and \"lasted for 50 years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   33.) He did not remember the word \"warranty\" being used in the ads. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   Around the time that Bowers directed his builder to purchase Hardieplank, he picked up a Hardieplank brochure from the lumberyard. (Moreland Decl., Ex. 1, Bowers Dep. 34-35.) He recalls that the brochure mentioned a 50-year warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   153.) He is not sure if he viewed the brochure before or after the Hardieplank was purchased. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   34-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   Before Bowers' builder purchased the siding, Bowers had never spoken to Hardie, seen Hardie brochures or any other written advertisement (apart from possibly the aforementioned brochure), seen Hardie television commercials, or visited Hardie's website. (Bowers Dep. 30-31, 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   In 2007, Bowers noticed \"shrinkage\" and \"disintegration\" of siding boards. (Moreland Decl., Ex. 1, Bowers Dep. 39-40; Frakes Bowers Decl., Ex. C, Bowers' Answer to Interrogatory No. 5.) He \"had no idea\" whether the shrinkage was normal for siding and \"didn't know if it was a problem.\" (Bowers Dep. 40.) In 2007, he saw the disintegration \"as a problem\" and believed that the siding had \"failed in some way to be the product that I thought I had bought.\" (Bowers Dep. 41-42.) Boards near the ground had expanded, and the paint had peeled off. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   In the summer of 2007, Bowers spoke with a company called John Haley # 1 Roofer because he \"was looking for someone to come and replace the damaged siding.\" (Bowers Dep. 45-46.) He also spoke to his wife about his concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   52-54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   In 2007, Bowers contacted Hardie by telephone to ask for advice and to ask a representative to inspect the siding. (Moreland Decl., Ex. 1, Bowers Dep. 42, 49-50.) He asked Hardie whether the shrinkage was normal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   42.) He did not mention the disintegration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Hardie representative repeatedly told him that Hardieplank does not shrink and said that there was no Hardie representative in the area who could come look at his house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   43-45, 49-50.) Bowers' only contact with Hardie was in 2007. (Frakes Bowers Decl., Ex. A, Bowers Dep. 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   After a storm in 2010, Bowers asked a contractor to inspect the Hardieplank. The contractor noted \"bubbling\" on the Hardieplank. (Bowers Dep. 83, 86, 123-28.) Bowers believed that the bubbling was not limited to the paint but was in the Hardieplank substrate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   84-85.) The contractor told Bowers about this lawsuit and Bowers learned that there was \"an issue\" and \"a problem\" with Hardieplank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   164.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   There is no evidence that Bowers ever submitted a warranty claim to Hardie. (Frakes Bowers Decl., Ex. A, Bowers Dep. 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   On March 22, 2012, Bowers filed suit against Hardie in the District of Minnesota.

His original Complaint alleges: \"Plaintiff purchased and installed an exterior siding product that is defective and unsafe.... The defect causes damage to Plaintiff's home, in addition to damage to the siding itself, by allowing moisture to enter through or around the Siding.\" (Second Frakes Decl., Ex. E, Bowers Compl. \u00b6 124.) The current operative complaint, the ACC, asserts that the siding \"is susceptible to premature failure, causing damage to the underlying structures and property of Plaintiff by allowing water and moisture to penetrate into the structure.\" (ACC \u00b6 6.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34 (siding \"allows water and moisture to penetrate into the structure, thereby causing damage to the underlying structure and other adjoining property\"), 123 (\"Due to gaps and deterioration in the Siding, the underlayment of Plaintiffs' home was exposed to the elements, risking further damage to the underlying structure.\").) Also, Plaintiffs' expert opines that gaps in the siding, like those alleged by Bowers, can permit \"additional moisture intrusion\" and \"exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which affects any underlayment or building paper.\" (Exponent Report at 65.) All of Bowers' claims seek \"to recover damages for any injury to property ... arising out of the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.051\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 541.051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   Additionally, all of Bowers' causes of action are the type of claims that are subject to the two-year statute of limitations. The two-year statute of limitations applies to \"actions based on breach of an express written warranty.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.051\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 541.051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subds. 1, 4. Therefore, it applies to Count 1: Breach of Express Warranty. Additionally, because the statute applies to actions \"in contract, tort, or otherwise,\" it further applies to Count 7: Minnesota Unlawful Trade Practices Act and Count 8: False Statements in Advertising Act claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Donatelle Plastics Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2031002847\">\n    2002 WL 31002847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (applying two-year statute of limitations to claims, including statutory consumer fraud and false advertising claims, that flooring was defective in that it failed to adhere to a cement substrate). Thus, the two-year statute of limitations applies to all of Bowers' Minnesota claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Accrual\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   In 2007, Bowers personally observed shrinkage and disintegration of his siding. He saw the disintegration as a problem, believed that the siding had \"failed in some way to be the product that I thought I had bought,\" and was so concerned that he called Hardie and also talked to a roofing contractor about his issues and to find out about replacing the siding. Bowers knew that a problem existed with his siding in 2007. He also knew, in 2007, that Hardie refused his request to send someone to inspect his house and denied that his siding shrank. Bowers had no contact with Hardie after 2007, and there is no evidence that he ever submitted a warranty claim to Hardie. Thus, Bowers' claims accrued in 2007, when he first discovered his \"injury,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.051\">\n    Minn.

Equitable Estoppel or Tolling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   Bowers argues that his claims should be equitably tolled because a Hardie representative told Bowers that Hardieplank does not shrink and refused to send anyone to look at Bowers' house.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-408\">\n   [W]hen the defendant makes assurances or representations that the injury will be repaired and the plaintiff reasonably relies on these assurances to their detriment, the defendant may be estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-409\">\n   Estoppel depends on the facts of each case and ordinarily presents a question for the jury. But, when only one inference can be drawn from the facts, the question is one of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   <em>\n    Oreck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11552896\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/602/424/#p429\">\n    602 N.W.2d at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   Equitable tolling does not apply. Equitable tolling can occur when a defendant lulls a plaintiff into not filing suit until after the limitations period has run, for example, by promising to make the repairs. Here, the opposite situation is alleged. Bowers claims that, when he contacted Hardie in 2007, Hardie immediately denied liability and responsibility and made no offers to repair the problems.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Oreck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11552896\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/602/424/#p429\">\n    602 N.W.2d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding grant of summary judgment on statute of limitations because equitable tolling could not apply when the defendant \"consistently denied any responsibility for the air and water leakage and made no promises to repair the problems\").

Thus, in 2007, Hardie put him on notice that it would not fix his siding issues. Also, because he had no contact with Hardie after 2007, Hardie could not have made any representation or inducement upon which he relied to his detriment.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-413\">\n   A statute of limitations may be tolled if the cause of action is fraudulently concealed by the defendant.

Facts Related to Plaintiff John Hernandez\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   Plaintiff John Hernandez is a Colorado resident. In 2006, Hernandez hired Backwoods\n   Builders to construct a house and cistern shed on his property in Dolores, Colorado. ( [Docket No. 345] Frakes Hernandez Decl., Ex. A, Hernandez Answer to Interrogatory No. 2; Frakes Hernandez Decl., Ex. B, Hernandez Dep. 23, 25.) On October 20, 2006, Backwoods Builders purchased Hardieplank siding from a lumberyard called ProBuild, formerly known as UBC Builders. (Hernandez Answer to Interrogatory No. 2; Hernandez Dep. 28-31.) Hernandez paid Backwoods Builders to construct the house, but did not pay ProBuild or Hardie for the siding. (Hernandez Dep. 30-32.) He does not know how much Backwoods Builders paid to purchase the siding or for the siding to be prefinished with a stain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   32-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   Before Backwoods Builders bought the Hardieplank for Hernandez's house, Hernandez spoke with UBC Builders employee Jeff Greve. (Hernandez Dep. 38.) Hernandez understood that Greve worked for UBC Builders and that UBC Builders was a separate company than Hardie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   44.) Hernandez told Greve that he was \"looking for a low-maintenance product, something with fire protection, because of the area [he] live[s] in, as well as something that was going to withstand the elements of where [he] was.\" (Hernandez Dep. 43.) Greve responded by pointing to the Hardieplank and saying that was the product he wanted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Greve also told Hernandez that the Hardieplank had a \"significant warranty,\" although Hernandez can no longer recall the particular length of the warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   44.) Hernandez \"selected Hardieplank because of its durability, its warranty, and its fire protection.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   Before the siding was purchased, Hernandez never spoke with anyone employed by Hardie, never visited Hardie's web site, never reviewed any Hardie brochure or advertisement, never saw a Hardie television commercial, and never heard a Hardie radio advertisement. (Hernandez Dep. 37-38.) He did see a display of different colored siding pieces at the lumberyard, but the display had no writing on it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   41-42, 45-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   The siding that was purchased for Hernandez's house was prefinished with Mason's Select \"Cedar\" stain. (Hernandez Dep. 35; Frakes Decl., Ex. C.) Hardie has never applied or sold its siding with Mason's Select stain. (Klein Decl. \u00b6 6.) Thus, after Hardie sold either primed or unprimed siding to its customer, the stain was applied by a third party unaffiliated with Hardie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hardie's best practices recommend that semi-transparent stains, such as Mason's Select \"Cedar\" stain, should not be used. (Klein Decl. \u00b6 3; Klein Decl., Ex. 1, 2005 Hardie Installation Best Practices for Exterior Siding and Trim Products, at 23.) A Hardie technical bulletin available since 1997 states that \"[c]lear coats and semi-transparent stains have not proven durable in exterior exposures. James Hardie does not recommend their use on Hardie Siding Products.\" (Klein Decl. \u00b6 4; Klein Decl., Ex. 2, 1997 Hardie Technical Bulletin No. S-100.) A Hardie technical bulletin available since 2003 states that \"Hardie does not warrant the appearance or durability of semitransparent stains or clear coats.\" (Klein Decl. \u00b6 5; Klein Decl., Ex. 3, 2003 1997 Hardie Technical Bulletin No. S-100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   In 2010, Hernandez noticed \"fading\" and \"flaking\" on his siding. (Hernandez Dep. 52-53, 57-58; Frakes Hernandez Decl., Ex. A, Hernandez Answer to Interrogatory No. 5.) By \"flaking,\" Hernandez meant that the stain was coming off and, by \"fading,\" he meant that the color of the siding was \"becoming lighter.\" (Hernandez Dep. 52, 58.) He thought that the fading and flaking was a \"problem\" and that there was something wrong with the siding on all four sides of the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   59; Second Frakes Hernandez Decl., Ex. H,\n   Hernandez Dep. 54.) He discussed these problems with his wife. (Frakes Hernandez Decl., Ex. B, Hernandez Dep. 53, 59.) In 2010, Hernandez's wife attempted to repair the issues with touch up paint. (Hernandez Dep. 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   Hernandez submitted a warranty claim to Hardie in November 2013. (Hernandez Dep. 78-79; Frakes Hernandez Decl., Ex. D, Hernandez Warranty Claim.) The only \"concern\" he identified on the warranty claim was that the coating on the siding seemed to be flaking off. (Hernandez Warranty Claim; Hernandez Dep. 79-80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   On December 19, 2013, a Hardie inspector inspected the siding on Hernandez's home. (Hernandez Dep. 83.) The inspector orally told Hernandez that he could not patch the problems because then Hernandez would have to paint the entire house to match the touch ups. (Boyle Decl., Ex. 1, Hernandez Dep. 86-87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   On February 5, 2014, Hardie emailed Hernandez and denied responsibility for the problem:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-438\">\n   At the moment I am researching the company that stained you[r] product so I can assist in getting some resolution to you[r] peeling issue. ... The issues you are having are a pre-finish, not a JH issue. There are very few things I can do to help you so I am looking into other avenues you can move towards for resolution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   (Boyle Decl., Ex. 2; Frakes Hernandez Decl., Ex. B, Hernandez Dep. 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   On February 25, 2014, Hardie emailed Hernandez a settlement agreement. (Boyle Decl., Ex. 3.) It offered to pay $3,100 to a contractor of Hernandez's choosing to paint 3,100 square feet of the siding, and to pay to caulk the siding and dispose of any debris. (Frakes Hernandez Decl., Ex. B, Hernandez Dep. 100-01.) The total square feet of all siding on Hernandez's house was 2,618 square feet. (Hernandez Dep. 102.) Hernandez understood that, on February 5, 2014, Hardie was not accepting his warranty claim and that on February 25, 2014, Hardie was offering to pay money to resolve the claim although Hardie did not believe his issues were covered by the warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   On October 9, 2014, Hernandez filed suit against Hardie in the District of Colorado. (Civil File No. 14-4655)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Here, Hernandez asserts that an unaffiliated lumberyard employee made two alleged misrepresentations to him: that Hardieplank was covered by a 50-year warranty and that Hardieplank is low maintenance. However, Hernandez fails to present any evidence that Hardie made a misrepresentation to that lumberyard employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   Even if Hernandez could show that Hardie had told the lumberyard employee that Hardieplank was covered by a 50-year warranty, no CCPA claim would survive. There is no dispute that the siding did come with a 50-year transferrable warranty. There is no evidence that Hardie did not intend to honor the warranty at that time, and, in fact, it offered to repaint all of Hernandez's house even though the Limited Warranty excludes coverage for design defects and for third-party coatings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhino Linings USA, Inc. v.

Facts Related to Plaintiffs David and Sharon Angelici\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-474\">\n   Plaintiffs David and Sharon Angelici are Wisconsin residents who own a house located in Burlington, Wisconsin. ( [Docket No. 349] Frakes Angelici Decl., Ex. A, Angelicis' Answer to Interrogatory No. 2.) In November 2002, they installed Hardieplank siding on their home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Polakoff Decl., Ex. 1, D. Angelici Dep. 11-12, 14.) The siding was prefinished with Cabot-brand stain by Cedar Siding &amp; Lumber, Inc., which provided that service to Burlington Lumber. (Frakes Decl., Ex. A, Angelicis' Answer to Interrogatory No. 3; Frakes Angelici Decl., Ex. B, D. Angelici Dep. 19-20; Frakes Angelici Decl., Ex. C, S. Angelici Dep. 19-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-475\">\n   Before the Angelicis purchased the Hardieplank, David Angelici visited Burlington Lumber several times and discussed siding with a Burlington Lumber employee. He saw siding samples and a siding display, but he cannot recall any writing on either. (D. Angelici Dep. 30-32.) He reviewed an 11 inch by 17 inch brochure and a smaller version of that brochure, but cannot recall anything that they said. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   32, 35-36.) David Angelici had multiple conversations with Burlington Lumber employee Chris Impens. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   22-25.) He understood that Impens was employed by Burlington Lumber and not Hardie and that Burlington Lumber and Hardie were two separate companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   22-23.) Impens told him that Hardieplank was a maintenance-free product covered by a 50-year warranty. (D. Angelici Dep. 23-24; Angelicis' Answer to Interrogatory No. 1.) David Angelici believed that Hardieplank \"would outlast the use that I had for it\" and would not suffer any defects. (Polakoff Decl., Ex. 1, D. Angelici Dep. 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-476\">\n   Before the Angelicis installed the Hardieplank, David Angelici reviewed the Limited Warranty and then decided to have the siding installed after reviewing the warranty. (Frakes Angelici Decl., Ex. B, D. Angelici Dep. 26-27.) He skimmed it and noticed that there were \"conditions\" and \"exclusions\" to the warranty coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   27-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-477\">\n   Sharon Angelici did not select the Hardieplank siding. (Frakes Angelici Decl., Ex. C, S. Angelici Dep. 23.) Once the siding was selected, she chose the color. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   24, 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-478\">\n   The Angelicis have no recollection of any information received, before they purchased the Hardieplank, from a Hardie employee, Hardie's website, Hardie television commercials, or Hardie radio advertisements. (D. Angelici Dep. 36-38; S. Angelici Dep. 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-479\">\n   In 2006, Sharon Angelici first noticed problems with the Hardieplank. (S. Angelici Dep. 28-29.) She noticed \"discoloration and chipping\" and was \"concerned about it looking like drywall where it was going to\n   start to crumble. And then my husband and I just started looking into why it would be doing that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Also in 2006, David Angelici observed the siding fading to pink, so he talked to Impens about the issue. (D. Angelici Dep. 38-40.) David Angelici \"definitely\" thought that there was a problem with the siding at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-480\">\n   In October 2008, at Burlington Lumber's request, Impens and a Hardie representative visited the Angelicis' house. (D. Angelici Dep. 38-40, 42-43.) David Angelici did not meet or have a conversation with that Hardie representative, whose name he does not remember. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   42-44.) Impens told David Angelici that the Hardie representative stated that Hardie was not at fault for any of the problems with the Hardieplank-flaking, warping, separating, and fading-and that the fading was ordinary \"weathering.\" (D. Angelici Dep. 42-44; Angelicis' Answer to Interrogatory No. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-481\">\n   In 2008 and 2009, the Angelicis noticed gapping and shrinking in the siding. (Polakoff Decl., Ex. 3, S. Angelici Dep. 36; Angelicis' Answer to Interrogatory No. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-482\">\n   On May 31, 2010, the Angelicis submitted a Warranty Claim Information Form to Hardie making a claim under the Limited Warranty. (Frakes Angelici Decl., Ex. E, Angelici Warranty Claim; Frakes Angelici Decl., Ex. B, D. Angelici Dep. 65.) The claim stated: \"The siding is beginning to deteriorate. The color has changed from brown to pink. The caulk is drying and splitting and there is shrinking.\" This was the only warranty claim that the Angelicis ever made to Hardie. (D. Angelici Dep. 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-483\">\n   In July 2010, Hardie sent an inspector to the Angelicis' home. (Polakoff Decl., Ex. 1, D. Angelici Dep. 66.) On August 13, 2010, Hardie emailed the Angelicis and offered to replace 600 square feet of Hardieplank siding on the Angelicis' home. (Polakoff Decl., Ex. 5 at 32; D. Angelici Dep. 58-59.) The Angelicis declined Hardie's offer to repair because they thought that it was inadequate, that 1,000 square feet of siding were affected, and that the offer would be a piecemeal repair with nonmatching siding. (D. Angelici Dep. 58-59, 69-72; Frakes Angelici Decl., Ex. C, S. Angelici Dep. 73-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-484\">\n   The Angelicis received quotes that it would cost between $19,000 and $34,000 to replace all of their Hardieplank siding. (Polakoff Decl., Exs. 6-7.) In June 2014, they repainted their Hardieplank at a cost of $4,300 in order to protect their home from the elements and to prevent the Hardieplank from deteriorating further. (Polakoff Decl., Ex. 3, S. Angelici Dep. 80; Polakoff Decl., Ex. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-485\">\n   In January 2015, the Angelicis substituted for previous Plaintiff Steven Schindler, who had filed claims against Hardie in the Eastern District of Wisconsin on January 6, 2014. (Civil File No. 14-285)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-486\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Angelicis do not allege that Hardie's products did not come with a 50-year warranty, so there is no allegation that Hardie breached that promise. An advertisement's reference to a formal limited warranty does not, on its own, create a new informal promise that the product will last for a certain amount of time without any of the terms or conditions of the limited warranty. Thus, none of the informal warranties explicitly extended to future performance, so the future performance exception does not apply and the claim began to accrue at tender of delivery in 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hardieplank Fiber Cement Siding Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-MD-2359,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202987657\">\n    2014 WL 2987657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (D.

Facts Related to Plaintiff Heidi Picht\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-506\">\n   Plaintiff Heidi Picht is a Minnesota resident. When Picht built a new home in Minnesota in 2006, her building contractor, Joe Jost, suggested that she use siding manufactured by Hardie because that siding \"looked like wood but did not require any maintenance\" and \"was protected by a fifty-year warranty.\" (Civ. File No. 11-958 [Docket No. 79] Picht Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) Based on Jost's recommendation, Picht visited Morris Lumber, where she looked at samples of Hardie siding and saw Hardie advertising. (Picht Decl. \u00b6 4.) The advertising stated that the siding was durable and covered by a 50-year warranty. (Picht Decl. \u00b6 5; Picht Decl., Ex. A.) Picht testified that the only representation that she saw from Hardie before purchasing the siding was a statement that the siding came with a 50-year warranty. ( [Docket No. 81] Murphy Reply Decl., Ex. B, Picht Dep. 67-68.) Picht chose to purchase the Hardie siding because it looked like wood and she believed that it was \"a durable product with a fifty-year warranty.\" (Picht Decl. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-507\">\n   Picht chose a mahogany stain for the siding, and it was installed on her house on or before September 25, 2006. (Moriarity Aff., Ex. 1, Picht Response to Hardie Interrogatory No. 2; Moriarity Aff., Ex. 2, Picht Dep. 58.) Hardie sold the siding as unfinished to Building Products, Inc. (\"BPI\"), an independent distributor of building products. (Duke Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) BPI hired Midwest Factory Finishes to apply a semi-transparent stain manufactured by third-party Duckback Products (\"Duckback\"). (Enoka Aff., Ex. 1 at 13, 15, 19; Duke Aff. \u00b6 4.) BPI then sold the siding to Morris Lumber. (Duke Aff. \u00b6 5; Enoka Aff., Ex. 1 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-508\">\n   In the spring of 2007, Picht noticed that the siding's finish was starting to peel and she contacted Jost, who contacted Morris Lumber. (Picht Decl. \u00b6 6.) The lumberyard put Picht in touch with Jamie Duke, a representative from BPI, and John Cooper, a representative of Duckback. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7; Duke Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6.) Later in the spring of 2007, Duke and Cooper visited Picht's house. (Picht Decl. \u00b6 7.) Cooper gave Picht a copy of James Hardie's Limited Warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Picht avers that this was the first time that she saw the language of the Limited Warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-509\">\n   As a result of the visit, Duke sent a worker to touch up the stain on Picht's siding at some point in 2007. (Picht Decl. \u00b6 9.) When Picht told Duke that the touch-up work was unsatisfactory and blotchy, he stated that he would return again in the spring of 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) During the fall of 2007 or the spring of 2008, Picht noticed that the siding was also warping and shrinking. (Picht Dep. 126.) During the spring of 2008, Picht asked Duke for a warranty claim form, and Duke provided Picht with a warranty claim form from Duckback, but not from Hardie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   167-68.) At that time, Picht knew that Duke worked for BPI, and she thought that Duckback was the \"the warranty company\" which was responsible for fixing the problems with her siding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   167-68, 207-08.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-510\">\n   On June 9, 2008, Picht submitted the warranty claim to Duckback. (Enoka Aff., Ex. 1 at 13.) On June 19, 2008, Duckback informed Picht that there were\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-511\">\n   building practice issues that must be fixed prior to any coating resolution. I have included a copy of the James Hardie Installation Instructions. A few issues\n   noticed were lack of caulking and lack of kick out flashing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-512\">\n   Once the building practice issues have been fixed, Midwest Factory Finishes, BPI and Duckback will work together to supply coating for the minimal peeling and a few re ran boards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   (Enoka Aff., Ex. 1 at 15.) On August 7, 2008, Picht told Duckback that the building practices issues had been fixed and she had received 20 new siding boards from BPI, but the boards were darker than the existing siding. (Enoka Aff., Ex. 1 at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   On August 13, 2008, Duckback stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-515\">\n   The initial building practice issues allowed moisture to enter the boards resulting in the underlying substrate to give way resulting in cracking and peeling. Because of the initial problems the boards may continue to give way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-516\">\n   Duckback offered to apply a solid-color finish to all of her siding. (Enoka Aff., Ex. 1 at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-517\">\n   On or about August 19, 2008, Picht retrieved documents related to her siding claims from an attorney she had consulted. (Murphy Decl., Ex. B, Picht. Dep. 183.) A letter dated August 19, 2008 accompanied the return of the documents. (Murphy Decl., Ex. A.) In the letter, Picht's attorney informed her that the statute of limitations \"to bring an actual lawsuit for this siding claim will run around March 1, 2009.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The letter stated that Picht \"[had] been fully advised that if [she] ever want[ed] to make a legal claim for this siding issue it must be sued out prior to March 1, 2009.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Picht testified that, in August 2008, she understood that the deadline for her to bring her lawsuit against Hardie was March 1, 2009, because she had discovered problems with her siding around March 1, 2007. (Murphy Decl., Ex. B, Picht. Dep. 183-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-518\">\n   On August 21, 2008, Picht submitted a Consumer Complaint regarding Hardie to the Minnesota Attorney General's Office. ( [Docket No. 81] Murphy Decl., Ex. D.) Picht asserted that the siding was \"clearly a defective product\" and stated that she wanted Hardie to provide the \"[f]ull cost of new siding, removal of old product, including labor, house wrap and all materials needed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-519\">\n   On November 3, 2008, in response to an inquiry by the Minnesota Attorney General, counsel for Hardie wrote that Picht's \"complaint against James Hardie [was] unfounded\" because its Limited Warranty did not apply to Picht's claim due to its exclusion of coverage for stains or coatings not applied by Hardie or an affiliate. (Murphy Decl., Ex. E.) The Minnesota Attorney General's Office relayed Hardie's response to Picht in a letter dated November 5, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-520\">\n   On March 30, 2011, Picht commenced an action against Hardie in Minnesota state court. [Docket No. 1] Hardie removed the matter to this Court. In her Amended Complaint [Docket No. 16], Picht set out seven causes of action: Count 1: Breach of Express Warranty; Count 2: Breach of Implied Warranties of Merchantability and Fitness for a Particular Purpose; Count 3: Unlawful Trade Practices: Count 4: False Advertising; Count 5: Negligence; Count 6: Negligent Failure to Warn; and Count 7: Unjust Enrichment. On July 5, 2011, Hardie moved for summary judgment on all claims against it based on, among other things, the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   On August 9, 2013, Plaintiffs filed the ACC, which included Picht as a Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Applicability of the Two-Year Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-528\">\n   The two-year statute of limitations applies to all of Picht's Minnesota claims because Picht's claims, like Bowers' claims, seek \"to recover damages for any injury to property ... arising out of the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.051\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 541.051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1. Picht alleges that Hardieplank has left her home insecure and vulnerable to invasion by the elements. Her Amended Complaint alleged that the siding was both \"defective and unsafe\" and that it \"allow[s] water to penetrate into the structure.\" (Amended Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 122.) The current operative complaint, the ACC, asserts: \"Because of the failure of the Siding, water penetrated into Ms. Picht's home, damaging the underlying structure. (ACC \u00b6 60.) The ACC further alleges that the siding \"is susceptible to premature failure, causing damage to the underlying structures and property of Plaintiff by allowing water and moisture to penetrate into the structure.\" (ACC \u00b6 6.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.051\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.051\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (siding \"allows water and moisture to penetrate into the structure, thereby causing damage to the underlying structure and other adjoining property\"), 123 (\"Due to gaps and deterioration in the Siding, the underlayment of Plaintiffs' home was exposed to the elements, risking further damage to the underlying structure.\").) Thus, for the reasons explained with respect to Plaintiff Bowers, the two-year statute of limitations applies to Picht's Minnesota claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-529\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Accrual\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-530\">\n   At the very latest, Picht was aware of her claims against Hardie when she received a letter from the Minnesota Attorney General informing her that Hardie denied liability for the alleged defects in her home's siding. Picht received that letter in November 2008. By this time, she had observed the defects in her siding and knew that Hardie would not address those alleged defects and denied liability under the Limited Warranty. Thus, Picht's claims had all accrued by November 2008, when she had discovered her \"injury,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.051\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 541.051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd.1 (non-express warranty claims) and when she also discovered Hardie's \"breach,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.051\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.051\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   subd. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-531\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Equitable Estoppel or Tolling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-532\">\n   Tolling based on fraudulent concealment or estoppel does not apply. Picht discovered the alleged defect affecting her siding well over two years before she filed this action. Picht has stated that her siding began peeling as early as the spring of 2007. In any event, in November 2008, she received notice through the Minnesota Attorney General's Office that Hardie's position was that it was not responsible for the problems with her siding. Picht has alleged no conduct after that date by Hardie (or anybody else) which could have fraudulently concealed the alleged defects in the siding or Picht's cause of action based on such defects. Additionally, in August 2008, Picht was informed by an attorney that she needed to file suit by March 2009, and Picht testified that she understood that this was the deadline for her to file a\n   lawsuit against Hardie based on defects in the siding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-533\">\n   Picht argues that there remains a question fact as to whether the representations of BPI employees acting as James Hardie's actual or constructive agents induced her to delay filing her lawsuit and should serve to estop Hardie from asserting a statute of limitations defense. \"Under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, if a buyer delays filing suit [on a warranty claim] as a result of reasonable and detrimental reliance on a seller's assurances it will repair the defective goods, the limitations period is tolled during that period of delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Highway Sales, Inc. v. Blue Bird Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5660044\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/782/#p789\">\n    559 F.3d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789 (8th Cir. 2009). Picht has not pointed to evidence from which a factfinder could determine that BPI or Duke were actual or constructive agents of Hardie. And Duke provided Picht with a Duckback warranty claim form, not a Hardie claim form. In any event, even if Duke's conduct were attributable to Hardie and induced Picht to delay filing suit, the statute of limitations bars her claims. Duckback rejected Picht's warranty claim in August 2008. That same month, Picht's attorney informed her that the statute of limitations on her claim would run in less than a year. In November 2008, Hardie made clear that it did not believe that its warranty covered her claims. Picht has pointed to no evidence that Hardie, Duke, or anyone else made any additional representations to her after November 2008 or that such representations caused her to continue to delay the filing of her lawsuit. Thus, even if estoppel applied, the start of two year limitation period would not be tolled after November 2008 at the very latest, meaning that Picht was required to bring her action in November 2010. Picht did not file her lawsuit until March 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-534\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Count 5: California Unfair Competition Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-535\">\n   Hardie is entitled to summary judgment on Count 5. Assuming without deciding that the UCL applies, Picht's UCL claim fails. First, statements by Picht's building contractor are not actionable because Hardie is not liable for statements made by unrelated third parties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Emery v. Visa Int'l Serv. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1021173\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/95/952/\">\n    95 Cal.App.4th 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2025\">\n    116 Cal.Rptr.2d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33 (2002). Second, Picht cannot point to actionable representations by Hardie. Picht testified that the only representation that she received from Hardie before purchasing her siding was that the siding carried a 50-year warranty. As the Court has previously explained, this representation was true and there is no support for Plaintiffs' signal theory. As for Picht's more recent claim that she read a brochure that Hardie was durable, \"[g]eneralized, vague, and unspecified assertions constitute 'mere puffery' upon which a reasonable consumer could not rely, and hence are not actionable [under the UCL].\"\n   <em>\n    Azoulai v.
