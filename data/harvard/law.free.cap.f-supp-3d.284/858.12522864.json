BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case involves the wrongful retention of a child and is brought pursuant to the Hague Convention (the \"Convention\") and the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (\"ICARA\"). Petitioner Noemy Elizabeth Membre\u00f1o Peralta (\"Petitioner\") is the mother of a ten-year-old child, GM. GM's father, Eli Escobar Garay (\"Garay\"), is not a party to this dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Parents reside in El Salvador. Respondent Guadelupe del Carmen Escobar Garay (\"Respondent\") is GM's paternal aunt. Respondent resides in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   GM was born in El Salvador on January 14, 2007, and lived with Petitioner in El Salvador until 2016. In early 2016, the Parents agreed to leave El Salvador and travel to the United States with GM and Son. The Parents intended for Garay and GM to travel separately from Petitioner and Son. On approximately March 14, 2016, Garay and GM left El Salvador and traveled to the United States. Approximately one month later, Petitioner and Son left El Salvador, intending to travel to the United States. On approximately March 25, 2016, after Garay and GM entered the United States, United States immigration officials detained Garay and GM for traveling illegally. While Garay and GM were being detained in the United States, Petitioner and Son were stopped in Mexico (in route to the United States) and deported to El Salvador. Petitioner alleges that, because of Garay and GM's detention, Petitioner gave Respondent-who was residing in the United States-temporary authorization to retain GM so that United States immigration officials would release GM to Respondent. Following GM's release to Respondent, Garay was deported to El Salvador. GM has since resided with Respondent in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 26, 2016, Petitioner filed a lawsuit in this Court, contending Respondent is wrongfully retaining GM in the United States and asking the Court to order the return of GM to El Salvador.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 25, 2017, Respondent moved to dismiss Petitioner's lawsuit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). On January 8, 2018, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on Respondent's Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, at which time testimony was heard from the Parents, Respondent, and two other witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent's Rule 12(b)(1) motion is currently pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    II.

FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1). A motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) must be considered before any motion on the merits because subject matter jurisdiction is required to determine the validity of any claim.\n   <em>\n    Moran v.

The Convention and ICARA empower courts to order the return of children wrongfully removed or retained from their country of habitual residence, not to determine the merits of an underlying custody dispute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209001\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 9001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    England v.

The Convention requires that a court order the return of a wrongfully removed or retained child. To qualify for relief under the Convention, a petitioner seeking return of a child must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the child was wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the Convention.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011603\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). Thus, federal subject matter jurisdiction is invoked only if a removal or retention is \"wrongful.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nicolson v. Pappalardo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3680881\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/674/295/#p298\">\n    674 F.Supp.2d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (D.

A retention is wrongful if (1) the respondent retained the child somewhere other than the child's habitual residence; (2) the retention violated the petitioner's rights of custody under the habitual-residence nation's laws; and (3) \"at the time of ... retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but\n   for the ... retention.\"\n   <em>\n    Larbie v. Larbie,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3503684\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/295/#p307\">\n    690 F.3d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (5th Cir. 2012). Respondent's motion to dismiss focuses only on the first element, contending that, at the time of Respondent's retention of GM in the United States, the Parents had abandoned El Salvador as the country of GM's habitual residence and intended to permanently relocate GM to the United States. Petitioner contends El Salvador has always been GM's country of habitual residence. The parties therefore agree that the disposition of Respondent's motion to dismiss requires the Court to determine GM's habitual residence at the time GM was retained in the United States. Because the factual findings regarding GM's habitual residence are intertwined with the elements of Petitioner's claim, the Court will not dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction unless Petitioner's contentions regarding GM's habitual residence are obviously without merit or foreclosed by prior decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1380717\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/618/1093/#p1103\">\n    618 F.2d 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1103 (5th Cir. 1980).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although the term \"habitual residence\" is not defined by the Convention, the Fifth Circuit has \"adopted an approach that begins with the parents' shared intent or settled purpose regarding their child's residence.\"\n   <em>\n    Larbie,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3503684\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/295/#p307\">\n    690 F.3d at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nicolson v.

The family traveled separately: Garay and GM traveled together and Petitioner and Son traveled together. Garay testified that the Parents intended to relocate the family to the United States because the Parents thought there would be more opportunities for their children in the United States. Petitioner denied intending to permanently relocate but testified that the Parents intended for the family to remain in the United States indefinitely and planned on finding jobs and a residence in the United States. Despite Petitioner's denial of the intention to permanently relocate, Petitioner's admission that the Parents intended the family to remain in the United States indefinitely strongly indicates the Parents had a shared intent to abandon El Salvador as GM's habitual residence and relocate GM to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mozes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11077215\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/1067/#p1080\">\n    239 F.3d at 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing a court can find mutual abandonment based on the settled mutual intent to stay in a separate country indefinitely).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Garay also testified that he intended to seek asylum in the United States. Petitioner was not clear as to whether the family intended to seek asylum. The Parents testified to bringing their passports, personal identification, and other documents with them as they traveled from El Salvador to the United States. Petitioner testified that she and Garay each quit their respective jobs in anticipation of leaving El Salvador. This testimony also indicates a shared intent to abandon El Salvador as GM's habitual residence and relocate GM to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delgado v. Osuna,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128823\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/571/#p579\">\n    837 F.3d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579 (5th Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berezowsky v.

The Court finds the evidence conclusively establishes the Parents' shared intent to abandon El Salvador and permanently relocate GM to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioner alleges that, regardless of the Parents' previous intentions, after the Parents were deported to El Salvador, their shared intention shifted to reestablishing GM's permanent residence in El Salvador. However, by that time, GM had already been relocated to the United States and retained by Respondent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friedrich v. Friedrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11649406\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/1396/#p1402\">\n    983 F.2d 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1402 (6th Cir. 1993) (finding there must be a change in geography to establish a new habitual residence). Thus, at the time Respondent retained GM, El Salvador had been abandoned as GM's country of habitual residence. Petitioner has therefore failed to meet her burden of showing that GM's retention is wrongful. Accordingly, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Petitioner's lawsuit, and Respondent's motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    IV.
