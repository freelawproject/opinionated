Appx. 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although Plaintiff argues that this should not be the result in the present matter, he provides no authority in support of his position. The Court agrees with this well-settled case authority which holds that Article 78 is an adequate post-deprivation remedy in state court for resolving disputes over discipline in public schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff contends that an Article 78 proceeding was not an adequate post-deprivation remedy in the present matter. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that he withdrew his appeal to the Commissioner because he was about to graduate and, therefore, the issue was moot and would have been rejected. The Court disagrees. In\n   <em>\n    Appeal of Duffy\n   </em>\n   , the respondents argued that the appeal was moot because the student had already served his five day suspension.\n   <em>\n    See Appeal of Duffy\n   </em>\n   , Dec. No. 13,718, 36 Educ. Dept. Rep. 257 (1996). Although the Commissioner agreed that he will only decide \"matters in actual controversy and will not render a decision on a state of facts which no longer exist or which subsequent events have laid to rest ...,\" the Commissioner found that a live controversy remained because the disciplinary action remained on the student's record.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Fed.%20Appx.%20435\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, in his appeal to the Commissioner, Plaintiff not only requested a temporary stay of his suspension pending resolution of the appeal, but also that the Commissioner \"vacate and annul the decision of the Board of Education and the Superintendent being erroneous, arbitrary and contrary to the credible evidence, and granting such other and further relief as the Commissioner deems just and proper.\" Dkt. No. 26-4 at 18-19. As in\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   , since Plaintiff was seeking to have the decisions of the Board of Education and Superintendent vacated and annulled, the fact that he had already served his suspension and graduated did not moot the appeal since a favorable decision from the Commissioner could have removed the disciplinary action from Plaintiff's record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Similarly, an Article 78 proceeding was available to provide Plaintiff his requested relief. Although the Article 78 court certainly could not provide Plaintiff with reinstatement after he graduated, it could have ordered Plaintiff's record expunged. As the Second Circuit has noted, Article 78 is an amalgam of the common law writs of certiorari to review, mandamus, and prohibition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hellenic Am. Neighborhood Action Committee v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639376\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/877/#p881\">\n    101 F.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 881 (2d Cir. 1996). It provides a hearing and means of redress for petitioners and, in such a proceeding, constitutional issues can be decided.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639376\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/877/#p881\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). While Plaintiff correctly indicated at oral argument that he would not be able to obtain damages through an Article 78 proceeding, both the Second Circuit and Supreme Court have held that an \"Article 78 proceeding is adequate for due process purposes even though the petitioner may not be able to recover the same relief that he could in a \u00a7 1983 suit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639376\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/877/#p881\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

In certain situations where the alleged violations are systemic, and not isolated and random, the availability of an Article 78 proceeding does not bar a procedural due process claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reyes v. County of Suffolk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069707\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/995/215/#p228\">\n    995 F.Supp.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). Plaintiff, however, has not asserted such a systemic claim. Rather, Plaintiff's complaint makes clear that he is simply attacking the propriety of the decisions of the Superintendent and School Board, which is exactly the type of claim barred by the availability of an Article 78 proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069707\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/995/215/#p228\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendant Westling's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff's procedural due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The \"shock the conscience\" standard is not easily met; the plaintiff must show that the government's conduct was \" 'egregious' \" and \" 'outrageous,' \" not \"not merely incorrect or ill-advised.\"\n   <em>\n    Ferran v.

Plaintiff has failed to plead any facts plausibly suggesting conduct so egregious as to constitute a violation of substantive due process. In his complaint, Plaintiff acknowledges that he was provided with two hearings and was permitted the opportunity to testify on his own behalf. While Plaintiff criticizes the decision of Defendant Westling he fails to allege any conduct sufficiently egregious to plausibly allege a substantive due process claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chandrapaul v.

Quite simply, assuming the truth of the well-pled allegations in the complaint, Plaintiff fails to allege conduct that transgressed the \"outer limit\" of legitimate governmental action or that is fairly viewed as so \"brutal\" and \"offensive to human dignity\" that it shocks the conscience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9013879\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/363/421/#p432\">\n    363 F.Supp.2d at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant Westling's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff's substantive due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
