(TAC 2.) Gould, Plaintiff's initial parole supervisor, informed Plaintiff of the conditions of his parole, which included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   a) curfew between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   b) no use of alcohol or [attendance] in an establishment of where alcohol is [the] main level of business;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   c) no fraternizing or being in the company of convicted felons/felony offenders;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   d) no travel outside of New York City (5 boroughs) and/or New York State;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   e) cannot operate a vehicle or have possession of a driver's license;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   f) cannot possess a firearm or sharp instrument that can be used and ruled as a weapon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) King subsequently replaced Gould as Plaintiff's parole supervisor, and informed Plaintiff that he remained subject to the same conditions of release. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) King also informed Plaintiff that the release conditions were imposed by Commissioner Annucci, who forwarded them to King's supervisor, McCleary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) In approximately March 2015, Urena replaced King as Plaintiff's parole supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In or about March or April 2015, Plaintiff was informed that he needed to submit a request to travel outside of New York City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In June 2015, Plaintiff requested permission to travel to Albany, New York, and Urena denied the request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff subsequently filed a complaint to Annucci and Evans. Gaynor, who replaced Urena, subsequently also denied the travel request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although his travel request was eventually granted in August of 2015, Plaintiff alleges that he has been stripped of his \"level three\" status in retaliation for his grievance complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result of his now \"level one\" status, Plaintiff must report to his parole officer every two weeks instead of once every two months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also claims that he has been \"forced\" by each parole supervisor to agree to the parole terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At some point, Plaintiff was also informed that, due to his felony conviction, he no longer has the right to vote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Procedural background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on the foregoing facts, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants, alleging violations of his rights under the First, Second, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) In every complaint, Plaintiff has alleged: (1) that the curfew and travel conditions violate the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause because (a) he is prohibited from praying at a mosque between 9:00 PM and 7:00 AM, and (b) he is prohibited from making a pilgrimage to Mecca, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3); (2) that the condition regarding contact with persons previously convicted of a felony violates his First Amendment right to free association because he is unable to associate with anyone unless he knows their criminal history, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); (3) that the firearm condition violates his Second Amendment right to bear arms, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5); and (4) that the travel restriction violates his fundamental right to travel under the Fourteenth Amendment and restricts his ability to \"strengthen[ ] ties with [his] friends and family, ....\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Through subsequent amendments, Plaintiff also alleged that the release conditions constitute: (5) double punishment for the same crime in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5); (6) cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eight Amendment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and (7) violation of due process and equal protection rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Although not directly related to the conditions of parole, Plaintiff has also consistently maintained that Defendants have violated his right to vote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the April 2015 Memorandum and Order, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's claims\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   and denied leave to amend, finding that \"Plaintiff has no protected liberty interest to be free from the special conditions of his parole and has otherwise failed to allege a constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Trisvan I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201966275\">\n    2015 WL 1966275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citations omitted). The Court also found that Plaintiff failed to \"allege[ ] any facts to suggest that the imposition of his special conditions of parole are arbitrary and capricious or that his parole conditions are not 'reasonably and necessarily related' to the Government's interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201966275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). On appeal, the Second Circuit remanded with instructions to allow Plaintiff to file a second amended complaint to show why the release conditions are not \" 'reasonably and necessarily related' to the state's interests in light of the conduct for which [Plaintiff] was convicted.\" (Order of USCA, Docket Entry No. 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following remand, in dismissing the Second Amended Complaint, the Court again found that Plaintiff \"fail[ed] to present ... any factual allegations regarding his crime of conviction and fail[ed] to allege that the release conditions are not reasonably and necessarily related to his crime of conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Trisvan II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207335609\">\n    2016 WL 7335609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The Court reiterated that\n   \"parolees are subject to 'restrictions not applicable to other citizens,' and a prisoner on parole enjoys only 'conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special parole restrictions.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207335609\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). Thus, Plaintiff's \"consistent[ ] assert[ions] that the release conditions are unconstitutional\" were insufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Nevertheless, in light of Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status, the Court granted leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. In so doing, the Court advised Plaintiff to \"\n   <em>\n    provide ... facts underlying his crime of conviction and explain why his release conditions are unreasonable or unnecessary in light of those facts.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Subsequently, Plaintiff filed the TAC, repeating his prior assertions that the release conditions violate multiple constitutional amendments. (TAC 5.) Plaintiff did not provide any facts underlying his crime of conviction or allegations as to why the release conditions were therefore unreasonable or unnecessary. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   TAC.) Instead, Plaintiff only added allegations that the restriction on alcohol consumption violates his rights under the Twenty-first Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also specified that his right to vote was infringed in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.

(Defs. TAC Mem. 2.) Rather than alleging that the release conditions are not reasonably and necessarily related to legitimate state interests in light of the crime and circumstances related to his conviction, Plaintiff again asserts that the restrictions are inherently unconstitutional and Defendants have violated the Constitution by enforcing them. (Pl. Opp'n to Evans TAC Mot. (\"Pl. Evans TAC Opp'n\") 2, Docket Entry No. 77 (\"It has been noted that Plaintiff's constitutional rights are not unfettered ... These rights were deemed by the framers ... as 'inalienable.' \").) Plaintiff continuously asserts in a conclusory manner that Defendants' proffered justifications such as the desire to \"deter ... future criminal acts are\" attempts to shield violations of his constitutional rights. (Pl. Opp'n to Defs. TAC Mot. (\"Pl. TAC Opp'n\") 2, Docket Entry No. 62; Pl. Evans TAC Opp'n 2.) In addition, Plaintiff also argues that he has \"served his time,\" and therefore may not be subject to any further supervision. (TAC 7;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (\"Defendants are attempting to keep Plaintiff under supervision for an additional time beyond which Plaintiff has already served.\").) Plaintiff further asserts that the restrictions are unnecessary because he has been a \"law abiding member of his community\" both before and after the conviction at issue.

Second, by claiming innocence, Plaintiff effectively asserts that the facts, as described in the habeas decision, are untrue except for those supporting his claim of innocence. By asserting an \"actual innocence\" claim in the habeas petition, Plaintiff argued that his confession was coerced, that the physical evidence was incompatible with his confession, that eyewitnesses had either recanted their testimony or were not credible and that his appointed counsel improperly refused to offer his alibi at trial.\n    <em>\n     Trisvan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20419685\">\n     2015 WL 419685\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5-6.

More importantly, even if the facts underlying his conviction were incorporated, Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    , based on those facts, the conditions are unreasonable or unnecessary. Instead, Plaintiff continues to assert that Constitutional rights cannot be abridged for any reason.

(TAC 6.) These conditions are not only common but also appear reasonably and necessarily related to legitimate state interests such as protecting the public and ensuring compliance with other parole requirements.
