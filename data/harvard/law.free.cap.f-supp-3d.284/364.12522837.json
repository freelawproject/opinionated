Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Three years after a guilty plea and sentencing, Petitioner Nekebwe Superville moves for a writ of habeas corpus or writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis,\n   </em>\n   and to vacate his conviction, claiming that his attorney misled him about the immigration consequences of his conviction. His application is denied on substantive and procedural grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Relying on recent precedent from the United States Supreme Court, Superville argues that incorrect advice from his attorney led him to believe that he would probably not be deported if he pled guilty, and that this advice induced him to plead guilty rather than stand trial.\n   <em>\n    Padilla v. Kentucky,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ;\n   <em>\n    Lee v. United States,\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605079\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1958/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605079\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1958/\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The record and contemporaneous documentation does not support this claim. Consistent with standard practice, a magistrate judge and a district judge warned Superville that he could face deportation if he were to plead guilty. The mandatory nature of his deportation appeared in the terms of his plea agreement, which the court finds was read by him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even if Superville's attorney advised him incorrectly, the immigration consequences of his plea were explained to him before he was sentenced on his plea of guilty. About his guilt of the crimes he was sentenced for, there is no doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court held an evidentiary hearing on this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Hearing Tr. (\"Hr'g Tr.\"), Feb. 14, 2018, Feb.16, 2018. Three witnesses testified: Howard Greenberg, Superville's former attorney, Phillis Superville, the petitioner's mother, and the petitioner, Nekebwe Superville. Superville and Greenberg gave conflicting accounts of the immigration advice that Superville received before deciding to plead guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court does not credit Superville's testimony in light of the contemporaneous record. He did not demonstrate that he would have stood trial rather than plead\n   guilty had he been more forcefully advised of the serious risk of deportation he faced. The evidence against him was overwhelming. If he was found guilty-as he almost certainly would have been-he faced a mandatory ten-year term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In reaching its conclusion, the court did not take into account the change in Department of Justice administration to increase deportation of criminals that occurred long after Superville pled guilty and the reality that this may have increased Superville's prospects of deportation after he was convicted. Both counsel agreed this was appropriate. Hr'g Tr. 147:20-148:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Cal. Apr. 18, 2011). This non-binding case is distinguishable. There the court's deportation warning was highly equivocal-\"it is at least\n   <em>\n    conceivable\n   </em>\n   ... that the guilty plea may lead to immediate deportation proceedings\"-and the attorney's advice was clear-\"his attorney informed him that even if he were deported, he would have a\n   <em>\n    strong argument\n   </em>\n   at canceling the deportation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (emphasis added). Superville, by contrast, was given three objective warnings, two by the court and one in his cooperation agreement. The number and strength of the warnings he received would have caused a duly diligent person to make a further inquiry into the possibility of deportation. In fact, he consulted two other attorneys on this point before his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Because Superville could have discovered his claim at the latest at his sentencing in October 2014 and his petition is brought more than a year after that time, it is untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The court takes no position on whether the advice given by Superville's criminal defense attorney, Howard Greenberg,\n   falls below an objective standard of reasonableness. Superville cannot claim prejudice under the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland.\n   </em>\n   He cannot show a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

The contemporaneous evidence leads this court to conclude that he did in fact know that there was a strong possibility of deportation when he pled guilty and that he cannot show that a stronger warning would have led him to stand trial. Even if the court credited the entirety of Superville's testimony, the result would remain unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Two judges informed Superville that his conviction would carry immigration consequences.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV(A). Both times he affirmed under oath that he understood this. It is this court's invariable practice, and the practice of magistrates in this district, to inform criminal defendants when pleading guilty that they could face deportation if they are not citizens. If this warning is to have meaning, courts must be able to rely on the fact that defendants take this warning seriously, and speak truthfully under oath when they acknowledge that they understand the immigration consequences of their plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   That is not to say that these warnings will be sufficient in all cases. In\n   <em>\n    Lee,\n   </em>\n   for example, the defendant received a warning from the district court prior to it accepting his plea. Upon receiving this warning, he responded \" 'I don't understand,' and turned to his attorney for advice ... [and] [o]nly when Lee's counsel assured him that the judge's statement was a 'standard warning' was Lee willing to proceed to plead guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1968. Contemporaneous evidence showing that the defendant did not understand the warning or was misled is necessary in most cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1967 (\"Courts should not upset a plea solely because of\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   assertions from a defendant about how he would have pleaded but for his attorney's deficiencies.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kovacs v.

Unlike the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Lee,\n   </em>\n   Superville affirmed under oath that he did understand consequences-without equivocation. The last time that Superville claims to have spoken to his attorney about immigration consequences is a few weeks before the plea hearing. Three times\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   that he learned that he could in fact be deported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Superville was facing a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence if he did not cooperate with the government and had been threatened by a codefendant. It is undisputed that Superville understood that he \"could\" be deported as a result of his guilty plea. Hr'g Tr. 134:20-23. While the extent of his understanding is not clear, that he did not hesitate to plead guilty after receiving judicial warnings significantly undercuts his claim that he would have stood trial rather than plead guilty and face a ten-year mandatory minimum and deportation. In\n   <em>\n    Lee,\n   </em>\n   by contrast, the Supreme Court characterized Lee's \"consequences of taking a chance at trial [as] not markedly harsher than pleading\" because it was only a \"year or two more of prison time\"; not a decade.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1968.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The court also notes, without deciding as an independent ground for denying the\n   motion, that there is a significant causation issue in this case. Superville was separately advised, apparently incorrectly, by an attorney specializing in immigration law. To the extent that he relied on this advice, it undercuts his argument that it was Greenberg's advice that induced him to plead guilty. It does not seem that the conduct of an attorney who has no role in the criminal case, under such circumstances that exist in this case, is cognizable under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Superville cannot show a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee v.
