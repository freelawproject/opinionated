Superior Court Proceedings Related to Provost\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2008, a jury returned a verdict finding that Provost was a sexually dangerous person. Docket # 12-1, at 30. Subsequently, Provost was committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center at Bridgewater (the \"MTC\") \"for an indeterminate period of a minimum of one day and a maximum of his natural life until discharged pursuant to the provisions of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A,] section 9.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278337\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/169/#p172\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On November 19, 2012, Provost filed a petition in the Hampden Superior Court for examination and discharge pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 123A, section 9.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. A jury trial was held in April 2016, which concluded on Friday, April 22, 2016, when the jury returned a verdict that Provost was no longer sexually dangerous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. There is a dispute about certain events that transpired after the jury's verdict. Plaintiff asserts that the superior court judge initially allowed his request for immediate release, but that the DOC objected and interfered by informing court officers that Provost had to return to the MTC until correct paperwork relating to Provost's intended residence was submitted to the Sex Offender Registry Board (\"SORB\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 13, at \u00b6\u00b6 29-35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket # 23-1, at \u00b6\u00b6 8-15. Provost had initially submitted to SORB the address of the Southampton Street Shelter as his intended address, but on the last day of trial, he provided DOC counsel with the address of the Boston Rescue Mission. Provost claims that the DOC informed his counsel that it \"needed Mr. Provost to remain incarcerated until they had submitted the 'correct' address of the Boston Rescue Mission in Boston to SORB.\" Docket # 23-1, at \u00b6 11. Defendants move to strike such assertions because, they contend, these statements are hearsay. In any event, it is undisputed that rather than ordering Provost to be immediately released, the superior court issued an Order of Discharge signed by the session clerk ordering Provost to be \"discharged from custody and released from the Massachusetts Treatment Center no later than the end of the business day on Monday April 25, 2016.\" Docket # 12-1, at 39. Provost was eventually released on April 25 at approximately noon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. State Proceedings Related to Pike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Around 2002, Pike was involuntarily civilly committed as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 123A, section 9, and he remains committed in the MTC. Like Provost, Pike filed a petition for examination and discharge, and his trial is scheduled to begin on November 4, 2019. Docket # 13, at \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    C. United States District Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 17, 2016, Provost filed his original complaint against defendants in this court. Docket # 1. After several assented-to motions for extension of time to respond, defendants moved for summary judgment on April 11, 2017. Docket # 10. On May 1, 2017, Provost filed an amended complaint, adding Jason Pike as a named plaintiff and clarifying that plaintiffs are\n   suing defendants Turco and O'Brien in their individual capacities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 13, at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. In response to plaintiffs' opposition to their motion for summary judgment, defendants moved to strike portions of plaintiffs' statement of undisputed facts and affidavit of Michael Ryan (the \"Ryan Affidavit\"), who was co-counsel for Provost in the state court proceeding. Docket # 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Specifically, they contend that Pike has failed to establish an injury in fact because his trial has yet to take place-it is currently scheduled for November 2019-and thus, he cannot establish that a jury will find him to be not sexually dangerous and that defendants will violate his rights. They also assert that this case is not ripe because \"Pike's claim relies on a chain of contingencies that may never come to pass,\" Docket # 32, at 8, including the fact that Pike may be found to be sexually dangerous and therefore, ineligible for release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I agree.
