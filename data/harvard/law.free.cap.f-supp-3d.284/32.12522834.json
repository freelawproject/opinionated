The Court grants CCWI's motion for a preliminary injunction because it will likely prevail on the merits, two of the other factors weigh in its favor, and the last, the public policy question, is in equipoise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

If the PY17 WIOA funds are not promptly made available, CCWI will be forced to cease all workforce training operations under WIOA by the end of January 2018, and CCWI's other independent funding will run out later in the year, forcing it to shut down completely by the end of June 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55; see also\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Inj.

The remaining twenty-five-percent comes from stand-alone grants which support programs that rely on the infrastructure funded by WIOA funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Last year, CCWI received 49,213 customer visits through the local CareerCenters and affiliate offices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Of those visits, 16,512 customers required additional workforce services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.

With some hesitancy, the Court ultimately concludes that Congress intended \u00a7 3242(e) and \u00a7 3249(g) to benefit a discrete class of beneficiaries, the designated local areas under state plans that receive the federal funds. The provisions confer a benefit \"for a local area.\" The provisions require prompt funding on a program year basis and specifies whom that benefit is \"for.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The Court's hesitancy is first based on the absence of any prior caselaw on the precise issue before the Court. Although the parties analogized the provisions of WIOA to other laws and vigorously disputed each other's analogies, the parties cited no cases interpreting the WIOA provisions central to the dispute in this case.\n    <em>\n     Defs.' 12(b)(6) Mot.\n    </em>\n    at 8 (\"[N]o reported decisions under WIOA address this precise issue\");\n    <em>\n     Pl.'s 12(b)(6) Opp'n\n    </em>\n    at 7 (\"Defendants' suggestion that 'no court has allowed a local workforce board to bring a \u00a7 1983 action against a state under WIOA or its predecessor statutes based upon the type of WIOA violation asserted here' is misleading, as it suggests that courts have addressed the question\"). This leaves the Court with a clean slate. Typically, where injunctive relief is sought, particularly as in this case against the head of the executive branch of state government, the federal court is not asked to blaze a new legal trail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Next, CCWI proclaims that it can do what it acknowledges the ultimate beneficiaries of the WIOA cannot do, sue the Governor and Commissioner for WIOA\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    funds. Section 3554(12) of title 29 reads: \"Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to provide an individual with an entitlement to a service under this subchapter.\" Under this language, if CCWI were without funds because the Governor withheld them, a dislocated worker who would benefit from WIOA funding to help secure \"access to and opportunities for the employment, education, training, and support services,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203101\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , is statutorily barred from suing the Governor to release the WIOA funds.

This anomalous result gives the Court pause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Analogizing the provisions of the WIOA to other statutes is imperfect because the structure of the Act and its specific provisions clash with the goals and language of other laws. Nevertheless, the Court looked for other cases where the ultimate beneficiaries of the statute differ from the entities directly affected by the law. Here, even though WIOA as a whole is focused on providing benefits to individuals in need of workforce training, not on the local entities overseeing that training, the text of the specific provisions at issue is focused on those entities that receive the funds from the federal government through the states.

The text simply requires that the funds \"shall be made available\" within the deadline and \"shall be available for obligation only the basis of a program year\" and thus \"speaks to\" entities that might block those funds, such as a governor, state agency, or federal agency. This suggests that Congress enacted \u00a7 3242(e) and \u00a7 3249(g) to confer individual benefits to the funding recipients and to restrict the ability of any relevant actor to interfere with that benefit after the Secretary approves the State Plan and the Governor approves the Local Plans and the Secretary allots the funds to the Governor.

The\n    <em>\n     Blessing\n    </em>\n    Court explained that if a statute only requires \"substantial compliance\" with the provision a plaintiff asserts, Congress must have anticipated some noncompliance, and thus did not intend to create a right.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651863\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/329/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The Court examined \u00a7 3242(e) and \u00a7 3249(g), and their other subsections, for language indicating Congress contemplated any level of noncompliance with the prompt allocation of funds on a program year basis. The statutory language contains no flexible standard or yardstick. The statutory requirement is binary.

WIOA, like the Medicaid statute, ultimately seeks to benefit the individual service seekers, rather\n    than the service providers, but both statutes contain provisions that further that larger goal by conferring benefits on certain types of providers in some circumstances.

Section 3244(b)(2) provides the local areas with an administrative appeal mechanism to the Secretary, but that process only applies to corrective actions and sanctions by the Governor, not at issue here. Section 3241(c) requires States and local areas establish a grievance process for individual \"participants and other interested or affected parties\" for violations of wage and labor standard requirements, and the Secretary must respond within 120 days. But this grievance process is for participants, not the local areas, whom WIOA tasks with setting up this grievance process. Additionally, this process has limited remedies, not suited to a conflict between a local areas and a state over these provisions. The Defendants argue that the Court should not provide relief to CCWI because it sent a letter to USDOL and initiated the 120 day grievance process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    But the Court cannot find, and the parties do not point to any provision creating an administrative grievance process for the benefit of the local areas, as opposed to the beneficiaries, based on violations of the right to the prompt allocation of funds on a program year basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    In short, the statute provides no clear alternate remedy for violations of the right to the prompt allocation of funds on a program year basis.

The Court will dismiss without prejudice so much of Plaintiff's Complaint as concerns WIOA funds for PY16. Of course, in light of the dismissal without prejudice, if the Court's faith in the state of Maine proves to have been misplaced, CCWI is free to reinitiate its claim for the PY16 funds.

Despite this, the Defendants argue that they have satisfied their legal obligations by offering to enter into a contract with CCWI provided that CCWI's budget complied with a new sixty-percent training requirement. CCWI argues that offering to make the funds available only if CCWI meets a new condition is not truly making the funds available as the statute requires, because they argue the Defendants had no authority to impose the new sixty-percent condition at this stage. Essentially, the parties offer two competing interpretations of the Governor's authority under WIOA at the stage when the statute instructs that the \"funds shall be made available ... within 30 days....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    The parties do not agree on the nature of the legal instrument the state of Maine uses to make money available to the local areas.

There is no procurement relationship. CCWI determines which service providers are eligible to receive the federal funds. CCWI has its performance measured in terms of the objectives laid out in the WIOA State and Local Plans. It has responsibility for programmatic decision-making and carries out the program for a public purpose. CCWI does not provide goods or services to the state in exchange for consideration. The Defendants' claim that CCWI has a typical contract relationship with the State is undermined by the federal regulations and by WIOA itself. The previous instruments between CCWI and MDOL were called \"Subrecipient Award Agreement[s]\" and explicitly refer to CCWI as the \"Subrecipient.\"\n    <em>\n     Joint Ex.\n    </em>\n    10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    The Court concludes that WIOA does not create a typical contractual relationship where the parties have the liberty to make any offer contingent upon any terms they might desire. An ordinary contract negotiation allows broad discretion on the offeror, but both the text of the statute and the federal regulations contemplate a relationship between CCWI and the State distinct from ordinary contract bargaining. Once all the other conditions for federal WIOA funding have been met, the state in effect becomes a pass-through of funds from the federal government to the local areas.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    Since the Court concludes the Defendants do not have unlimited authority to impose conditions on the WIOA funds at the subaward stage, the Court must determine whether the sixty-percent training requirement is within the limits of the State's authority at that stage. The OMB regulations do contemplate additional conditions imposed by a state at the subaward stage, but these are limited to financial and accounting measures.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20200.331\">\n     2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(3) (required information on subaward document includes \"[a]ny additional requirements that the pass-through entity imposes on the subrecipient in order for the pass-through entity to meet its own responsibility to the Federal awarding agency including identification of any required financial and performance reports\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20200.331\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 200.331(a)(5) (required information on subaward document includes \"[a]ppropriate terms and conditions concerning closeout of the subaward\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20200.331\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 200.338-39 (\"If a non-Federal entity fails to comply with Federal statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of a Federal award, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may impose additional conditions\" like \"[requiring payments as reimbursements rather than advance payments,\" or requiring additional, more detailed financial reports and monitoring, or the termination of the federal award).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    The Court draws two conclusions from these regulations. First, the specificity of what a state government may require of the local areas suggests what a state government may not require. In other words, there is no indication in these regulations that state governments, as pass-through entities, may impose new substantive conditions on the receipt of funds absent noncompliance with the regulations by the recipient. The state of Maine has not claimed that CCWI violated any of these regulations. Thus, there is no indication CCWI has ever failed to comply with any financial, accounting, or any other type of requirement\n    under WIOA or the federal regulations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    To be clear, the state of Maine has the express authority under the regulations to negotiate performance conditions with the local areas. At earlier stages, the statute expressly contemplates negotiation between the Governor and the local areas, but that negotiation occurs when the state adopts a state plan, and when the local areas submit local plans for state approval.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(B) (\"A State may identify in the State plan additional performance accountability indicators\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3141(c)(2) (\"The local board, the chief elected official, and the Governor shall negotiate and reach agreement on local levels of performance based on the State adjusted levels of performance\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3123(b)(17) (\"the local plan shall include ... a description of the local levels of performance negotiated with the Governor and chief elected official\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    At the late stage where a state passes a federal subaward through to a local area, however, the structure of WIOA eliminates the possibility of a state requiring additional performance metrics, because the Secretary must first approve any state performance requirements before the state and localities implement them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3141(b)(3)(iv)(I)-(II) (\"The State shall reach agreement with the Secretary ... on levels of performance for each indicator\" for each of the first two years of the state plan, and then again for any adjustments the State makes as a modification to the state plan for the third and fourth years);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20677.165\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7 677.165\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"States may identify additional indicators of performance for the six core programs.

There is no explicit percentage training requirement in the State Plan. Maine previously imposed a forty-percent training requirement but removed it from the 2016 State Plan.\n    <em>\n     See Defs.' Ex.\n    </em>\n    6. The Defendants argue that the remaining language in the 2016 State Plan authorizes it to impose the new sixty-percent training requirement. In particular, the Defendants point to the following language in the State Plan:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n    While we still feel it is important to set a goal, we now know that the specific amounts to be set may have to differ from one local area to another depending upon the differences in infrastructure costs and percentage of harder to serve customers involved ... We now feel the best policy is to work with local areas to establish service spending goals ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20677.165\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    The Court cannot conclude this language authorizes the state to impose a sixty-percent training requirement at the subaward stage. The language refers to setting different levels of performance for different local areas, not another flat percentage requirement. The language refers to setting \"goals\" rather than another \"requirement\" or \"condition.\" The new precatory language in the State Plan contemplates nonbinding targets, rather than the old mandatory forty-percent requirement. The language Defendants cite is under the heading \"Policies to be rescinded.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20677.165\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Perhaps most importantly, it is difficult to imagine the public, the local areas, or the Secretary would have understood this language as authorizing a sixty-percent requirement when the language revoked the\n    old forty-percent requirement. Language repealing a more lax performance requirement would not logically authorize the imposition of a more demanding one.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    The Court concludes that the State Plan does not mandate the sixty-percent training requirement. The State Board's recent vote rejecting the sixty-percent spending requirement for the next round of planning further bolsters the Court's conclusion. As a result, the Defendants had no legal power under WIOA or the OMB regulations to place the sixty-percent condition upon the availability of the funds for the local areas at this stage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    Accordingly, the Court finds that CCWI is likely to prevail on the merits as to the PY17 funds, because it likely will be able to establish that the Defendants violated CCWI's right to the prompt allocation of funds, which is enforceable through \u00a7 1983.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Potential for Irreparable Harm to the Movant\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    CCWI has made a strong showing that it will suffer irreparable harm if the Court does not issue an injunction. Mr. Bourret testified about CCWI's heavy reliance on the WIOA funds, which the Defendants do not deny. WIOA funds represent seventy-five percent of CCWI's entire PY17 funding stream. The remainder of its revenue consists of other grants which are contingent on the infrastructure and systems CCWI maintains with the WIOA funds. As a result, without gaining access to the PY17 funds before June 2018, Mr. Bourret testified that CCWI will be required to shut down entirely at that point. Without access to the funds, even before June, 2018, Mr. Bourret testified that CCWI will be required to curtail its activities, and he was concerned that its service provider might be required to close as early as the end of January, 2018. Once they shut their doors, Mr. Bourret predicted that CCWI and its provider will not easily be able to reopen.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    Mr. Bourret asserted that CCWI's survival as an entity depends on access to WIOA funds on the terms and in a time frame that federal law specifies and only on the conditions contained in the State and Local Plans or contemplated by federal cash management regulations. An imminent threat to the movant's survival constitutes irreparable harm.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Condon v.

The Balance of the Relevant Impositions\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    The Court must balance the potential harm or burden on CCWI from withholding an injunction against the burden on the Defendants from issuing an injunction. The Court has already discussed the implications to CCWI if its request for an injunction is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Turning then to the imposition on the state of Maine, one concern that would make CCWI's claim more tenuous would be if CCWI were demanding funds from the state of Maine's fisc. If so, its lawsuit would have Eleventh Amendment implications. The Eleventh Amendment provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n    The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or\n    by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    U.S. CONST. amend.

Based on the record before it, if the Court issues an injunction, there would be little, if any, burden on the state treasury, since the federal funds pass-through the state on their way to the local areas.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    Accordingly, the balance of the equities tips in favor of CCWI.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    <strong>\n     D. The Effect of the Ruling on the Public Interest\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    In the context of this case, balancing the public interest is difficult, because it requires assessing CCWI's need for the funds, the value of the tiered bureaucratic structure that WIOA imposes, the role of state government in the dispersal of federal funds, and the practical inability of state government to object on policy grounds to federal law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    On its side of the ledger, CCWI has made a convincing showing that the injunction it seeks is in the public interest. The Defendants have not suggested that the underlying goals of WIOA are not laudable. As noted earlier, the stated purposes of WIOA include \"increas[ing] ... access to and opportunities for the employment, education, training, and support services\" and the \"alignment of workforce investment, education, and economic development systems in support of a comprehensive, accessible, and high-quality workforce\n    development system ....\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203101\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Although the Defendants are concerned about CCWI's efficiency in using the money for direct services, the Defendants do not dispute CCWI's overall allegation that it uses the approximately $3,000,000 in WIOA funds to directly or indirectly help dislocated workers, low income adults, and young adults with barriers to employment throughout the Coastal Counties Region.\n    <em>\n     Compl.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 28.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    Congress expressed its intent to give the local areas control of the funds, subject to prior negotiations with the Governor, State Board, and the Secretary at the State and Local Plan stage of the process. There is a public interest to see that the congressional intent is fulfilled and that the local and state actors comply with federal law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    The State Plan also suggests the injunction CCWI seeks is in the public interest. The State Plan is the end result of a public process of meetings, planning, and approvals among citizens, the local areas, the State Board, the Governor, and the Secretary. The State Plan indicated that the previous forty-percent training requirement \"negatively impacted staff-assisted services\" in some of the local areas.\n    <em>\n     Defs.' Ex.\n    </em>\n    6\n    <em>\n     State of Maine 2016-2020 Unified Plan\n    </em>\n    , at 2. It also said, \"Most importantly when we reviewed the percentage of participants enrolled in formal training before imposing the spending requirement and numbers didn't change, regardless of the amount spent ... We did find that the cost per participant went up significantly with the requirement.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    As a result of these concerns, the current State Plan repealed the previous forty-percent training requirement and the State Board recently voted not to include the sixty-percent requirement in the next State Plan. CCWI posits that there is a public interest to vindicate the process WIOA outlines for setting performance measures, and to uphold the negotiated choices that all the relevant actors made during the last two successive planning stages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    In response, however, the Defendants-just as CCWI-justify their position on the basis of an overriding public interest. This decision has described the tiered, highly bureaucratic system under WIOA for the distribution of federal job training funds. As Mr. Bourret conceded, CCWI does not itself provide any direct services to job seekers. Instead, it contracts with Goodwill Industries of Northern New England through Workforce Solutions, the service provider, which in turn provides direct services.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    Furthermore, Mr. Bourret testified that state government has no direct control over CCWI's budget. Instead, CCWI's local board controls its budget. Mr. Bourret testified that the local board consists of 51% local employers as well as representatives of adult education, the community college system, the Job Corps, and the AFL-CIO. It also has what is termed a Chief Elected Official (CEO), in this case an elected County Commissioner, as a member of the Board.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    As noted, WIOA also creates a state board, the SWDB. The SWDB is free to agree or disagree with the state's governor. Thus, on December 1, 2017, according to Mr. Bourret and Commissioner Crosby, the SWDB voted to reject MDOL's request that it commit to spending at least 60% of its budget to direct training as opposed to administrative costs, such as salaries, and infrastructure, such as leases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    This layered approach to job training comes at a cost. Although Mr. Bourret certainly believes that CCWI's oversight function adds value to WIOA's job training program, he conceded that he draws an annual salary of $97,000 and receives benefits\n    equaling an additional $27,000 for an annual total of $124,000. If his salary package is duplicated in the other two regional local area organizations, the chief administrators receive $372,000 in salaries, which under a less bureaucratic system could directly assist people seeking work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    One reflection of the possible inefficiency of multiple local areas is the relatively small percentage of WIOA funds actually spent on direct training. Mr. Bourret testified that in general one-third of CCWI's budget is spent on staff, one-third on infrastructure, and one-third on direct training. As noted earlier, the 2012 State Plan called for 40% of the funds to be spent on direct training.\n    <em>\n     Pl.'s Ex.\n    </em>\n    12\n    <em>\n     Workforce Investment Act, Strategic Plan 2012-2016\n    </em>\n    , at 8 (\"The goal is to move the Training Expenditure statewide average up to 30% in PY13 and then to 40% by PY14. In PY 14 each LWIB [Local Workforce Investment Board] will be asked to meet or exceed the 40% goal\"). Mr. Bourret testified that the 2012-2016 State Plan put pressure on the local boards to reach this goal, and although CCWI was concerned about whether it could meet the goal and objected to the 40% provision, it was overruled. In the end, Mr. Bourret stated that CCWI's budget dedicated 38% to direct training.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    During his testimony, Mr. Bourret discussed the fact that the 40% direct training requirement did not survive into the 2016 State Plan, and that the current State Plan contains no specific requirement as to the percentage of the local areas' budgets that must go to direct training. Even though the 2016 version of the State Plan sought to justify the elimination of even the 40% goal for direct services, Governor LePage is apparently not convinced and maintains the view that the local areas, including CCWI, should spend a higher percentage of their funds for direct services. The Governor's concerns have been met with resistance from the local boards, particularly from CCWI.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    On its face, a job training organization that spends only about 30% of job training funds on actual job training is not a model of efficiency, especially since the organization has purely an oversight function, does no direct job training, and contracts out what Mr. Bourret described as the \"boots on the ground\" work to a service provider. Mr. Bourret testified that CCWI receives approximately $3,000,000 in WIOA funds and, using the 30% figure, only about $900,000 of that money goes to direct services with about $2,100,000 going to salaries and infrastructure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    One can sympathize with the Defendants' view that there must be a more efficient way to get training funds to the people in need. CCWI properly stressed the dire consequences flowing from the Governor's withholding training funds. At the same time, it may be a fair point that WIOA's structure weaves into the provision of training services unusually high administrative and infrastructure costs, annually diverting millions of dollars that could be used to assist people. On these policy issues, both CCWI and the Defendants make legitimate points.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    Even though CCWI emphasized the tripartite structure of WIOA, consisting of the federal government, the state government, and the local area organizations, the plain fact is that under CCWI's view of WIOA, state government is by far the weakest among the three. The Court already mentioned the SWDB's vote to reject the Governor's demand that the local areas spend 60% of WIOA funds on direct services. In addition, when Governor LePage sought to meet with CCWI's board on September 26, 2017, Charles Crosby, the President of the CCWI Board and a County Commissioner for Sagadahoc County, testified that he refused to attend\n    the meeting unless it was publicly noticed and unless CCWI staff were allowed to attend.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    In fact, Commissioner Crosby did not attend the scheduled meeting with the Governor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    Theoretically, the Governor has some influence over the contents of the State Plan, which must be resubmitted every four years to the United States Secretary of Labor for approval.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203112\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), (c). But WIOA and its regulations contain mandates about the development of the State Plan, which entities must be allowed to participate, and the process that the state of Maine must follow in developing its quadrennial version of the State Plan.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20676.105\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.105\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1)-(3)(i)-(vi). For example, federal regulations require \"an opportunity for public comment on and input into the development of the Unified State Plan prior to its submission.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20676.130\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d). The regulations specify exactly who must be allowed to comment:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n    The opportunity for public comment must include an opportunity for comment by representatives of Local WDBs and chief elected officials, businesses, representatives of labor organizations, community-based organizations, adult education providers, institutions of higher education, other stakeholders with an interest in the services provided by the six core programs, and the general public, including individuals with disabilities.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20676.130\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    As outlined above, WIOA gives state government a number of roles in its implementation, including audit and compliance functions, decertification authority, and the ability to negotiate standards, and influence the contents of the State Plan. But none of the contemplated powers of state government under WIOA gives state government the authority to effect a significant policy change in WIOA itself. Thus, not surprisingly, the federal government retains federal authority over a federal law it funds with federal money.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    The same unequal authority under WIOA characterizes the state government's relationship with the federal government. Mr. Bourret stated that in 2012, the Maine State Plan originally called for the elimination of local boards, but the United States Department of Labor rejected Maine's proposal and told the state of Maine that it had to deal with the local boards. On July 17, 2017, Governor LePage wrote United States Secretary of Labor R. Alexander Acosta, requesting that Maine be granted \"single State local area designation\" under WIOA.\n    <em>\n     Joint Ex.\n    </em>\n    1\n    <em>\n     Letter from Governor Paul R. LePage to The Hon. R. Alexander Acosta, Sec. of Labor\n    </em>\n    (Jul 11, 2017). On August 30, 2017, Deputy Secretary Byron Zuidema responded to Governor LePage, rejecting his request:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n    Unfortunately, we are unable to approve your request. WIOA Sec. 189(j)(3)(A)(i) explicitly prohibits the Secretary from waiving any statutory or regulatory requirements relating to the establishment and function of local areas and/or allocation of funds to local areas. Additionally, 20 CFR [\u00a7] 679.270(a) provides that only \"[the] Governor of any State that was a single-State local area under the WIA as in effect on July 1, 2013 may designate the State as a single-State local area under the WIA as in effect on\n    July 1, 2013 may designate the State as a single-State local area under the WIOA.\" There are currently no statutory or regulatory procedures for a State with multiple local workforce development areas to become a single-area State.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    <em>\n     Joint Ex.\n    </em>\n    2\n    <em>\n     Letter from Deputy Assistant Sec. Byron Zuidema to The Hon. Paul R. LePage\n    </em>\n    (Aug. 30, 2017). The record therefore reveals that under current state of things, the governor and state government are virtually impotent in their ability to influence significant policy changes with either the federal government or the local areas under WIOA.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    In describing the policy interests involved here, the Court is not called on to judge and does not decide who is right. The money is, after all, federal money, and if Congress wishes to make a layered bureaucracy the price of the receipt of training funds, it has the legal right to do so. It may be that WIOA's current scheme is a better way to obtain the benefit of local control, and to respond to the idiosyncrasies of local labor markets while at the same time balancing the need for national uniformity under a federal statute, and infusing a very modest degree of control from state government. It may be that Governor LePage's preference for lower administrative costs and a higher percentage of direct services to people in need would be a more effective way to deliver more services to the people WIOA was enacted to assist.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    The Court cannot and does not resolve this policy debate. CCWI sees its administrative oversight function as a local area as valuable and essential to the proper delivery of WIOA services to people in need of training services; the Governor sees CCWI as a wasteful and inefficient bureaucratic intermediary between the federal and state governments and the people in need of training services; the Court sees their policy dispute as in equipoise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    <strong>\n     E. The Statute, Timing and the Moral High Ground\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    The Court concludes that three of the factors weigh in favor of issuing the injunction and the last is evenly balanced. The Court ends with a few points. The statute demands the relief CCWI is requesting. The statutory language is mandatory and clear: the funds a governor is required to allot to the local area \"shall be made available ... for a local area not later than 30 days after the date the funds are made available\" to the governor \"or 7 days after the date the local plan for the area is approved, whichever is later.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203242\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e). Once the process reaches the point where the federal government is ready to transfer WIOA funds to the state, the state operates merely as a pass-through and must, as the statute says, make those funds available to the local area \"not later than 30 days after the date the funds are made available to the Governor ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    Another issue is timing. To the extent the Governor has the ability to effect a significant change in the way the local areas in Maine operate under WIOA, his efforts at reform cannot be at the moment the funds are to be released.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    Thirdly, the Court does not perceive either CCWI or the state officials as occupying a higher moral ground in this case. CCWI, in particular, occasionally allowed a degree of rhetorical smugness to creep\n    into its argument, painting itself as championing the best interests of its customers against the unreasoned objections of state government. To be clear, the Court is agnostic as to whether the current WIOA model is a better approach or whether a more flexible, centralized model would result in more money being spent for people in need of training. The Court does not blame CCWI for filing this lawsuit to obtain its allocated WIOA funding nor does it blame Governor Paul LePage and Commissioner John Butera for seeking to make CCWI and the other local areas more accountable, efficient and effective.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    In addition, cognizant of the importance of judicial restraint, the Court is extremely reluctant to enjoin the duly elected Governor and a duly appointed State Commissioner to act, when they have chosen not to do so. The Court is conscious that its injunction runs not only against a co-equal branch of government but against a separate sovereign. The Court is exercising its authority to mandate state compliance with a federal statute because in this case the statute clearly demands it and the required action is confined and readily achievable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    Finally, although it is clear that an injunction should issue, the Court is not clear what language would be appropriate for the injunction. This is because of the rather arcane way the WIOA funds are transferred from Washington, D.C. through Augusta, Maine to Brunswick, Maine, and the Court's uncertainty about when the funds are to be transferred. Mr. Bourret explained a rather complicated process by which the WIOA funds are made available, and counsel for CCWI echoed the complexity in his closing remarks. It is the Court's intention to order the Defendants to make the PY17 funds available to CCWI in the ordinary course. It may be that a simple order, requiring the Defendants to release the funds would be appropriate, but a simple order may be too simple, and would require the Defendants to release funds before they would ordinarily be released. The Court will give the attorneys for both CCWI and the Defendants seven days from the date of this opinion to consult and propose to the Court acceptable language to be contained in the injunction. If the parties are unable to agree on proper language, the Court will resolve their disagreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    <strong>\n     V. FINAL INJUNCTION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    Prompted by CCWI's urgent requests for relief and dire predictions of serious consequences, the Court has driven this case through the system with unusual speed without the standard discovery period. Counsel cooperated and supplied some discovery to the opposing party/parties. However, during the December 18, 2017 hearing, the Court discussed with the parties, the Defendants in particular, what additional discovery they would need in order to fully litigate this case to a permanent injunction and to allow for appeal. The Court charged counsel, especially counsel for the Defendants, with considering what additional discovery was truly necessary after the issuance of this order. To give counsel an opportunity to digest this opinion and to propose what should happen next, the Court will grant the parties' counsel the same seven days from the date of this decision to notify the Court as to next steps.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    <strong>\n     VI. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    The Court DENIES Defendants Paul R. LePage and John Butera's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 17). The Court DENIES in part and GRANTS in part Plaintiff Coastal Counties Workforce, Inc.'s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 16). The Court DISMISSES without prejudice so\n    much of Coastal Counties Workforce, Inc.'s motion for preliminary injunction as applies to PY16 funds. The Court GRANTS Coastal Counties Workforce, Inc.'s motion for preliminary injunction as it applies to PY17 funds. The Court DEFERS issuance of the injunction on the PY17 funds in order to give counsel an opportunity to consult and propose specific language.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-246\">\n     This conclusion is based on the record before the Court. There is no indication in the parties' filings that any state funds are involved in WIOA.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-247\">\n     The Court takes no position on whether Commissioner Crosby is correct in his interpretation of Maine's Freedom of Access Act, 1 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 401\n     <em>\n      et seq.\n     </em>\n     The Court views Commissioner Crosby's refusal to meet with the sitting Maine Governor to discuss the Governor's concerns about CCWI's use of public money as a direct reflection of the relative lack of power residing with state government under WIOA.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-248\">\n     Two of the other local area organizations compromised with the Governor and accepted his demand that 60% of their budget go directly to customer services. However, their acquiescence was before the issuance of this Order, which confirms greater legal authority in the local area organizations than they might have surmised.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
