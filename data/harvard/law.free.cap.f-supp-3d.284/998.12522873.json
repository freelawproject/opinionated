WESTMORE, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 13, 2017, Plaintiff Elizabeth White (aka Curry) filed this case against\n   Defendants Angela Wright, Melanie Levorsen, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (\"VA\"). (Compl., Dkt. No. 1.) Plaintiff alleges that the VA has wrongfully offset her retirement payments in order to pay for a debt that Plaintiff asserts she is not responsible for. (Compl. at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 20, 2017, Defendants moved to dismiss the case because: (1) the Court lacks jurisdiction per the Veterans' Judicial Review Act of 1988 (\"VJRA\"), (2) Plaintiff's claims are barred by sovereign immunity; and (3) Plaintiff fails to state a claim. (Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 2, Dkt. No. 16.) Upon consideration of the parties' filings, as well as the arguments presented at the February 1, 2018 hearing, and for the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In her complaint, Plaintiff asserts that since 2014, the VA has been offsetting her retirement payments in order to collect on a \"false 'debt.' \" (Compl. at 4.) Based on documents attached to Plaintiff's complaint, it appears that Plaintiff was a fiduciary payee for the VA benefits of her brother, Clifford E. Curry, a disabled veteran. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 22.) The VA found that Plaintiff used $25,000 of Mr. Curry's benefits to purchase a condominium, when Mr. Curry did not have the mental capacity to give $25,000 in benefits to her. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 14-15, 23.) To recoup the $25,000, the VA has been taking a monthly offset of 25% from Plaintiff's federal retirement benefits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 9.) Plaintiff, however, disputes that she is responsible for the $25,000 debt, and asserts that her brother had falsified information to the VA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 20, 2017, Defendants moved for dismissal of Plaintiff's complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). (Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 1.) Primarily, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims are barred by the VJRA, \"a comprehensive remedial scheme created by Congress, [which] bars any action that concerns the provision of veterans benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 4, 2018, Plaintiff filed her opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Plf.'s Opp'n, Dkt. No. 22.) In her opposition, Plaintiff asserted that around April 2009, she had informed the VA that she was no longer Mr. Curry's fiduciary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) In 2014, Plaintiff was informed that money would be taken from her retirement check to pay a debt to the VA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Plaintiff asserts that Ms. Karen Nall, \"the director of the Fiduciary at the VA,\" informed her that on April 6, 2009, someone purporting to be Plaintiff had sent a fax to the VA, stating that Plaintiff had put a $25,000 down payment on a condo for Mr. Curry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff denied sending the fax or making a $25,000 down payment. Plaintiff further states that in January or February 2017, a Ms. Coralee told her that the debt had been removed and was now assigned to Mr. Curry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The monthly offset, however, has not been removed, and is still collected from her retirement check. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Plaintiff states that thus far, $9,591.96 has been improperly collected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response to Defendants' legal arguments, Plaintiff argued\n   that her claim is based on the Treasury Offset Program, that the Little Tucker Act provides concurrent jurisdiction for her claim, and that the VJRA does not apply because her claim does not concern veteran's benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 12, 2018, Defendants filed their reply brief. (Defs.' Reply, Dkt. No. 23.) Defendants disputed that the Treasury Offset Program establishes jurisdiction, or that the Little Tucker Act applies in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Finally, Defendants again asserted that the VJRA applies because \"[t]he VA's decision that plaintiff misused her brother's benefits and therefore owed a fiduciary debt to the government falls within this exclusive remedial scheme.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Defendants also provide a declaration by Mr. Michael Crouse, a VA Assistant Director, which includes an April 6, 2009 fax that appears to be from Plaintiff, stating that Plaintiff was putting down $25,000 on a place for her to live so that Mr. Curry could have her condo. (Crouse Decl., Exh. A, Dkt. No. 23-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Like\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , the district court found that the \"claims of theft and mismanagement of funds by his appointed fiduciary are also governed by the VJRA because they fall within the confines of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206106\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 6107, which govern the misuse of veteran benefits by an appointed fiduciary and the failure of the VA Secretary to investigate or monitor a fiduciary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206106\">\n    at *9-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction under the VJRA, and dismissed the case without leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the instant case, Plaintiff's claims concerns not just any debt, but a debt that was purportedly incurred when she was acting as a fiduciary responsible for her brother's veteran's benefits. Thus, Plaintiff is essentially challenging the actions of the VA in supervising her use of her brother's benefits when acting as his fiduciary. Again, \u00a7 5502 gives the Secretary authority to supervise the actions of a fiduciary, and Courts have found such actions to be a matter affecting benefits under the VJRA. Additionally, while Plaintiff argues that she is not responsible for the $25,000 down payment for a condo, this goes to whether she misused the benefits, an act that is under the supervision of the VA per\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206106\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 6106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This supervision, in turn, has been found by courts to fall within the purview of the VJRA, such that the district courts lack jurisdiction to review the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court acknowledges that the instant case is unique, in that Plaintiff herself is not the veteran, but was the fiduciary. Plaintiff does not point to any authority that the VJRA applies only to claims brought by veterans, however, and indeed, there are cases outside of this Circuit in which courts have found claims brought by non-veterans to be encompassed by the VJRA. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh\n   Circuit found that claims brought by a veteran's wife and daughter (the veteran's former fiduciary) were properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under the VJRA because \"[t]he complaint here is really a challenge to a federal fiduciary appointment and to veteran benefits distribution.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341851\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1117/#p1121\">\n    774 F.3d at 1118, 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Outside of the fiduciary context, the Federal Circuit has found that a case challenging the termination of an attorney's accreditation to represent claimants before the VA fell within the purview of the VJRA.\n   <em>\n    Bates v. Nicholson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9033720,3001956\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/398/1355/\">\n    398 F.3d 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1357 (2005). Thus, the key question is not whether the plaintiff is a veteran or not, but whether the claim concerns a \" 'decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the provision of veterans' benefits.' \"\n   <em>\n    Veterans for Common Sense\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872768\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1013/#p1020\">\n    678 F.3d at 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20511\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), internal modification omitted). Again, \"[t]his preclusion extends not only to cases where adjudicating veterans' claims requires the district court to determine whether the VA acted properly in handling a veteran's request for benefits, but also to\n   <em>\n    those decisions that may affect\n   </em>\n   such cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20511\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Such is the case here, where Plaintiff's claims directly concern whether the VA properly supervised Plaintiff's use of her brother's veteran's benefits while she was acting as a fiduciary, a supervisory power that has been held to be a matter affecting benefits under the VJRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that because Plaintiff's claims concern VA benefits proceedings, the Court lacks jurisdiction over this case. Because the Court lacks jurisdiction, it need not address whether Plaintiff can assert claims under the Treasury Offset Program or the Little Tucker Act because even if she could, the Court would be precluded from reviewing such claims under the VJRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to dismiss. Because dismissal is based on lack of jurisdiction, the Court dismisses without leave to amend.
