Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Haynishes allege the following facts, which the Court must accept as true. The Haynishes owned and lived in a house at 885 Heatherwood Estates Drive in Hollister, California. In 2005, they refinanced an earlier home loan and executed a first-lien deed of trust and promissory note. Dkt. No. 24 at 4. Bank of America became the Haynishes' loan servicer in late 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Haynishes suffered a financial hardship in 2011 and set out to obtain a loan modification from Bank of America.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. This set off a \"frustrating process, where...[the Haynishes] were forced to submit and resubmit countless documents to [Bank of America] to no avail.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2015, four Bank of America employees told the Haynishes that their loan modification application was about to be approved. These employees-named Daniel Gonzalez, David Warner, Jacqueline, and Adriana Rodriguez-nonetheless asked the Haynishes to \"resubmit the same documents over and over again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Haynishes experienced another economic setback around January 2015, as their monthly income declined from about $10,000 to $8,800. The Haynishes sent Bank of America paystubs to document their decreased earnings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In April 2015, a Bank of America employee named Shandra told the Haynishes that their loan modification application was complete and under review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bank of America then sent the Haynishes a letter saying the opposite: the application would not be reviewed for failure to submit requested documents.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 6. The Haynishes spoke to yet another Bank of America employee, John Mayes, who reassured them that the letter had been sent in error.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, Bank of America then mailed the Haynishes another request for documents. In July, Bank of America confirmed receiving a complete loan modification application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bank of America caused a notice of trustee's sale to be recorded against the Haynishes' home on July 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trustee's sale was scheduled for August 4, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In mid-July 2015, SPS took over for Bank of America as the servicer on the Haynishes' loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. SPS told the Haynishes that \"[i]f you were working with your prior servicer on a potential modification ... SPS will work with you to continue this process with minimal disruption.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   SPS requested more documents from the Haynishes, which they provided. August 4 came and went, leading the Haynishes to believe that SPS had cancelled the scheduled trustee's sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Yet on September 17, 2015, SPS and Bank of New York caused the Haynishes' house to be sold at a trustee's sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bank of New York purchased the property, and the Haynishes left their home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

AA, BB, EE, FF, the Haynishes commenced this action in early 2017. Dkt. No. 1. All three defendants moved to dismiss, Dkt. Nos. 11, 15, and the Haynishes filed a first amended complaint, Dkt. No. 24. The FAC asserted four claims: violations of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights (\"HBOR\"), specifically its ban on \"dual-tracking\" loan modification applications, California Civil Code \u00a7 2923.6\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; wrongful foreclosure; negligence; and violations of California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7 17200 (\"Unfair Competition Law\" or \"UCL\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   All three defendants moved to dismiss the FAC for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Dkt. Nos. 27, 29. All defendants also filed requests for judicial notice, Dkt. Nos. 28, 31, while SPS and Bank of New York moved to strike portions of the FAC under Rule 12(f), Dkt. No. 30. The court held a hearing on September 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the claims asserted in the complaint. \"Dismissal can be based on the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.\"\n   <em>\n    Balistreri v.

To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege sufficient facts to state a claim for relief that is facially plausible.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). In considering a motion to dismiss, a court accepts all of the plaintiff's factual allegations as true and construes the pleadings in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552352\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1025/#p1031\">\n    519 F.3d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1031 (9th Cir. 2008). However, the court will not \"assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they are cast in the form of factual allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Fayer v.

When dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim, a court should grant leave to amend unless amendment would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaset v. Fleer/Skybox Int'l, LP,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11425899\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/1083/#p1087\">\n    300 F.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1087-88 (9th Cir. 2002)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Requests for Judicial Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition to the motions to dismiss and motion to strike, all three defendants ask the Court to take judicial notice of various documents. A court generally may not consider matters outside the pleadings without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. There is an exception, however, for facts that are \"capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned, as well as matters of public record.\"\n   <em>\n    Roca v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-02147-KAW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20368153\">\n    2016 WL 368153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) ). A court may also take judicial notice of documents that are \"incorporated by reference\" into\n   the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knievel v. ESPN\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9174169\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/1068/#p1076\">\n    393 F.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1076 (9th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Bank of America requests that the Court take judicial notice of 32 exhibits, comprising two categories of documents. The first category, Exhibits A through Z, includes the 2005 deed of trust, documents detailing the chain of title, and the September 2015 trustee's deed of sale. The Court takes judicial notice of these documents as they are public records of the County Recorder's Office, and because they are referenced and relied upon by the FAC and the parties do not dispute their authenticity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The second category of documents, Exhibits AA-FF, come from prior state court litigation between the defendants and the Haynishes. In this latter category, the Haynishes object to the Court taking notice of Exhibit DD, a declaration signed by an SPS employee. In it, the employee avers that between 2012 and 2015, Bank of America issued four letters indicating that the Haynishes were not eligible for a loan modification. BofA RFJ Ex. DD. The four letters are attached to the declaration. Bank of America says the letters are relevant because the Haynishes' HBOR claim may fail if the bank rejected loan modification applications prior to the July 1 notice of trustee's sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Haynishes argue that Exhibit DD is not judicially noticeable, as its contents are subject to reasonable dispute. Dkt. No. 33 at 4. Yet the Haynishes did not deny, in their motion papers or at the hearing, that Bank of America repeatedly denied their loan modification applications. Instead, the Haynishes argued that they adequately alleged experiencing a material change in income since the earlier modification denials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Bank of America, for its part, says it offers the exhibit not \"for the truth of its contents\" but to describe the nature and existence of the prior proceedings. Dkt. No. 37 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A court may take judicial notice of matters of public record but a court may not take judicial notice of \"disputed facts stated in public records.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100379\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/668/#p690\">\n    250 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690 (9th Cir. 2001). A court may also take judicial notice of documents that are incorporated by reference into the complaint if \"the plaintiff's claim depends on the contents of a document, the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss, and the parties do not dispute the authenticity of the document, even though the plaintiff does not explicitly allege the contents of that document in the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Morton v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-05833-HRL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207117041\">\n    2016 WL 7117041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (citations omitted). This latter exception to the general rule aims to prevent \"plaintiffs from surviving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion by deliberately omitting references to documents upon which their claims are based[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Parrino v. FHP, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11815195\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/699/#p706\">\n    146 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (9th Cir. 1998),\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abrego Abrego v. Dow Chem. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046402\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/676/#p681\">\n    443 F.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681-82 (9th Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Bank of America's argument that Exhibit DD is offered merely to show the existence of prior proceedings is not well taken. Bank of America is offering Exhibit DD to show that it considered and denied the Haynishes' loan modification applications prior to the notice of trustee's sale. The Haynishes' argument is similarly unpersuasive, as they do not actually contest the accuracy of Exhibit DD's contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court is satisfied that it can take judicial notice of Exhibit DD-including the four loan modification denial letters-without turning this motion into one for summary judgment. The Haynishes' dual-tracking claim against Bank of America depends on whether they were considered for a loan modification, and they do not deny the authenticity of the records. The Court therefore will take judicial notice of Exhibit DD, along with Exhibits AA-CC, EE, and FF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   SPS and Bank of New York also ask the Court to take judicial notice of documents. One category of documents, including notices of default and notices of trustee's sale, concern the Haynishes' loan. The remaining documents come from earlier litigation between the Haynishes and the defendants. The Haynishes did not object to SPS and Bank of New York's request for judicial notice. The Court grants SPS and Bank of New York's request for judicial notice. All of the documents are noticeable either as public records or documents incorporated by reference into the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Dkt. No. 24 at 8-9. Bank of America makes two arguments for why the claim should be dismissed. First, Bank of America says it was exempted from having to review to review any more loan modification applications from the Haynishes. No. 27 at 5-7. Second, the Haynishes failed to plead a material HBOR violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046402\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/676/#p681\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   HBOR prohibits dual-tracking, i.e., advancing the foreclosure process while a borrower's loan modification application is under review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202923.6\">\n    Cal.

DD. Therefore, in the absence of a material change in Haynishes' financial circumstances, Bank of America was not obligated to consider any additional applications. The Haynishes, however, insist that they did allege a material change in financial circumstances: the January 2015 decrease in monthly income. Dkt. No. 24 at 5-6. They argue that \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   change in a borrowers' financial circumstances\" satisfies the material change requirement. Dkt. No. 33 at 6. Bank of America argues that decreased income \"would impact negatively as to [a borrower's] eligibility for a loan modification,\" and is therefore insufficient to plead a dual-tracking violation. Dkt. No. 27 at 6. Neither side cites to any authority, except for the statute, to support its argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At least two courts in this district have concluded that a decreased monthly income may satisfy \u00a7 2923.6(g)'s material change requirement.

They contend that a claim for wrongful foreclosure lies where the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff, the defendant breaches that duty, and the breach causes the plaintiff harm. Dkt. No. 24 at 9. SPS and Bank of New York allegedly breached a duty when they (1) caused the Haynishes' home to be sold while a modification application was pending and (2) failed to provide the Haynishes with notice that the August 4, 2015, trustee's sale had been postponed rather than cancelled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt.

Nos 33 at 10; 35 at 11-12 (same). The Court understands the Haynishes to mean that they pleaded UCL claims, within the \"unlawful\" category, based on underlying claims for negligence and violations of the HBOR. Although the Haynishes also accuse the defendants of \"fraudulent business practices,\" neither the FAC nor the motion papers elaborate on this other category of UCL claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Given that understanding, the Haynishes failed to adequately plead a UCL claim. First, to the extent the Court dismissed the underlying claims, the Haynishes cannot plead UCL violations based on those claims. The Haynishes may not plead a negligence-based UCL claim because the Court has now dismissed the underlying claim with prejudice. As for the HBOR claims that survived this motion to dismiss, the Haynishes have not established standing to sue under the UCL. Setting aside the question of economic injury, the Haynishes did not satisfy the causation prong of the UCL's standing test. The but-for cause of the foreclosure appears to have been the Haynishes' default on the loan, not any alleged dual-tracking violation by the defendants. As it stands, the Haynishes have not adequately alleged that they would not have suffered any harm absent an HBOR violation. That is not sufficient to state a claim under the UCL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Additionally, the Haynishes have failed to explain what relief, if any, they could receive under the UCL. They say they \"seek injunctive relief enjoining Defendant[s] from engaging in\" unfair practices. Dkt. No. 24 at 13. But if the Haynishes do not seek to undo the trustee's sale, what possible injunctive relief could the Court provide? Their claim for restitution also fails. The Haynishes accuse the defendants of causing them harm-in the form of lost equity in their home and attorneys' fees, among other things-but they fail to allege that any of the defendants took anything from them wrongfully. The default on the loan entitled the trustee to sell the house, and the Haynishes have never suggested otherwise. As to attorneys' fees, the Haynishes did not pay those fees to the defendants, so they are not recoverable as restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court dismisses the Haynishes' UCL claims. As the Court cannot say for certain that amendment would be futile, the claims are dismissed with leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendoza v.
