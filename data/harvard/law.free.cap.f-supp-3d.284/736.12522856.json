Plaintiff Tajin Sarin's case traces back to a traffic stop by two state troopers that led to Sarin's arrest and prosecution for driving under the influence. A state trial judge ultimately found that the troopers lacked probable cause to stop Sarin's car and suppressed all evidence obtained from the stop, with the result that all charges were then withdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Citing the state court suppression order, Sarin has moved to preclude the troopers from arguing here that their stop of Sarin's car was supported by probable cause. The defendant Troopers broadly argue that such an order cannot have preclusive effect in a later civil rights action, in reliance on\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Holtz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527245\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/186/#p199\">\n    210 F.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199 (3d Cir. 2000). Although I reject the Defendants' expansive reading of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , I conclude that the state court judgment Plaintiff seeks to import did not decide an issue identical to the issue now before me, rendering collateral estoppel inappropriate. For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2015, Pennsylvania state troopers Michael Magee and Francis Pawlowski (\"Defendants\") followed Plaintiff Tajin Sarin's car for a short distance before pulling him over. Trooper Magee asked Sarin to get out of the car, questioned him at length about his activity that night, previous arrests, military service, and reason for leaving the military, and eventually performed several field sobriety tests. Trooper Pawlowski then administered a\n   breath analysis test, which revealed that Sarin's blood alcohol content was .093 percent, in excess of the legal limit of .08 percent. Trooper Magee placed him under arrest for driving under the influence. Over the next several months, Sarin remained in detention while the Delaware County District Attorney, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, charged him with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), and two summary traffic offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2016, when Sarin had already been incarcerated for more than nine months, a state trial judge, the Honorable John Capuzzi, Sr., determined that Defendants had initially stopped Sarin's car without probable cause. As a result, Judge Capuzzi suppressed \"all the physical evidence and statements obtained via the illegal stop.\" Order 4, Feb. 8, 2016, ECF No. 12 at 25 [hereinafter \"State Judgment\"]. In a four-page decision, Judge Capuzzi explained that he based his decision on evidence presented at the suppression hearing, including extensive testimony by Trooper Magee, who had initiated the stop, and video footage from Defendants' dashboard camera of the moments leading up to the stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Trooper Magee testified that he had stopped Plaintiff after observing the car change lanes twice without signaling, in violation of the motor vehicle code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Judge Capuzzi viewed the video at the hearing, with Trooper Magee indicating the two instances he perceived as violations, but Judge Capuzzi \"fail[ed] to see the motor vehicle code violations that led to the ultimate stop of the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. In his Conclusions of Law, Judge Capuzzi discussed the legal standards for both probable cause and reasonable suspicion, but ultimately based his decision on the conclusion that \"there was no probable cause to initiate the stop of [Plaintiff's] vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Less than a month after Judge Capuzzi's decision, and shortly before Plaintiff's trial was to begin, the Commonwealth withdrew all charges against Plaintiff via a request for\n   <em>\n    nolle prosequi.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 15-4. Plaintiff was then released after eleven months of imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on these events, Sarin filed a complaint against the Troopers under Section 1983, alleging that their traffic stop and arrest of Plaintiff violated his Fourth Amendment rights, and asserting related state law claims. Sarin alleges that, \"despite the lack of reasonable suspicion to stop [his] vehicle or probable cause to arrest,\n   defendants illegally arrested [him] for DUI.\" Compl. \u00b6 17.

Plaintiff Sarin asserts: \"[i]t is well-established that a party may not re-litigate the issue of probable cause in a civil action once the issue has been determined in a criminal action.\" Pl.'s Mot. 6 (citing,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715506\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/90/#p96\">\n    449 U.S. at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715506\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/90/#p96\">\n    101 S.Ct. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). This proposition, Sarin insists, should apply with equal force to both offensive use by plaintiffs who won a favorable judgment in the underlying criminal case, and defensive use by governmental officials who seek to bind a plaintiff to an earlier adverse judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Defendants assert the opposite. The Troopers contend that a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff cannot advance a theory of collateral estoppel to prevent re-litigation of an issue decided in the plaintiff's favor in an underlying criminal proceeding. Defs.' Resp. 6. They cite the Third Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Holtz\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"a judgment against the government does not bind its officials in subsequent litigation,\" urge me to \"apply\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and its progeny,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and ask me to hold that Sarin cannot satisfy the elements of issue preclusion because the Troopers cannot be considered parties or in privity with a party to Sarin's underlying criminal prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12 (citing\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527245\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/186/#p199\">\n    210 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   199 n.18 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Neither approach provides a satisfactory basis for deciding the question. Plaintiff's argument relies mostly on symmetry and fairness-the notion that plaintiffs in \u00a7 1983 actions should benefit from collateral estoppel to the same extent as defendants. Pl.'s Mot. 6-7. Although this seems superficially appealing, it fails to account for the fact-specific, multi-part analysis established by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Defendants' global argument fails because it relies far too heavily on the Third Circuit's footnote in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   -a case that addressed issue preclusion in a fundamentally different factual context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , a case of some notoriety, a now-infamous high school principal who had been found guilty of three murders brought a \u00a7 1983 claim after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court vacated his convictions because of prosecutorial misconduct and barred his retrial on grounds of double jeopardy.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527245\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/186/#p199\">\n    210 F.3d at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the \u00a7 1983 case that followed, Smith sought to preclude the defendant state troopers from re-litigating the materiality of certain exculpatory (\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ) evidence based on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's holding in the underlying criminal case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527245\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/186/#p199\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527245\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/186/#p199\">\n    at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199 n.18. The district court refused to apply\n   issue preclusion, and the Third Circuit affirmed. I am not convinced, however, that the brief discussion in footnote 18 of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   was intended to announce a general rule prohibiting offensive use of collateral estoppel by a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff. Rather, the Court of Appeals explicitly considered \"several factors\" and concluded that the district court had not abused its discretion in declining to apply collateral estoppel in Smith's case.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527245\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/186/#p199\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The primary basis for the Third Circuit's decision was that, although the issues in Smith's state case and in his \u00a7 1983 case were \"tightly tethered,\" they were not identical.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527245\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/186/#p199\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527245\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/186/#p199\">\n    at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If it is not necessary to stop the vehicle to establish that a violation of the Vehicle Code has occurred, an officer must possess probable cause to stop the vehicle. Where a violation is suspected, but a stop is necessary to further investigate whether a violation has occurred, an officer need only possess reasonable suspicion to make the stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6853272,12174670,6853158\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/121/987/\">\n    121 A.3d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 993 (Pa. Super. 2015). This two-tier standard is codified at 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6308(b). Judge Capuzzi's conclusion that the stop was illegal because the Troopers lacked probable cause necessarily implies a subsidiary conclusion on his part: that the stop was predicated upon a traffic violation that required no further investigation beyond what the Troopers had already observed,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   something other than DUI.

On the record before me, this is an issue in dispute. The Troopers' dashboard footage (at minute 3:18) shows that, in the first 30 seconds of the stop, Trooper Magee asked if Sarin was wearing contacts, a question directly relevant to the field sobriety tests Trooper Magee went on to perform. Because the record raises the question of whether the Troopers had reasonable suspicion, but the State Judgment decided only that they lacked probable cause, the issues here and in the state case are not identical. Those issues are certainly \"tightly tethered,\" but under\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   that is not enough.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527245\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/186/#p199\">\n    210 F.3d at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The state court made no specific findings as to the adequacy or legitimacy of their assessment, and Sarin subsequently tested above the legal limit. Because the evidence was suppressed as tainted by the unlawful stop, that ruling sheds no light on whether the Troopers had probable cause to arrest based on the test they administered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on my review, an identity of issues is lacking, and therefore Plaintiff's Motion for Application of Res Judicata or Collateral Estoppel must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This 18th day of January, 2018, upon consideration of Plaintiff's Motion for Collateral Estoppel on the Issue of Probable Cause (ECF No. 12) and Defendants' response (ECF No. 15), it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    As set forth below, one of the requirements for application of collateral estoppel is that the prior ruling constitute a final judgment.
