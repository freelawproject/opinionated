Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Providing restitution to victims of crimes is one of the goals of the criminal justice system.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A (providing restitution to victims). But, where restitutionary interests frustrate important sentencing principles or due process, restitution must give way.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   American Law Institute, Model Penal Code: Sentencing (Proposed Final Draft), App. B at 613 (2017) (\"When core interests of public safety and recidivism reduction do not conflict with an award of victim restitution ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Congress passed the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996 to provide relief to victims \"directly and proximately harmed\" by a defendant's conduct, not to all persons affected by a defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3663A(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court was about to sentence the defendant based on a plea agreement (providing for extensive restitution) when individuals and entities sought intervention claiming to be additional victims of the defendant's crimes. After discovery, they did not show entitlement to restitution. Their claims for restitution are dismissed. The court will sentence the defendant and provide restitution only as agreed to by the defendant and the government in the defendant's cooperation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additional claims by the proposed interveners for remuneration may be decided under the Remission or Mitigation procedure, allowing the government to share with other claimants, in its discretion, funds it received in forfeiture from the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part III(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Several individuals,\n   and attorneys representing entities appeared, claiming restitution as victims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The case was referred to the magistrate judge for discovery. An evidentiary hearing was set for December 19, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 13, 2017 Order, ECF No. 46. During the course of discovery, several of the individuals who had attended the sentencing hearing withdrew their claims. Letter of Peter Hurwitz, ECF No. 49, Nov. 7, 2017. This left PRP Brooklyn Eatery, LLC and PRP Neptune Beach, LLC (together, the \"PRP Entities\"), as new restitution claimants. On November 27, 2017, Shailendra Bhawnani and Vision One Hospitality sought to intervene as restitution claimants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27, 2017 Order, ECF Nos. 57-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Discovery, supervised by the magistrate judge, was contentious. Many factual issues were disputed. After a protective order was signed by Kesav Dama, as \"Guardian\" of Venkaiah Dama, for the PRP Entities, the defendant challenged the authority of Kesav Dama to act on behalf of the PRP Entities.

Bank Fraud Schemes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. PNC Bank\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   6. In approximately 2003, the defendant FALGUN DHARIA, together with others, obtained the development rights to various Houlihan's Restaurants, Inc. (\"Houlihan's\") franchises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   7. To obtain funding to develop three of the Houlihan's franchises, including a Houlihan's restaurant in Brooklyn, New York, the defendant FALGUN DHARIA, together with others, submitted applications to PNC Bank for loans, which were partially guaranteed by the SBA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   8. The SBA partnered with approved lending institutions to provide loans with favorable terms to borrowers for starting, acquiring and expanding small businesses. The SBA had personal financial disclosure and guarantee requirements to obtain an SBA-guaranteed loan. For example, at the time that the defendant FALGUN DHARIA, together with others, submitted the loan applications to PNC Bank, the SBA limited a borrower to $2 million in total SBA-guaranteed loans. The SBA also required personal financial statements and guarantees from individuals applying for a loan who had a 20% or more ownership interest in the small business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   9. In or about and between January 2003 and December 2009, the defendant\n   FALGUN DHARIA, together with others, made material misrepresentations in the loan applications submitted to PNC Bank regarding the ownership structure of the three Houlihan's franchises. Specifically, in order to circumvent the SBA's lending requirements, in documentation submitted to the bank, DHARIA minimized his ownership interest in each of the three Houlihan's restaurants and inflated the ownership interests of the other investors. In reality, DHARIA's ownership interest in each of the three Houlihan's restaurants was greater than 20%, thus requiring him to provide personal financial statements and guarantees to the bank for each loan. DHARIA did not comply with these requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   10. Once he and his business partners unlawfully obtained the loans from PNC Bank, contrary to the terms of the loans, the defendant FALGUN DHARIA used portions of those loans for other projects and investments. DHARIA did not report his improper use of portions of those loans to PNC Bank or the SBA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   11. The defendant FALGUN DHARIA and his business partners eventually defaulted on the loans obtained from PNC Bank, resulting in millions of dollars of loss to PNC Bank and the SBA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   B. Fidelity Bank of Florida\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   12. Beginning in approximately January 2006, the defendant FALGUN DHARIA, together with others, purchased approximately five hotels throughout the United States in need of renovation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   13. To obtain financing for these hotels, the defendant FALGUN DHARIA, together with others, submitted applications for approximately five loans to Fidelity Bank of Florida.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   14. Each of the five loan applications contained material misrepresentations about the ownership structure of the hotels. Specifically, the defendant FALGUN DHARIA minimized his ownership interest in the hotels and inflated the ownership interests of the other investors to avoid having to provide personal guarantees for the loans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   15. In or about and between January 2006 and December 2010, the defendant FALGUN DHARIA, together with others, obtained five loans from the Fidelity Bank of Florida. DHARIA and his business partners defaulted on those loans, resulting in millions of dollars of loss to Fidelity Bank of Florida.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Criminal restitution as part of a sentence is a relatively new and unsettled aspect of sentencing procedure. The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA) of 1996 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in subsection (c), the\n   <em>\n    court shall order,\n   </em>\n   in addition to, or in the case of a misdemeanor, in addition to or in lieu of, any other penalty authorized by law,\n   <em>\n    that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense\n   </em>\n   or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A \"victim\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   a person\n   <em>\n    directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense\n   </em>\n   for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct\n   <em>\n    in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\n   </em>\n   In the case of a victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardian of the victim or representative of the victim's estate, another family member, or any other person appointed as suitable by the court, may assume the victim's rights under this section, but in no event shall the defendant be named as such representative or guardian.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3663A(a)(2) (emphasis added). If agreed to in a plea agreement, the court may also order restitution to be paid to \"persons other than the victim of the offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The legislative history of the MVRA demonstrates that it is not intended to remedy all harms caused by a defendant's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   It is the committee's intent that courts order full restitution to all identifiable victims of covered offenses, while\n   <em>\n    guaranteeing that the sentencing phase of criminal trials do not become fora for the determination of facts and issues better suited to civil proceedings.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   To that end,\n   <em>\n    the committee amendment restricts mandatory restitution requirements\n   </em>\n   to criminal cases involving either a crime of violence, as defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code ; a felony against property under title 18, including any felony under title 18 committed by fraud or deceit; a crime involving tampering with consumer products under section 1365 of title 18, and offenses under part D of the Controlled Substances Act ( 21 U.S.C. 841 et seq. ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, the committee amendment requires that there be an identifiable victim who suffers a physical injury or pecuniary loss before mandatory restitution provisions would apply. The committee intends this provision to mean, except where a conviction is obtained by a plea bargain, that mandatory restitution provisions apply\n   <em>\n    only in those instances where a named, identifiable victim suffers a physical injury or pecuniary loss directly and proximately caused by the course of conduct under the count or counts for which the offender is convicted.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   In the case of a conviction obtained by a plea bargain, it is the committee's intent that, in addition to any restitution mandatory\n   for the offense for which the victim is convicted, all other restitution included in the plea agreement and supported by fact be ordered by the court. The committee recognizes the central role played by plea bargaining in the Federal criminal justice system. Nothing in this act is intended by the committee to impair the fundamental and critical function served by plea bargaining in the administration of justice, or the traditional authority of the court to accept a plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   S.

Burden on Sentencing and Complexity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The proposed final draft of the Model Penal Code on sentencing offers useful commentary on victim restitution and how it interacts with the other aims of criminal sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   In contrast with many other asserted victims' interests, an interest in restitution does not suffer from a high degree of indeterminacy. While the scope of losses that should be compensable in criminal proceedings may be debated, the outcome sought is not an abstraction. Partly for this reason, and partly due to broad consensus among American criminal justice systems, the Reporters recommend in this draft that \"victim restitution\" be added to the general purposes of the sentencing system as expressed in \u00a7 1.02(2).

His claim is based on an April 4, 2016 email, as well as bills and an account statement from November 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873600\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/149/#p170\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is not clear why this claim is brought here, now. The defendant's attorney challenges the nature of his firm's attorney-client relationship with Kesav Dama, claiming that the representation did not relate to Dharia and that Dama was advised in April 2016 that Moses &amp; Singer could not represent him in any matter related to Dharia. Mem. in Opp'n to Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   to Remove Att'y, ECF. No. 72, Dec. 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Deciding this motion and removing the defendant's attorney would unduly complicate the sentencing process. Mr. Wolf has represented the defendant for several years. Removing him now would burden the defendant and deprive him of his counsel of choice. It would require the court to make difficult factual and legal findings regarding the scope of Moses &amp; Singer's representation of Dama-facts that appear to be in dispute. If Dama has a claim against the law firm, it may lie in malpractice-not in a sentencing proceeding at this late hour. Victim restitution cannot be granted when it badly impedes the sentencing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The government argues that if the court were to accept Vison One and Shailendra Bhawnani's position on restitution entitlement, it \"would require the investigation of upwards of fifty different properties, which would not be practicable for the government or the Court to accomplish without seriously impeding the sentencing process.\" Gov. Letter at 6, ECF No. 69, Dec. 18, 2017. Consistent with the restitution statutory scheme, the court will not impose this burden on the government or the sentencing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Prudential Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As suggested by the ALI and MVRA's statutory scheme, the court takes account of pragmatic considerations. Vison One and Shailendra Bhawnani have already received a judgment against the defendant for the amounts they are now seeking in restitution. Restitution Hearing Transcript 14:6-19, Dec. 29, 2017 (\"Restitution Hr'g Tr.\"). The PRP Entities began a civil proceeding against the defendant in 2009, which has been stayed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   20:16-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The United States Probation Department undertook an extensive survey of the defendant's assets and concluded that his net worth is about $2.5 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Falgun Dharia Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") at 30-40. The government has already collected approximately $3.24 million in funds from the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov. Letter at 3, ECF No. 73, Dec. 22, 2017. He has agreed to pay a total of over $11 million dollars in restitution for the instant convictions to the banks he defrauded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 12, 2017 Hr'g Tr. He probably owes millions of dollars more to many individuals-his crimes and business dealings were far reaching. The defendant will probably be paying off his debts for the remainder of his life and will probably never fully satisfy them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The government has represented that the money it collected can be distributed through the remission process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 12, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 9:16-10:14; Restitution Hr'g Tr. 32:5-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The court could, theoretically, appoint a special master to distribute money to the restitution claimants.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203664\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(6) (\"[The court may] refer any issue arising in connection with a proposed order of restitution to a magistrate judge or special master for proposed findings of fact and recommendations as to disposition, subject to a de novo determination of the issue by the court.\"). But the cost of this process would cut into the already insufficient funds of the defendant. It appears that the special master would only be able to provide funds to those who qualified as \"victims\" under the MVRA, which would not help most of the additional restitution claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The government has already collected millions of dollars from the defendant and has a process in place for the distribution of these funds.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III(D). Remission allows for \"related offense[s]\" to be covered-the government is not bound to remit funds solely to those losses\n   resulting from the \"offense of conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%209.8\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Remission and Mitigation process is an efficient alternative. It avoids delaying the defendant's sentencing for further court hearings, which in the end could only provide the claimants with permission to wait in line for funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The restitution claims of Vison One, Shailendra Bhawnani, and the PRP Entities are dismissed for lack of any potential merit and based upon the complexity exception to the restitution scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The motion to remove Dharia's attorney is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
