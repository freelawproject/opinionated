These messages were directed to someone\n   other than Coleman. After several phone calls, Coleman contacted a Rite Aid employee at the number from which the calls originated. Coleman informed the employee that the messages were reaching the wrong person and he wanted them to stop. Nevertheless, Coleman continued receiving prerecorded automated calls from Rite Aid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 14, 2017, Coleman filed suit against Rite Aid asserting three claims. On May 1, Rite Aid filed a motion [6] to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On May 15, Coleman amended his complaint dismissing all claims except one: Rite Aid's violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Rite Aid does not assert that Coleman's claim fails to meet any of these elements. Instead, Rite Aid argues that the case should be dismissed because two exceptions to the TCPA apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rite Aid argues that the calls at issue are subject to either the exception for calls made for emergency purposes or the exception for calls made for health care purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   47 U.S.C \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The FCC defines \"emergency purposes\" as \"calls made necessary in any situation affecting the health and safety of consumers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(4). Rite Aid argues that the automated calls to Coleman were made for an emergency purpose because they related to prescription notifications for a Rite Aid customer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To support its defense, Rite Aid relies upon\n   <em>\n    Roberts v. Medco Health Solutions\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:15-cv-1368-CDP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203997071\">\n    2016 WL 3997071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mo. July 26, 2016).\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203997071\">\n    2016 WL 3997071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8, held that calls relating to confirmations or refills of prescription medication orders, when the caller did not know it was calling the wrong person, fall under the emergency purpose exception because \"a patient's ability to timely receive a prescribed medicine is critical in preventing a major health emergency.\" The Court is not convinced, however, that the issue here is the same as the issue in\n   <em>\n    Roberts.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's number previously belonged to a customer of the defendant-company that placed the offending calls. It is unclear in\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   whether the plaintiff ever informed the company that it was calling the wrong number, or asked for the calls to stop. Contrastingly, Coleman made Rite Aid aware that the calls were placed to the wrong person and regarded medication that was not his, yet Rite Aid continued calling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rite Aid states that Coleman does not \"allege that he requested that the calls stop.\" [12] at 5. However, Coleman alleges in his complaint that he \"told Defendant's pharmacy employee that the wrong person was being called,\" [1] \u00b6 12, \"told the Defendant's pharmacy employee that he did not know the person to whom the messages were directed,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13, and \"requested Defendant stop the calls to his cellular phone,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Accepting Coleman's allegations as true, Rite Aid was informed that Coleman no longer wished to receive calls. This differs materially from the situation in\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   and therefore compels a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Coleman's claims align more closely with those in\n   <em>\n    St. Clair v. CVS Pharmacy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271025\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/779/\">\n    222 F.Supp.3d 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. 2016).\n   <em>\n    St. Clair\n   </em>\n   held that \"[c]ontinuing to call a customer (or former customer) about a prescription, when the customer has made clear that he does not want or need the calls, does not fall within the definition of an 'emergency' purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271025\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/779/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271025\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/779/\">\n    at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same logic applies with even greater force when a non-customer makes a similar request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   If accepted, Rite Aid's argument would give carte blanche under the TCPA to companies that make automated calls related to prescription notifications. As noted by the court in\n   <em>\n    St. Clair\n   </em>\n   , this outcome is inconsistent with the development of TCPA regulations and the emergency purpose exception generally: to prevent unwanted automated calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With no controlling case law in our circuit, but mindful of how other courts have dealt with this issue, the Court holds that the emergency purposes exception to the\n   TCPA does not apply to calls made after Coleman told Rite Aid to stop calling him. Thus, dismissal is not warranted on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Health Care Exceptions to the TCPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition to the statutory exceptions to the TCPA (emergency purposes and prior express consent), the FCC has promulgated exceptions to the TCPA for certain calls related to health care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Notwithstanding the volume of ink spilled on this regulatory crusade, there is a remarkable lack of clarity regarding the extent to which calls ordinarily subject to the TCPA are exempted because they are health care related.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court examines the tangled regulatory framework that Rite Aid argues requires dismissal because the calls it made to Coleman are related to health care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Health Care Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, there is the Health Care Rule. This rule was codified after the FCC issued an order in 2012 \"tightening the restrictions for automated telemarketing calls under the TCPA ....\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Cal. Oct. 11, 2016).

It is unclear from the structure of the regulation whether the clause providing the exception for \"a call that delivers a 'health care' message\" relates, for purposes of the exception, to the \"prior express consent\" in the clause before it, or if it starts a new clause entirely exempting the health care category of calls from any consent requirement. According to the FCC, it is the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This ambiguity is at least manifested in, though not predicated upon, the decisions cited in this Order, which have arrived at opposite conclusions regarding the level of consent, if any, required for health care-related calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, the Court defers to the FCC's interpretation that calls excepted by the Health Care Rule require prior express consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Coleman avers\n   that he did not provide any consent to the calls made by Rite Aid, the Health Care Rule does not apply, and dismissal is not warranted on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The \"Health Care Treatment\" Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In addition to the Health Care Rule, the FCC has provided an additional exception to the TCPA affecting health care-related calls. Section (b)(2)(C) of the TCPA provides that the FCC \"may, by rule or order, exempt from the [restrictions on automated or prerecorded calls made to, inter alia, cell phones] that are not charged to the called party, subject to such conditions as the [FCC] may prescribe as necessary in the interest of the privacy rights [the TCPA] is intended to protect.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(C). Thus, the TCPA permits the FCC to create regulatory exceptions to TCPA liability, subject to certain exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In 2015, the FCC conducted a \" section 227(b)(2)(C) inquiry\"-i.e., determined whether it would or could create a regulatory exception to the TCPA-when it granted an exemption requested by the American Association of Healthcare Administrative Management (\"AAHAM\").\n   <em>\n    2015 TCPA Order\n   </em>\n   , 30 FCC Rcd. at 8030. Among other things, AAHAM asked the FCC \"to exempt from the TCPA's prior-express-consent requirement certain non-telemarketing, healthcare calls that are not charged to the called party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The FCC responded: \"We grant the exemption [requested by AAHAM], with [certain] conditions ..., but restrict it to calls for which there is exigency and that have a healthcare treatment purpose ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8031. Relevant to this case, the FCC made it clear that this included \"prescription notifications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court refers to this as the Health Care Treatment Exception.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Latner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263365\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/52/#p54\">\n    879 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   55 n. 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20265085\">\n    2018 WL 265085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This \"healthcare treatment purpose\" standard is the hallmark of this regulatory exception.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20265085\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FCC clarified that this exclusion did not include calls containing \"telemarketing, solicitation, or advertising content, or which include accounting, billing, debt-collection, or other financial content.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8031. For purposes of this exception, TCPA calls were divided into two categories: telemarketing calls and health care exigency calls. The latter would be, according to the FCC's order, exempted from the prior express consent requirement as requested by the petitioner, AAHAM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It is clear that the Health Care Treatment Exception \"went further than the Health Care Rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Zani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274776\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/835/#p845\">\n    246 F.Supp.3d at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is because the FCC order purports to grant an exemption for certain health care-related calls from TCPA consent requirements altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But some clarity is still wanting. In a footnote to the\n   <em>\n    2015 TCPA Order\n   </em>\n   , the FCC commented that \"HIPAA-covered autodialed, prerecorded voice, and artificial voice calls to a wireless number are exempt from the TCPA's written consent requirement but are still covered by the general consent requirement.\" 30 FCC Rcd. at 8030 n.481 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(2) ). And yet, the FCC-in the same order-purported to grant an exemption from\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   consent requirement for \"calls subject to HIPAA\" that do not contain certain commercial/telemarketing content and which met other conditions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    at 8031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The tension is manifest; and it is unclear exactly what level of consent is now required for health care-related calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because this issue is not fully briefed, and there are other grounds for its decision, the Court declines to delve further into the regulatory morass at this time. But the identified tension could present an issue in future stages of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Rite Aid cannot take shelter under the Health Care Treatment Exception-whether or not it is a complete exemption to the TCPA-because it fails to satisfy the prerequisites to the exceptions operation. To meet the exception,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   a \"healthcare provider must honor ... opt-out requests immediately.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    at 8032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Coleman avers that Rite Aid continued the offending calls after Coleman requested that they stop. Rite Aid therefore cannot utilize the exception on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Rite Aid also falls short of another prerequisite according to Coleman's averments. The Health Care Treatment Exception requires that \"a healthcare provider ... offer recipients within each message an easy means to opt out of future such messages ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Coleman avers that Rite Aid did not provide an appropriate opt out mechanism in the offending calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As a result Rite Aid's calls do not meet the prerequisites to the Health Care Treatment Exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
