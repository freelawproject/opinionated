PAULEY III, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   DigitAlb, Sh.a (\"DigitAlb\") brings this action alleging copyright infringement, trademark dilution, communications piracy, and breach of contract against Setplex LLC (d/b/a NimiTV and d/b/a TVAlb), LBD Group, LLC, Lionel Dreshaj, and Benjamin Dreshaj (together, \"Setplex\"). Setplex moves to dismiss the claims for direct and contributory copyright infringement in the United States as well as the trademark dilution claim under Rule 12(b)(6). It also seeks to dismiss the claim for copyright infringement in various European countries for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   under Rule 12(b)(3), and alternatively asks this Court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that claim. For the reasons that follow, Setplex's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The allegations in the First Amended Complaint (\"Compl.\") are presumed true for the purposes of this motion. This action arises from the piracy of Albanian-language television programming. DigitAlb is an Albanian corporation engaged in the distribution of Internet Protocol Television (\"IPTV\") programming from certain Albanian-language television channels. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 14-15; Compl., Ex. A.) IPTV involves the delivery of streaming content and programming by \"sending coded digital transmissions over the Internet,\" which are then translated by standard television receivers or other devices provided by the distributor to the subscriber. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 12.) DigitAlb distributed and published this programming pursuant to licenses from the Albanian and Kosovan originators of the programming who granted it exclusive distribution rights in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other independent European countries. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 13-15.) In addition, DigitAlb licensed other parties to distribute and publish this programming. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The gravamen of the Complaint is that Setplex-a U.S.-based distributor of Albanian-language content and programming-infringed DigitAlb's exclusive distribution rights by pirating, retransmitting, and publishing the licensed programming to its own customers in the United States and in Europe without DigitAlb's authorization. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7, 16-17.) Although the Complaint largely glosses over the method through which Setplex purportedly distributed this programming, this Court gathers that, at minimum, Setplex delivered the programming to its subscribers through its website or by providing its subscribers with devices or equipment to receive and display the programming. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 34, 39.) Following a pre-motion conference identifying certain pleading deficiencies in DigitAlb's U.S. copyright claims, DigitAlb amended its complaint to add \"[e]xamples of the individual daily programs published on each channel and to which Plaintiff holds exclusive rights.\" (Compl. \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. A.) Four claims are the subject of this motion: (1) Count I, for direct copyright infringement in the United States; (2) Count II, for contributory copyright infringement in the United States; (3) Count IV, for copyright infringement in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other European countries; and (4) Count VI, for false designation of origin and trademark dilution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The legal standards governing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\n   claim are well-established.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.) To state a claim for copyright infringement, a plaintiff must allege that it owns a valid copyright and that the defendant violated one of the exclusive rights the plaintiff holds in the work, which includes distribution rights.\n   <em>\n    Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893302\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/934/640/#p648\">\n    934 F.Supp.2d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citing\n   <em>\n    Twin Peaks Prods., Inc. v.

In other words, a plaintiff must generally plead (1) the specific original works are the subject of the copyright claim; (2) that plaintiff owns the copyrights in those works; (3) that the copyrights were registered in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (4) the acts by which and the time period during which the defendant infringed the copyright.\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

Specifically, it contends that DigitAlb acknowledges that the copyrights are not registered pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that DigitAlb has not alleged that the copyrights are exempt from registration as non-United States works. DigitAlb does not dispute that the at-issue copyrights are not registered, but instead retorts-without citing any legal authority-that it is not required to explicitly plead that the works are exempt from registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pursuant to the Copyright Act, holders of copyrights in \"United States works\" may not institute a copyright infringement suit \"until preregistration or registration has been made.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). A work is a \"United States work\" only if, in the case of a published work, it is first published (1) in the United States; (2) simultaneously in the United States and another treaty party whose law grants copyright protection for at least the term provided in the United States; (3) simultaneously\n   in the United States and a foreign nation that is not a treaty party; or (4) in a foreign nation that is not a treaty party, and all the authors of the work are headquartered in the United States.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, non-United States works-generally, works first published outside the United States in a foreign country that is a signatory to the Berne Convention-are exempt from registration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 Patry on Copyright \u00a7 17:77 (2017) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jose Armando Bermudez &amp; Co. v.

Aug. 29, 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As a threshold matter, this Court rejects DigitAlb's assertion that it is not required to allege exemption from \u00a7 411's registration precondition. Although DigitAlb appears to concede that works first published abroad and in the United States simultaneously would be subject to registration, its argument implicitly suggests that because the Complaint does not allege simultaneous publication, those works must be exempt. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law Opposing the Motion of Defendants to Dismiss Counts I, II, IV, and VI of the First Amended Complaint, ECF No. 51 (\"Pl.'s Opp.\") at 4.) But this cannot be the rule. If a court were to woodenly accept that a work is exempt from registration based on the\n   <em>\n    omission\n   </em>\n   of allegations indicating that the work is a United States work, any party seeking to surmount the registration requirement could simply omit any allegation of first publication in the United States or first publication simultaneously within and outside the United States. Thus, should DigitAlb seek to rely on the \u00a7 411 registration exemption, it must allege that the works are not United States works within the meaning of \u00a7 101.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joint Stock Co. Channel One Russia Worldwide v. Infomir LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20696126\">\n    2017 WL 696126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 (S.D.N.Y.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. at 5.) Here, the only allegations pertaining to publication of the programming are that DigitAlb \"published those works outside of the United States\" and that it \"licens[ed] other distributors within and without the United States, not including the defendants, to publish them.\" (Compl. \u00b6 13.) But these allegations do not identify where or when the programming was\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   published.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Two additional points warrant brief discussion. First, DigitAlb avers that the programming was \"created, developed, and produced ... outside of the United States, i.e. in the Republic of Albania or the Republic of Kosovo.\" (Compl. \u00b6 13.) Indeed, courts in this Circuit sometimes frame the registration requirement in terms of the work's \"country of origin.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sadhu Singh Hamdad Trust v. Ajit Newspaper Advert., Mktg. &amp; Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5702729\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/503/577/#p584\">\n    503 F.Supp.2d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 584 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (citing\n   <em>\n    Jose Armando Bermudez &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201225792\">\n    2000 WL 1225792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 ). Of course, this phrasing makes sense in light of \u00a7 411(a)'s historical exemption from registration of \"copyright[s] in Berne Convention works whose\n   <em>\n    country of origin\n   </em>\n   is not the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1997) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But like \u00a7 101's current definition of \"United States work,\" the preceding version of \u00a7 101 defined the \"country of origin\" as the United States for \u00a7 411 purposes based on where the work was \"first published.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   5 Patry on Copyright \u00a7 17:77 (couching the \"country of origin of the work\" in terms of where that work was first published). Therefore, while the amended complaint suggests that the works may have \"originated\" in Albania or Kosovo from a layman's perspective, it says nothing about where the works were first published.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, DigitAlb alleges that the programming on at least some of the at-issue channels-Top Channel, Top News, Musical, and Top Channel HD-was \"first aired ... either (1) outside of the United States or (2) simultaneously outside the United States and within the United States.\" (Compl. \u00b6 50.) This too is insufficient to allege where the works were first published because the mere public performance or display of a work does not constitute publication.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   1 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 4.11 (explaining that broadcast of audiovisual works does not constitute publication). Accordingly, DigitAlb's direct copyright infringement claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Contributory Copyright Infringement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Count II alleges contributory infringement by LBD Group and the Dreshaj Defendants on the basis that they facilitated, managed, or directed Setplex's unauthorized distribution of the programming by entering into contracts with consumer subscribers for the programming and causing the delivery of the programming to the subscribers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.) To state a claim for contributory copyright infringement, a plaintiff must allege that someone \"with knowledge of the infringing activity[ ] induce[d], cause[d], or materially contribute[d] to the infringing conduct of another.\"\n   <em>\n    Blank Prods., Inc. v. Warner/Chappell Music, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2032806\">\n    2013 WL 32806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Setplex's only argument for dismissal of this claim is that DigitAlb's failure to sufficiently plead the registration element is fatal to its contributory copyright infringement claim. It does not otherwise challenge the sufficiency of the allegations related to contributory infringement. This Court's analysis of the direct copyright infringement claim compels the same result as to the contributory infringement claim because \u00a7 411 is a precondition to\n   <em>\n    suit\n   </em>\n   , not to bringing direct infringement claims only. Accordingly, Count II is also dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Leave to Amend\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Setplex contends that DigitAlb should not be afforded another opportunity to amend its copyright infringement claims because it received notice at the pre-motion conference of the need to allege additional details. Such details included whether the allegedly infringed works are foreign works, the country of origin, and the date of publication. (Hr'g Tr. at 8:25-10:22.) DigitAlb offers no argument in opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jumei Int'l Holding Ltd. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2095176\">\n    2017 WL 95176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2017) (arguments not rebutted in opposition briefs are deemed conceded). At oral argument on the motion, DigitAlb admitted that it could have pleaded that the at-issue works were exempt. Counsel offered no explanation for why he did not do so aside from his belief that it was not necessary. (Oral Arg. Hr'g Tr. at 4:10-4:22.) Courts have dismissed claims with prejudice on the basis that \"the plaintiff has already had an opportunity\n   to replead after specific warnings as to a complaint's deficiencies.\"\n   <em>\n    Tamar v.

A fundamental purpose of a pre-motion conference is to discuss potential defects in pleadings and to obviate successive pleadings. Accordingly, leave to amend Counts I and II is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Trademark Dilution Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Setplex seeks to dismiss Count VI for false designation of origin and trademark dilution under the Lanham Act. As an initial matter, DigitAlb appears to conflate a claim for false designation of origin under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) with a claim for trademark dilution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). In essence, DigitAlb alleges that each at-issue television channel contains a unique symbol that appears in the corner of the television screen. (Compl. \u00b6 59.) While the Complaint purports to state a cause of action under \u00a7 1125(c), DigitAlb alleges that Setplex's unauthorized distribution of the television programming and use of the symbols on their websites constitute a false designation of origin within the meaning of \u00a7 1125(a)(1). (Compl. \u00b6 64.) However, it also avers that Setplex's use of these symbols dilutes the quality of the symbols. (Compl. \u00b6 65.)

Specifically, Setplex points to a 2011 Court of Justice of the EU (\"CJEU\") case that rejected the \"practice of television channels reserving absolute territorial exclusivity between EU countries\" by selling \"broadcasting rights, so as to segment the EU market along national boundaries.\" (Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants Setplex, LLC, Lionel Dreshaj, and Benjamin Dreshaj's Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 45 (\"Defs.' Memo. of Law\"), at 19.) But even if the issues decided in the CJEU opinion-which was rendered in 2011-can fairly be described as novel, it is unclear how the foreign copyright infringement claims would implicate those issues, which principally relate to the movement of goods and services within the EU market. (Defs.' Memo. of Law, at 19.) Setplex also invokes a 2017 European Parliament draft law regarding \"geo-blocking,\" which is the act of offering an online or digital content service solely within the boundaries of a single EU country. As with the 2011 CJEU opinion, however, Setplex fails to explain how the foreign copyright infringement claims would even implicate the issue addressed by the EU draft law, which relates to \"unify[ing] copyright laws of various EU member states to legalize content portability.\" (Defs.' Memo. of Law, at 19.) In short, aside from examples of how peripheral aspects of EU copyright law may be changing, Setplex does not show how any European copyright principles applicable\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   -namely, those governing copyright infringement-are unsettled or developing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Whether the Foreign Copyright Claims Substantially Predominate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Alternatively, Setplex posits that dismissal of the foreign copyright claims would be proper because the need to apply the copyright laws of at least 18 countries would substantially predominate over the claim or claims for which this Court has original jurisdiction. Here, aside from the foreign copyright infringement claims, dismissal of the U.S. copyright infringement claims and the trademark dilution claim leaves only the claim for communications piracy under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20605\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the breach of contract claim (for which subject matter jurisdiction may be lacking).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even if the survival of some federal claims \"means that not '\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   claims over which [the district court] has original jurisdiction' have been dismissed,\" the non-federal claims may be dismissed if \"it has nonetheless become clear that the [non-federal] claims now 'substantially predominate[ ]' \" in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v.

The facts underpinning the breach of contract claim center on a licensing agreement authorizing Setplex to distribute television content for four channels in the United States and Canada. (Compl. \u00b6 48.) Almost by definition, none of these facts are implicated by the foreign copyright claims, which focus on Setplex's unauthorized distribution of a broader scope of content in Europe. (Compl. \u00b6 42.) Moreover, the breach of contract claim focuses on Setplex's failure to pay fees to a non-party during a period in which it was authorized to distribute certain programming. By contrast, the foreign copyright claims introduce separate legal issues of whether Setplex's conduct infringed DigitAlb's copyrights under the laws of various European countries. DigitAlb's communications piracy claim is equally peripheral-factually, because it relates solely to Setplex's purported piracy of programming and distribution of electronic devices to its subscribers\n   <em>\n    within the United States\n   </em>\n   , and legally, because it seeks vindication of DigitAlb's rights under an entirely separate statutory scheme. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) The heart of this action is that Setplex infringed DigitAlb's exclusive rights to distribute certain programming by distributing that programming to its own customers.

Here, dismissal of Count IV would not amount to a waste of this Court's resources where, as here, this case is still in the pleading stage and no significant judicial resources have been invested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zohar CDO 2003-1, Ltd. v.

Moreover, the factually and legally disparate nature of the foreign copyright claims vis-\u00e0-vis the breach of contract and communications piracy claims suggests that it would not be materially prejudicial for DigitAlb to re-file its foreign copyright claims in a more appropriate forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chenensky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226424\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/942/388/#p392\">\n    942 F.Supp.2d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The European nations whose copyright laws Setplex allegedly infringed undoubtedly possess the greater stake in protecting the property rights and the economic and cultural interests furthered by those foreign copyright laws.
