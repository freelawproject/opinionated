R. CIV. P. \" or \"Rule\") 12(c) for a judgment on the pleadings. For the reasons that follow, the Plaintiff's motion is denied in its entirety, and the Defendant's motion is granted in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 18, 2013, the Plaintiff applied for disability insurance benefits under the Act, alleging that he has been disabled since July 27, 2009. The Plaintiff claims that he is disabled because of hip, knee, shoulder and back injuries, as well as sinusitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease related to time spent at the World Trade Center in 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   His claim was denied on December 11, 2013, and he requested a hearing. The Plaintiff appeared with counsel before Administrative Law Judge Patrick Kilgannon (the \"ALJ\") on May 12, 2015. On August 28, 2015, the ALJ issued a written decision in which he found that the Plaintiff was not entitled to disability benefits under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiff sought a review by the Appeals Council, which denied his request on April 12, 2016. With his request for review, the Plaintiff included a December 30, 2015 letter from Andrew Pasternack, a vocational expert. The ALJ's decision became the final decision of the Commissioner upon the Appeals Council's denial of the Plaintiff's request for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 15, 2016, the Plaintiff filed the instant action. The parties submitted the matter as fully briefed to the Court on March 29, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For purposes of these motions, familiarity with the underlying administrative record is presumed. The Court's discussion of the evidence will be limited to the specific challenges and responses presently raised by the Plaintiff and the Defendant. In this regard, references to the record are denoted as \"R.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Dr. Fuchs is a medical expert who responded to interrogatories on July 3, 2015.

Specifically, he contends that ALJ Kilgannon incorrectly labeled Dr. Caiati as an orthopedist, thereby improperly weighing Dr. Caiati's opinions against those of the Plaintiff's treating physicians. The Court is not persuaded that the ALJ's misstatement altered his analysis or ultimate decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p31\">\n    362 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   32-33 ;\n   <em>\n    Vogler v.

It is therefore clear that the Appeals Council considered Mr. Pasternak's letter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. at 10-19, but determined that it did not undercut ALJ Kilgannon's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   An examination of the letter at issue reveals that the opinions and conclusions of Mr. Pasternak are based on \"a comprehensive vocational functional capacities evaluation and skills analysis.\" R. at 10. These \"standardized tests and work samples\" were administered to the Plaintiff in December 2015, five months after the ALJ's decision. Further, these tests analyzed the Claimant's disabilities as of the date of the examination; they did not relate back to past symptoms or injuries that were present before the ALJ decision. When the new evidence at issue does not \"relate[ ] to the period on or before the ALJ's hearing decision,\" the Appeals Council may not consider such evidence. Given the considerable passage of time, the Appeals Council properly determined that the assessment of Mr. Pasternak, which was prepared five months after the issuance of the ALJ's denial, did not constitute new and material evidence necessitating the reversal of ALJ Kilgannon's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
