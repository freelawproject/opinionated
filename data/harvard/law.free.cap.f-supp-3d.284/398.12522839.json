Among the overt acts of the alleged conspiracy are the execution-style murders of two KMC members-Paul Maue (\"Maue\") and Daniel \"DJ\" Szymanski (\"Szymanski\")-that occurred outside the KMC North Tonawanda Chapter clubhouse during the early morning hours of September 6, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 33, Count 1, Overt Acts \u00b6\u00b6 41-66). Defendant Andre Jenkins was convicted for the murders in state court, following a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Decision and Order addresses the motions for severance and for change of venue filed by defendants David Pirk (\"Pirk\") (Dkt. 434; Dkt. 435; Dkt. 789; Dkt. 833); Filip Caruso (\"Caruso\") (Dkt. 776); Jack Wood (\"Wood\") (Dkt. 777); Stanley Olejniczak (\"Olejniczak\") (Dkt. 781; Dkt. 784); Gregory Willson (\"Willson\") (Dkt. 782); Sean McIndoo (\"McIndoo\") (Dkt. 783); Glen Stacharczyck (\"Stacharczyck\") (Dkt. 785); Robert Osborne,\n   Jr. (\"Osborne\") (Dkt. 787); Timothy Enix (\"Enix\") (Dkt. 790); Thomas Scanlon (\"Scanlon\") (Dkt. 791); and Andre Jenkins (\"Jenkins\") (Dkt. 522; Dkt. 792; Dkt. 836). For the reasons set forth below, the Court severs Caruso, Wood, Stacharczyck, and Jason Williams (\"Williams\") from the trial commencing on January 16, 2018, and determines that that trial will take place in Buffalo, New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2016, four defendants-Scanlon, Osborne, Olejniczak, and Williams-moved for severance. (Dkt. 384; Dkt. 387; Dkt. 394; Dkt. 400). In a Decision and Order dated February 9, 2017, the Court denied those motions without prejudice, reasoning that severance was premature at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 490).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2017, Pirk moved to sever his trial from his co-defendants and to change the location of his trial from Buffalo, New York, to Rochester, New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 434 at 21-27 (motion to change venue); Dkt. 435 (Severance Motion)). Jenkins' pretrial omnibus motion, filed in March 2017, requested a change of venue to another district, or, alternatively, from Buffalo, New York, to Rochester, New York. (Dkt. 522 at \u00b6\u00b6 140-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In July 2017, the Court issued a Decision and Order on certain aspects of Defendants' pretrial omnibus motions. (Dkt. 688). However, in that Decision and Order, the Court did not address Pirk's motions for severance and to change venue (Dkt. 435; Dkt. 435) or Jenkins' motion for change of venue (Dkt. 522), choosing instead to resolve those motions closer to the time of trial. (Dkt. 688 at 2. n.4). In August 2017, the Court issued a Pretrial Order, which set a deadline of September 15, 2017, for Defendants to file or renew previously filed severance motions. (Dkt. 739 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants moved or renewed their motions for severance, pursuant to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 8 and 14, as listed below:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-17\">\u2022 David Pirk: Motion to Change Venue Dkt. 434 Motion to Sever Defendant and Counts Dkt. 435 Renewed Motion to Sever Dkt. 789 Renewed Motion to Change Venue Dkt. 833 \u2022 Filip Caruso: Motion to Sever Defendant Dkt. 776 \u2022 Jack Wood: Motion to Sever Defendant Dkt. 777 \u2022 Gregory Willson: Motion to Sever Defendant Dkt. 782 \u2022 Stanley Olejniczak: Motion to Sever Defendant Dkt. 781 Amended Motion to Sever Defendant Dkt. 784 \u2022 Thomas Scanlon: Motion to Join in Request for Separate Trial Dkt. 783 Motion to Sever Defendant Dkt. 791 \u2022 Glen Stacharczyck: Motion to Sever Defendant Dkt. 785 \u2022 Robert Osborne: Motion to Sever Defendant, Joinder Dkt. 787 \u2022 Timothy Enix: Motion to Sever Defendant Dkt. 790 \u2022 Andre Jenkins: Motion to Change Venue Dkt. 522 Motion to Sever Defendant Dkt. 792 Motion for Joinder Dkt. 836</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 29, 2017, the Government filed a consolidated response to Defendants motions for severance. (Dkt. 803). Some defendants filed replies in further support of their motions. (Dkt. 808 (Pirk); Dkt. 809 (Scanlon); Dkt. 810 (Stacharczyck); Dkt. 811 (Enix); Dkt. 812 (Jenkins)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 24, 2017, the Court held oral argument on the motions for severance and for change of venue cataloged above. (Dkt. 844). After the oral argument concluded, the Court orally announced its decision to sever Caruso, Wood, Stacharczyck, and Williams from the trial commencing on January 16, 2018, to defer ruling on Jenkins' motion for severance, and to deny all other motions for severance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also announced its decision to hold the trial commencing on that date in Buffalo, New York. On October 26, 2017, the Court issued a Text Order summarizing its oral decision and indicating that a forthcoming Decision and Order would memorialize the Court's reasoning in further detail. (Dkt 840). This Decision and Order sets forth that reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SEVERANCE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Defendants' Arguments in Support of Severance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Caruso, Wood, Willson, Olejniczak, Stacharczyck, and Osborne each argues, in the main, that he should not be tried with co-defendants who are charged with committing or ordering acts of violence, and particularly, those charged with the overt acts of the murders. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 776 at \u00b6\u00b6 32-39 (Caruso); Dkt. 777 at \u00b6 9 (Wood); Dkt. 782 at \u00b6 28 (Willson); Dkt. 784 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12, 14, 19-21 (Olejniczak); Dkt. 785 at \u00b6 4 (Stacharczyck); Dkt. 787 at \u00b6 5 (Osborne)). These defendants also argue that the admission into evidence of Jenkins' prior state court conviction for the murders would prejudice their rights to a fair trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 776 at \u00b6 28; Dkt. 782 at \u00b6 27; Dkt. 784 at \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 783).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To those ends, Caruso and Willson both ask to be severed from Pirk, Enix, and Jenkins, arguing that these defendants are the only ones charged in the murders. (Dkt. 776 at \u00b6 32 (\"[O]nly these defendants [Pirk, Enix, and Jenkins] are charged in the overt acts of murder which would substantially prejudice the right to a fair trial by Caruso who is not charged in those acts.\"); Dkt. 782 at \u00b6 28 (\"The prejudice stemming from the introduction of evidence against Pirk, Enix, and Jenkins-those charged in the murder-would substantially impede the jury's ability to make a reliable judgment.\")). Olejniczak asks not to be tried with Pirk and Jenkins, arguing that, in contrast to those co-defendants, he is not named in the overt acts of violence contained in the introduction to the RICO conspiracy count. (Dkt. 784 at \u00b6 8, 12, 14, 19-21). Stacharczyck argues that the risk of prejudicial spillover would be too great if he were to be required to stand trial with certain co-defendants (Jenkins, Caruso, Enix, McIndoo, Olejniczak, Pirk, and Willson) who are accused of crimes and acts of violence, including murder. (Dkt. 785 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-7). Osborne argues that his alleged participation in Count 1 is \"minimal,\" as the Indictment attributes only five overt acts to him. (Dkt. 787 at \u00b6 5). He argues that, as a \"peripheral figure,\" he should be severed from his co-defendants, or alternatively, that the Court should adopt the \"groupings\" suggested by Scanlon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Scanlon proposes three trial groups as follows: Group A, consisting of Pirk, Willson, Olejniczak, McIndoo, Caruso, and Enix; Group B, consisting of Williams, Osborne, Wood, Scanlon, and Stacharczyck; and Group C, consisting of Jenkins. (Dkt. 791 at 8). According to Scanlon, Group A consists of those accused of ordering or carrying out violent acts, whereas Group B consists of those accused mainly of obstruction of justice and various possession offenses related to narcotics trafficking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, he proposes isolating Jenkins to Group C in order to ensure that Jenkins' state court murder conviction does not unduly prejudice the defendants in Group A, as well as to allow time for Jenkins' state and federal appeals to be resolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). In support of his proposal, Scanlon argues that a trial of 12 defendants would be unmanageable and in excess of the benchmarks described in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Casamento\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536447\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/887/1141/#p1141\">\n    887 F.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1141-42 (2d Cir. 1989).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12. He disagrees with the notion that the overarching conspiracy count warrants a single trial, pointing out that the Indictment contains several counts that are irrelevant to the RICO conspiracy and charge only certain defendants, and that not all technically relevant evidence is admissible, as it may be cumulative or unduly prejudicial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13). Like his co-defendants, Scanlon also argues that the admission of Jenkins' certificate of conviction would be extremely prejudicial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-18). According\n   to Scanlon, separating defendants who are charged with serious violence from those who are not would address the foregoing concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   McIndoo argues that \"there needs to be at least two separate trials, and that actually Mr. Jenkins should be tried separately from all the others.\" (Dkt. 783). McIndoo disagrees with Scanlon's proposal that McIndoo belonged in the first trial of defendants accused of ordering or carrying out acts of violence, arguing that the violence in which he was allegedly involved was overstated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pirk argues that he should be tried separately from Caruso because Caruso and Pirk have each claimed that the other either committed or caused the murders of Maue and Szymanski, and each claims that the other intended to kill or injure the other. (Dkt. 789 at 3). Pirk also argues that he should not have a joint trial with Caruso because \"the government has specifically accused [Caruso of] engineering an assaultive confrontation with Mr. Pirk on August 3, 2014 as an overt act of the RICO conspiracy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Pirk further argues that a trial with Caruso would violate the principles set forth in\n   <em>\n    Bruton v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    391 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Pirk maintains that he should be tried separately from Jenkins because the Government's use of Jenkins' state court murder conviction will prejudice Pirk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9). Like Scanlon, Pirk argues that the Court should not conduct a single trial in light of the number of defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Enix requests that the Court sever the defendants into two or more separate trial groups, as follows: Group 1, consisting of Enix, Williams, Osborne, Wood, Scanlon, and Stacharczyck; Group 2, consisting of Willson, Olejniczak, McIndoo, and Caruso; and Group 3, consisting of Jenkins and Pirk. (Dkt. 790 at \u00b6 7). According to Enix, this proposal would avoid Enix being tried with co-defendants accused of engaging in or ordering violence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Enix maintains that some co-defendants erroneously read the Indictment to include Enix in the overt acts concerning the murders, but he contends that he is not alleged to have engaged in or ordered violence, including the murders. (Dkt. 790-1 at 3 &amp; n.1). Like Pirk, Enix argues that Jenkins' murder convictions are inadmissible against Enix, and that Caruso should be tried separately from Enix and Pirk because of\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Jenkins argues that, under\n   <em>\n    Bruton,\n   </em>\n   the Court should sever his trial from certain co-defendants who purportedly made statements implicating him in the charged offenses. (Dkt. 792 at 5). Alternatively, he asks that the Court bar admission into evidence of any post-arrest statements, made by non-testifying co-conspirators, that may implicate him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He identifies statements by Pirk, Enix, Caruso, Williams, Osborne, Wood, Scanlon, Stacharczyck, and McIndoo as implicating him and running afoul of\n   <em>\n    Bruton.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Government's Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its consolidated response, the Government argues that severance is not necessary because of the nature of the charged RICO conspiracy, a crime of violence with predicate racketeering activities such as murders, kidnapping, robbery, assaults, drug offenses, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and sales of untaxed cigarettes. (Dkt. 33, Count 1 at \u00b6 28). The Government argues that, because the Indictment charges all Defendants with the RICO conspiracy, the notion that some defendants are more culpable than others is without merit; moreover, in its view, no defendant is a minor player in the conspiracy. (Dkt. 803 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Government's response also includes some concessions. It consents to the severance of Caruso and Williams but maintains that the \"main trial\"-to commence before any trial of Caruso and Williams-should include the remaining ten defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7). The Government also indicates that, if the Court \"prefer[red] two more evenly balanced groups for trial,\" the Government would consent to Wood being severed from the main trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37). The Government also states that it would forgo introducing Jenkins' state court conviction during its case-in-chief in order to protect against spillover prejudice and allow Jenkins to be tried jointly with his co-defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Government further argues that certain statements cited by Defendants do not implicate\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   , namely, the interview between Enix, Pirk, and the FBI on December 11, 2014. (Dkt. 803 at 16-25). The Government maintains that \"all the evidence against Pirk and Jenkins is admissible against Enix, and vice-versa,\" and as a result, \"there is no spillover prejudice, and no reasonable view of the evidence, that should separate defendant Enix from defendants Jenkins and Pirk at trial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28). The Government disagrees with Jenkins that there are any valid\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   concerns arising out of statements by Pirk, Enix, Caruso, Williams, Wood, Osborne, Scanlon, Stacharczyck, and McIndoo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, the Government argues that the number of defendants and length of trial do not require a severance, and that its proposed main trial complies with the benchmarks in\n   <em>\n    Casamento.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Rules Governing Joinder and Severance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Rule 8(b) provides for joinder of defendants \"if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction, or in the same series of acts or transactions, constituting an offense or offenses.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b) (\"The defendants may be charged in one or more counts together or separately. All defendants need not be charged in each count.\"). The Indictment plainly alleges a common scheme and conspiracy involving KMC, with all defendants named in the RICO conspiracy count, among others. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 33). Thus, Defendants are properly joined pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nerlinger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825736\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/967/#p973\">\n    862 F.2d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 973 (2d Cir. 1988) (It is an \"established rule ... that a non-frivolous conspiracy charge is sufficient to support joinder of defendants under Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b).\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 14, \"[i]f the joinder of offenses or defendants in an indictment, an information, or a consolidation for trial appears to prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts, sever the defendants' trials, or provide any other relief that justice requires.\" Fed.

Indeed, the statements cited by Jenkins (Dkt. 792 at \u00b6 9) do not facially incriminate him.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lung Fong Chen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9169626\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/139/#p148\">\n    393 F.3d at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To that end, the Court's severance decision is motivated by the logical presentation of proof and the in-custody status of certain defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Pirk, Enix, and Scanlon are allegedly the three highest-ranking members of the KMC based on the allegations in the Indictment. Based on the Government's allegations and the Court's understanding of the evidence, both Pirk and Jenkins should be tried together as they are both charged with counts of racketeering based on the murders. Moreover, Enix was allegedly Pirk's second-in-command, and through Facebook postings was Pirk's alleged spokesperson, including allegedly engaging in communications to facilitate the planning and subsequent cover-up of the murders. Thus, all three (Pirk, Enix, and Jenkins) should be logically tried together. In addition, Scanlon and Osborne both served in leadership roles within the KMC, including each serving at different times as President of the Olean Chapter. (Dkt. 33 at 8). Willson and Olejniczak are both alleged to have been KMC Nomads (a KMC member who answers only to the National President or Regional Presidents and is expected to serve the interests of the KMC, including through violent acts) and were allegedly involved in the June 7, 2013, shutdown of the Springville Chapter KMC clubhouse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 8-9, 16-17). Willson and McIndoo are both alleged to have been involved in an incident on August 3, 2013, at the Springville KMC Chapter clubhouse, where a shotgun was fired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19). Moreover, as the Government stated at oral argument on October 24, 2017, its view is that all of the defendants-except for Caruso, Williams, and Wood-have either a direct or indirect connection to the murders. Considering their leadership positions within the KMC and the overlap of proof that will be presented, a trial of Pirk, Enix, Jenkins, Scanlon, Willson, Osborne, Olejniczak, and McIndoo is logical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Moreover, certain defendants-including Wood, Williams, Stacharczyck-have been released pending trial.

Defendants' Arguments in Support of Change of Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Pirk moves to change venue or the juror division within the district of his trial, on the basis that \"the populace of Erie and Niagara counties has been subject to an intense and prolonged barrage of media coverage regarding the 'Kingsmen Slaying.' \" (Dkt. 434 at \u00b6\u00b6 76-94). He argues that \"[t]he extensive coverage regarding the trial of Jenkins, who was convicted at the state trial was particularly and unfairly prejudicial against Mr. Pirk depicting him as the motivating force behind the shootings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82). He also suggests that the Government has contributed to the press coverage because, for example, an AUSA is quoted in the article as stating, \" 'This indictment charges the worst of the\n   worst' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86), and, on August 8, 2016, the then-U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York issued a press release concerning a co-defendant's guilty plea in which the KMC was described as \" 'nothing other than a criminal front' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87). In Pirk's view, while the media coverage of the Jenkins trial was intense in Erie and Niagara counties, the media coverage in Rochester area has been sparse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88). Pirk cites both the Sixth Amendment and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21(a) in support of his motion. (Dkt. 434 at \u00b6\u00b6 89-90).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In support of his initial motion to change venue, Pirk attaches articles from the-\n   <em>\n    Buffalo News\n   </em>\n   covering the Jenkins state court proceedings and contends that television and newspaper coverage in the Erie County and Niagara County regions was also extensive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79). Those articles span 95 pages of text. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 434-5). In support of his renewed motion to change venue, which was filed on October 23, 2017, Pirk provides a\n   <em>\n    Buffalo News\n   </em>\n   article dated October 17, 2017, which described a newly filed indictment of four additional KMC members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 833 at \u00b6 12). That article included Pirk's mugshot, along with a reference to Jenkins' state court conviction. (Dkt. 833-1 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Jenkins, also citing the Sixth Amendment and Rule 21(a), argues that his previous state court prosecution \"[a]lmost immediately ... became a major media affair,\" where the \"press coverage was extensive and highly prejudicial.\" (Dkt. 522 at \u00b6 144). He argues that, because of the extremely prejudicial media coverage during his state trial, the Court should move the trial to another district. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 146). As an alternative solution, he joins in Pirk's request to move the trial from Buffalo to Rochester. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 144-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Government's Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Government argues that the Court should deny Pirk's motion to transfer the case to Rochester, whether considered under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 18 or 21, or the Local Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Dkt. 491 at 30-31). The Government contends that substantial publicity, in and of itself, is insufficient to require a change of venue under Rule 21(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 491 at 32). In the Government's view, pretrial publicity is not unique in a so-called \"high profile\" case, nor is it reasonable, in the internet age, to expect that jurors will not have some exposure to information about a high profile case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33). Moreover, the Government argues, the critical requirement is that a juror be impartial,\n   not ignorant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33). The Government also argues that, before voir dire, the defense cannot establish that any juror has fixed opinions about the case; as a result, a motion for change of venue based on pretrial publicity is premature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34). The Government notes that the Buffalo division of the Western District of New York has a population of over 1.5 million people and geographic area of 6,439 square miles. The size of the Buffalo division, according to the Government, should mitigate against any concerns about unfair prejudice, as many potential jurors may not be familiar with the press coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Government also raises challenges to Jenkins' motion for a change of venue that are similar to those that the Government raises against Pirk. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 554 at 67-71). In the main, the Government argues that Jenkins has failed to demonstrate that pretrial publicity will corrupt his trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Rules Regarding Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Pursuant to Rule 18, the Government has properly prosecuted this case in the Western District of New York, and the Court has properly set the place of trial in Buffalo, where the Indictment was returned; defendants, most defense counsel, and the prosecutors are located; the offenses were allegedly committed; and many witnesses are located.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pirk and\n   Jenkins have not disputed these points or offered any claim that a trial in Buffalo would unduly inconvenience them or any witness or victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Rather, Pirk's and Jenkins' arguments focus on the prejudicial nature of pretrial publicity. However, neither the Sixth Amendment nor Rule 21(a) requires a transfer out of the district (as Jenkins requested) or a transfer within the district to Rochester (as Pirk requested and Jenkins requested as an alternative). Without a doubt, in the Buffalo area, pretrial press coverage of this case has been significant during various periods of time following the September 6, 2014, murders. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 434-5). However, Pirk and Jenkins have not shown a reasonable likelihood that the press coverage thus far would prevent them from receiving a fair trial in Buffalo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   First, the size and characteristics of the community weigh against a finding of prejudice. The Government represents that the Buffalo division of this district has a population of 1.5 million people, spread out over 6,439 square miles. (Dkt. 491 at 34). This is significantly greater than the community in\n   <em>\n    Rideau,\n   </em>\n   where the population was 150,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rideau,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720000\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/723/\">\n    373 U.S. at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720000\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/723/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A jury drawn from a population the size of the one in the Buffalo division reduces the likelihood of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Second, the Court finds that, although news coverage has occurred, Pirk and Jenkins have not demonstrated that the press coverage is more than just adverse pretrial publicity. As discussed above, jurors must be impartial, but they need not be ignorant. Although Pirk has suggested that the Government is responsible for generating the publicity, particularly with the August 2016 press release, he has not shown that the press release has so saturated the public's awareness so as to prevent the Court from impaneling an impartial jury over a year after the press release was issued. Likewise, the bulk of the cited newspaper articles were published in 2014, 2015, and 2016-well before this trial is set to begin on January 16, 2018. (Dkt. 434-5 at 95). The exception is the more recent news coverage of the indictment against four additional KMC members; that indictment was filed October 4, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   W.D.N.Y. 1:17-CR-00189 EAW (Dkt. 1)). Although the\n   <em>\n    Buffalo News\n   </em>\n   article about that new indictment is more recent than those cited in Pirk's initial motion for a change of venue, it still precedes the trial by three months, having been published on October 23, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Some\n   </em>\n   publicity does not warrant a transfer. The objected-to press coverage is not enough to convince the Court that the pretrial publicity has been so substantial and inflammatory that Pirk and Jenkins cannot receive a fair trial in the Buffalo division of this district. Indeed, the cited press coverage has been limited primarily to one media outlet-the\n   <em>\n    Buffalo News\n   </em>\n   -and defendants have not identified the permeation of coverage, particularly recently, in other media venues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Finally, any alleged bias among the community in the Buffalo area is likely\n   to be remedied by this Court's careful voir dire questioning of the prospective jurors. Indeed, \"[c]areful voir dire questioning is a recognized and effective tool to uncover bias\" and \"thorough voir dire examinations have been used in [the Second Circuit] to produce unbiased juries, even in high-profile cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Volpe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11613361\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/42/204/#p216\">\n    42 F.Supp.2d at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

However, after the oral argument on October 24, 2017, the Court issued a Decision and Order retaining jurisdiction and concluding that it would proceed to trial with Jenkins on January 16, 2018.

However, as discussed above, the Government has stated that it will forgo introducing Jenkins state court conviction as part of its case-in-chief to ameliorate any concerns about spillover prejudice and to permit Jenkins to be tried with his co-defendants.

In a similar vein, Jenkins sought an order, pursuant to Local Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(c), restraining the Government from speaking to any member of the press. (Dkt. 836). As discussed at oral argument on October 24, 2017, AUSA Tripi did not make statements to the press; rather, he made statements in open court that the press quoted. Accordingly, the motion to restrain the Government was denied as moot because it was withdrawn.
