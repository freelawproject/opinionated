The review, it must be said, was surprising in that so many of the documents could not, consistent with the basic and long standing principles articulated by the Seventh Circuit and other courts, be deemed privileged. Illustrative of the often over broad and unfounded claims of privilege is Document PHILCL007107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is nothing more than a brief cover email from defendants' attorney stating, in full: \"Please see attached for your files. Please contact me with any\n   questions. We hope you have a good weekend.\" We are told-not in any privilege log, but in a letter dated November 29, 2017-that this document was withheld based on attorney client privilege. Nowhere in these three sentences is any advice given or any client confidence revealed. This claim of privilege surely can't be squared with the unbroken line of authority that holds that privilege does not exist merely because a letter emanates from a lawyer to her client.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   cases cited\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 895-96. These types of letters, many of which simply summarize the status of things, appear to be the plurality of the mass of materials the defendant has submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection while claiming they are privileged. Unfortunately, this sort of indiscriminate insistence that materials are privileged appears all too often in modern litigation. Many more documents fall into this category and, of course, they will be required to be produced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Another large portion of the documents the defendant claims to be privileged are nothing more than updates. An email telling the client a letter was sent, or a meeting was being scheduled, or a response was due from the other side,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PHILCL007102, PHILCL007103, PHILCL007104, PHILCL007106, PHILCL007124, PHILCL007130, PHILCL007132, PHILCL007137, PHILCL007145, PHILCL001061, PHILCL001072, etc. are not privileged-unless, of course, we are to abandon the traditional and basic definition of attorney client privilege. The inescapable fact is that none of these kinds of materials reveal advice, or strategy, or disclose client confidences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A number of other documents in this category are said to be privileged although they summarize what occurred in court hearings. So, for example, Document PHILCL001095 says,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Judge Feinerman has set a discovery schedule, notes the due dates, informs of a status date, and so on. Beyond being mere updates revealing no client confidences or advice, such things are a matter of public record. As for work product, the events are certainly not unknown to opposing counsel, and so, the information does not \"enable [plaintiff's counsel] ... to perform its functions either without wits or on wits borrowed from the adversary.\"\n   <em>\n    Hickman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158152\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/329/495/#p516\">\n    329 U.S. at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158152\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/329/495/#p516\">\n    67 S.Ct. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jackson, J., concurring). Thus, the \"specific assertions of [work product] privilege are [not] reasonably consistent with the purposes for which\" the privilege was created.\n   <em>\n    Appleton Papers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048083\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/1018/#p1022\">\n    702 F.3d at 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . All these types of documents, without question, must be produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, there are a fair number of documents that either describe information shared with opposing counsel or information received from opposing counsel. For example, in Document PHILCL007162, defendants' attorney tells her client what she wrote to\n   <em>\n    opposing counsel\n   </em>\n   in a letter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   We have sent a letter to the insured's counsel requesting a scope and estimate of the claimed hail damage and necessary repairs, and indicated that Philadelphia would like to conduct a re-inspection\n   of the property, even if we don't have the scope and estimate in hand. We stated that a re-inspection should be coordinated with the independent adjustor, George Dorsch, and that Towne Place was free to have its own consultant present, too.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Not only does such a document fail to reveal any client confidences or advice, the information is not confidential because it was shared with opposing counsel. A similar example is Document PHILCL007167. It is a cover letter for a letter from plaintiff's counsel which describes the contents of that letter. It's certainly not information gained in confidence from the defendant, and it's certainly not any secret to the other side. While the sharing of actual confidential information with the other side would clearly constitute a waiver,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Judges should be on guard not to approve of privilege claims that are hopelessly inconsistent with basic principles and which trivialize the \"privileges\" that are invoked. Improper and needless assertions of privilege needlessly sap the necessarily limited time of judges, forcing parties with substantial disputes to wait in a longer queue and condemning them to receive less judicial attention when their cases finally are heard. This is a significant problem on which the Seventh Circuit in other contexts has spoken.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Szabo Food Service, Inc. v.

Those logs are specific in terms of the privilege that is being claimed. Thus, both attorney client privilege and work product protection claims are not jointly claimed, save in a few instances. That is, most attorney client privilege assertions do not also contend that the document is protected by the work product doctrine. In ruling on the objections, we have, of course, relied solely on the protection claimed, without regard to whether, for example, claimed protection that was not raised might also be applicable to the privilege expressly raised. \"A court does a disservice to the system, and to one party when it assists the other party in the presentation of its case.
