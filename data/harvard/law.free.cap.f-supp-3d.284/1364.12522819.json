In the situation presented here, \u00a7 351.401(c) did not permit Commerce to use a home market price for the foreign like product that was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   net of a price adjustment satisfying the \u00a7 351.102(b)(38) definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In reaching the opposite conclusion, Commerce made a number of irrelevant findings, including that the terms of Yieh Phui's and Synn's home market rebates \"were not established prior to shipment and invoicing.\"\n   <em>\n    Final Decision Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Similarly irrelevant is the Department's finding that neither company had any \"established standards or policies, written or unwritten, that specify the amount and the possibility\" of rebates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.102\">\n    at 23-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Department's finding that the home market rebates \"could not have issued ... without [antidumping] duty liability in mind\" is also extraneous and irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.102\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These findings are all directed to the wrong question. Under the regulations, the question is not whether the rebates were made according to a \"program\" that satisfied the various prerequisites Commerce identified in the Final Decision Memorandum, or whether they were made for a reason acceptable to Commerce, but whether the monthly rebates were actually reflected in purchasers' net outlays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In reaching conclusions from its findings, the Department's reasoning is erroneous in several respects. First, the Final Decision Memorandum misapplies the Department's regulations in declining to adjust the home market prices for the monthly rebates. As discussed above, Commerce did not conclude that the monthly rebates were not \"reflected in the purchaser's net outlay\" within the meaning of \u00a7 351.102(b)(38) or that the rebates were not \"reasonably attributable to the ... foreign like product\" within the meaning of \u00a7 351.401(c). In addition, as the court has pointed out, Commerce successfully verified that the monthly rebates issued by Yieh Phui and Synn were in fact paid to home market customers. In the circumstances presented by the Department's own findings, the regulations require Commerce to treat these rebates as post-sale price adjustments. Although \u00a7 351.401(b) provides that \"[t]he interested party that is in possession of the relevant information has the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Secretary the amount and nature of a particular adjustment,\" Commerce was not empowered by this general provision, which applies to all adjustments, not merely price adjustments, to ignore the specific standard established by \u00a7 351.401(c), according to which the Secretary must recognize a \"price adjustment\" as defined in \u00a7 351.102(b)(38). Here, Commerce made no findings stating or suggesting that the price adjustments did not occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Final Decision Memorandum also misconstrues the Department's discussion of its regulations in the preamble that accompanied promulgation of the regulations at issue (the \"Preamble\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antidumping Duties;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Countervailing Duties\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C296\">\n    62 Fed.

Contrary to defendant's argument, the Preamble does not support a regulatory interpretation under which Commerce was free to disregard rebates such as those at issue in this case. Rather, the pertinent discussion in the Preamble reveals that in promulgating the final rule Commerce intended for reductions, including post-sale reductions, in the price of the foreign like product to result in adjustments to the starting prices used to determine normal value if they are reflected in the purchaser's net outlay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Preamble explained that \u00a7 351.401(c)\"restated the Department's practice with respect to price adjustments, such as discounts and rebates.\"\n   <em>\n    Final Rule\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C296\">\n    62 Fed.

First, defendant argues that the Department's regulations do not define the term \"rebates\" and that, accordingly, it is free to develop a reasonable interpretation to fill this gap. Def.'s Opp'n 50-51. This argument is specious because the definition of the term \"rebate\" is not the issue in this case.

The latter provision defined \"price adjustment\" broadly and directly contrary to the interpretation Commerce advanced in the Final Decision Memorandum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.102\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(38) (\" 'Price adjustment' means\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   change in the price charged for subject merchandise or the foreign like product,\n   <em>\n    such as\n   </em>\n   discounts, rebates and post-sale price adjustments,\n   <em>\n    that are reflected in the purchaser's net outlay\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added).

The sales Commerce found to have been misreported as code 7 involved merchandise classified in Prosperity's internal Product Coding System as having a mechanical property grade of \"Structural (YS&gt;80 Ksi),\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , as having a minimum specified yield strength\n   <em>\n    greater\n   </em>\n   than 80,000 psi.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prosperity's Br. 9-11, 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The first problem with the Department's misclassification finding is that Commerce did not define in its questionnaire the meaning of the term \"Minimum specified yield strength\" as used in its table of yield strength categories (\"codes\").\n   <em>\n    See Yield Strength Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. As a result, this term could be read to refer to the yield strength as \"specified\" by the manufacturer or as \"specified\" by a standards organization. Second, the four paragraphs that follow do not narrow the meaning of the term \"Minimum specified yield strength\" in the way that Commerce assumed. The court is not aware of any other record information that did so, and defendant points to none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The first paragraph that follows the table consists of a single sentence: \"For example, under ASTM A1079, the minimum specified yield strength for 'Designation CP grade 780T/500Y' is 500 MPa, which converts to approximately 72,519 psi, so for that product, you would report code '6'.\"\n   <em>\n    Yield Strength Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 2. While this sentence refers to an industry standard, ASTM A1079, it does so only as an example, not as a directive to classify products using only yield strength specifications obtained from industry standards. Instead, the example is directed to the conversion of MPa (megapascals) to pounds per square inch. The sentence does not state that only the use of yield strength specifications\n   in established international industry standards, not manufacturer's specifications, are acceptable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The second paragraph fails to communicate that only external standards will suffice because it is not even a complete sentence.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Where no minimum yield strength is required, but a typical minimum is identified within the specification from a standards organization such as ASTM (e.g., under ASTM A653, the typical range of yield strengths for 'Designation CS Type A' is identified as 25,000 psi to 55,000 psi, yielding a typical minimum of 25,000 psi, which in turn falls under reporting code '3').\"). Even were the court to overlook the grammatical problem, it still would conclude that the text does not address the question this case poses. The example in the parenthetical addresses how to report a \"typical minimum\" yield strength where only a \"typical range,\" and not an identified required minimum yield strength, is given. There is no discussion of what constitutes a permissible specification within the universe of possible specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The third paragraph, a single sentence, instructs that \"[i]f no such requirements or guidance on minimum specified yield strength is identified in the specification for the product in question, explain in detail your rationale for using one of the above reporting codes to report this field for the product (do not create additional reporting codes).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This sentence is directed to a situation in which a product specification contained no minimum yield strength specification or guidance. Here, minimum yield specifications existed in the manufacturer's specification and that of the industry standard, and, therefore, this sentence is inapplicable to, and does not resolve, the issue before the court. Moreover, in using the unspecific phrase \"identified in the specification for the product in question,\" the sentence suggests that Commerce intended a broad meaning to the word \"specification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The fourth and final paragraph contains two references to industry standards, but each reference is presented only as an example.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Like the preceding paragraphs, it does not indicate an intent to prohibit a respondent from using a manufacturer's specification for yield strength.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   It might be argued that the examples given in the fourth paragraph and the first two paragraphs suggest that only specifications published by international standards bodies were intended. But even if that interpretation of the instructions were considered,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , to be the more reasonable interpretation, it would not suffice to justify the adverse action Commerce took against Prosperity. The lack of specificity arising from the breadth of the terms Commerce used (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"Minimum specified yield strength\" and \"specification for the product in question\") and from the absence of definitions for those terms convinces the court that Prosperity's interpretation of the Department's reporting instructions was not unreasonable. It follows that Commerce, on this record, was not justified in resorting to the use of the facts otherwise available. Having not requested yield strength information only in the form of yield strength as specified by a standards organization, Commerce was not supported by substantial evidence on the record when it found, per 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(B), that Prosperity failed to provide requested yield strength information. For the same reason, Commerce could not permissibly find that the information Prosperity submitted \"could not be verified\" within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(D). Because the decision to resort to the facts otherwise available was incorrect, so too was the decision to invoke an adverse inference based on an alleged failure by Prosperity \"to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply\n   with a request for information\" from Commerce,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677e(b). Simply stated, Prosperity complied with the instructions as Commerce wrote them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Department's reasoning that Prosperity could have consulted Commerce for clarification of the information request,\n   <em>\n    see Final Decision Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 13, does not convince the court that Commerce acted properly in using the facts otherwise available or an adverse inference. Because Commerce did not effectuate in its instructions its claimed intention to confine yield strength reporting to yield strength specifications in established industry standards, Prosperity did not act unreasonably in interpreting the Department's instructions to allow it to use manufacturer's specifications for this purpose or in not requesting clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendant-intervenors argue, similarly, that Prosperity was \"at the very least negligent\" by \"failing to confirm its understanding\" of the instructions for reporting yield strength with Commerce and that it was Prosperity's \"responsibility to look behind its internal product coding system and report physical characteristics for each sale based on Commerce's model match.\" Def.-Ints.' Opp'n 30. Because the instructions on their face did not require Prosperity to code its products for yield strength based on an established industry standard, the court rejects defendant-intervenors' notion that Prosperity was required in this circumstance to seek clarification. If Commerce is to take an action adverse to a party for an alleged failure to comply with an information request, it must fulfill its own responsibility to communicate its intent in that request. In this instance, the possibility that a respondent would not interpret the instructions according to the Department's subjective and undisclosed intent was a foreseeable consequence of the way Commerce drafted those instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendant and defendant-intervenors argue that the Department's instructions did not permit Prosperity to use producer-specific codes for reporting yield strength. Def.'s Opp'n 18-24; Def.-Ints.' Opp'n 13-15, 16-18. According to defendant-intervenors, the Department's questionnaire \"instructions very clearly require[d] the reporting of MSYS [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , minimum specified yield strength] based on industry specifications published by 'standards organizations such as ASTM.' \" Def.-Ints.' Opp'n 13. This argument overlooks the\n   <em>\n    lack\n   </em>\n   of clarity in the instructions on that point. Defendant argues that \" 'in reporting yield strength, as steel products are commonly (if not virtually exclusively) manufactured to various standards, {Prosperity} was required to code yield strength pursuant to the minimum yield strength required of the standard to which the product was produced and not the actual yield strength of the product itself.' \" Def.'s Opp'n at 19 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Final Decision Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 13). This argument misses the mark because Prosperity, rather than claiming to have reported yield strength based on actual yield strength, claimed that it reported yield strength according to its own manufacturing specifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prosperity's Reply Br. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendant also argues that Prosperity erroneously \"read each paragraph of the instructions in isolation\" and failed to consider \"whether subsequent paragraphs provided additional information that would clarify a term contained in a prior paragraph.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 19-20. The court's individual analysis of the four instructional paragraphs, presented above, demonstrates the flaw in this textual argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    2. Commerce Must Correct Its Error in the Redetermination upon Remand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Because Commerce invoked its authority to use facts otherwise available and an adverse inference according to an invalid\n   finding that misreporting on the part of Prosperity occurred, Commerce must take appropriate corrective action and revise accordingly the affected weighted-average dumping margin (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , either a margin for the combined Yieh Phui/Prosperity/Synn entity or, should it be necessary or appropriate for Commerce to reverse its collapsing decision, for Prosperity).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, Commerce may not use facts otherwise available as a substitute for information that is now on the administrative record of the investigation. Subject to these requirements, the type of corrective action is a matter for Commerce to decide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.
