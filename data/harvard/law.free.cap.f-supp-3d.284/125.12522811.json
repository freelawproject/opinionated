It is important to allow beneficial uses of these devices while also protecting the privacy of residents throughout the City. In order to prevent nuisances and other disturbances of the enjoyment of both public and private space, regulation of pilotless aircraft is required. The following section is intended to promote the public safety and welfare of the City and its residents. In furtherance of its stated purpose, this section is intended to be read and interpreted in harmony with all relevant rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, and any other federal, state and local laws and regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Def.'s Mem., Ex. 2, Newton Ordinances \u00a7 20-64, ECF No. 40-3. \"Pilotless aircraft\" is defined as \"an unmanned, powered aerial vehicle, weighing less than 55 pounds, that is operated without direct human contact from within or on the aircraft.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-64(a). In section (b), the Ordinance imposes certain registration requirements upon owners of all pilotless aircraft.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-64(b). Section (c) sets forth operating prohibitions, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a ban on the use of a pilotless aircraft below an altitude of 400 feet over private property without the express permission of the owner of the private property,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-64(c)(1)(a), \"beyond the visual line of sight of the Operator,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-64(c)(1)(b), \"in a manner that interferes with any manned aircraft,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-64(c)(1)(c), over Newton city property without prior permission,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-64(c)(1)(e), or to conduct surveillance or invade any place where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-64(c)(1)(f)-(g).

RULINGS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Specifically, Singer challenges four subsections of the Ordinance: the registration requirements of section (b) and the operation limits of subsections (c)(1)(a), (c)(1)(b), and (c)(1)(e). Pl.'s Mem 3-4; Pl.'s Resp. i. Singer argues that the Ordinance is preempted by federal law because it attempts to regulate an almost exclusively federal area of law, Pl.'s Mem. 6-15, in a way that conflicts with Congress's purpose,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. In turn, Newton posits that the Ordinance is not preempted by federal law because it falls within an area of law that the FAA expressly carved out for local governments to regulate, Def.'s Mem. 8-10, and thus can be read in harmony with federal aviation laws and regulations,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Preemption Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that federal laws are supreme, U.S. Const. art.

The Fact Sheet also summarizes the Federal responsibility for ensuring the safety of flight as well as the safety of people and property on the ground as a result of the operation of aircraft. Substantial air safety issues are implicated when State or local governments attempt to regulate the operation of aircraft in the national airspace. The Fact Sheet provides examples of State and local laws affecting UAS for which consultation with the FAA is recommended and those that are likely to fall within State and local government authority. For example, consultation with FAA is recommended when State or local governments enact operation UAS restrictions on flight altitude, flight paths; operational bans; or any regulation of the navigable airspace. The Fact Sheet also notes that laws traditionally related to State and local police power-including land use, zoning, privacy, trespass, and law enforcement operations-generally are not subject to Federal regulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2042063\">\n    81 Fed.

Thus, the FAA explicitly contemplates state or local regulation of pilotless aircraft, defeating Singer's argument that the whole field is exclusive to the federal government. The FAA's guidance, however, does not go quite as far as Newton argues-rather than an express carve-out for state and localities to regulate, the guidance hints that whether parallel regulations are enforceable depends on the principles of conflict preemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The FAA, however, explicitly has indicated its intent to be the exclusive regulatory authority for registration of pilotless aircraft: \"Because Federal registration is the exclusive means for registering UAS for purposes of operating an aircraft in navigable airspace, no state or local government may impose an additional registration requirement on the operation of UAS in navigable airspace without first obtaining FAA approval.\" Def.'s Mem., Ex. 14, State and Local Regulation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Fact Sheet\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"FAA UAS Fact Sheet\") 2, ECF No. 40-15. Newton did not obtain FAA approval before enacting the Ordinance. Def.'s Answers Interrogs. 3. Further, regardless of whether there is some space that would allow Newton to require registration of model drones, here Newton seeks to register\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   drones, Tr. 10:3-14, without limit as to the at which altitude they operate, in clear derogation of the FAA's intended authority.

Subsections (c)(1)(a) and (c)(1)(e) work in tandem, however, to create an essential ban on drone use within the limits of Newton. Nowhere in the city may an individual operate a drone without first having permission from the owner of the land below, be that Newton or a private landowner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The FAA is charged with \"prescrib[ing] air traffic regulations on the flight of aircraft ... for-(A) navigating, protecting, and identifying aircraft; (B) protecting individuals and property on the ground; [and] (C) using the navigable airspace efficiently.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040103\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).

Newton's choice to restrict any drone use below this altitude thus works to eliminate any drone use in the confines of the city, absent prior permission. This thwarts not only the FAA's objectives, but also those of Congress for the FAA to integrate drones into the national airspace. Although Congress and the FAA may have contemplated co-regulation of drones to a certain extent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2042063\">\n    81 Fed.
