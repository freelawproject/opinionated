For the following reasons, the Court finds that summary judgment should be granted in favor of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This lawsuit arises out of the termination of Plaintiff's position of tenured professor by the Board of Supervisors (\"the Board\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College (\"LSU\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants are: F. King Alexander (\"Alexander\"), President and Chancellor of LSU; Damon Andrew (\"Dean Andrew\"), Dean of the College of Human Sciences and Education at LSU; A.G. Monaco (\"Monaco\"), the Vice\n   Chancellor of the Office of Human Resource Management at LSU; and Gaston Reinoso (\"Reinoso\"), the Director of the Office of Human Resource Management and Executive Director of Equal Employment Opportunities at LSU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff joined the faculty of LSU in 1995 and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2001.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff created LSU's \"Early Childhood Program,\" a teacher education program for pre-school through third-grade instruction known as the \"PK-3\" program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff is widely published in top academic journals and claims she had demonstrated significant success in securing funding for both her research and early childhood initiatives at LSU.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to the inception of the underlying conduct at issue, Plaintiff was recommended for a promotion to Full Professor following a review process that included the approvals of a Tenure and Promotion Committee, the Director of the School of Education, and the Dean of the College of Human Sciences and Education, Defendant Andrew.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Dean Andrew later rescinded this recommendation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In mid-November 2013, Ed Cancienne (\"Cancienne\"), Superintendent of the Iberville Parish Schools District, complained about Plaintiff's \"professionalism and her behavior\" during her visits to schools in his district while she was overseeing the PK-3 program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cancienne was reportedly very upset because he heard that Plaintiff had been condescending to the teachers during her site visits with LSU student teachers and their mentor teachers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff claims that, in response to this complaint, she attempted to \"smooth Cancienne's ruffled feathers\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   by an email on that same day wherein she apologized for any offense and affirmed that his Parish was \"full of excellent teachers and very bright students.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite this apology, Plaintiff contends Cancienne called her personal cell phone and demanded that she come to his office and discuss the matter \"just the two of us.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff admits she had no desire to meet with Cancienne alone as she had previously reported to Associate Dean Jennifer Curry (\"Curry\") that Cancienne had flirted with her and she thought him \"creepy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff maintains that Curry and another female LSU faculty member shared this view of Cancienne.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Cancienne and Plaintiff spoke on the phone about this incident, Cancienne called Curry to complain that he had been advised that, while Plaintiff was at an Iberville school to assess a PK-3 program student teacher, Plaintiff referred to Cancienne as \"crazy\", \"talked awful about our schools,\" and used the word \"pussy three times.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Plaintiff claims Cancienne advised Curry that if Plaintiff returned to Iberville schools, he would \"have\n   her arrested.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Cancienne clearly objected to Plaintiff's use of the term \"pussy,\" he claimed that he did not believe it was used in a sexual context or to engage in sexual harassment, but was used as part of Plaintiff's instruction to student teachers regarding coping with parents who may use different vocabularies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff claims that LSU investigators never inquired into the nature of Cancienne's complaints and only assumed, without supporting evidence, that Plaintiff's use of the word \"pussy\" was slang for female genitalia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Plaintiff contends that no one at LSU inquired into the actual nature of Cancienne's concerns, which she claims were primarily based on Plaintiff's criticism of his school and teachers and not related to any kind of sexual harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Student complaints also formed the basis of the investigation into Plaintiff's conduct. Curry testified that two of Plaintiff's students requested a meeting to discuss their complaints about Plaintiff's classroom behavior. Student 1 claimed she was offended by Plaintiff's comments about Student 1's sexual relationship with her fianc\u00e9. Student 1 stated that she was humiliated by Plaintiff's references to her sexual relationship in front of her classmates. According to Student 1:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Buchanan had offered them condoms, had told them it was unacceptable to become pregnant. And that if you chose to become a mother, that your grades would suffer for that. She told them ... enjoy the sex while the sex is-good. If you're dating-if you're dating, make sure the sex is good, something along those lines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Student 1 was also particularly offended when, after having advised Plaintiff that her fianc\u00e9 was very supportive, Plaintiff allegedly responded, \"yeah, he's supportive now while the sex is good, but just wait until you're married five years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Curry testified that Student 1 stated: \"I don't know who she is to make these assumptions about me, and to say it in front of a room full of people.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Student 1 also reported to Curry that Plaintiff had recorded a student (Student 2) crying during an assessment team meeting and played the recording back for the student.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Student 2 met with Curry and complained that Plaintiff had intimidated and demeaned her by video recording this incident during a team assessment meeting. Regarding this incident, Dr. Curry testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ... during her assessment team meeting, [the student] began to cry. She said that Dr. Buchanan was yelling at her. And that when she started to cry, Dr. Buchanan got out her cell phone and did not ask her, but started to record her crying and then played it back for her, she said, look at yourself, look at yourself, you need to check yourself in somewhere and get help, get a break.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Curry further testified that Student 2 reported that this meeting was \"mortifying,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Terry [Plaintiff] was extremely aggressive during this assessment team meeting. She said every time she tried to talk, Terry would say, shut up, you're not listening, be quiet, be quiet, like screaming at her, very aggressive. She said it was more than intimidating. Like she felt attacked, fearful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff claims that no administrator met with her to discuss these allegations, and they never disclosed to her these student complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Plaintiff does not deny that these incidents took place. Plaintiff acknowledges that the administration obtained a written complaint in the winter of 2012 purporting to represent the views of Plaintiff's \"Junior PK-3 Cohort\" complaining that Plaintiff made several offensive comments, such as: (1) stating that \"a woman is thought to be a dike if she wears brown pants\"; (2) \"it was a choice to be in the program and it was not the fault or problem of the professors if any of us chose to be mommies or wives and not to expect to get an A in the class\"; and (3) that Plaintiff used \"extreme profanity on a regular basis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends \"[i]t was never established the letter actually came from a 'cohort' and was not just a random complaint from a disgruntled student.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Plaintiff contends that there is no evidence that this student or cohort was speaking on behalf of anyone other than him/herself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Curry reported the student complaints to Dean Andrew who subsequently met with Dr. Earl Cheek (\"Dr. Cheek\"), Director of the College of Education, regarding same. Curry testified that Dr. Cheek advised that between ten and twelve students had come to his office and reported similar complaints about Plaintiff's behavior and her \"talking about sex.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cheek further reported that local elementary school administrators had requested that Plaintiff not mentor students on their campuses. According to Curry, Dr. Cheek claimed he had relayed these complaints to Dean Lindsay (who preceded Dean Andrew) and to Human Resources but was advised nothing could be done because Plaintiff was tenured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The Investigation\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dean Andrew instructed Curry to gather all information regarding prior complaints, and, while in the process of doing this, Curry was contacted by Cancienne, who advised that Plaintiff was no longer authorized to be on any Iberville Parish school campus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   After gathering additional evidence, Curry and Dean Andrew sought help from Human Resources regarding Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Human Resources Management administrator Reinoso interviewed witnesses and reported his findings to Dean Andrew, who then recommended to Provost Bell the appointment of a Policy Statement-104 (\"PS-104\") Faculty Senate Grievance Committee (\"the faculty committee\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The PS-104 committee conducted a 12 hour hearing during which several witnesses testified about Plaintiff's classroom behavior, including Plaintiff's friend Karen Donnelly (\"Donnelly\") who is an adjunct instructor in the PK-3 program. Donnelly testified that she had reported her concerns to Dr. Cheek about Plaintiff's behavior in the Zachary Community School System because Plaintiff's behavior was \"threatening our program, and Zachary is our best placement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Donnelly also confirmed that she observed Plaintiff use profanity in the classroom\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   and heard the remarks about which students had complained. Donnelly also testified that she knew of complaints from four elementary schools that would no longer allow Plaintiff to mentor student teachers; Donnelly testified to knowledge of complaints about Plaintiff's behavior from Zachary schools,\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   the LSU Lab School,\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Port Allen Elementary School,\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Iberville Parish Schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Donnelly confirmed that Reinoso accurately reported that Plaintiff typically makes comments about sex because \"that is how she is.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked what was meant by the comment that Plaintiff had \"no self-awareness of what she says,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Donnelly responded: \"I'm not sure that was my exact word, but it's like when I said she doesn't have a filter. She just doesn't realize what sometimes she says, and how it sounds. She doesn't mean it the way, you know, it sounds, sometimes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Donnelly also confirmed that she was present when Plaintiff spoke to students about condoms to avoid pregnancy\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   and when Plaintiff advised a student in an assessment meeting about the quality of sex in a relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Donnelly testified that she did not believe Plaintiff's behavior was worse than it had always been but that \"girls are more vocal nowadays.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On December 20, 2013, Plaintiff was informed by Dean Andrew that she was being removed from the classroom for the Spring 2014 semester while multiple issues were investigated by the Human Resources Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 15, 2014, Plaintiff met with LSU Human Resource Management administrators, including Reinoso, to discuss the allegations of complaints by students and school administrators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the investigation, Plaintiff admitted to using profanity and language of a sexual nature which she claimed supported her \"overall pedagogical strategy when teaching at LSU.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff\n   agreed that, while not a direct quote, she used such language to \"get the attention of students\" and \"loosen them up.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 26, 2014, Plaintiff received a memorandum from Reinoso finding her \"actions and behavior\" to be \"inappropriate, unwelcome, and a direct violation of the University's Policy Statements on Sexual Harassment, PS-73 and PS-95.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reinoso further stated: \"Beyond your sexually oriented comments, your reported communication style with students, faculty, and outside administrators has been found to be inappropriate, as you often use profanity in your communication.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   This memorandum led to a June 12, 2014 meeting between Plaintiff and Dean Andrew. Reinoso testified that his role was to determine if Plaintiff's behavior violated policy, but he could not recommend Plaintiff's termination because he lacked the power to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff challenges Reinoso's findings, arguing that his report failed to differentiate general allegations against her versus those that constituted harassment. Plaintiff further contends Reinoso's deposition testimony clarified that several allegations against Plaintiff did not support a finding that Plaintiff violated LSU's sexual harassment policy. Plaintiff claims that Reinoso's deposition testimony confirms that only the following allegations supported his finding that she violated the sexual harassment policy: (1) Plaintiff's remark to a student about birth control and condoms; (2) Plaintiff's remark to a student that her fianc\u00e9 was only supportive now because \"the sex is good\"; (3) the use of profanity in certain contexts; and (4) the allegation that Plaintiff referenced her own sex life in class after she went through a divorce. Plaintiff contends these allegations do not meet the standard of severe, pervasive, or objectively offensive such that she should have been terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff claims she was not provided with Reinoso's report, which was endorsed by Monaco and then discussed amongst Reinoso, Monaco, and Dean Andrew, but was only given a shorter, condensed memorandum of findings that did not detail specific allegations against her or identify witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of Reinoso's report, Dean Andrew chose to pursue disciplinary proceedings against Plaintiff and requested that Plaintiff meet with him on June 12, 2014 to discuss the report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   During this meeting, Plaintiff claims Dean Andrew provided her a one-page list of the policies she was accused of violating and asked that she respond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dean Andrew later wrote that Plaintiff \"admitted to using profanity and language of a sexual nature, claiming it supported [her] overall pedagogical strategy when teaching at LSU,\" and that Plaintiff stated something to the effect that such language was used to \"get the attention of students\" and \"loosen them up.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In reaction to Plaintiff's response, on June 17, 2014, Dean Andrew advised Plaintiff, in writing, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   I find this explanation to be unacceptable, and I do not condone any practices where sexual language and profanity are\n   used when educating students, particularly those who are being educated to serve as PK-3 professionals. As a PK-3 faculty member, you are expected to set a good example for your students in the profession, and receiving bans from multiple school districts as a result of your inappropriate behavior does little to support legitimacy in the classroom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Andrew's correspondence further advised Plaintiff that he was considering pursuing dismissal \"for cause\" proceedings under LSU policy PS-104.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff contends she responded to Dean Andrew on July 1, 2014, advising that she had to contend with \"vague and indefinite charges,\" and that, \"[b]efore listening to the context or intention underlying my actions,\" Dean Andrew at the Human Resources Management team had drawn unfair conclusions that denied her \"due process\" and resulted in her loss of a promotion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also questioned the reliability of the report findings which she claims \"centered on the complaints of a few disgruntled students and answers to leading questions of others, entirely discounting my explanation of the events.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Despite her response, Plaintiff claims she was informed of Dean Andrews' July 14, 2014 recommendation to Provost Stuart Bell that she be dismissed for cause from LSU ten days later on July 24, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 30, 2014, Provost Bell requested a PS-104 proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff alleges she wrote to Provost Bell on August 3, 2014 to reiterate due process concerns and to explain how the complained-of speech was part of her pedagogical strategy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[Profanity] is part of the common vernacular even among very young children today, and teacher-education students need to be aware that they will be confronted with that language and professionally decide how they will respond.

Further, Plaintiff's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    van Herdeen\n   </em>\n   is without merit and without any jurisprudential support.

Plaintiff's argument that \"Defendants' various actions are part of a single course of conduct that applied an unconstitutional sexual harassment standard and culminated in\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   her termination is a clear attempt to apply the continuing violation theory to her First Amendment retaliation claim.

Indeed, there is no allegation that either of them even recommended her dismissal. Thus, any claims against Reinoso or Monaco for unlawful termination are dismissed as a matter of law. Plaintiff does allege that Dean Andrew recommended her dismissal to the Provost, and that Chancellor Alexander recommended her dismissal to the Board following the faculty committee hearing. Reading the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that Andrew and Alexander caused her termination. However, the discrete act by Andrew occurred 18 months prior to Plaintiff filing suit and has been dismissed as prescribed. In any event, both Andrew and Alexander are entitled to qualified immunity for Plaintiff's termination as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Culbertson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   and for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The First Amendment protects a public employee's right, in certain circumstances, to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern. A First Amendment retaliation claim requires proof of the following elements: (1) an adverse employment action; (2) speech involving a matter of public concern; (3) the employee's interest in speaking must outweigh the employer's interest in promoting efficiency in the workplace, and (4) the employee's speech motivated the employer's adverse employment action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Garcetti v.

Such balancing involves a question of law for the court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Fifth Circuit noted that \"[t]he 'rights' of the speaker are thus always tempered by a consideration of the rights of the audience and the public purpose served, or disserved, by his speech. Appellant's argument, by ignoring his audience and the lack of any public purpose in his offensive epithets, founders on several fronts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court held as follows regarding whether Martin's speech was a matter of public concern:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   There is no doubt that Martin's epithets did not address a matter of public concern. One student described Martin's June 19, 1984, castigation of the class as an explosion, an unprovoked, extremely offensive, downgrading of the entire class. In highly derogatory and indecent terms, Martin implied that the students were inferior because they were accustomed to taking courses from inferior, part-time instructors at Midland College. The profanity described Martin's attitude toward his students, hardly a matter that, but for this lawsuit, would occasion public discussion. Appellant has not argued that his profanity was for\n   any purpose other than cussing out his students as an expression of frustration with their progress-to \"motivate\" them-and has thereby impliedly conceded his case under\n   <em>\n    Connick.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Fifth Circuit further held that, \"[r]epeated failure by a member of the educational staff of Midland College to exhibit professionalism degrades his important mission and detracts from the subjects he is trying to teach.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit noted the trial testimony that Martin's conduct strongly influenced the students in that one student claimed he had \"lost interest in economics as a result of Martin's belittling comments,\" and another student \"expressed his reticence to asking questions in class for fear of Martin's ridicule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the court held: \"To the extent that Martin's profanity was considered by the college administration to inhibit his effectiveness as a teacher, it need not be tolerated by the college... .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, distinguishing jurisprudence on which Martin relied, the Fifth Circuit stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   However, we hold that the students in Martin's classroom, who paid to be taught and not vilified in indecent terms, are subject to the holding of\n   <em>\n    Pacifica\n   </em>\n   , which, like\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   , recognizes that surroundings and context are essential, case-by-case determinants of the constitutional protection accorded to indecent language. Martin's language is unprotected under the reasoning of these cases because, taken in context, it constituted a deliberate, superfluous attack on a \"captive audience\" with no academic purpose or justification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Although not binding, decisions from other federal appellate courts also support the Court's holding. The Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bonnell v. Lorenzo\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   is particularly applicable to this case. The college professor in\n   <em>\n    Bonnell\n   </em>\n   was disciplined for his gratuitous in-class use of the words \"pussy,\" \"cunt,\" and \"fuck,\" which had given rise to a sexual harassment complaint filed by one of the professor's students.\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Bonnell's offensive language was \"not germane to the subject matter,\" the court concluded that he did \"not have a constitutional right to use [these terms] in a classroom setting.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the\n   university had issued a warning to the plaintiff as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Unless germane to discussion of appropriate course materials and thus a constitutionally protected act of academic freedom, your utterance in the classroom of such words as 'fuck,' 'cunt,' and 'pussy' may serve as a reasonable basis for concluding as a matter of law that you are fostering a learning environment hostile to women, a form of sexual harassment. Federal and state law imposes a duty on the College to prevent the sexual harassment of its students and therefore requires that the College discipline you if it finds that you have created a hostile environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Despite this warning, the complaints about Bonnell continued.

The administrators moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district\n   court held the administrators were not entitled to qualified immunity, and they appealed. The background facts are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   In the summer of 1994, Vega taught a six-week composition course at the College's Summer Institute, a program designed for pre-freshmen who need remedial courses prior to matriculation. The students were male and female, aged 17 and 18. On July 21, Vega conducted a free-association exercise called \"clustering,\" in which students were invited to select a topic, then call out words related to the topic, and finally group related words together into \"clusters.\" According to Vega, the exercise is intended to help students reduce the use of repetitive words in college-level essays.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   The students selected \"sex\" as the topic for the \"clustering\" exercise. Vega understood the topic to be \"sex and relationships.\" Vega then invited the students to call out words or phrases related to the topic, and he wrote at least many of their responses on the blackboard. The first words called out were, as Vega described them, \"very safe words,\" such as \"marriage,\" \"children,\" and \"wedding ring.\" As the exercise continued, the words called out included \"penis,\" \"vagina,\" \"fellatio,\" and \"cunnilingus.\" Toward the end of the exercise, with all but one of the students yelling and two standing on chairs, the following words and phrases were called out: \"cluster fuck,\" \"slamhole,\" \"bearded clam,\" \"fist fucking,\" \"studded rubbers,\" \"your [sic] so hard,\" and \"eating girls out.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Vega wrote many of the words on the blackboard, but \"[a]t no point in the session did Vega seek to curtail the vulgarity of what the students were yelling, or terminate the exercise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    188\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the students in the class ever complained about this, but it came to the attention of the administrators while investigating another matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Vega was confronted about this exercise, and he turned over his lesson plans which included many provocative topics. Vega was advised that the administrators found the exercise inappropriate, and that \"it opened the door to bad publicity and possible sexual harassment complaints.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    190\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vega was advised that he would not be offered reappointment for the upcoming school year. Vega's contract was officially terminated, and the supporting memorandum explained that Vega's termination was due to his \" 'reliance on sex as a theme' and 'use of sexually explicit vocabulary' in the clustering exercise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    191\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, Vega filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In considering Vega's First Amendment academic freedom claim, the court noted jurisprudence that \"serves as a caution to governmental administrators not to discipline a college teacher for expressing controversial, even offensive, views lest a 'pall of orthodoxy' inhibit the free exchange of ideas in the classroom,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    192\n   </footnotemark>\n   but distinguished Vega's conduct finding that \"Vega's toleration of the students' shouted vulgarities was far removed from [another plaintiff's] expression of his political views.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    193\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   court also noted that, while \"a teacher may not be disciplined simply because a vulgar word is contained\n   and discussed in assigned materials, at least for students of suitable age, ... the vulgarities Vega permitted to be called out in his classroom were not part of an etymological exploration, nor was the scene in which all of the students but one were yelling their contributions, with two standing on chairs, an academic discussion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    194\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   court also held that, considering the state of the law at the time of Vega's conduct, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity for disciplining Vega:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   [T]he Defendants could reasonably believe that in disciplining Vega for not exercising professional judgment to terminate the episode, they were not violating his clearly established First Amendment academic freedom rights. Even though no students complained, what students will silently endure is not the measure of what a college must tolerate or what administrators may reasonably think that a college need not tolerate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    195\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiff likens her case to\n   <em>\n    Hardy v. Jefferson Community College.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    196\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit held that a professor's right to use the words \"nigger\" and \"bitch\" during a classroom discussion on the power of words to marginalize and oppress outweighed the college's interest in regulating offensive speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    197\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   involved the use of controversial words in a class identified as \"Introduction to Interpersonal Communication.\" The students were to examine how language is used to marginalize minorities and other oppressed groups in society. The lecture included an analysis of words that have historically served the interests of the dominant culture in which they arise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    198\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   is easily distinguished from the present case. There is no argument or jurisprudence before the Court which support Plaintiff's claim that using the word \"pussy\" and \"fuck,\" or discussing her own or students' sex lives and/or reproductive decisions, are relevant to educating students on becoming teachers of preschool through third grade students. These words and/or discussions are not relevant to the subject matter being taught. Indeed, even\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   makes clear that academic freedom protects only speech in the context of instructional communication of \"an idea transcending personal interest or opinion which impacts our social and/or political lives.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    199\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even in\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   , the objectionable conduct and language was related to the class material and used as part of class assignments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    200\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Applying the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   to the facts of this case, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact that her comments were in any way related to her pedagogical strategy for teaching preschool and elementary education to future teachers. Plaintiff has presented no summary judgment evidence that use of the words \"pussy,\" \"fuck,\" and other explicit words are germane to the subject matter being taught. Discussions of students and/or Plaintiff's sex lives in class is likewise not related in any way to the subject matter being taught. As found in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has offered no evidence that her\n   speech and/or conduct served an academic purpose or justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Further, the student complaints herein in many ways mirror those in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   in that Plaintiff's students avoided her class, avoided speaking up in class, and felt embarrassed and/or harassed by Plaintiff's conduct. Dr. Cheek reported that a \"cohort\" of between ten and twelve students complained that they felt sexually harassed by Plaintiff and submitted a written complaint in 2012 regarding Plaintiff's classroom language and conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    201\n   </footnotemark>\n   Curry testified that one student previously discussed felt \"attacked\" and fearful\" following Plaintiff's classroom conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    202\n   </footnotemark>\n   Curry testified that, when asked if she wanted to speak to Plaintiff about the incident, this student responded: \"I don't want to ever have her as a professor again.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    203\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the fact that Zachary Schools, the LSU Lab School, Port Allen Elementary Schools, and Iberville Parish Schools had either banned Plaintiff from their campuses or requested that LSU not allow her to mentor their student teachers due to Plaintiff's conduct and speech further demonstrates that Plaintiff's conduct and speech served no pedagogical purpose. Rather, the record supports a finding that Plaintiff's behavior and speech interfered with the educational opportunities of her students both in the classroom and in the student teacher or field setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiff has utterly failed to present any summary judgment evidence establishing how her conduct and language related in any way to assignments, instruction, and education of preschool and elementary teachers. The argument that Plaintiff used such language because her students would encounter same by their future preschool through third grade students and parents is unsupported by any record evidence and rejected by the Court as spurious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that Plaintiff's speech is not protected by the academic freedom exception to\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   and did not involve a matter of public concern. As such, \"it is unnecessary for the court to scrutinize the reason for the discipline.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    204\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, it is undisputed that Plaintiff's speech was made while performing her official duties of teaching and supervising student teachers. Plaintiff's argument that the speech was part of her pedagogical strategy is unsupported by evidence and without merit as set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Even if the Plaintiff's speech were protected, the Court, nonetheless, finds that the Defendants are entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. Based on the clearly established law in place at the time of Plaintiff's conduct, the Court finds that the actions of the Defendants were objectively reasonable. It was objectively reasonable for Defendants Monaco, Reinoso, and Dean Andrew, prompted by complaints from students and the fact that several local schools would not allow Plaintiff to return to their campuses, to conduct an investigation into Plaintiff's conduct, report such findings up the administrative chain, and recommend a due process hearing before a faculty committee. The Court further finds that Alexander's conduct-recommending Plaintiff's dismissal to the Board despite the faculty committee's recommendation for censure-was also objectively reasonable under the facts of this case. LSU policy clearly allows the Chancellor to make his own recommendation\n   irrespective of that of the faculty committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    205\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's First Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Constitutional Challenge to LSU's Sexual Harassment Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that LSU's sexual harassment policies are unconstitutional both facially and as-applied because they are overbroad and lack the necessary objective test for offensiveness. Defendants challenge Plaintiff's standing to seek a declaratory judgment that LSU's sexual harassment policies are unconstitutional pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 and a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing these policies on LSU faculty and students. Defendants also contend LSU's policies are reasonable\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   for purposes of qualified immunity because the policies are consistent with federal policies on sexual harassment. Defendants maintain that they reasonably believed Plaintiff's speech in violation of the policies was unprotected under the First Amendment. LSU's sexual harassment policies are allegedly consistent with the United States Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (\"OCR\") and Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") \"blueprint for colleges and universities throughout the country.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    206\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Plaintiff argues she has standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the Defendants because, although she no longer teaches at LSU, and may not return, \"the collateral and future consequences of applying PS-73 and PS-95 to her, given the blemish on her record, afford her standing to challenge them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    207\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Plaintiff claims that any regulation of harassment aimed at preventing a hostile educational environment must be drafted and applied with narrow specificity to avoid violating the First Amendment. Plaintiff contends the sexual harassment definitions in LSU's policies violate the basic constitutional requirements set forth by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    208\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Plaintiff contends LSU's policy definitions are effectively the same as those held unconstitutional by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    DeJohn v. Temple University.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    209\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on the Third Circuit's language, Plaintiff contends that \"unwelcome verbal ... behavior of a sexual nature,\" without any requirement of objective offensiveness or interference with a reasonable person's access to his or her education, encompasses any potentially sex-related speech deemed \"unwelcome\" even if that person is uniquely sensitive. Citing the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Papish v. Board of Curators of Univ. of Mo.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    210\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff maintains that, \"[u]nder the First Amendment, a public institution may not broadly ban any sex-related speech based simply on its potential to offend.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    211\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Plaintiff contends that LSU's policies lack the requirement of an objective test for offensiveness and are, thus, unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiff also contends Defendants' reliance on the OCR/DOJ blueprint is irrelevant as various university speech codes and enforcement actions have been invalidated\n   despite the schools' invocation of their obligation to enforce such rules under civil rights statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    212\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues that the OCR/DOJ blueprint upon which LSU relies lacks necessary constitutional safeguards, and \"[n]o 'interpretive guidance' from the federal government can alter these constitutional minimums.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    213\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends that federal agency interpretations cannot immunize universities against constitutional claims because such pronouncements are only controlling if they do not violate the Constitution. As the Supreme Court has stated, courts cannot \"accept the contention that the State has a compelling interest in complying with [ ] whatever mandates [DOJ] issues.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    214\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In addition to challenging the facial constitutionality of LSU's policies, Plaintiff also contends these policies were unconstitutional as applied to her. Plaintiff claims Reinoso did not examine events in context, particularly Cancienne's initial complaints. Plaintiff contends this complaint became a center-piece of the sexual harassment findings although Cancienne was more upset that his school had been criticized and testified that he did not interpret Plaintiff's comments as sexual in nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    215\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff further argues that Cancienne's complaint that Plaintiff used the word \"pussy\" somehow \"telephoned\" its way into complaints regarding a student who was not present for the utterances, and was then repeated across the sexual harassment findings and recommendations although it was later admitted that Cancienne applied no sexual connotation to the term.\n   <footnotemark>\n    216\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff maintains Reinoso could have learned of this had he spoken to Cancienne and not relied on what others passed along and his own assumptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Plaintiff further claims that most of the statements described in Reinoso's report did not contribute to his ultimate finding because many witness claims were not corroborated and others did not support this finding at all as they had nothing to do with sexual harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    217\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Plaintiff contends most of the expletives and colloquialisms emphasized by some witnesses admittedly did not constitute sexual harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    218\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, most of what was deemed inappropriate did not play a role in the sexual harassment finding.

The\n   <em>\n    Saxe\n   </em>\n   policy contained a catch-all category of \"other personal characteristics\" upon which one could be harassed that is not present in the LSU policies, and it even prohibited speech directed at one's \"values.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    261\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Saxe\n   </em>\n   is applicable to the issue herein only to the extent that it holds that a \"severe or pervasive\" requirement should be in a policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Plaintiff also relies heavily on another Third Circuit decision,\n   <em>\n    DeJohn v. Temple University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    262\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it is the strongest case in her favor. In\n   <em>\n    DeJohn\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff filed suit against Temple University arguing that the following university policy governing sexual harassment was overbroad:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   For all individuals who are part of the Temple community, all forms of sexual harassment are prohibited, including ... expressive, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual or gender-motivated nature, when ... (c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work, educational performance, or status; or (d) such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    263\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The plaintiff complained that, because of the harassment policy, \"he felt inhibited in expressing his opinions in class concerning women in combat and women in the military.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    264\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    DeJohn\n   </em>\n   court noted: \"It is well recognized that '[t]he college classroom with its surrounding environs is peculiarly the \"marketplace of ideas [,]' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    265\n   </footnotemark>\n   and '[t]he First Amendment guarantees wide freedom in matters of adult public discourse.'\n   <footnotemark>\n    266\n   </footnotemark>\n   Discussion by adult students in a college classroom should not be restricted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    267\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    DeJohn\n   </em>\n   Court began its analysis by explaining that \"there is no 'harassment exception' to the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause; that is, 'we have found no categorical rule that divests harassing speech, as defined by federal anti-discrimination statutes, of First Amendment protection.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    268\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found the policy at issue in\n   <em>\n    DeJohn\n   </em>\n   overbroad because the policy focused on the motive of the speaker and not just the effect the speech had on the learning environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    269\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court reached this conclusion through a careful application of the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   , which requires that a school must show that speech will cause a material or substantial disruption before prohibiting it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    270\n   </footnotemark>\n   Temple's inclusion of regulation based on the speaker's intent was \"contrary to\n   <em>\n    Tinker'\n   </em>\n   s requirement that speech cannot be prohibited in the absence of a tenable threat of disruption.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    271\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The court stated in particular that the policy's use of the words \"hostile,\" \"offensive,\" and \"gender-motivated\" is \"on its face, sufficiently broad and subjective that they 'could conceivably be applied to cover any speech' of a 'gender-motivated' nature 'the content of which offends someone.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    272\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, \"[a]bsent any requirement akin to a showing of severity or pervasiveness-that is, a requirement that the conduct objectively and subjectively creates a hostile environment or substantially interferes with an individual's work-the policy provides no shelter for core protected speech.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    273\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The court also took issue with the language \"unreasonably interefere[s] with an individual's work,\" stating that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   probably falls short of satisfying the\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   standard. If we were to construe \"unreasonable\" as encompassing a subjective and objective component, it still does not necessarily follow that speech which effects an unreasonable interference with an individual's work justifies restricting another's First Amendment freedoms. Under\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   , students may express their opinions, even on controversial subjects, so long as they do so \"without colliding with the rights of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p509\">\n    393 U.S. at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p509\">\n    89 S.Ct. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As we observed in Saxe, while the precise scope of this language is unclear,\n   <em>\n    Saxe\n   </em>\n   , 240 F.3d at 217, we do believe that a school has a compelling interest in preventing harassment. Yet, unless\n   harassment is qualified with a standard akin to a severe or pervasive requirement, a harassment policy may suppress core protected speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    274\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   It is important to note, however, that the\n   <em>\n    DeJohn\n   </em>\n   court did not suggest that all anti-harassment policies violate the First Amendment. Indeed, the Third Circuit has previously emphasized that \"preventing discrimination in the workplace-and in schools-is not only a legitimate, but a compelling, government interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    275\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, relevant to the present case, the\n   <em>\n    DeJohn\n   </em>\n   court suggested that Temple's policy could have provided shelter for protected speech if it \"contained a requirement that the conduct objectively and subjectively create[d] a hostile environment\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      or\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   substantially interfere[d] with an individual's work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    276\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also notes that there is a distinction between a university's obligation to regulate the classroom speech of its students and that of its faculty. Indeed, the university has a responsibility and obligation to ensure that its students are not being harassed or abused by those it has hired to educate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The Court acknowledges that the language in LSU's policies is similar to that in the policy at issue in\n   <em>\n    DeJohn\n   </em>\n   , but the policies are not exactly the same. Although they lack the exact words \"severe\" or \"pervasive,\" LSU's policies do inject an objective standard and require a heightened level of offense by the phrase \"so offensive to a reasonable person\" in PS-73, which is further enhanced by the definitions and examples of prohibited conduct set forth in the policy as quoted above. The definitions and examples set forth in the policy reveal a requirement that the conduct be severe and pervasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The Court has also considered the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. San Bernardino Valley College\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    277\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is, in the Court's view, the most factually analogous to the case before the Court. In\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   , a tenured professor brought a Section 1983 action against public community college officials in response to a student grievance claiming sexual harassment which allegedly violated the professor's First Amendment rights. Cohen taught a remedial English class wherein one student became offended by Cohen's repeated focus on topics of a sexual nature, his use of profanity and vulgarities, and by his comments she believed were directed intentionally at her and other female students in a humiliating and harassing manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    278\n   </footnotemark>\n   During a particular class, Cohen began a class discussion on pornography and played \"devil's advocate\" by asserting controversial viewpoints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    279\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cohen proceeded to give the students an assignment discussing pornography, and the complaining student asked for an alternative assignment. When Cohen refused to accommodate this request, the student stopped attending Cohen's class and received a failing grade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    280\n   </footnotemark>\n   The student then complained to the English Department and filed a formal written student grievance pursuant to a new sexual harassment policy implemented by the university.\n   <footnotemark>\n    281\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy in\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, written, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. It\n   includes, but is not limited to, circumstances in which:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   1. Submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a student's academic standing or status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   2. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive learning environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   3. Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for academic success or failure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    282\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The Grievance Committee held a hearing and concluded that Cohen had violated the policy by creating a hostile learning environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    283\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cohen appealed this decision to the Board which considered the matter with new hearings. Both Cohen and the student were represented by attorneys, and each of them testified. Additionally, several students came forward and testified about the sexual nature of Cohen's teaching material and his frequent use of derogatory language, sexual innuendo, and profanity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    284\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the Board found Cohen in violation of the policy, ordered him to take specific corrective actions, and warned him that further violation of the policy would result in further discipline \"up to and including suspension or termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    285\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The Ninth Circuit held that the university's policy was unconstitutionally broad and violated Cohen's constitutional rights:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   In this case, the College punished Cohen based on his teaching methods under the provision of the Policy which prohibits conduct which has the \"effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive learning environment.\" Cohen, admittedly, uses a confrontational teaching style designed to shock his students and make them think and write about controversial subjects. He assigns provocative essays such as Jonathan Swift's \"A Modest Proposal\" and discusses controversial subjects such as obscenity, cannibalism, and consensual sex with children. At times, Cohen uses vulgarities and profanity in the classroom and places substantial emphasis on topics of a sexual nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   We do not decide whether the College could punish speech of this nature if the Policy were more precisely construed by authoritative interpretive guidelines or if the College were to adopt a clearer and more precise policy. Rather, we hold that the Policy is simply too vague as applied to Cohen in this case. Cohen's speech did not fall within the core region of sexual harassment as defined by the Policy. Instead, officials of the College, on an entirely ad hoc basis, applied the Policy's nebulous outer reaches to punish teaching methods that Cohen had used for many years. Regardless of what the intentions of the officials of the College may have been, the consequences of their actions can best be described as a legalistic ambush. Cohen was simply without any notice that the Policy would be applied in such a way as to punish his longstanding teaching style-a style which, until the College imposed punishment upon Cohen under the Policy, had apparently been considered pedagogically sound and within the bounds of teaching methodology permitted at the College.\n   <footnotemark>\n    286\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Nevertheless, despite holding the policy unconstitutionally broad, the\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   court explicitly found that the university officials were entitled to qualified immunity in their implementation of the policy. The court held: \"The legal issues raised in this case are not readily discernable and the appropriate conclusion to each is not so clear that the officials should have known that their actions violated Cohen's rights. ... We AFFIRM IN PART that aspect of the district court's judgment which held that the individual officials were qualifiedly immune.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    287\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Further, while\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   is similar to the present case in several ways, it can also be distinguished. Cohen's language, conduct, and assignments were at least tangentially related to the subject matter being taught, and his pornography assignment, while in some views inappropriate and perhaps ill-advised, had an arguable teaching motive and some demonstrative connection to the coursework. The same cannot be said for the conduct and comments of Plaintiff. She repeatedly argues that her conduct and language are part of her pedagogy but has failed to provide the Court any summary judgment evidence which demonstrates sufficient justification or connection between the use of the vulgarities and unwelcome prying into students' sex lives with the teaching of PK-3 education or supervising student-teachers at elementary school campuses. Further, the court found that Cohen was \"ambushed\" by the student grievance; in the present case, Plaintiff was admonished for her language and behavior at the Iberville school and apparently refused to change, opting instead to simply send others to work with student-teachers off campus. Perhaps the most significant distinction between\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   and the present case is that LSU's policies include the objective standard \"so offensive to a reasonable person,\" which was lacking in the\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   , discussed above, also addressed Vega's constitutional challenge to the college's sexual harassment policy. Vega claimed that the sexual harassment policy implemented against him was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The district court ruled that there was a factual issue as to whether Vega was terminated pursuant to the policy and denied summary judgment as to the administrators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    288\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court distinguished the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   , finding that \"the policy in that case was 'different and narrower' than the one at issue here.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    289\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The Second Circuit reversed the district court and held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   Vega's academic freedom claim asserts that the First Amendment prevented the Defendants from disciplining him for this conduct, and we have ruled above that, whether or not that claim is valid, the Defendants were objectively reasonable in believing that it did not. Since the Defendants have a qualified immunity defense from damages liability for a First Amendment academic freedom violation, it does not matter whether they not only thought that Vega's conduct exceeded the proper bounds of a teacher's classroom conduct but also thought that it violated the College's sexual harassment policy. The conduct remains activity for which they may terminate him without incurring damages liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    290\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   This is not a case of dual motivation in which a plaintiff contends that adverse action was taken for an impermissible\n   reason, e.g., exercising First Amendment rights by providing information to a radio station, and the defendant contends that the action was taken for a different, permissible reason, e.g., using obscene gestures to correct students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mt.

In such circumstances, if the evidence shows that the impermissible reason was a \"motivating factor\" of the adverse action, the defendant is liable unless it can show that it would have taken the adverse action in the absence of the impermissible reason.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8150\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/274/\">\n    Id. at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8150\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/274/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    But where, as here, there is only one conduct of the discharged employee that motivates the adverse action, and a defendant has qualified immunity for taking such action, the immunity is not lost even if the defendant thinks that this same conduct also provides an additional reason for the adverse action\n   </strong>\n   . To take an extreme example, if a teacher ordered a female student to disrobe in front of a class and was fired because the school administrator reasonably concluded that such conduct was not related to a legitimate pedagogical purpose, the administrator would not lose qualified immunity just because of an additional belief that the teacher's conduct also violated the school's sexual harassment policy, no matter how impermissibly vague or overbroad that policy was.\n   <footnotemark>\n    291\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   court ultimately followed\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   in granting qualified immunity to the college administrators:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   In 1996, two years after Vega's termination, the Ninth Circuit held qualified immunity available to college administrators for disciplining a tenured professor for violating a sexual harassment policy that violated the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   , 92 F.3d at 973. \"The legal issues raised in this case are not readily discernable and the appropriate conclusion to each is not so clear that the officials should have known that their actions violated [the professor's] rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    diLeo v.

The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to carry this heavy burden. First, the Court finds that the LSU policies, when read together, are not unconstitutionally broad or vague. While the Third Circuit has held there must be something akin to a \"severe and pervasive\" requirement for a sexual harassment policy to be valid, the Fifth Circuit has not explicitly done so in this context. Further, the Court finds that, while the LSU policies could arguably have been crafted better, the Court does not read the language in LSU's policies to be lacking an objective standard akin to severe and pervasive. The phrase \"so offensive to a reasonable person\" constitutes a requirement that the conduct be objectively\n   severe, and the definitions and examples set forth in the policy emphasize that the offending conduct must be severe and pervasive as expressed by the words \"unwelcome,\" \"persistent,\" \"unwanted,\" \"deliberate,\" \"repeated,\" \"intimidating,\" and \"demeaning.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    293\n   </footnotemark>\n   As set forth above, the Plaintiff must establish that there exists no set of circumstances under which this policy would be valid. Plaintiff has failed to carry this burden, and summary judgment is appropriate in favor of Defendants on the facial challenge to LSU's sexual harassment policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Plaintiff has likewise failed to establish that LSU's sexual harassment policies are unconstitutional as applied. \"While rejection of a facial challenge to a statute does not preclude all as-applied attacks, surely it precludes one resting upon the same asserted principle of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    294\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In ascertaining the constitutional validity of a restriction on speech, the Court must (1) first assess whether the speech deserves protection, (2) then determine the type of forum involved, and (3) finally decide whether the proffered justification for the state's restriction satisfies the appropriate standard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    295\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Court has already held that the challenged speech is not protected by the First Amendment in the classroom setting, Plaintiff's as-applied challenge to the policies as restricting protected speech fails. Further, LSU's proffered justification for the prevention of sexual harassment and abusive conduct towards its students by faculty members outweighs any interest Plaintiff has in such speech. The Court finds that the LSU policies are narrowly tailored to promote a substantial government interest such that the policies survive intermediate scrutiny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    296\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   In support of her as-applied challenge, Plaintiff primarily contends that even her own accusers did not understand the context of Plaintiff's profanity and language to be sexual in nature. Plaintiff maintains that the LSU policies' lack of a severe and pervasive requirement failed to put her on notice of what was prohibited conduct. The Court rejected this argument in addressing Plaintiff's facial challenge, finding that the LSU policies do contain an objective and subjective standard that satisfies this test. Because Plaintiff's as-applied challenge rests on the same principle of law as her facial challenge, it is denied on the same grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Alternatively, the Court finds that, even if LSU's anti-harassment policies\n   were facially unconstitutional, the Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for the same reasons set forth by the\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   courts. Considering Plaintiff's conduct, LSU's obligation to protect its students from harassment and abuse, and LSU's obligation to protect its academic and professional reputation in the community, the Court finds that the actions taken against Plaintiff were objectively reasonable under the facts of this case. The record in this case is replete with examples of vulgar and demeaning language and conduct by the Plaintiff. As succinctly stated in\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   , in view of the vulgarities and conduct expressed by Plaintiff, \"no reasonable jury could fail to find that the Defendants would have terminated [Plaintiff] solely because they considered [her] conduct beyond the bounds of proper classroom performance, even if [LSU] had no sexual harassment policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    297\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, summary judgment is granted in favor of Defendants on Plaintiff's constitutional challenges to LSU's harassment policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Alleged Due Process Violations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Plaintiff claims that the investigation, hearing, and termination deprived her of procedural and substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <em>\n    a. Parties' Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Plaintiff claims that her termination violated her Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. She contends that the \"bare recital of steps LSU took\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    298\n   </footnotemark>\n   cannot demonstrate the \"notice and opportunity to be heard\" to which she was entitled as a tenured professor. Plaintiff argues that the charges against her were \"never clear, at any stage of the process\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    299\n   </footnotemark>\n   because of Reinoso's classification of his \"finding\" as sexual harassment and how decision-makers thereafter relied on this \"finding.\" Plaintiff claims that, when she met with Reinoso initially, she was questioned but not given specific information regarding the allegations against her or those making the claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    300\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the HRM-EEO findings that were later provided to her consisted only of conclusions and \"examples\" of \"allegations\" that summarized the complete findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    301\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Plaintiff claims that the lack of specificity regarding her alleged wrongs limited her ability to properly defend herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   As for the final findings, Plaintiff contends such findings lacked any analysis explaining how she violated LSU's sexual harassment policies. Rather, she contends there was only a recap of interviews, a summary, and a bottom-line set of conclusory findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    302\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff claims that the one-sided nature of who Reinoso chose to interview, failing to interview Cancienne, Plaintiff's non-complaining students, and other witnesses, asking leading questions and \"perhaps browbeating witnesses,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    303\n   </footnotemark>\n   mischaracterizing testimony, and failing to connect the evidence to the conclusions \"is fatal to any notion of due process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    304\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Subsequently, Plaintiff contends everything in Reinoso's report was deemed a \"finding\" of sexual harassment and relied upon in that fashion going forward. Dean Andrew recited a great deal of Reinoso's report in seeking PS-104 proceedings, the faculty committee based its decisions on it as well, and Alexander admitted that he\n   also relied on the report over the committee recommendation. Thus, Plaintiff claims these flawed materials and findings form the basis of the termination recommendation to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Plaintiff claims none of this information was communicated to her during the investigation, and even once she received the full report, she was forced to guess which allegations implicated sexual harassment and which had been disregarded, depriving her of any opportunity to address these distinctions at any stage before any decision-maker. Plaintiff argues the fact that an explanation from Reinoso only came once he was deposed, many months after Plaintiff's termination, negated her ability to present her side as to specific charges lodged against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   While Plaintiff acknowledges she received a hearing before the faculty committee and was permitted to appeal, she claims these steps cannot cure a due process violation because \"an adjudication ... tainted by bias cannot be constitutionally redeemed by review in an unbiased tribunal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    305\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff claims that bias is demonstrated here because Reinoso failed to particularize what conduct constituted sexual harassment and affected all subsequent levels of the decision-making process. Plaintiff further claims these \"inherent deficiencies\" are critical and do not constitute the notice and opportunity to be heard guaranteed by the Due Process Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    306\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Defendants claim Plaintiff was afforded due process, and summary judgment should be granted in their favor on this claim. Defendants note that Plaintiff has acknowledged that she: (1) was notified of the allegations against her, (2) participated in pretrial meetings, (3) was afforded an evidentiary hearing before the faculty committee, and (4) was permitted to appeal the committee's findings and recommendations. Specifically, Defendants claim Plaintiff acknowledges the fact that LSU received complaints about her lack of professionalism during her site visit to Iberville Parish schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    307\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Plaintiff acknowledges that her supervisor Dr. Cheek informed her of the initial complaint from Cancienne and requested that she address the complaint, which she did by e-mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    308\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite notice of this complaint, and after Plaintiff's ostensible \"apology\" e-mail to Cancienne, Defendants contend Plaintiff continued to make inappropriate and offensive remarks to the Iberville Parish staff. Rather than modify her behavior, Defendants contend Plaintiff unilaterally decided, without consultation or input from her supervisor, to send other supervisors for education students in Iberville Parish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   As to notice, Defendants refer to the packet received by Plaintiff advising her of the allegations, and Plaintiff's written response thereto, which referenced inappropriate or unwelcome language used in her teaching.\n   <footnotemark>\n    309\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's response admits that she was given a \"set of complaints\" although Plaintiff characterized these complaints as \"accusations and allegations that amount to hearsay.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    310\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's response further consists of denials of specific incidents brought to her attention, specifically a student's right to confidentiality regarding the student's disability status; telling students not to get pregnant while in the\n   program; and regarding the sexual orientation of women who wear brown pants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    311\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Further, Defendants note the undisputed fact that the faculty members of the PS-104 committee unanimously determined that Plaintiff violated PS-73 and PS-95 through her use of profanity, poorly worded jokes, and sometimes sexually explicit jokes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    312\n   </footnotemark>\n   The committee found that Plaintiff's behavior, both on and off campus, created a \"hostile learning environment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    313\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants maintain that the committee hearing transcript establishes that numerous witnesses testified, and Plaintiff had the opportunity to question those witnesses and present witnesses on her own behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    314\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiff's unwillingness to modify her offensive behavior, even after she had been notified and asked to address it, is sufficient to establish Plaintiff's notice of the allegations being brought against her, particularly since the nature of the complaints by Iberville Parish is consistent with the complaints LSU received from other sources regarding Plaintiff's conduct. Further, Defendants maintain this series of events establishes that Plaintiff engaged in a pattern of conduct that was addressed and questioned by her supervisor, but she was unwilling to change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's criticism of who investigators chose to interview or not does not amount to a denial of due process. Plaintiff's disagreement with the manner in which the investigation was carried out does not constitute a due process violation but only further illustrates Plaintiff's inability to get along with others and modify her behavior professionally. Defendants also take issue with Plaintiff's challenge to having her teaching duties suspended for the Spring 2014 semester when she unilaterally, without informing her supervisors, removed herself from teaching duties when her behavior was challenged. Defendants maintain that due process was not required for such an action because they were within the Provost's and Dean Andrew's discretion, and LSU has a responsibility to protect its students and the PK-3 program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Thus, Defendants contend they have established by summary judgment evidence that Plaintiff was afforded due process. Plaintiff's argument that she did not learn the specifics of the charges until Reinoso was deposed is contradicted by the plethora of documents that she has attached to her pleadings. It is undisputed that Dr. Cheek made Plaintiff aware of the allegations, allowed her a response, and Plaintiff was excluded from several school campuses \"long before the PS-104 hearing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    315\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Reinoso, Curry, and Dean Andrew all testified at the committee hearing, and Plaintiff was permitted to question each of them. When Alexander rejected the committee's recommendation and recommended Plaintiff's termination to the Board, Plaintiff was permitted to appeal to Alexander and appear before the Board before the final decision was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   The United States Constitution provides that, \"No State shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Where a tenured public university faculty member is terminated, due process requires both notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    316\n   </footnotemark>\n   The type of\n   hearing necessary-the process due-is a function of the context of the individual case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    317\n   </footnotemark>\n   Due Process is not a rigid and fixed concept, but, rather, it is \"flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    318\n   </footnotemark>\n   To determine the requisite process, a court must analyze the \"interests at stake in a given case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    319\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   provides the three distinct interests to consider:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    320\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to present summary judgment evidence that there is a material issue of fact as to whether she was denied Due Process in the investigation and hearing that resulted in her termination from LSU. Considering the record before the Court, the Court finds that Plaintiff was afforded both procedural and substantive due process leading up to her termination. The record establishes that Plaintiff was given notice of the allegations against her, and the Court finds no lack of specificity, especially in light of Plaintiff's responses. Further, at every step, Plaintiff was afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegations brought against her. At the faculty committee hearing, Plaintiff's position was considered, and the committee determined that she violated the sexual harassment policies of LSU. There is simply no summary judgment evidence that Plaintiff was not afforded proper notice and the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner, including appealing Alexander's recommendation to the Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    321\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Substantive Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   \"Public officials violate substantive due process rights if they act arbitrarily or capriciously.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    322\n   </footnotemark>\n   A public employer's decision to terminate a tenured employee's property interest in continued employment is arbitrary or capricious if the decision \"so lacked a basis in fact\" that it may be said to have been made \"without professional judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    323\n   </footnotemark>\n   The terminated employee \"must show that the decision was 'made without a rational connection between the known facts and the decision or between the found facts and the evidence.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    324\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   The standard for establishing a substantive due process violation is \"demanding\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    325\n   </footnotemark>\n   because \"a federal court is generally not the appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decisions that are made daily by public agencies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    326\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The standard may be even more demanding in the context of higher education personnel decisions because of repeated refusals by the Supreme Court, as well as this court, to 'use the Fourteenth Amendment as an excuse to regulate the internal affairs of public universities.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    327\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the Fifth Circuit has \"also observed that '[t]his measure of judicial restraint ... does not require slavish deference to a university's arbitrary deprivation of a vested property right.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    328\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Plaintiff's substantive due process claim of bias is also unsupported by any summary judgment evidence. Plaintiff claims that Reinoso showed bias because he did not interview persons she believed should be interviewed. This does not establish bias for purposes of due process. The United States Supreme Court has held that an employer is entitled to limit his investigation and make credibility determinations in employment situations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    329\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has held that, \"the members of an adjudicative body have been found to be unconstitutionally biased in three circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   (1) where the decision maker has a direct personal, substantial, and pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case; (2) where an adjudicator has been the target of personal abuse or criticism from the party before him; and (3) when a judicial or quasi-judicial decision maker has the dual role of investigating and adjudicating disputes and complaints.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    330\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Plaintiff has failed to present summary judgment evidence satisfying any of the above circumstances of bias. While Reinoso did investigate the allegations against Plaintiff and submitted findings, the faculty committee was not bound by these findings, and there is no evidence that Reinoso had any hand in the final decision reached by the committee or Alexander's recommendation to the Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    331\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record is\n   devoid of evidence of improper communications or predetermined conclusions by investigators. Plaintiff has offered no evidence of bias other than a decision that runs contrary to her subjective belief, which is not summary judgment evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   There is likewise no evidence that the decision to terminate Plaintiff was arbitrary or capricious because Plaintiff has failed to present evidence establishing that her termination lacked a basis in fact or was made without professional judgment. To the contrary, there is abundant evidence in the record, discussed at length above, establishing that Plaintiff engaged in conduct and used speech that violated LSU's anti-harassment policies, and the faculty committee's conclusion confirms this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   On the Plaintiff's claims of procedural and substantive due process violations, the Court is guided by the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pastorek v. Trail\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    332\n   </footnotemark>\n   a case involving the termination of a tenured professor at LSU's Medical School (\"LSUMS\"). The plaintiff specialized in the treatment of high-risk pregnancies and performed consultations on patients referred by a local obstetrician.\n   <footnotemark>\n    333\n   </footnotemark>\n   The referring physician came under scrutiny and was subjected to investigatory hearings due to allegations that he was harming patients by over-utilizing high-risk procedures. Based on this development, the Chair of the Obstetrics-Gynecology department at the medical school encouraged the plaintiff not to participate in and support the referring physician's practices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    334\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the plaintiff refused, the Chair sent a formal letter of complaint and recommended the commencement of termination proceedings to the LSUMS's Chancellor, Dr. Mervin L. Trail (\"Trail\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    335\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The plaintiff was informed of the charges and provided a copy of the Chair's complaint. The plaintiff's obstetrics privileges were suspended, but he was allowed to continue teaching and practicing gynecology pending an investigation and hearing. A committee was appointed to review the charges against the plaintiff, and the committee sought independent review from another physician.\n   <footnotemark>\n    336\n   </footnotemark>\n   This review resulted in a finding that the plaintiff engaged in \"very questionable obstetrical practices.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    337\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to this conclusion, the committee recommended further investigation, and Dr. Trail sought independent review by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology (\"ACOG\"). The ACOG found that sixteen of the nineteen consultations that it reviewed were unsatisfactory due to inadequate documentation, and two clearly fell below the standard of care required by a physician.\n   <footnotemark>\n    338\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Following this conclusion, Trail terminated the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff appealed this decision to the Dean of LSUMS, the LSUMS Standing Appeals Committee, and the President of LSU. The plaintiff lost each appeal and claimed that all of the hearings were biased against him. The LSU Board of Supervisors ultimately ratified the decision to terminate the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    339\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff sued under Section 1983 and alleged that his procedural\n   and substantive due process rights were violated. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of LSU and the LSU defendants, and the plaintiff appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    340\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the termination proceedings did not afford him due process, specifically because he claimed the defendants did not give him notice of the \"actual reasons\" for his termination, and the termination hearing was biased.\n   <footnotemark>\n    341\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit rejected these arguments and held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   Appellant alleges that he was denied due process because he did not have an opportunity to respond to \"the reasons which actually motivated Dr. Trail\" to terminate him. In\n   <em>\n    Levitt v. University of Texas at El Paso\n   </em>\n   , this court articulated the due process protections to which a tenured professor is entitled.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388278\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/759/1224/#p1228\">\n    759 F.2d 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1228 (5th Cir.1985). Included among these protections is the professor's right to \"be advised of the cause for his termination in sufficient detail so as to enable him to show any error that may exist.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388278\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/759/1224/#p1228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This notice requirement is satisfied when a professor receives \"notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\"\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.

The letter informed appellant of the charges and requested a written response. These facts are not disputed. This procedure gave appellant notice of the charges and an opportunity to tell \"his side of the story.\" Therefore, Appellant received the notice and opportunity to be heard that due process requires.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   Appellant also argues that the hearing he received was biased because a lawyer participated as an advisor both in drafting the initial charge letter and in the subsequent hearings. Before being terminated, a tenured professor is entitled to a hearing before a tribunal that possesses \"an apparent impartiality toward the charges.\"\n   <em>\n    Levitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388278\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/759/1224/#p1228\">\n    759 F.2d at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, partiality is not established by the fact that someone participated in the hearing and in the initial investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duke v. North Texas State University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"257805\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/469/829/#p834\">\n    469 F.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 834 (5th Cir.1972). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Duke v. North Texas State University\n   </em>\n   , this Court rejected plaintiff's argument that the hearing was biased simply because some of those who sat on the panel also participated in the charging phase of the termination proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"257805\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/469/829/#p834\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, appellant argues that the participation of an attorney in the charging and hearing phases of the termination proceedings made the hearing biased against him. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Duke\n   </em>\n   , such participation does not constitute partiality, particularly where, as here, the allegedly partial individual did not participate in the actual decision to terminate. Summary judgment against appellant on his procedural due process claims was appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    342\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   The plaintiff also claimed that his substantive due process rights were denied because he was terminated without cause. The Fifth Circuit noted that, to prevail on such a claim, the plaintiff had to show that he had a property interest in his employment and that his termination was arbitrary or capricious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    343\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the court stated: \"A public employer's termination\n   of an employee does not violate substantive due process unless the determination 'so lacked a basis in fact that their decision to terminate him was arbitrary or capricious, or taken without professional judgment.'\n   <footnotemark>\n    344\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact that reasonable minds could disagree on the propriety of the decision is insufficient to defeat a public official's qualified immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    345\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit rejected the substantive due process challenge, finding as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   In this case, Dr. Gary Cunningham, a physician not associated with LSUMS, determined that appellant engaged in \"questionable obstetrical practices.\" An independent review by the ACOG resulted in a finding that, in two cases, appellant's care fell below the standard required of a physician. The ACOG also found that appellant's performance was unsatisfactory in another sixteen cases because of inadequate medical record documentation. Appellant was provided a hearing, an opportunity to defend himself, and several appeals. Appellant may not agree with Dr. Cunningham's or the ACOG's findings, but it cannot be said that the decision to terminate him lacked a basis in fact. Further, the extensive proceedings afforded appellant show that the decision to terminate him was not made arbitrarily or capriciously. Therefore, neither Trail nor Elkins violated appellant's substantive due process rights and summary judgment in their favor on this issue was appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    346\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   No different result is mandated in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   The Court is mindful of the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Honore v. Douglas\n   </em>\n   , wherein the Court found procedural adequacy but reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment on the substantive due process claim where the committee \"unanimously recommended tenure,\" but the university president rejected such a recommendation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    347\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although in the present case, President Alexander rejected the faculty committee's recommendation to retain and censure Plaintiff rather than terminate, the faculty committee was also unanimous in finding that she had violated both of LSU's sexual harassment policies. Further, President Alexander was within his rights to reject the committee's recommendation and present his own recommendation to the Board, as long as such a recommendation was not arbitrary or capricious. Another important distinction is that, in\n   <em>\n    Honore\n   </em>\n   , unlike the present case, the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to show that his speech criticizing a graduate school's admission policy was a matter of public concern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    348\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the nature of the charges brought against Plaintiff, the committee's findings, and the fact that Plaintiff had an opportunity to address the Board before it decided to adopt Alexander's recommendation, the Court cannot find that the decision to terminate Plaintiff was arbitrary and capricious, and the Court finds that the circumstances are factually distinct from those in\n   <em>\n    Honore.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's due process claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

This rule has been enforced in all but the most sensitive constitutional areas. Several Midland College administrators testified on the basis of strong educational credentials and years of experience in their vocation and in the local community. On their shoulders rest the college's educational standards and its utility as a publicly-supported institution. The federal courts thus appropriately respect the professional conclusion of those whose past and future careers depend upon the esteem due to Midland College.

The warning continued: \"The principle of academic freedom under the 1st Amendment serves to protect the utterances in question only if they are germane to course content as measured by professional teaching standards. Since the precise frontier between academic freedom and sexual harassment remains to be defined by the courts case by case, a teacher of English literature or composition courses may be able to find safety and comfort under the 1st Amendment only if the words uttered are found in appropriate textual materials and the utterances are pertinent to discussion of those materials. Beyond this point, the teacher enters uncharted territory and proceeds at his or her own risk of being found guilty of sexual harassment. Consequently, you are warned that a general use in the classroom of words like 'fuck,' 'cunt,' and 'pussy' outside a professional exegesis may compel the conclusion that you are creating a hostile learning environment requiring disciplinary action.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139082\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/800/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139082\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/800/\">\n     at 804\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"184\">\n   <p id=\"p-429\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139082\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/800/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139082\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/800/\">\n     at 804\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"185\">\n   <p id=\"p-430\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139082\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/800/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139082\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/800/\">\n     at 819\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"186\">\n   <p id=\"p-431\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457262\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/460/\">\n     273 F.3d 460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2nd Cir. 2001).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"187\">\n   <p id=\"p-432\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457262\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/460/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457262\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/460/\">\n     at 462-63\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"188\">\n   <p id=\"p-433\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457262\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/460/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457262\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/460/\">\n     at 463\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"189\">\n   <p id=\"p-434\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520422\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/958/103/#p107\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"190\">\n   <p id=\"p-435\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520422\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/958/103/#p107\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"191\">\n   <p id=\"p-436\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520422\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/958/103/#p107\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"192\">\n   <p id=\"p-437\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520422\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/958/103/#p107\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 467 (citing\n    <em>\n     Keyishian v.
