In this action, Plaintiff Gayle Andrews seeks recovery against BNSF, her former employer, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (\"FELA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Federal Safety Appliance Act (\"FSAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020301\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , for injuries she allegedly sustained during her employment. BNSF moves for summary judgment on both of Andrews's claims. Although BNSF requested oral argument, the Court finds this matter can be appropriately resolved without it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LR 7(c). The matter is fully submitted and ready for decision. As explained below, BNSF's motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated. Andrews worked\n   for BNSF as a conductor based out of Galesburg, Illinois. On October 15, 2014, Andrews was working as an \"over-the-road\" conductor on the route from Galesburg to Creston, Iowa. When working this route, she typically traveled from Galesburg to Creston, spent the night in Creston, and returned to Galesburg the next day. On this date in particular, Andrews received a duty call to take a loaded coal train to \"ISU Station\" near Helpin, Iowa. Andrews reported to the Creston depot during the afternoon, and the crew received their trip paperwork and a safety briefing. The train they were to take to ISU Station was parked at New York Avenue. The crew went to New York Avenue, conducted another safety briefing, and Andrews went to the coal cars to release the hand brakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Railroad freight cars have two kinds of braking systems: air brakes and hand brakes. Air brakes and hand brakes both function through a brake cylinder and piston. With air brakes, the piston extends from the brake cylinder as air pressure is reduced, and a series of brake rods and levers eventually forces the brake shoes against the railcar's wheels. Applying the air brakes pushes the piston out of the brake cylinder. Hand brakes are similar in nature to parking brakes on automobiles. Applying the hand brake pulls the piston out by tightening the brake chain. The brake chain is tightened by turning the wheel of the hand brake clockwise. To release the hand brake, an employee can either use the quick release lever or turn the wheel counterclockwise until the brake releases. Some hand brakes do not have a quick release lever and can only be released by turning the wheel. The parties dispute whether quick release levers are standard on all hand brakes. However, it is undisputed that a quick release lever cannot be replaced separately. Instead the whole hand brake mechanism must be replaced if a new quick release lever is necessary. To use the quick release lever, an employee rotates the lever to the \"off\" position until the brake releases. The quick release lever releases the brakes without turning the wheel. Even if it is used, a quick release lever may not fully release the hand brake, necessitating one or two turns of the wheel to release the brake completely. If the quick release lever releases the hand brake, the wheel spins freely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Andrews received training on the operation of hand brakes. BNSF's Train, Yard, and Engine Safety Rules provide instructions on setting and releasing hand brakes. The rules state that if a quick release lever does not release the hand brake, the employee should use the wheel to release the brake by turning the wheel with steady pressure. If the wheel does not easily release the hand brake, the employee should have air applied to the car or seek assistance. The rules additionally instruct that when an employee is operating a hand brake, the employee should stand on the left side of the hand brake with her left foot on the ladder of the car and her right foot on the brake platform. The employee is required to grasp the ladder with her left hand and operate the hand brake wheel with her right hand. The General Code of Operating Rules instructs employees to be alert and attentive while working and to be careful to prevent injury to themselves and others. Andrews was familiar with how to set and release hand brakes; she had set and released hand brakes previously. BNSF states Andrews was adequately trained in these procedures, which Andrews disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 15, 2014, Andrews began walking from the engine back along the rail cars. The grade at the New York Avenue location requires the use of twenty to thirty hand brakes to park a train, depending on the tonnage of the train.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Andrews had worked at the New York Avenue location before. She released several brakes and then reached a car with a \"short-handle\" quick release lever. She does not remember the car number or any other identifiers. In the personal injury report Andrews submitted to BNSF, she included a car list for the train and indicated the car was within the train's first twenty cars. Andrews testified that COLX 4564 may have been the car, since it was the only one she could identify with a short handle quick release lever. Once Andrews reached the car, she looked at the hand brake to check that it was applied. She does not remember the wheel being bent or broken. Likewise, the chain was not bunched or kinked. Andrews did not see anything wrong with the hand brake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Andrews mounted the ladder on the back of the car to release the hand brake. She first tried to use the quick release lever. She testified that the quick release lever did not release the brake. She made at least one more attempt to release the brake using the quick release lever before beginning to turn the wheel. Andrews put both of her hands on the wheel \"and when [she] pulled down, it let go, and it just let go. That's when [she] fell to [her] knees and everything.\" [ECF No. 15-3 at 27]. When Andrews fell to her knees, \"something happened, and [her] insides went ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020301\">\n    at 29-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The wheel released the hand brake. The parties dispute whether Andrews correctly followed BNSF's training and rules governing the release of hand brakes. Andrews did not report a problem with the car or the hand brake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Andrews reported her injury to BNSF the next day. Three carmen inspected the twenty cars of the train two days later, on October 18, 2014, dividing up the inspections between them. In doing so, they inspected, set, and released the hand brakes of the cars, by using both the quick release lever and the wheel. They also set and released the brakes with and without the train's air brakes being set. All of the hand brakes, including the wheels and quick release levers, were in working order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Andrews subsequently filed this action against BNSF, alleging two counts. [ECF No. 1]. Count One alleges Andrews's injuries were a result of BNSF's negligence in violation of the FELA. Count Two alleges BNSF violated the FSAA and such violation resulted in Andrews's injuries. After the close of discovery, BNSF moved for summary judgment on both of Andrews's claims. [ECF No. 15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.

Despite BNSF's initial statement in its motion that Andrews cannot establish a prima facie case supporting either of her claims, BNSF does not specifically address the elements of each claim. Instead, BNSF only argues Andrews's own negligence was the sole cause of her alleged injuries. Causation is an element of both of Andrews's claims, thus the Court will interpret BNSF's argument as an attack on the causation element of each of Andrews's respective claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Regarding Andrews's FELA claim, the Court finds that BNSF has not met its burden of proving its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. BNSF lays out the legal standards of FELA claims but does not apply those standards to the undisputed facts or clearly identify undisputed facts related to the elements of her FELA claim showing there is no genuine issue for trial. The Court will not perform the legal analysis of Andrews's FELA claim wholesale for BNSF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court further finds it cannot conclude that Andrews's negligence was the sole cause of her damage as a matter of law. BNSF bases its argument on the fact that Andrews testified that she had both hands on the wheel at the time she fell rather than one hand on the wheel and her other hand on the ladder as BNSF training and safety rules dictate. However, whether Andrews's placing of her hand on the ladder would have served to prevent her from falling is a matter of fact. On the evidence before the Court, there is no way to discern whether her actions broke the causal connection between the failure of quick release lever, the \"giving way\" or \"coming loose\" of the wheel, and her subsequent fall. At the most, the fact that she operated the wheel with both hands indicates an issue of contributory negligence, which may reduce Andrews's damages but does not in and of itself bar recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    B.

Among those is an action for a railroad's violation of the FSAA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020301\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The FSAA does not by its own terms \"confer a right of action on injured parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Grogg v.

June 2, 2005) (denying the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in case where quick release lever failed and plaintiff suffered injuries from being \"spun around\" by the brake wheel due to conflicting evidence on issue of efficiency).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Perhaps case law like that above is one reason BNSF fails to directly address whether the hand brake at issue was efficient. Instead, as previously noted, BNSF only specifically addresses the element of causation, arguing that Andrews's own negligence was the sole cause of her alleged injuries. As part of this argument, BNSF repeatedly states that the quick release lever played no part in Andrews's injuries, neither causing nor contributing to them. Rather, BNSF contends, Andrews's negligent operation of the wheel-not the lever's failure to function-led to her damage. First, this appears patently incorrect since, at a minimum, the failure of the quick release lever to function began the sequence of events that led to Andrews's alleged injuries. Furthermore, the wheel and the quick release lever are both integral parts of a hand brake. Because Andrews contends the functioning of either or both is evidence that the hand brake was not efficient, BNSF would have to show that a reasonable jury could not conclude\n   that the alleged failure of either to function in the usual or desired manner played any part, even the slightest, in producing Andrews's harm. In this, BNSF clearly fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Consequently, BNSF's sole cause defense cannot succeed. Even in\n   <em>\n    Beimert v. Burlington N., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit BNSF cites to support the use of such a sole cause defense in FSAA cases, the issue had been tried to a jury.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929593\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/412/#p414\">\n    726 F.2d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the impact of Andrews's allegedly negligent operation of the hand brake wheel on causation simply cannot be determined as a matter of law. The evidence in this case is susceptible to more than one interpretation and \"where the evidence allows more than one outcome on the issue of causation, the issue should be decided by a jury, not a judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123230\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/428/#p437\">\n    330 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   437 (citing\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6162070\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/352/500/#p506\">\n    352 U.S. at 506-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6162070\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/352/500/#p506\">\n    77 S.Ct. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IV.
