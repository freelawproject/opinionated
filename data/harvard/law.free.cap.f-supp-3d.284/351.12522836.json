Andres (\"Andres,\" and collectively, \"plaintiffs\") filed complaints against Professional Claims Bureau, Inc. (\"Professional Claims Bureau\" or \"PCB\" or \"defendant\"), alleging violations of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692g(a)(2) and 1692e of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the \"FDCPA\") in Claims One and Two, respectively, of their complaints. Presently before the Court are plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. As plaintiffs' claims and grounds for moving for summary judgment are identical in plaintiffs' three separate cases,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court\n   decides plaintiffs' motions together in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs notified the Court of two recent decisions in this district in which the courts granted summary judgment in favor of other plaintiffs against Professional Claims Bureau, finding the same Professional Claims Bureau form letters at issue in this case to be in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1692g(a)(2) and 1692e of the FDCPA. In addition to putting forth arguments for summary judgment on the merits of their cases, plaintiffs argue that, in light of these prior adverse rulings against defendant, this Court should find defendant collaterally estopped from relitigating these issues and rule in favor of plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons set forth in detail below, the Court grants plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment. Specifically, the Court concludes that defendant is collaterally estopped from relitigating these issues and, in any event, also independently holds that the letters at issue violate \u00a7\u00a7 1692g(a)(2) and 1692e of the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.

The court in\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   concluded its analysis by stating that \"substantially for the same reasons articulated by Judge Spatt in his\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   Decision, as a matter of law, the Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment in their favor as to their \u00a7 1692g(a)(2) causes of action.\"\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   Opinion at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   granted summary judgment on the \u00a7 1692e claim for the same reasons provided in its \u00a7 1692g(a)(2) analysis.\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   Opinion at 16. The\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   court agreed with the\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   court's decision and found that, in addition to violating \u00a7 1692e by failing to sufficiently identify the current creditors, the letters could also be found to be \"false, deceptive, or misleading\" for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (1) other than the numerous times PCB is mentioned in the Collection Letters, including several directions to pay it, as to each Letter, there is one, ambiguous reference to another entity; and (2) in each Collection Letter, PCB's opaque reference to its \"client\", without more, does not elucidate a connection, if any, between itself and the vaguely referenced entity. Moreover, since PCB did not identify the named entities as the Plaintiffs' current creditors, that failure is sufficient to satisfy the materiality requirement, if there is one ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   Opinion at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , aside from the recipient-specific information they contain, the form letters in the instant cases are identical to the letters discussed in\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   , and are also, therefore, deficient in the ways identified by the courts ruling in those cases. This Court, therefore, finds the first requirement for collateral estoppel satisfied: the issues in those cases and the instant cases are the same. Further, as those courts ruled on the parties' summary judgment motions after reviewing the parties' briefs,\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   , ECF Nos. 25, 28-37;\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   , ECF Nos. 24, 30-42, (1) these issues were actually litigated and decided in those proceedings, (2) defendant had a \"full and fair opportunity\" to litigate, and (3) the issues were necessary to support the courts' valid and final judgments on the merits in both cases, finding that defendant's form collection letters had violated \u00a7\u00a7 1692g(a)(2) and 1692e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court, therefore, concludes that defendant is collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of the deficiency of the same form collection letter in the instant cases.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that defendant's form collection letters violated the FDCPA because of \"certain deficiencies ... concerning the identity of the owner of Plaintiff's debt,\" and that plaintiffs are therefore entitled to summary judgment. (ECF No. 19 at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a threshold matter, the first two elements of an FDCPA claim are not disputed: the parties agree that plaintiffs are \"consumers\" as defined by \u00a7 1692a(3), and that defendant is a \"debt collector\" as defined by \u00a7 1692a(6). (ECF No. 17 at 1.) At issue in this case is the last element required for plaintiffs' claims: whether defendant has violated \u00a7\u00a7 1692g(a)(2) and 1692e of the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   a. Section 1692g(a)(2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that defendant failed to include the name of the creditor to whom the debt was owed in their collection letters, as required under \u00a7 1692g(a)(2). While \"the Second Circuit appears not to have directly addressed how clearly a debt collection notice must identify the name of the creditor,\" numerous decisions in this circuit have found collection letters to be in violation of \u00a7 1692g(a)(2) for, among other reasons, failing to make the creditor's identity explicit, or identifying a creditor only once.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Datiz v. Int'l Recovery Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-3549 (ADS)(AKT),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204148330\">\n    2016 WL 4148330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-11 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2016) (rejecting defendant's argument that its letter \"clearly implie[d] that [the medical institution] [wa]s the Plaintiff's creditor,\" and therefore denying defendant's motion to dismiss because \"the fact that the caption [of the] ... Letter lists [the medical institution] is not, without more explanation, sufficient to satisfy Section 1692g(a)(2) because it does not identify the Hospital as the Plaintiff's current creditor\");\n   <em>\n    Sparkman v.

Plaintiffs also highlight that the letters here, as the court noted in\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   , inform recipients that \"[t]he above referenced account has been referred to our offices for collection\" (ECF No. 1, Ex. 1 at 1), but \"fail to make clear on whose behalf [the debt collector] was acting when it sent the Collection Letters,\"\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   Opinion at 4. As was true of the\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   letters, here, defendant's letters to plaintiffs each contain only \"one, ambiguous reference\" to the creditor (the medical institution that initially performed the service for which plaintiffs owed a debt),\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   Opinion at 17-18: the single reference is in the upper right-hand corner of the letters, where the medical institution's name follows the word \"Re:\" (ECF No. 1, Ex. 1 at 1). After the \"Re:\" line, nothing else in each letter directs the recipient back to the creditor's name. The body of each letter refers to the institution as defendant's \"client,\" but does not clarify further if the recipient will satisfy his or her debt to that\n   client by submitting the payment slip in the collection notice. (ECF No. 1, Ex. 1 at 1.) For these reasons, the Court agrees with plaintiffs, and finds that these letters would mislead recipients as to whom they owe a debt, possibly even to believe that they owe a debt to defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendant asks the Court to consider the recent Southern District of New York ruling in its favor in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. Professional Claims Bureau, Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 35;\n   <em>\n    Gracci\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 29.) The letter at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   also resembles the letters in\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   , and the instant cases, aside from one critical difference: the payment slip in Hernandez's letter was addressed to the medical institution that had performed the service for which she owed a debt,\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20193819\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12-13, rather than to defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Distinguishing\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   court found that plaintiff had not demonstrated, as a matter of law, that the letter insufficiently identified the name of the creditor seeking collection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11-13. The court first explained that, in other cases in which courts had found letters to be deficient under \u00a7 1692g(a)(2) -including\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   -the creditor was \"listed only once in the subject line of a collection notice, and there [wa]s no reference to the term 'creditor.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10-11. Conversely, other courts had determined that collection letters that repeated the creditor's name, even where they failed to use the term \"creditor,\" sufficiently identified the creditor for the purposes of the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11-12. After highlighting that the letter before it included more than a single reference to the creditor, the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   decision discussed the significance it assigned to the fact that defendant included the creditor's name on the payment slip.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12-13. The court specifically distinguished\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   (in which\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   's name appeared on the payment slip) on this basis, and explained that \"[t]he inclusion of the creditor's name on the payment slip-considered together with the 'Patient Name' field, the suggestion that the debt is a co-pay, and the listing of a medical facility-is sufficient for this court to conclude ... that [the medical institution] is identified as the current creditor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   decision discussed the\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   case as rightly decided, and this Court concurs. Additionally, the Court notes that the payment slips in plaintiffs' letters, unlike in the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   letter (1) are addressed to defendant rather than to the medical institutions, and (2) include a note stating that \"[the recipient's] credit card statement will reflect a charge from Professional Claims Bureau, Inc.\" (ECF No. 1, Ex. 1 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Viewing the same set of relevant facts as were present in\n   <em>\n    McGinty\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   , this Court finds the analysis in those decisions to be persuasive. Here, based on the language in defendant's letters alone, this Court finds that it would be\n   <em>\n    at best\n   </em>\n   unclear to the \"least sophisticated consumer\" which entity owned plaintiffs' debts. In fact, the Court believes it is equally, if not more likely, that recipients would read these collection notices to suggest that the creditor they would be paying was defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   b. Section 1692e\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In addition to finding that defendant insufficiently identified the current creditor in its form collection letters under \u00a7 1692g(a)(2), the Court also agrees with plaintiffs and the courts in the prior proceedings against defendant that its letters violate \u00a7 1692e. Plaintiffs argue that defendant's letters are \" open to more than one reasonable interpretation as to the owner of the debt,\" and are therefore deceptive as a matter of law under \u00a7 1692e. (ECF No. 19 at 7.) The Court agrees with plaintiffs for the reasons stated supra. In\n   particular, the least sophisticated consumer would find the language of the letter, as it relates to the identity of the creditor, to be confusing and misleading. The Court, therefore, finds defendant's form collection letters to be deceptive as a matter of law under \u00a7 1692e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   lV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment on Claims One and Two of their complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    White brought her claims in\n    <em>\n     White v.
