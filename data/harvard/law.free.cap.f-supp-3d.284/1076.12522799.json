First, Plaintiff moves for remand, arguing that Legault was properly named as a defendant and his presence in this case made removal to this Court improper. Alternatively, Plaintiff further contends that the amount in controversy requirement has not been met. Second,\n   Legault moves to dismiss Plaintiff's Ninth Cause of Action, for defamation, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Legault asserts that since Plaintiff has failed to state a viable claim for defamation, and because defamation is the only cause of action asserted against Legault, he should be dismissed entirely as a defendant to this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's Motion to Remand (ECF No. 10) is DENIED and Legault's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 8) is GRANTED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff had worked for Compass for over 32 years when he was terminated on February 23, 2017.

Compass claims that sometime between Plaintiff's return to work and his termination in February, he received work restrictions through his worker's compensation claim. Def.'s Mot. to Dism., ECF No. 8, 2:9-11. These restrictions, according to Compass, precluded Plaintiff from performing the essential functions of his job. Def.'s Mot. to Dism., ECF No. 8, 2:9-11. Plaintiff neither confirms nor denies whether there were work restrictions, but instead maintains that he completed his duties, including all essential functions, at full capacity. Pl.'s Mem.

He filed his complaint on or about April 7, 2017, and on May 12, 2017, Compass removed the case to this Court. Plaintiff is a citizen of California, Pl.'s Comp. at \u00b6 1, and Compass is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in North Carolina. Def.'s Notice Rem., ECF No. 1, 4:18-20. Although Plaintiff included Legault, a California resident, in his complaint, Defendants alleged that Legault was a \"sham\" defendant named solely for the purpose of destroying diversity and that removal was therefore appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Compass, Legault's inclusion was a \"sham\" because: (1) Plaintiff cannot meet the prima facie elements of a defamation claim against Legault; (2) even if the prima facie elements are met, Legault's statements were privileged; (3) the statement is opinion; and (4) Plaintiff has not amended the complaint to further substantiate the defamation claim despite having\n   the opportunity to do so. Specifically, Compass contends there is no person other than Plaintiff to whom the allegedly defamatory statement was made and that as such, defamation, by definition, cannot be proven. Moreover, Compass argues, even if there is a third person to whom Legault directed the allegedly defamatory statement, the statement is privileged because it was a statement about the reason for Plaintiff's termination made to another employee. Compass also notes that defamation requires a \"false statement of fact,\" and maintains that Legault's allegedly defamatory statement was merely a nonactionable statement of opinion. Finally, Compass points to the fact that Plaintiff could have amended his complaint but has not. Such failure, Compass argues, demonstrates that there are no changes Plaintiff could make to further substantiate his defamation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff, on the other hand, moves to remand his case back to Sacramento County Superior Court on grounds that joining Legault was proper and, that regardless, that Defendant has failed to show that the requisite amount in controversy has been pled. Defendant concurrently moves to dismiss the Ninth Cause of Action for defamation on the same grounds outlined above. Further, Defendant requests that he be dismissed from this case in its entirety as a fraudulently joined defendant under Rule 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

That is, it is possible for an individual who overhears an allegedly defamatory statement to constitute the necessary third party if a reasonable person in the speaker's shoes would have recognized that the third party would hear the statement.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, Plaintiff contends that the presence of Compass manager Julie Berger at the termination meeting was sufficient to constitute the requisite communication to a third party. Legault, on the other hand, argues that Plaintiff failed to allege that his statements were (1) made to a \"third person who\n   <em>\n    understands\n   </em>\n   the defamatory meaning of the statement and its application to [plaintiff]\" and (2) \"directed\n   <em>\n    at anyone else\n   </em>\n   .\" Def.'s Opp. to Mot. Remand, ECF No. 12, 3:20-28 (emphasis in the original). Certainly, Berger understood what was being said to Plaintiff. Additionally, the fact that Legault did not direct the allegedly defamatory statement specifically to Berger does not necessarily doom Plaintiff's claim. With Berger in the room, Legault knew, presumably, that Berger would hear his statements. Indeed, in the context of an employee termination, it is reasonable to infer that hearing and seeing what transpired at the meeting was the very purpose for having Berger present. Legault's statements made in this context were, therefore, at the very least negligently, if not in fact intentionally, communicated to Berger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is nevertheless questionable whether Berger, regardless of whether she otherwise qualifies as a third person for defamation publication purposes, should, in this context, be deemed the necessary\n   third person. Berger was on the same side of the conversation as Legault. What was going to be said and done in the meeting could not have been news to her when it happened. Indeed, for all intents and purposes, Plaintiff basically met with a single entity: Compass Group USA, Inc. Thus, it is doubtful whether Berger can be deemed a \"third person\" to whom Defendant communicated the allegedly defamatory statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this stage, however, since the Court must resolve any state law ambiguity in that regard in Plaintiff's favor, it will assume that Berger can qualify as the necessary third person and that, for instant purposes, the prima facie elements of a defamation claim have been pled. Despite that prima facie showing, however, the Court must still address Legault's argument that the allegedly defamatory statements to Berger were privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Plaintiff's allegations here, however, are not analogous to the allegations in that case. Plaintiff does not allege that Defendant acted in reckless disregard of the truth. Nor does he allege that Defendant was motivated by feelings of ill will toward Plaintiff arising from previous quarrels and rivalries. That is not to say that evidence of previous quarrels and rivalries are necessary to plead malice, but the absence of such pleading further demonstrates how inapposite\n   <em>\n    Slaughter\n   </em>\n   is. Finally, Plaintiff does not allege that the reasons Legault gave for Plaintiff's termination were part of a plan to discredit and impugn Plaintiff's reputation and integrity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without more, Plaintiff's sole allegation that that Legault \"failed to reasonably investigate the truth of his statement and knew Plaintiff had been performing the essential functions for over 6 months,\" Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Remand, ECF No. 10, 8:18, does not set forth the requisite ill will required to show actual malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Perhaps recognizing the shortcomings of his complaint, Plaintiff also attempts to articulate alternative means of establishing malice. First, Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Harte-Hanks Commc'n, Inc. v. Connaughton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218419\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/657/#p682\">\n    491 U.S. 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682-684,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218419\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/657/#p682\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218419\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/657/#p682\">\n    105 L.Ed.2d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), for the proposition that malice is shown where the publisher of the alleged defamatory statements fails to interview witnesses who could have disproved the allegations or to consult relevant documentary evidence. But\n   <em>\n    Harte-Hanks\n   </em>\n   involved a public figure who accused a newspaper of defamation, a context that triggers different rules and a higher standard for establishing malice. And more importantly, Plaintiff misstates the rule derived from that case. The court specifically concluded that \"failure to investigate will not alone support a finding of actual malice [but that] the purposeful avoidance of the truth\" may.\n   <em>\n    Harte-Hanks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218419\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/657/#p682\">\n    491 U.S. at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218419\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/657/#p682\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff does not allege, nor is there any evidence of, purposeful avoidance here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that \"malice can be shown through evidence that the publisher lacked reasonable grounds for belief in the truth of the publication.\" For this proposition, Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    MacLeod v. Tribune Publ'g Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4382885\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/52/536/#p552\">\n    52 Cal.2d. 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20P.2d%2036\">\n    343 P.2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959), a case that again involves a public figure's libel action against a newspaper. The defendant there published a news article that falsely implied or insinuated a connection between the plaintiff and the communist party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 544-45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20P.2d%2036\">\n    343 P.2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff alleged that defendant published the article \"falsely and maliciously and with intent to injure, disgrace, and defame plaintiff,\" and that \"all said charges, reference, assertions, and imputations were false, malicious, and unprivileged, and were calculated to and did expose plaintiff to hatred, contempt, ridicule, and obloquy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 552,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20P.2d%2036\">\n    343 P.2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held that because material refuting the implied connection was readily available, the defendant should not have had any trouble reporting the recommendations accurately, and that doing so indicated a lack of reasonable grounds for the report.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20P.2d%2036\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Simply put,\n   <em>\n    MacLeod\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. Here, Plaintiff has not, and presumably cannot, point to evidence that proves Legault lacked reasonable grounds for the decision to terminate plaintiff for\n   not being able to perform the essential functions of his job other than simply arguing that he could do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, Plaintiff argues that malice can be established by a \"failure to investigate thoroughly and verify the facts of the defamatory statement.\" But as is discussed above, a close reading of\n   <em>\n    Harte-Hanks\n   </em>\n   does away with this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues that it is for the state court to decide whether the conditional privilege applies. Plaintiff argues the discussion of conditional privilege and malice is \"exogenous to the defamation claim\" and cites to\n   <em>\n    Ritchey,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11851261\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/1313/#p1318\">\n     139 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1319\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"when the defense is exogenous to the cause of action itself, it will not turn to [sic] a state action into a federal one.\" Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Remand, ECF No. 10, 9:20. But the court in\n   <em>\n    Ritchey\n   </em>\n   stated that rule in the context of determining whether federal question jurisdiction existed. Here, the issue is whether diversity jurisdiction exists. The discussions of fraudulent joinder, defamation, conditional privilege, and malice all fall within the ambit of the analysis of that inquiry. Determining each of these issues is therefore crucial to and not exogenous to determining whether there is diversity jurisdiction. Accordingly, it is entirely proper for this court to answer these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, although it is questionable whether Plaintiff has even met the prima facie elements of defamation, even if he has, the common-interest conditional privilege applies. As such, the Court holds that there is no possibility that Plaintiff can state a viable or non-fanciful defamation claim under the circumstances present here. Consequently, complete diversity exists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Here, Plaintiff seeks nonmonetary relief in the form of injunctive and declaratory relief. Pl.'s Comp. at 20.

All the Court held was that a plausible allegation was sufficient and that the defendant need not, at least initially, include supporting evidence in the notice of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, however, the question is less whether Defendant made a plausible allegation-he has-than it is what happens now that Plaintiff has contested the amount.\n   <em>\n    Dart Cherokee\n   </em>\n   , as both parties point out, explains that \u00a7 1445(c)(2)(B) authorizes the submission of evidence by both parties once \"plaintiff contests, or the court questions, the defendant's allegations.\" Plaintiff contends that Defendant is therefore \"required to provide 'summary judgment type evidence' to establish that the amount in controversy is met.\" Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Remand, ECF No. 16, 3:19. Not so. First, as Defendant points out, Plaintiff fails to assert that he is seeking less than $75,000. Second, the evidence currently before the Court is sufficient to ascertain whether the amount in controversy is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff first seeks damages for loss of income, benefits, regular employment, and career advancement opportunities. Pl.'s Comp. at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 43, 55, 67, 75, 94, 103, 124. Plaintiff earned $36,063.65 in 2016. Exhibit 2, attached to Decl. of Julie Cobb. Plaintiff was terminated on February 23, 2017. Defendant assumed a trial date of at least one year from the date of the hearing on Plaintiff's Motion for Remand, which was on July 27, 2017, and calculated Plaintiff's lost income to be approximately $51,090.17. But as Plaintiff points out, \"... 'diversity must exist at the time the action is removed to federal court.' \"\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Hartford Life Ins.

The date of removal is May 12, 2017. Plaintiff was terminated on February 27, 2017, so the amount of lost income relevant to determining whether diversity existed on May 12, 2017 is around three month's wages, which is approximately $9,009.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff also seeks unspecified damages for emotional distress. Pl.'s Comp. at \u00b6\u00b6 36, 44, 56, 68, 76, 95, 104, 125. Defendant suggests that approximately $25,000 is a reasonable estimate of the emotional distress damages Plaintiff might obtain if ultimately successful. Def.'s Mem. Opp. to Mot. Remand, ECF No. 12, 13:12-17. Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Kroske v. U.S. Bank Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556364\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/976/#p980\">\n    432 F.3d 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 980 (9th Cir. 2015) and two jury verdicts as evidence for this proposition. Plaintiff essentially contends\n   <em>\n    Kroske\n   </em>\n   is inapposite and attacks the jury verdicts on the grounds that they are not analogous cases. Plaintiff does not, however, specifically contest the amount of $25,000 nor argue it is seeking a specific amount less than $25,000. Ultimately, the Court need not settle on a figure now because, when joined with the other damages Plaintiff seeks, even a minimal award of emotional distress damages would suffice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff also seeks attorney's fees for each of his nine causes of action. Pl.'s Comp. at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 47, 59, 71, 79, 98, 106, 118;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (Prayer for Relief). Attorney's fees may be considered in determining the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971589\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/1005/#p1007\">\n    825 F.Supp.2d at 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant admits that he cannot calculate Plaintiff's attorney's fees with precision but suggests they alone might exceed $75,000. In support of this contention, Defendant cites to\n   <em>\n    Ponce v. Med. Eyeglass Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:15-CV-04035-CAS (JEMx),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204554336\">\n    2015 WL 4554336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (C.D. Cal. Jul. 27, 2015), which observes that attorney's fees in Los Angeles generally run between $425.00 and $725.00 per hour. Plaintiff does not dispute this estimate nor does he offer his attorney's rates or what fees they have incurred up to this point. Instead, Plaintiff attacks the basis for Defendant's assumptions and urges this Court to decline to consider future attorney's fees at all. But as long as the assumptions in Defendant's chain of reasoning are reasonable, they are expressly authorized.\n   <em>\n    Ibarra v. Namheim Inv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340620\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1193/#p1197\">\n    775 F.3d 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1197 (9th Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Big Lots Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20590216\">\n    2017 WL 590216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2017). In light of Plaintiff's failure to specifically contest the hourly rates or total estimated fees suggested by Defendant with either his own attorney's fees and to-date incurred cost estimates or some other means, the Court cannot conclude that Defendant's assumptions are off base. Along with the other amounts discussed herein even a minimal award of attorney's fees would cause the amount in controversy to exceed the jurisdictional minimum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff seeks punitive damages. Pl.'s Comp. at \u00b6\u00b6 38, 46, 58, 70, 78, 97, 105, 127. Courts may consider punitive damages in determining the amount in controversy as long as they are recoverable under state law.\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971589\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/1005/#p1007\">\n    825 F.Supp.2d at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In California, punitive damages are available for violations of FEHA.\n   <em>\n    Andrade v. Arby's Rest. Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270663\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/225/1115/#p1143\">\n    225 F.Supp.3d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1143 (N.D. Cal. 2016). Defendant cites to two cases with large punitive damages awards to establish an estimate and Plaintiff argues those cases are not analogous. The Court, however, need not address whether those cases are analogous because even a minimal damage award along with the damages discussed above would satisfy the amount in controversy threshold. Indeed, if the Plaintiff prevails on all its claims, which, of course, we must presume, the jury will have concluded that Compass discriminated against a 32-year employee because of an injury he sustained on the job. It is not at all difficult to imagine a jury imposing a substantial punitive damages award in light of such a conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff correctly notes that merely conclusory allegations will not suffice. But Defendant has not merely stated that the amount in controversy is more than $75,000. On the contrary, Defendant proffers\n   a reasonable argument for why the amount in controversy is satisfied. Assuming Plaintiff wins, $9,009.15 in lost wages, together with even minimal awards for emotional distress, attorney's fees, and punitive damages will more than likely exceed the jurisdictional minimum. The Court finds that Defendant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy is met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the foregoing reasons Plaintiff's Motion to Remand (ECF No. 10) is DENIED, and Defendant Legault's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 8) is GRANTED. Although generally leave to amend would be \"freely given,\" to do so here would imply that Plaintiff could state a viable defamation claim, and the Court has already concluded he cannot. Moreover, Plaintiff has had multiple opportunities to amend his complaint but has failed to do so, and this Court is thus convinced that amendment would be futile.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore no leave to amend will be permitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Because oral argument was not of material assistance, the Court ordered this matter submitted on the briefs. E.D. Cal. Local Rule 230(g).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    As a fundamental matter, it is worth noting that courts have expressed \"strong judicial disfavor for libel suits based on communications in employment performance reviews.\"\n    <em>\n     Jensen v. Hewlett-Packard Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6037280\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/14/958/#p964\">\n     14 Cal.App.4th 958\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 964,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2083\">\n     18 Cal.Rptr.2d 83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993). Although a performance evaluation can support a cause of action for libel, such a claim only lies where the performance evaluation \"falsely accuses an employee of criminal conduct, lack of integrity, dishonesty, incompetence or reprehensible characteristics or behavior.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 965,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2083\">\n     18 Cal.Rptr.2d 83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, although the facts do not involve a performance review per se, they are nonetheless analogous to the performance review or evaluation context in that part of Defendant's termination of Plaintiff involved evaluation of Plaintiff's performance. The sentiment expressed in\n    <em>\n     Jensen\n    </em>\n    is therefore instructive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Plaintiff's attempt to analogize to Mullins is similarly unpersuasive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Having concluded that the defamation claim fails because the common interest conditional privilege applies, the Court need not address Legault's alternative arguments as to whether his statements were mere opinion or amounted to a legal conclusion, and accordingly could not be defamatory under those grounds, either.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The Court acknowledges that both parties included in their briefs arguments as to whether a federal question provides an alternative basis for federal jurisdiction. Having concluded, however, that diversity jurisdiction exists, the Court need not address these arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint in response to Defendants' Notice of Removal, which clearly delineated why the defamation claim against Legault as then constituted failed to state any viable cause of action. Nor did Plaintiff file an amended complaint in response to the instant Motion to Dismiss, which put Plaintiff on notice yet again as to the deficiencies of his defamation claim. Given these failures, the Court concludes that Plaintiff is unable to further support his defamation claim through any amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
