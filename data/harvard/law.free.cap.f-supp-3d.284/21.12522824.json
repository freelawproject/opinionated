This case concerns the conclusion by the Medford, Oregon district of the Bureau of Land Management (\"Bureau\") that a segment of the Rogue River in Oregon is suitable for Congress to designate for future protection under the Act. Plaintiffs contend that this decision is flawed and here sued the Bureau's Acting Director seeking its reversal. But because the Bureau's suitability determination is but one step in a long and unpredictable process towards potential\n   congressional designation, and because they fail to allege an injury-in-fact that is traceable to the suitability determination itself, Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge that determination. The Court will, accordingly, grant Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The government contends that Plaintiffs lack standing because their alleged injuries are too speculative and, in any event, are not traceable to the challenged determination. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Overall, Plaintiffs assert two main types of injuries: those that flow from congressional designation and those that flow from the Bureau's \"protective management\" regime for suitable rivers. But the injuries that Plaintiffs point to that are sufficiently specific for standing-which the Court will detail below-will arise only if the river is designated; their allegations concerning injuries from the suitability determination itself are too conclusory and general. Thus, the only injuries on which Plaintiffs could sustain standing are those that relate to designation, namely future activities Plaintiffs argue they might seek to undertake but may be precluded from conducting because of the statutory protections for designated rivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Yet the ultimate designation of the Proposed Segment (and thus any injury Plaintiffs might suffer from that designation) is far from certain. In order for their specific injuries to materialize, (1) the Medford District's conclusion needs to be approved by both the Bureau's Oregon State Director and the National Director, who would then pass the suitability recommendation on to the Secretary of Interior; (2) the Secretary must also agree with the Medford District's suitability conclusion and make a recommendation to Congress to designate the Proposed Segment; (3) Congress must agree and pass a legislative act designating the Proposed Segment for protection; (4) the President must sign that legislation; (5) Plaintiffs must seek to undertake a desired action; and (6) an agency must refuse to permit or otherwise prevent them from undertaking that action. Plaintiffs themselves recognize that their injuries involve this lengthy chain of causation, explaining that their desired relief will redress their injuries because \"then the Segment will not be recommended for designation and permitting agencies will not be bound by the restrictions that flow from designation.\" Pls.' Mem. P. &amp; A. Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Dismiss (\"Pls.' Opp'n\"), at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In light of this long chain of events running from the challenged suitability determination to the concrete injuries that Plaintiffs have alleged-the preclusion of activities they may later seek to undertake-Plaintiffs lack standing for two reasons: (1) such an attenuated chain of causation, involving as it does the independent actions of third parties, reveals that the alleged injuries are not fairly traceable to the challenged action; and (2) in light of the many links in the chain and Plaintiffs' inability to establish that each event has a substantial likelihood of occurring, Plaintiffs do not allege an injury that is sufficiently imminent to constitute an injury-in-fact. The Court will elaborate below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' specifically-identified injuries are all a consequence of designation, not the suitability determination.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    1. Most of Plaintiffs' identified injuries flow from designation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In their complaint, Plaintiffs assert a number of specific actions they may seek to undertake that might be precluded. Generally, these potential prohibitions fall into four groups: (1) the loss of permits from the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct activities such as streambank stabilization, installation of riprap, construction of new or replacement points of diversion, maintenance of levees, and the sales of mineral deposits; (2) the loss of water rights, both existing and potential future ones; (3) the loss of grazing permits; and (4) the loss of mining permits from the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

But for each of these asserted activities, the roadblocks that Plaintiffs point to arise from the statutory protections for designation, not the Bureau's suitability finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Loss of permits from the Army Corps of Engineers\n   </em>\n   : Plaintiffs allege they are injured because they will be unable to obtain permits from the Army Corps of Engineers to continue or begin a variety of activities on or near the Proposed Segment, such as streambank stabilization and mineral sales.

The statute provides no indication that section 1284(d) has any impact whatsoever on state law or state jurisdiction over study rivers such as the Proposed Segment. Similarly, the Oregon regulation that Plaintiffs say will limit their ability to transfer water rights discusses transfers involving \"federal wild and scenic rivers,\" which would not include agency-identified study rivers.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Admin.%20R.%20690\">\n    Or.

Opp'n at 11 (stating that permit \"authorizations and renewals are governed by the 'unreasonably diminish' standard in [ section 1278(a) ]\"). As discussed above, section 1278(a) has no impact on federal agencies unless and until the Proposed Segment is designated. Nor do Plaintiffs point to any independent barriers to the renewal of permits, indicating that as with their other alleged injuries, the loss of grazing permits will occur only if the Proposed Segment is designated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Loss of mining permits\n   </em>\n   : Plaintiffs finally contend that they are injured because they will be prevented from obtaining or renewing mining rights from the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. Decl. of Rich Angstrom \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. But Plaintiffs point to nothing indicating that any such issues might arise except following designation. To the extent that section 1284(d) might require changes in Oregon mining rights-a proposition that is itself uncertain, given that that provision applies to a State's jurisdiction \"over\n   <em>\n    waters of any stream\n   </em>\n   ,\" not to State jurisdiction over land and the regulation thereof,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201284\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (emphasis added)-that statutory provision does not apply to study rivers, as discussed above.

The Bureau's manual states that the Bureau has \"broad discretionary authority, on a case-by-case basis through project-level decisionmaking and the [National Environmental Planning Act] process, not to impact [study] river values or make decisions that might lead to a determination of ineligibility or nonsuitaiblity.\" Pls.' Opp'n Ex. C, at 3-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In theory, a party could maintain standing by alleging a specific project under the Bureau's review that would be precluded by the protective management imposed by the Bureau as a result of a suitability determination. But Plaintiffs make no such specific, concrete allegation here. They do not say, for instance, that they are undertaking a project on federal lands that will require the Bureau's authorization in a way that might be impacted by protective management. Rather, Plaintiffs primarily point to decisions that are under the jurisdiction and purview of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers or the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, and to their concerns over section 1278(a) -which, as noted above, does not apply to an agency-identified river prior to designation. And while the Bureau might have some ability to influence the decisions of other agencies-by commenting to the Army Corps of Engineers on pending permit applications, for instance-the Bureau has no statutory or regulatory authority to\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   those agencies from granting permits absent a designation decision. Nor do Plaintiffs, as explained above, point to barriers to those other agencies' actions in the absence of designation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs generally contend that the suitability determination will make the regulatory process more complicated and less certain, but never explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   that happens in the absence of designation or what\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   activities they seek to undertake that are (again, absent designation) made more complicated, less certain, or more expensive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such conclusory allegations unmoored from specific, concrete facts are insufficient to establish an injury for standing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' alleged injuries arising from the designation decision are not sufficiently imminent to be injuries-in-fact or sufficiently traceable to the challenged suitability determination.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As discussed above, the specific injuries that Plaintiffs identify will come to pass only if the Proposed Segment is designated, not simply because of the suitability determination challenged here. Consequently, the chain of causation between the suitability determination and the injuries Plaintiffs assert is as follows: the Medford District has determined the Proposed Segment is suitable, then the State Director, National Director, and Secretary will agree and recommend the Proposed Segment for designation, then Congress will pass (and the President sign) a legislative act designating the Proposed Segment for protection, then Plaintiffs will seek to undertake an action (such as obtaining a permit for streambank stabilization or applying for a renewal of mining or grazing rights), and then the reviewing agency will deny the requested permit or otherwise prevent the action because of the statutory protections for a designated river. Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, this chain of causation is simply too attenuated to meet the requirements that Plaintiffs' injuries be imminent and fairly traceable to the challenged action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As an initial matter, this causal chain in large part depends on the actions of third parties not before this Court. To reach the end of the chain, Congress, the President, and an agency (e.g., the Army Corps of Engineers) all must take a certain action. None of these entities are before the Court.

Nor do the Plaintiffs provide any reason to think that\n   <em>\n    Congress\n   </em>\n   would agree with the Bureau's conclusion and pass legislation designating the river. Plaintiffs do not, for instance, point to evidence showing that Congress regularly acts upon recommendations or adopts them, which might suggest that the Secretary's recommendation would likely be followed by Congress adopting legislation designating the segment. In any event, few things are more hypothetical and speculative than Congress passing a specific act of legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   And even if Congress did pass legislation designating the proposed segment, the statutory restrictions that Plaintiffs say would prohibit their potential activities are not\n   <em>\n    absolute\n   </em>\n   ; they only prohibit actions that impair the Act's purposes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201278\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers can approve activities that will not impair the Act's purposes or harm the river's values and have done so in the past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v.

Similarly, the Oregon regulation concerning water use permits only requires that a river's status as a wild and scenic river be taken into account; it does not prohibit any permits wholesale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Admin.%20R.%20690\">\n    Or. Admin. R. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -315-0040(4)(b). Plaintiffs do not explain why it is certainly likely that their permits would be denied given that such actions or permits\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   be approved. Thus, even the last link in the causal chain remains somewhat speculative. Plaintiffs therefore cannot establish traceability to the challenged action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For similar reasons, Plaintiffs also fail to allege an injury that is sufficiently \"imminent\" to meet the requirements for an injury-in-fact. Since Plaintiffs complain of future injuries-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the denial of future permits for streambank stabilization or of future water rights transfers-they must demonstrate that the action is \" 'certainly impending' \" for it to \"constitute injury in fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitmore v. Arkansas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/#p158\">\n    495 U.S. 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/#p158\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/#p158\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). \"And to 'shift[ ] injury from conjectural to imminent,' [Plaintiffs] must show that there is a 'substantial ... probability' of injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383754,3555893\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/192/\">\n    642 F.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (first and third alterations in original) (citation omitted). Plaintiffs do not show that here. Indeed, Plaintiffs provide little support to show a substantial likelihood of each link in the chain of causation coming to pass, as discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Rather, Plaintiffs' descriptions of their injuries in their declarations and complaint have the sort of speculative, someday quality that typically precludes finding an injury-in-fact. They allege with respect to grazing rights, for instance, that following designation \"[i]t is highly likely that ... preservation groups will seek to curtail grazing on the allotments affecting\" the relevant segment of the Rogue River. Decl. of Jerome Rosa \u00b6 5. Similarly, they state that they will be \"harmed by opposition from [the Bureau] when they attempt to secure an operating permit [from other agencies] for mining activities on lands within the segment.\" Decl. of Rich Angstrom \u00b6 5. And they say that their \"ability to make further changes to existing water rights ... will likely be limited under current\n   protective management.\" Compl. \u00b6 6. Nowhere do Plaintiffs indicate that they are currently attempting to renew grazing permits or seeking to secure mining permits or applying for permits for needed erosion prevention activities that will be denied-in fact, Plaintiffs' counsel acknowledged at the hearing that there are no pending permit applications to the Corps of Engineers or plans to imminently file any. This sort of someday speculation is not sufficiently imminent to constitute an injury-in-fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs' \"protracted chain of causation fails both because of the uncertainty of several individual links and because of the number of speculative links that must hold for the chain to connect the challenged act[ ] to the asserted particularized injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Fla. Audubon Soc'y v.

Cir. 1996) (en banc). In addition, \"[t]he presence and number of third-party links in this causal chain independently corroborate that [Plaintiffs'] claim of causation is 'entirely speculative' and insufficient for standing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695625,11334114,3695909,11334246\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that today's result means they will never be able to challenge the suitability determination and thereby prevent the river's designation. But this concern is overstated for two reasons. For one, the Court does not hold that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   plaintiff could have challenged the suitability determination; rather, a party could have standing if it alleged a specific, concrete injury that arises from the suitability determination\n   <em>\n    independent of\n   </em>\n   any consequence of designation. The Court simply concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to do that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs' inability to challenge the ultimate designation question reflects the particular nature of this statutory scheme-namely, Congress's decision to keep the final say on designation for itself. Should Plaintiffs desire to prevent designation, they are free to use the ordinary political channels to influence the decision of the Secretary of Interior and, if necessary, Congress. But absent a specific injury flowing from the suitability determination itself, they lack standing to block a possible future designation by first undoing the suitability determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant the government's Motion to Dismiss on the ground that Plaintiffs lack standing. A separate Order will accompany this Memorandum Opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    A river can also be designated by an act of legislation by the States through which the river flows and a finding by the Secretary of the Interior, upon application of the requisite State Governors, that the river meets the statutory criteria for designation.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201273\">\n     16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1273\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(ii).
