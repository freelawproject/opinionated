For example, recognizing that the Supreme Court has not decided whether a plaintiff seeking relief under the Equal Protection Clause must show that invidious partisanship was one consideration motivating a challenged districting plan's lines or that the mapdrawers were predominantly motivated by invidious partisanship, this Court found that Plaintiffs' intent evidence satisfied either standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305190\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/155/552/#p558\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305190\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/155/552/#p558\">\n    at 653-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20341658\">\n    2018 WL 341658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *45 ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 694-97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20341658\">\n    2018 WL 341658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *78-79 (Osteen, J., concurring). Likewise, the Court concluded that regardless of whether Plaintiffs or Defendants bore the burden under the Equal Protection Clause's justification prong, the evidence adduced at trial proved the 2016 Plan's invidious partisanship was not justified by the state's political geography or other legitimate state interests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20341658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 669 n.33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20341658\">\n    2018 WL 341658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *57 n.33 (majority op.).

Again, we disagree. The Supreme Court did not explain its decision to stay the remedial proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   . And there are a variety of reasons the Supreme Court may have decided to stay the remedial proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   that have no bearing on the instant cases. For example, the Supreme Court may have concluded that the state appellant in\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   was likely to prevail on its statewide standing argument. Or the Court may have believed that the substantial federalism concerns with invalidating state legislative districts, as opposed to congressional districts, weighed heavily in favor of staying remedial proceedings until the Court rendered a final decision. Or the Court may have concluded that the less extensive empirical evidence introduced in\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   was insufficient to demonstrate the challenged plan's discriminatory effects. Given that the Supreme Court provided no explanation for its decision to stay the remedial order in\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   and that there are a variety of reasons for staying remedial proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   that have no bearing on this case, the Supreme Court's decision to stay remedial proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   does not justify the \"extraordinary relief\" of staying this Court's Order and risking that North Carolina will conduct a fourth congressional election under an unconstitutional districting plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Legislative Defendants nonetheless suggest that the Supreme Court will stay this Court's Order because the\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   trial court gave the State a longer period of time to draw the remedial plan and the record in\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   included several constitutionally compliant alternative plans. Motion 5. But the\n   <em>\n    Whitford\n   </em>\n   Court was able to give the state months to draw remedial maps because the next election was nearly two years away when the court rendered its liability decision.

Accordingly, if this Court needs to extend the candidate-filing period to ensure any proposed remedial plan enacted by the General Assembly completely remedies the constitutional violation and is otherwise legally acceptable, it is within our power to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1343. Additionally, we emphasize that the majority's decision to appoint a special master to draw a back-up plan concurrent with the General Assembly's opportunity to enact a remedial plan, and the Court's review of any such plan, further ensures that the state's election cycle will be minimally impacted. In particular, in the event the General Assembly fails to enact a remedial plan or enacts a remedial plan that is legally unacceptable, the special master's back-up plan will be more quickly available-and thereby subjecting the State's electoral process to less disruption-than if the Court waited until after it reviewed the General Assembly's remedial to appoint a special master.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we deny Legislative Defendants' motion to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   DENIED\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Legislative Defendants in both actions are Robert A.
