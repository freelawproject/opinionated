INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court is Defendants Donald Trump, United States Department of State, Rex Tillerson, United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), United States Customs and Border Protection, Kevin McAleenan, Michele James, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Elaine Duke, and Daniel Coats's (collectively, \"Defendants\" or \"the Government\") emergency motion for a stay pending the appeal of the court's December 23, 2017, order granting Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunctions in the consolidated cases. (MFS (Dkt. # 95);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PI Order (Dkt. # 92).) The court directed Plaintiffs in the two consolidated cases\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to file separate responses to Defendants' motion. (12/30/17 Order (Dkt. # 97).) The court has considered the motion, Plaintiffs' responses (JFS Resp. (Dkt. # 100); Doe Resp. (Dkt. # 101) ), the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law. Being fully advised, the court DENIES the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 23, 2017, the court issued a preliminary injunction in the consolidated cases against certain aspects of Executive Order No. 13,815 (\"EO-4\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050%2C055\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 50,055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 27, 2017), and its accompanying memorandum to President Trump, from Secretary of State Tillerson, Acting Secretary of DHS Duke, and Director of National Intelligence (\"DNI\") Coats. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   PI Order;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Lin Decl. (Dkt. # 46) \u00b6 3, Ex. B (attaching a copy of the memorandum) (hereinafter, \"Agency Memo\").) The preliminary injunction enjoins Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"from enforcing those provisions of the Agency Memo that suspend the processing of [following-to-join (\"FTJ\") ] refugee applications or suspend the admission of FTJ refugees into the United States\" and \"those provisions of the Agency Memo that suspend or inhibit, including through the diversion of resources, the processing of refugee applications or the admission into the United States of refugees from [Security Advisory Opinion (\"SAO\") list] countries.\" (PI Order at 64-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 27, 2017, Defendants filed a motion asking the court to reconsider certain aspects of the preliminary injunction related to SAO countries. (MTR (Dkt. # 93).) Defendants' motion asked the court to reconsider its ruling that a bona fide\n   relationship with an American organization includes refugee applicants covered by a formal assurance from a refugee resettlement agency. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050%2C055\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PI Order at 63 n.31.) At the request of the court, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated response. (MTR Resp. (Dkt. # 98); 12/29/17 Order (Dkt. # 94).) On January 5, 2018, the court denied Defendants' motion for reconsideration. (1/5/18 Order (Dkt. # 103).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, on December 29, 2017, Defendants filed a second motion, which they denominated as an \"emergency motion\" for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending an appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MFS.) The court again directed Plaintiffs to file a response to Defendants' motion, but this time allowed Doe Plaintiffs and JFS Plaintiffs to file separately. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12/30/17 Order (Dkt. # 97).) Doe Plaintiffs and JFS Plaintiffs filed their responses on January 4, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JFS Resp.; Doe Resp.) On the same day, Defendants filed a notice of appeal of the court's preliminary injunction. (Notice of Appeal (Dkt. # 99).) Finally, on January 5, 2018, Defendants filed a \"notice,\" which asked the court to stay that portion of the preliminary injunction that Defendants unsuccessfully challenged in their motion for reconsideration. (Notice re: MFS (Dkt. # 104).) The court now considers Defendants' emergency motion for a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In analyzing Defendants' motion, the court first considers its own jurisdiction to decide the motion. Next, the court considers certain statements in Defendants' motion, which impliedly modify the court's preliminary injunction unilaterally. Finally, the court considers the merits of Defendants' motion to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because Defendants filed a notice of appeal (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Appeal), the court first considers its own jurisdiction to decide Defendants' emergency motion for a stay pending appeal. \"While a preliminary injunction is pending on appeal, a district court lacks jurisdiction to modify the injunction in such a manner as to 'finally adjudicate substantial rights directly involved in the appeal.' \"\n   <em>\n    A &amp; M Records v. Napster, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509143\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/284/1091/#p1099\">\n    284 F.3d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1099 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1479356\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/258/165/\">\n    258 U.S. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1479356\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/258/165/\">\n    42 S.Ct. 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1479356\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/258/165/\">\n    66 L.Ed. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1922) ). Nevertheless, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c) allows the court to issue further orders with respect to an injunction, even during an appeal, in order to preserve the status quo or ensure compliance with its earlier orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Sw. Marine, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129367\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/1163/#p1166\">\n    242 F.3d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1166 (9th Cir. 2001). Indeed, \"[t]he plain language of Rule 62(c) allows the district court to 'suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction' during the pendency of [an] interlocutory appeal, and such action can inure to the benefit of plaintiffs or defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayweathers v. Newland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084137\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/930/#p935\">\n    258 F.3d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 935 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(c) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1) (\"A party must ordinarily move first in the district court for the following relief: (A) a stay of the ... order of a district court pending appeal; ... or (C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is pending.\"). Based on these authorities, the court concludes that it has jurisdiction to consider Defendants' emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction despite the pending appeal. The court's exercise of jurisdiction, however, may \"not 'materially alter the status of the case on appeal.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mayweathers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084137\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/930/#p935\">\n    258 F.3d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat.

Defendants' Attempts to Unilaterally Modify the Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants declare in their motion they \"do not understand the preliminary\n   injunction to require affirmative action to undo any of the steps that were taken to implement the Joint Memorandum prior to December 23.\" (MFS at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (\"Defendants do not understand the preliminary injunction to require them to take affirmative steps to undo decisions that were made consistent with the [Agency Memo] prior to the preliminary injunction's issuance.\").) To the extent that this declaration is an attempt to unilaterally modify the preliminary injunction, the court rejects it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court's preliminary injunction requires Defendants to take actions that are necessary to undo those portions of the Agency Memo that are enjoined. For example, if Defendants sent guidance suspending the admission of FTJ refugees or refugees from SAO countries, they must rescind that guidance. If they issued instructions to de-prioritize the processing of applications from SAO countries, they must reverse those instructions. Defendants are required to restore the status quo prior to the issuance of the Agency Memo with respect to the processing of applications from FTJ refugees and refugees from SAO countries. Contrary to Defendants' assertions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MFS at 5), this requirement does not transform the preliminary injunction into a mandatory one,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124429\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/1053/#p1060\">\n    757 F.3d 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1060-61 (9th Cir. 2014) (holding that an injunction that prohibits the enforcement of a new law or policy is prohibitory, not mandatory, even where the policy has already taken effect prior to filing the lawsuit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In any event, Defendants' arguments that they should be excused from taking any \"affirmative actions\" to comply with the preliminary injunction are conclusory and unsupported by any evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , MFS at 5 (asserting without evidence that there \"is significant doubt about whether it would even be possible for Defendants to undo some of their prior decisions\").) Indeed, the only concrete example that Defendants provide to support their argument relates to certain \"circuit rides\" that Defendants scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 pursuant to the Agency Memo's directive to divert resources away from processing SAO refugee applications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Defendants posit that they \"might\" have to cancel the presently scheduled \"circuit rides\" and refugee applicant interviews if they are required to comply with the preliminary injunction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 (asserting this possibility without evidentiary support).) First, contrary to Defendants' assertions, nothing in the preliminary injunction requires Defendants to cancel any already-scheduled circuit rides or refugee interviews. Complying with the preliminary injunction, however, does require Defendants to restore any circuit rides that they would have scheduled absent the Agency Memo. Second, Defendants have submitted no evidence that such interviews could not be restored without cancelling previously scheduled interviews. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MFS;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt.) Indeed, the time to submit such evidence, to the extent it exists, would have been when the court was considering Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction. Thus, the court rejects Defendants' apparent attempts to unilaterally\n   modify the preliminary injunction and again orders Defendants to comply with the preliminary injunction as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Motion to Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the Ninth Circuit, \"[t]he standard for evaluating stays pending appeal is similar to that employed by district courts in deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that either SAO or FTJ refugees pose a security threat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Countering Defendants' general and unspecified concerns, Plaintiffs offer detailed testimony from numerous former national security officials concretely describing how the Agency Memo will harm our national security and foreign policy interests.

Based on the record before it, the court cannot conclude that Defendants have met their burden of establishing that the public interest favors a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition, Defendants' own actions undermine their position that they or the public interest will be harmed absent a stay. Defendants assert that they have tracked down Joseph Doe's family and that a \"[p]roposed interim guidance\" of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") would allow travel to the United States of Joseph's family and all other FTJ refugee applicants who obtained valid travel documents on or before October 24, 2017-the day that Defendants issued EO-4 and the Agency Memo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (MFS at 9; Smith Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.)

Thus, Defendants have decided to admit certain FTJ refugees, including those from SAO countries, prior to implementation of the additional screening procedures for FTJ refugees or completion of the additional threat analysis of SAO countries that the Agency Memo prescribes. This decision undermines Defendants' position that the preliminary injunction impairs national security or that Defendants will be irreparably harmed absent a stay. Defendants' decision to permit Joseph Doe's family, as well as other FTJ and SAO refugees, to travel to the United States so long as they received their travel papers prior to October 24, 2017, confirms that the government will suffer no irreparable harm by allowing such refugee admissions during the pendency of their appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Defendants again rely on the Supreme Court's December 4, 2017, stay orders in\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

(MFS at 2.) Defendants' reliance on these two stay orders is misplaced. First, the court has already declined to speculate on the reasons for the Supreme Court's December 4, 2017, stay orders, which involved preliminary\n   injunctions against portions of Presidential Proclamation No. 9,645,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2045%2C161\">\n    82 Fed.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PI Order at 61-62 n.30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, the balancing of the equities here is necessarily different here than in the cases challenging EO-3. This case involves refugees-individuals \"who are fleeing danger\" and \"who have been persecuted by actual terrorists\"-and their families or other individuals or organizations in the United States with whom those refugees have a bona fide relationship. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Decl. Former Nat'l Sec. Officers \u00b6 14.f;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2045%2C161\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2045%2C161\">\n    \u00b6 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The two cases stayed by the Supreme Court on December 4, 2017, challenged EO-3 and did not involve refugees or those here in the United States with a bona fide relationship to refugees. Further, in this case, Defendants have acknowledged that they will process the applications of FTJ refugees and refugees from SAO countries so long as the refugees received their travel papers prior to October 24, 2017. As discussed above, this acknowledgement undermines Defendants' assertion of national security concerns regarding the admission of FTJ and SAO refugees pending Defendants' appeal and necessarily affects the balancing of equities in this case in a manner not applicable to the cases challenging EO-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, the EO-3 cases before the Supreme Court involved entry prohibitions by the President and specific authorities that Congress granted the President in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) and 1185(a)(1). Those authorities and the unique role the President may play based on those authorities is not at issue here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PI Order at 51 (discussing statutory authorities invoked in this case).) Indeed, the restrictions at issue here were put into place by agency officials after the President found that his suspension of entry of refugees was no longer necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   EO-4 \u00a7 3(a) (\"Presidential action to suspend the entry of refugees under [United States Refugee Assistance Program (\"USRAP\") ] is not needed at this time to protect the security and interests of the United States and its people.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Agency Memo at 2-3 (suspending the processing of applications and entry of refugees from SAO countries for 90 days and FTJ refugees indefinitely).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Third, Defendants again ignore the Supreme Court's earlier, reasoned opinion denying a stay in relevant part in\n   <em>\n    Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605175\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2080/#p2089\">\n    137 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2089,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605175\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2080/#p2089\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    IRAP\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    IRAP\n   </em>\n   , like this case, involved a purportedly temporary ban on refugees contained in Executive Order No. 13,780,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2013%2C209\">\n    82 Fed.

Nevertheless, the Supreme Court denied a stay of the injunctions on EO-2 as to the same refugees protected by the preliminary injunction here-those with a bona fide relationship to United States persons or entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2089. Thus, for all of the foregoing reasons, the court again rejects Defendants' argument that the Supreme Court's December 4, 2017, stay orders concerning EO-3 require this court to balance the equities in Defendants' favor or to impose a stay on the preliminary injunction in this litigation as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, the court concludes that Defendants have failed to demonstrate that they will be irreparably injured absent a stay or that the public interest favors a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Issuance of the Stay Will Substantially Injure the Other Interested Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants' contentions concerning a lack of injury to individual Plaintiffs in the event of a stay pending appeal again\n   reiterate arguments that this court has already rejected. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 6-10\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   PI Order at 12-16, 20-25, 56-57.) Defendants provide the court with no basis to reevaluate its prior rulings that Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed in the absence of a preliminary injunction. Further, Defendants ignore the harm to organizational Plaintiffs, such as JFS-S and JFS-SV, in their motion seeking a stay. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   MFS.) These organizational Plaintiffs would also suffer substantial harm in the event of a stay. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PI order at 25-28.) The court concludes that Defendants failed to demonstrate that this factor favors a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Having evaluated all the factors that guide its exercise of discretion, the court denies Defendants' motion for a stay. In addition, for the same reasons as stated herein and in its order denying Defendants' motion for reconsideration (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1/5/18 Order), the court also denies Defendants' request in their January 5, 2018, notice for a more limited stay concerning those refugees who have a bona fide relationship with an entity in the United States through a resettlement assurance agency (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice re: MFS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Based on the analysis and authority cited above, the court DENIES Defendants' motion to stay the court's preliminary injunction order pending appeal (Dkt. # 95) and their request for a more limited in stay contained in their January 5, 2018, notice (Dkt. # 104).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Doe, et al. v.
