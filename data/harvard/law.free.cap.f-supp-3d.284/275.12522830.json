R. CIV. P.\" or \"Rule\") 56 for partial summary judgment. Specifically, the Defendants seek an order dismissing all of the Plaintiff's claims against the individual Defendants due to the expiration of the statute of limitations; or in the alternative, dismissal of the Plaintiff's Section 1983 claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution. For the following reasons, the Defendants motion is granted in part, and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the parties' respective Local Rule 56.1 Statements. The Court notes that while the Defendants and the Plaintiff included many facts relating to the Plaintiff's medications and alleged injuries, those facts are not discussed here because they do not bear on his false arrest or malicious prosecution claims, which are the only claims on which the Defendants have moved for summary judgment based on the admissible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May of 2011, the Plaintiff lived at 187 Edinburgh Drive, Ridge, New York. The Plaintiff's residence was a condominium that is part of a homeowner's corporation known as Leisure Knoll Association, Inc. (\"Leisure Knoll\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the relevant period, Karen Kluber (\"Kluber\") was an employee of Leisure Knoll, and she worked on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 11, 2011, Judge Patricia Filiberto (\"Judge Filiberto\") of the First District Court, County of Suffolk issued a temporary order of protection against the Plaintiff in favor of Kluber, in a criminal case that was pending against the Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    People of the State of New York v. Clifford Williams\n   </em>\n   , 2011SU0282.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The order of protection ordered the Plaintiff to stay away from Kluber, and to stay away from her home, school, and place of business. It further directed him to refrain from communicating with, assaulting, stalking, harassing, menacing, intimidating, or threatening Kluber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 31, 2011, Judge Filiberto denied the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office application to expand the order of protection to include the Leisure Village Recreation Center, located at 103 Sheffield Drive, Ridge, New York 11961.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 18, 2011, Kluber informed the SCPD that the Plaintiff had violated the order of protection. She signed a sworn SCPD Statement Form, in which she said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I, Karen Kluber[,] am an employee of Leisure Knolls Association, Inc. I was in the Recreation Building on Sheffield Dr. in Ridge with Fred Falco the Leisure Knolls Manager. I have an Order of Protection issued by 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   District Ct. Judge Filiberto [on] docket # 2011SU0282-issued on 8/1/11-to expire 8/1/12. The Order of Protection is against Clifford Williams. On Oct. 18, 2011 at approximately 2:45 pm[,] I was posting papers in [the] window box in the common area of the Recreation center. Clifford Williams walked into the Room, walked by me, smirked and chuckled at me, walk[ed] towards the bathroom and snapped a few pictures of me. Cliff walked out the back door. Cliff then returned and re-entered through the front door again, walked very slowly by me within 1 foot. The order of protection is a stay away order. Cliff knew I was inside[,] and instead of just leaving the first time[,] he approached me. These actions did clearly violate the stay\n   away portion. I have read this statement and I swear it is the truth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Defs.' 56.1 Statement \u00b6 6). The SCPD Statement Form states that \"[f]alse statements made herein are punishable as a class \"A\" misdemeanor pursuant to Section 210.45 of the Penal Law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 18, 2011, Officer Jeheber arrested the Plaintiff and charged him with criminal contempt in the second degree,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20PENAL%20LAW%20%C2%A7%20215.50\">\n    N.Y. PENAL LAW \u00a7 215.50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -3, for violating the order of protection. At the time of the arrest, the Plaintiff told Officer Jeheber that the order of protection did not require him to stay away from the recreation center. Officer Jeheber did not investigate the Plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Officer Jeheber prepared a misdemeanor information outlining the Plaintiff's alleged criminal conduct. In the information, Officer Jeheber wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The [Plaintiff], at 103 Sheffield Dr., Ridge, in the town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, New York, on or about October 18, 2011, at approximately 2:45 P.M., engaged in intentional disobedience or resistance to the lawful process or other mandate of a court; in that, the [Plaintiff], did walk past the victim, [Kluber] [ ], and did laugh at her before taking [her] picture. The [Plaintiff] left the building and then re-entered through the front door and walked slowly past the victim. The [Plaintiff] is in violation of an existing order docket # 2011SU0282 issued by Judge Filiberto on 8/1/11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Officer Jeheber noted that the charge was based both upon his own personal knowledge, as well as information from Kluber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Plaintiff was transported to the SCPD Seventh Police Precinct, and remained there until the morning of October 19, 2011. Between October 19, 2011 and October 21, 2011, the Plaintiff was treated at several area hospitals for injuries that he alleges were caused by members of the SCPD. On October 22, 2011, he was arraigned on the misdemeanor information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At some point, the Plaintiff brought a motion to dismiss the misdemeanor information for facial insufficiency. On September 26, 2014, the First District Court, County of Suffolk, issued a written order dismissing the misdemeanor information for facial insufficiency. The court, in its order, noted that the certified copy of the order of protection had not been filed with the misdemeanor information; and that the information did not contain any non-hearsay allegations establishing that the Plaintiff had notice of the order of protection or its contents. (Defs.' Ex. G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Relevant Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 18, 2014, the Plaintiff filed his initial complaint. The initial complaint brought claims against the County and the SCPD. It did not name any of the individual Defendants, but instead brought claims against unnamed John Doe SCPD officers. On October 9, 2014, the County and the SCPD filed their answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 19, 2015, the Plaintiff, without the consent of the Defendants, or leave from the Court, filed an amended complaint. On February 25, 2015, the Defendants filed a letter motion to strike the amended complaint. The Defendants' letter motion was denied without prejudice, as this Court does not permit letter motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   INDIV. R. OF ARTHUR D. SPATT, RULE IV-B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 31, 2015, the Court liberally construed the Plaintiff's filing of an amended complaint as a request to amend his complaint. The Court noted that the Defendants had failed to renew their letter motion to strike the amended complaint as a formal motion, and granted the Plaintiff's\n   motion to amend the complaint as unopposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Plaintiff's amended complaint substituted Officers Crawford, Suarez, Jeheber, Sangimino, and Santanello for the John Doe defendants. Many of the Plaintiff's claims in the amended complaint are redundant, and most of the claims do not specify against which Defendant they are brought. Therefore, assuming that where the Plaintiff does not name certain defendants, he intends to bring the claim against all of the Defendants, the Plaintiff brings claims against all of the Defendants for false arrest under Section 1983 ; excessive force under Section 1983 ; Section 1983 conspiracy; and malicious prosecution under Section 1983. Finally, the Plaintiff alleges that the constitutional violations were a result of a policy or practice of the County, and brings a Section 1983\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the County pursuant to that allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 4, 2017, the Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56. The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff's claims against the individual Defendants must be dismissed because the claims were filed after the statute of limitations had run, and the Plaintiff's amended complaint does not relate back to the initial filing. Alternatively, the Defendants contend that the Plaintiff cannot sustain his claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution because he was arrested on the sworn complaint of a victim, and because he did not obtain a favorable termination of prosecution. In the final alternative, the Defendants state that Officer Jeheber is entitled to qualified immunity on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under FED. R. CIV.

As to Whether the Plaintiff's Claims Against the Individual Defendants Are Barred by the Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff's claims against the individual Defendants are barred by the statute of limitations because he did not amend his complaint until more than three years after his claim accrued, and he cannot avail himself of the benefits of Rule 15(c) because a lack of knowledge of a defendant's identity is not a \"mistake\" under Rule 15.

Instead, she swore that he violated the \"stay away\" portion of the order. Kluber said that the Plaintiff did this by taking photographs of her; purposefully returning to the recreation center after seeing her there moments earlier despite the stay away order; and walking right up to her.
