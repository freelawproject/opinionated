The Court held a hearing on July 24, 2017. The primary issues are: (i) whether New Mexico's filed rate doctrine bars Plaintiff Helen Bhasker's negligence claims, claims under New Mexico's Unfair Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-12-1\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 57-12-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"UPA\") violations, claims under New Mexico's Unfair Insurance Practices Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 59A-16-1 (\"UIPA\"), and claims of breach of contract alleging that Financial Indemnity Company (\"Financial Indemnity\") sold her illusory underinsured motorist insurance (\"UIM\"); (ii) whether, if New Mexico applies the filed rate doctrine to consumer-protection claims against insurers, Bhasker can seek premium-based damages, which depends on whether Bhasker's UIM coverage was illusory; (iii) whether, if the UIM coverage is not illusory, Bhasker's claims fail as a matter of law, because the UIM coverage offers benefits in some situations; and (iv) whether the voluntary payment doctrine bars Bhasker's claims. The Court concludes that: (i) the filed rate doctrine does not bar Bhasker's claims, because the Supreme Court of New Mexico would not apply the filed rate doctrine to claims against insurers alleging unfair or deceptive business practices; (ii) even if New Mexico applied the filed rate doctrine to those claims, Bhasker and the proposed class could still seek premium-based damages, because the Supreme Court of New Mexico would determine that the UIM coverage was illusory in light of little coverage it provides; (iii) even if the UIM coverage is not illusory, Bhasker's claims may proceed, because they do not require that the UIM coverage be illusory; and (iv) the voluntary payment doctrine does not bar Bhasker's claims, because she alleges that she did not know all the material facts. Accordingly, the Court denies the MTD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bhasker contends that, \"[b]ased on the information provided by the Defendant,\" she agreed to \"pay a six-month premium for the State of New Mexico mandated minimum automobile bodily injury and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.\" First Amended Class Action Complaint for Breach of Statutory, Common law, and Contractual Duties \u00b6 30, at 5, filed March 23, 2017 (Doc. 12)(\"Complaint\"). According to Bhasker, her insurance policy features: (i) liability coverage on one vehicle for $25,000.00 per person and $50,000.00 per accident, per vehicle; and (ii) underinsured coverage on one vehicle for $25,000.00 per person and $50,000 per occurrence, per vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, at 7 (citing Coverage for 1995 Lexus LS 500 4D at 1 (Doc. 12-2)). Bhasker asserts that Financial Indemnity did not \"fully inform\" her that \"a purchase of 25/50 underinsured coverage, when triggered by a crash with a tortfeasor who has 25/50 bodily injury liability limits, will result in a payment of premium for which no payment of benefits will occur ....\" Complaint \u00b6 48, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bhasker avers that, on June 24, 2015, she was driving eastbound on I-40 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when another driver, Stephanie Martinez, \"failed to stop for the traffic in front of her vehicle\" and struck Bhasker's car in the rear, causing \"serious bodily injuries and other damages.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, at 2-3. Bhasker asserts that Martinez \"was an underinsured motorist at the time of the collision\" as Bhasker's insurance policy and New Mexico law define the term. Complaint \u00b6 17, at 3. Bhasker contends that she \"received the full extent of liability coverage carried by Ms. Martinez,\" which was $25,000.00. Complaint \u00b6 18, at 3. Bhasker asserts that after the accident, Financial Indemnity provided a certified copy of a document summarizing her policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 38, at 6 (citing New Mexico Personal Auto Application at 1-4 (Doc. 12-1)(\"Policy Application\")).

Furthermore, Bhasker contends that the Policy Application's language is \"deceptive and clearly ambiguous in that it states that the applicant may purchase underinsured coverage in excess of the bodily injury coverage limits, which is the opposite of the legislative intent\" of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2066-5-301\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 66-5-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and New Mexico case law. Complaint \u00b6 40, at 6. Bhasker contends that Financial Indemnity's Policy Application\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   did not alert [her], nor make clear to the ordinary and similarly situated insured, the fact that the New Mexico offset law drastically and materially diminished payment of benefits arising from a covered occurrence under the policy.... Specifically, there is virtually no possible underinsured minimum limits claim available to the Plaintiff and other similarly situated members of the class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Complaint \u00b6 43, at 7. Bhasker avers that, when she, \"through counsel, demanded Defendant provide [her] with underinsured benefits that Defendant solicited and for which the Plaintiff paid a premium,\" Financial Indemnity denied her claim for underinsured benefits. Complaint \u00b6 44, at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Bhasker further contends that Financial Indemnity has \"written direct premium automobile insurance to thousands of New Mexico residents and, from 2010-12-14, wrote direct premiums\" around the United States totaling $1.09 billion.

In her Complaint, Bhasker argues that Financial Indemnity\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"failed to act honestly and in good faith when it solicited and sold superfluous and illusory minimal limits underinsured motorist coverage to their insureds (in whole or in part)\" in violation of New Mexico law, \"and/or they denied claims for the benefits of that coverage.\" Complaint \u00b6 1, at 1. Bhasker contends that, \"[b]asically, there is no such thing as 'minimum limits underinsured motorist coverage.' \" Complaint \u00b6 1, at 1. Bhasker asserts that she \"brings this action on her own behalf, and on behalf of the many insured around the state who have been deceived by [Financial Indemnity's] practices.\" Complaint \u00b6 4, at 2. Bhasker contends that, before the accident, she had \"properly paid a premium for automobile coverage under the Financial Indemnity Company auto insurance policy,\" and, therefore, \"had a reasonable expectation\" that she carried underinsured motorist coverage for \"$25,000.00 each person and $50,000.00 each accident.\" Complaint \u00b6 19, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Next, Bhasker asserts that the Supreme Court of New Mexico \"established that underinsured coverage is superfluous when the tortfeasor and the injured driver both carry the statutory minimum of liability and underinsured coverage.\" Complaint \u00b6 23, at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Progressive\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Northwestern Ins.

Bhasker also avers that Financial Indemnity used an \"incorrect and inappropriate form from another state,\" which \"included ambiguous language that Plaintiff could purchase underinsured coverage in excess of her selected liability coverage limits.\" Complaint \u00b6 27, at 4 (citing Policy Application at 1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Bhasker alleges that Financial Indemnity \"misrepresented to [her] that she would benefit from underinsured coverage when they knew, or should have known, that the coverage was meaningless,\" and that Financial Indemnity made these misrepresentations \"knowingly and willfully, with the intent to deceive and induce the Plaintiff in purchasing underinsured coverage.\" Complaint \u00b6 29, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Bhasker contends that Financial Indemnity breached its duty to \"fully inform Plaintiff what the monthly premiums would be for the next available tier of coverage.\" Complaint \u00b6 33, at 5.

Bhasker also asserts that Financial Indemnity breached its duty to \"act fairly, honestly, and in good faith\" when it (i) \"failed to fully inform Plaintiff of illusory underinsured coverage with a disproportionate premium/indemnification ratio when compared to the next tier of available coverage\"; and (ii) \"materially misrepresent[ed] the terms of underinsured coverage.\" Complaint \u00b6 35, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Bhasker alleges that, by \"fail[ing] to offer their insured sufficient information and knowledge regarding the superfluous, illusory, and deceptive coverage,\" Financial Indemnity violated the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-12-1\">\n    N.M.

Taking Plaintiff's Complaint allegations that Defendant rarely, if ever, pays under minimum limits UIM coverage as true, then by definition the portion of the rate for the combined UM/UIM coverage that is attributable to UIM, as opposed to UM, coverage would be minimal based on a minimal loss payment history. So, again taking Plaintiff's Complaint allegations as true, Defendant cannot, as a matter of law, be collecting excessive premiums for UIM coverage that has an allegedly small or \"illusory\" value.

Plaintiff calculates her \"disproportionate underinsured indemnification to premium ratio\" as follows: \"$25,000.00/$81=308,\" and states \"the Plaintiff would be indemnified up to $25,000.00 in underinsured coverage with a purchase of the next tier of available coverage of $50,000.00 per person/$100.000.00 per accident after the offset.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   , n. 5 &amp; n. 6.) If, as Plaintiff maintains, she is not challenging insurance rates, her Complaint would not allege, as it plainly does, that Defendant has charged a disproportionate premium for minimum limits UIM coverage, or set forth calculations regarding that alleged wrongful premium, and it certainly would not seek a class-wide refund of supposedly improperly collected minimum limits UIM premiums. Put simply, on the face of the Complaint Plaintiff herself has injected \"unlawful premiums\" as a damages element in this case, alleging she and the class overpaid for worthless coverage.

Financial Indemnity began by arguing that there are three reasons why the Court should grant its MTD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:6-7 (Hanover). First, Financial Indemnity argued that Bhasker \"is challenging the amount of the premium that she was charged for her minimum limits UIM coverage, and this challenge is barred by the Filed Rate Doctrine.\" Tr. at 3:8-12 (Hanover). The Court asked whether New Mexico courts have ever \"squarely adopted\" the filed rate doctrine, Tr. at 3:13-14 (Court), and Financial Indemnity answered that it \"can't cite to a New Mexico state court case that's adopted it [but] I will say that I'm not aware of any state that has ever rejected the filed rate doctrine,\" Tr. at 3:21-24 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity stated that Montana \"is the only state I can think of that hasn't formally adopted [the filed rate doctrine] but they have not rejected it either.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:2-7 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court asked Financial Indemnity: \"[I]f you had an illusory contract in which you did not have anything being sold, do you think the Supreme Court of New Mexico would say ... the filed rate doctrine-that it's never adopted-is going to bar a claim for that?\" Tr. at 4:8-13 (Court). Financial Indemnity stated that it did not know, but conceded that it would be unlikely that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would bar such a claim based on the filed rate doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:7-9 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity asserted, nonetheless, that the UM/UIM coverage in this case is not illusory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:14-16 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Court then asked Financial Indemnity about\n   <em>\n    Coll v. First American Title Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:10-14 (Court). Financial Indemnity explained that the Tenth Circuit held that \"any filed rate that is one approved by the governing regulatory agency is, per se, reasonable and unassailable in judicial proceedings brought by ratepayers.\" Tr. at 6:24-7:4 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity asserted that the filed rate doctrine's purpose is \"to preserve the role of regulatory bodies in approving rates and maintaining markets and keeping courts out of the ratemaking process.\" Tr. at 7:4-8 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity asserted that, in New Mexico, there is a \"comprehensive rating scheme\" for insurance rates: \"Section 17.9 of the Insurance Code requires insurers to file the rates with the Superintendent of Insurance ... prior to using them.\" Tr. at 7:9-13 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity asserted that Section 17.12 \"requires insurers to charge only the rates that are lawfully in effect as provided in the insurance rate regulation laws, and the Superintendent of Insurance has exclusive authority over any challenges to fixed rates.\" Tr. at 7:13-17 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity asserted that, under New Mexico's Insurance Code, any \"aggrieved person\" has the right to a hearing before the Superintendent of Insurance. Tr. at 7:23-25 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity concluded that \"this comprehensive scheme leaves no doubt that the New Mexico Legislature did not intend for the premiums charged by insurers to be collaterally\n   estopped, and that's exactly what the plaintiffs are alleging here with their illusory coverage theory.\" Tr. at 8:1-6 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   The plaintiff specifically alleged that the premium that she paid for her UM/UIM coverage was too high. She calculates the ratios for minimum limits and for higher limits, with the contention that the premium actually charged to the plaintiff was excessive.

Financial Indemnity answered that a \"majority [of jurisdictions] have found that coverage was not illusory, and a minority have found that coverage is illusory.\" Tr. at 9:13-16 (Court). Financial Indemnity argued that the cases that have found coverage to be illusory can be separated into two categories:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Some of them, such as the\n   <em>\n    Hoglund[ v.

Financial Indemnity argued that, in this case, certain clues indicate that this is not a \"purely coverage\" question,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , because the \"putative class definition includes everyone that has the coverage, without regard to whether or not they've had any claim,\" and because Bhasker \"is challenging\n   the proportionality and amount of the premium that was charged for coverage that they believe to have been either completely or nearly worthless.\" Tr. at 11:8-17 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court then asked Bhasker whether she thought that the Tenth Circuit \"has correctly read New Mexico as adopting the filed rate doctrine.\" Tr. at 13:5-7 (Court).

The Court asked Bhasker how she can \"get around the Tenth Circuit application of that particular case,\" and Bhasker responded that \"the way you get around it is to focus on the relief Plaintiff seeks,\" and, in the Tenth Circuit case, \"the relief they were seeking was to adjust the rates.\" Tr. at 13:16-19 (Bhasker). The Court asked: \"[I]f you're asking for a refund of premiums, you are asking for some premiums back.\" Tr. at 13:22-24 (Court). Bhasker answered that she \"has not specifically requested that we receive a refund of the rates.\" Tr. at 14:2-6 (Bhasker). Bhasker asserted that she seeks \"remedies that are available for the misleading and unconscionable trade practice ... [which] include actual damages, punitive damages, attorney fees.\" Tr. at 14:10-13 (Bhasker). The Court wondered whether, to award damages to Bhasker, it would have to determine that the premiums were unlawful, and therefore \"run into the filed rate doctrine.\" Tr. at 14:14-20 (Court). Bhasker answered that \"the term 'unlawful premium' was first published by the defendant\" and that \"[n]owhere in our complaint have to we alleged that there was an unlawful premium.\" Tr. at 14:21-24 (Bhasker). The Court asked whether Bhasker's reference to \" 'illusory uninsured coverage with a disproportionate premium identification ratio, when compared to the next tier of available coverage' \" in her Complaint alleged an unlawful premium. Tr. at 14:25-15:5 (Court)(quoting Complaint \u00b6 35, at 6). Bhasker responded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   this description of the ratio and the next tier is to provide an example of the illusory nature of this coverage, and if the Court believes that this example is alleging that the rates are not fair, we would request that ... there would be a chance to amend the complaint to clear up this type of language.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Tr. at 15:6-13 (Bhasker).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Bhasker then argued that this case is distinct from the Tenth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Coll v. First American Title Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , because, in that case, \"the filed rate was applicable to preclude damages for restitution, unjust enrichment, and disgorgement of the excessive amounts charged for title insurance,\" but, in this case, Bhasker seeks \"the underinsured motorist benefits and any other damages the Court deems fair,\" but not restitution or unjust enrichment. Tr. at 15:18-24 (Bhasker).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Next, Bhasker argued that the Supreme Court of Alabama determined in\n   <em>\n    Peachtree Casualty Insurance v.

Bhasker answered that she would not agree with that statement, but added that \"I would agree that the vast majority of cases Defendant has cited [holds that the filed rate doctrine] blocks claims wherein the plaintiff are seeking rate adjustments.\" Tr. at 17:23-1 (Bhasker). The Court asked whether Bhasker could identify a case in which a plaintiff brought an illusory insurance claim, and the court discussed the filed rate doctrine and explained how they were allowing the claim to go forward despite the doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:2-6 (Bhasker).

Financial Indemnity stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   I believe it's disingenuous for Plaintiff to argue that they're not seeking any return of premium, when they broadly define the class to include people who have no claims whatsoever. It's difficult to figure out what possible damages would be there if there is no allegation to get premium back. Although the plaintiff has styled causes of action for ... violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act or Unfair Insurance Practices Act, there is no factual conduct that's alleged that could possibly constitute any violations of those acts, because there is no dispute that the terms of the policy disclosed the minimum UIM coverage limits; disclosed the terms of those coverages; that the plaintiff was on notice about New Mexico law with respect to the offset provision. And nothing in the complaint suggests anything improper or fraudulent about that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Tr. at 18:24-19:17 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court then switched to the voluntary payment doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:21 (Court). Financial Indemnity began by arguing that, in New Mexico, \"payments which are voluntarily made, with full knowledge of facts, cannot be recovered, in absence of fraud or duress.\" Tr. at 19:22-25 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity argued\n   that Bhasker knew the policy's terms, \"was constructively on notice of New Mexico, and may have been actually on notice.\" Tr. at 20:8-12 (Hanover). Moreover, Financial Indemnity argued, Bhasker \"paid her premium voluntarily,\" and there are \"no well-pleaded facts about any fraud or any duress.\" Tr. at 20:11-13 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity asserts that Bhasker's argument that Financial Indemnity was \"somehow required to affirmatively advise about the effect of New Mexico's offset law is not supported by any case law or other authority, nor does it preclude the application of the Voluntary Payments Doctrine.\" Tr. at 20:13-18 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity contends that Bhasker has not proffered any facts indicating circumstances under which the reasonable expectations doctrine should apply even in the face of clear policy language, nor is there anything in the pleadings indicating Bhasker got anything other than what she sought to purchase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20:25-21-14 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Financial Indemnity next argues that the \"only context in which New Mexico courts have required additional disclosure requirements have been where a policyholder rejects UM/UIM coverage limits in the same amount as the liability limit, which is not the situation here [because Bhasker] actually purchased the coverage limits.\" Tr. at 21:20-25 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Financial Indemnity also asserts that, although Bhasker correctly states that New Mexico courts have applied the voluntary payment doctrine only to cases relating to restitution, \"there is no case that suggests that they wouldn't apply it more broadly than restitution.\" Tr. at 22:3-9 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Court let Bhasker respond on the voluntary payment doctrine issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:12-13 (Court).

As for the voluntary payment doctrine, Bhasker stated that she asks the Court \"to focus on the remedy plaintiffs seek.\" Tr. at 23:6-7 (Bhasker). Bhasker asserted that in creating the class definition, \"we made it broad so we can encompass-not leave out-potential members, but if Your Honor requests, we can change the class definition.\" Tr. at 23:9-12 (Bhasker). Bhasker asserted that, if the Court \"believes that our complaint seeks restitution, unjust enrichment, and disgorgement, we would be happy to amend the complaint and make it clear that we seek the underinsured motorist coverage.\" Tr. at 24:3-7 (Bhasker). The Court asked for clarification, and Bhasker replied that she wants the \"benefit of the premium she paid\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that she benefits from the underinsured motorist coverage for $25,000.00. Tr. at 24:8-15 (Court, Bhasker). Bhasker added that there may be \"other situations for the putative class where those amounts may differ.\" Tr. at 24:16-17 (Bhasker). The Court asked how it could give Bhasker that coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:18-19 (Court).

And ... the plaintiff contended that this constituted a rejection of coverage. And as a rejection of UM coverage, it was subject to the New Mexico requirements for affirmative statements about rejecting UM coverage. These statements were allegedly not provided, and therefore, they claimed that the rejection was improper. So that they had never actually rejected coverage, and they should have the full limits up to the liability limits. The Supreme Court agreed with them. So the way that they reformed those policies was that they gave the plaintiffs coverage up to the full level of liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Here, there is no issue about any rejection, and the plaintiffs in the putative class already have the same UM/UIM limits as the liability limits. So if you're not trying to refund some sort of premium for allegedly illusory coverage, I'm hard-pressed to think about what you could possibly give them in terms of additional coverage. There is no allegation about any limits. We would just be engaging in sheer speculation as to what the plaintiff or the putative class may or may not have done if they had read their policy or thought about New Mexico law, or decided that the coverage was not worth a sufficient amount for them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Tr. at 25:11-26:18 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Financial Indemnity then identified \"three circumstances where the minimum limits UIM coverage does have value here\": (i) \"where the tortfeasor is an out-of-state driver who may have statutory limits lower than [is required in] New Mexico\"; (ii) \"where there are multiple injured parties, such that no one of them can recover the full amount of the tortfeasor's liability limits\"; and (iii) \"where the tortfeasor's policy limits contractually limits any payments for punitive damages judgments.\" Tr. at 26:19-27:6 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity contended that, \"if we accept ... that [the minimum limits UIM coverage is] worth something,\" the question becomes how much is that coverage worth, and who should decide.

Financial Indemnity asserted that it is the Superintendent of Insurance's job to determine insurance policies' worth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27:14-18 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity then argued that, because Bhasker paid one premium for combined underinsured and uninsured coverage, and insurers are allowed to set rates based on their loss history, it \"may be that only a miniscule portion\" of the combined premium \"related to the UIM portion versus the UM portion.\" Tr. at 27:19-28:20 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   those are all facts that we don't have here, but the point is that it doesn't really matter where those facts come out, because it's not the Court's job to figure out whether or not [the premium] was too much, too little, or just right.

Dr. Yumukoglu does not specify which of the fifteen provisions of this section he feels Provident has violated, and after a review of the statute, the Court cannot perceive which subsection could have been violated under the fact alleged. At the very least, Dr. Yumukoglu has failed to comply with the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2). Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a civil complaint set forth \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Here, it is not clear either what Dr. Yumukoglu is claiming or to what relief he is entitled under \u00a7 56A-16-20.

In other words, the plaintiffs argued that, although the filed rate doctrine precluded claims made against a state utility, it should not preclude claims against insurers, because New Mexico's Insurance Code seeks to promote competition among private actors in a regulated market; the Tenth Circuit rejected that argument, because the statutory scheme regulating the title insurance industry has not adopted the Insurance Code's policy goal to promote competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Given that the Tenth Circuit's analysis is focused on the Title Insurance Act and its differences from the Insurance Code in general, the Court concludes its holding in\n   <em>\n    Coll v.

The Court concludes, however, that New Mexico would not apply the filed rate doctrine in this case, because: (i) New Mexico has signaled an intent to allow such claims by creating a private right of action against insurers for UIPA misrepresentation claims; and (ii) the burden that the doctrine would impose on defrauded consumers is substantial compared to the doctrine's underwhelming benefits in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   As discussed above, New Mexico adopted the filed rate doctrine in the public utilities context to bar, most notably, claims that telephone rates are too high.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valdez v.

To apply the filed rate doctrine in this case, the Court would have to believe that New Mexico would expand the doctrine beyond heavily regulated public utilities to: (i) cover the automobile-insurance industry; (ii) bar consumer-protection claims; and (iii) bar claims that do not directly challenge approved rates. Nothing in the New Mexico courts' application of the filed rate doctrine or the New Mexico Legislature's enactments indicate that New Mexico law applies the filed rate doctrine so expansively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   One major factor counseling against the filed rate doctrine's application here is New Mexico Legislature's creation of a private right of action for consumers against that engage in misleading business practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M.

The Supreme Court of New Mexico explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   In the Mandatory Financial Responsibility Act, the Legislature determined that $25,000 insurance coverage for injury or death per accident is an adequate amount of coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 66-5-215(A)(1). Section 66-5-301(A) requires that same amount of coverage for UM coverage.

In other words, the Supreme Court of New Mexico determined that: (i) an uninsured motorist is any driver carrying less than the minimum $25,000.00 liability coverage, and (ii) an injured driver with UM/UIM coverage will collect only UIM benefits if both the UM/UIM coverage and the damages exceed $25,000.00. According to the Supreme Court of New Mexico, it is the UM, not the UIM, that compensates the injured driver for all damages up to $25,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   In so holding, the Court discounts the possibility that UIM benefits may pay out in the rare instances in which the insured carries only the minimum $25,000 UM/UIM coverage, such as if the tortfeasor carries the minimum liability coverage but must split that amount between multiple claimants. In light of this omission, the Court predicts that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would deem Financial Indemnity's UIM coverage illusory when its UM/UIM coverage is not greater than $25,000.00. Because the UIM coverage is illusory, the proposed class would not be\n   challenging the filed rates if they can separate the premiums paid for UM and UIM, and, therefore, the filed rate doctrine does not preclude the proposed class' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   In conclusion, the Court decides that, even if the filed rate doctrine applies to the plaintiffs' claims, the Supreme Court of New Mexico would conclude that: (i) the UIM coverage is illusory; and (ii) because the UIM coverage would be illusory, the plaintiffs may seek premium damages without challenging the filed rates-and, thus, ask the Court to determine a reasonable rate-because the illusory UIM coverage would be worth zero dollars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BHASKER'S CLAIMS ARE WELL-PLEADED EVEN IF THE UIM COVERAGE IS NOT ILLUSORY\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Financial Indemnity contends that Bhasker's claims fail as a matter of law, because her UIM coverage was not, as Bhasker asserts, illusory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 8-9. According to Financial Indemnity, the UIM coverage is not illusory, because there are a few scenarios over which the UIM coverage would provide coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 8. Financial Indemnity's arguments on this point are unavailing, because Bhasker need not prove that the UIM coverage is \"illusory\" to succeed on her claims. For starters, Bhasker's references to \"illusory\" coverage indicates that she uses the term loosely. In her Complaint, she alleges that Financial Indemnity sold her \"illusory\" UIM coverage. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 1, 46, 66, 68, at 1, 7, 13-14. She also alleges that the UIM coverage is illusory \"in part,\" Complaint \u00b6 67, at 14, and \"illusory in the event of a covered occurrence, as in this case, involving a minimally insured driver,\" Complaint \u00b6 32, at 5. Her inconsistent use of \"illusory\" is a good clue that her claims are not based on legal theories in which the coverage's \"illusory\" nature is an element necessary to prove.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, Bhasker seems to be arguing, generally, that her UM/UIM policy did not cover what she thought it would, in which case the UIM coverage was illusory in the sense that it appeared to be something it was not. According to her Complaint, she believes her policy's UIM component is worth nothing or close to nothing. Consequently, even if the Court agreed with Financial Indemnity that the policy's UIM coverage has some value, that designation would not foreclose Bhasker's claims that Financial Indemnity misled her about what the UM/UIM policy covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     THE VOLUNTARY PAYMENT DOCTRINE DOES NOT BAR THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS, BECAUSE THEY ALLEGE THEY DID NOT HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF MATERIAL FACTS, AND DO NOT SEEK RESTITUTION\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   New Mexico's voluntary payment doctrine bars plaintiffs from recovering payments made voluntarily and with full knowledge of the material facts, unless the plaintiff was the victim of fraud or under duress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rabbit Ear Cattle Co. v.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state-law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight, and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit-or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves-would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point-regardless whether it accurately reflects state law-at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-262\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination-the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants-if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion-have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-263\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. As such, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind developments in state law-developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-264\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court thinks the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding-what the state law was on the day the opinion was published-but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-265\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    . Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive-interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court thinks the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law-in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-266\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This may not be the most precise formulation if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court-the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, United States District Judge, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Laboratories v.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court-considerations that would never inform a federal court's analysis of federal law-may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-267\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time-forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous)-federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases-even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law-alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-268\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree. In\n    <em>\n     Wankier v.
