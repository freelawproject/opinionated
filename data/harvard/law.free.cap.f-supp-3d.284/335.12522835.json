(together, \"Navient\" or \"defendants\"), alleging that Navient improperly steered plaintiff and other student loan borrowers into forbearance to maximize their profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 4, 2017, non-parties Olga Demyanenko-Todd (\"Demyanenko-Todd\"), Kimberly Force (\"Force\"), and Melissa Miller (\"Miller,\" and collectively, \"proposed intervenors\") filed a motion to intervene and to dismiss, or, in the alternative, to stay or transfer this action pursuant to the first-to-file rule. For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies proposed intervenors' motion in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are taken from the complaint (ECF No. 1); the declaration of Geoffrey C. Jarvis (Jarvis Decl., ECF No. 13-2) and the supplemental declaration of Geoffrey C. Jarvis (Suppl. Jarvis Decl., ECF No. 38-1) filed in support of proposed intervenors' motion and the exhibits attached thereto; and the declarations of Andrew Wachtel (Wachtel Decl., Defs. Opp. Ex. A, ECF No. 33-1) and Jill Leonard (Leonard Decl., Defs. Opp. Ex. B, ECF No. 33-2) filed in support of defendants' opposition to proposed intervenors' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1. Student Loan Industry\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2010, with the enactment of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, the federal government shifted from backing private student loans to offering student loans directly to borrowers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 52.) Federal student loans, as compared to private student loans, have several benefits, including flexible repayment options. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 53.) Today, the majority of student loans are provided directly\n   by the federal government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although the federal government funds the student loans, it contracts with financial companies, such as Navient, to service them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Loan servicers advise borrowers about their repayment options and, at times, assess borrowers' financial situations to determine the best repayment plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two such repayment plans include income-driven repayment (\"IDR\") plans and forbearance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 61.) IDR plans are designed for borrowers experiencing long-term financial distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Under IDR plans, borrowers pay a percentage of their discretionary income instead of a high, fixed, monthly payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) In addition, IDR plans provide loan forgiveness after 20 to 25 years of monthly payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) Forbearance, on the other hand, is designed for student loan borrowers that are experiencing temporary financial hardship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Although forbearance allows borrowers to temporarily stop making student loan payments (and thereby avoid default), if continued over the long term, it can significantly increase the principal balance of student loans because loans in forbearance continue to accumulate unpaid interest, which is then added to the principal balance of the loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61, 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Lawsuits Against Navient\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Navient, incorporated in Delaware and with principal places of business in Delaware and Virginia, is the largest student loan servicer in the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, 70; Wachtel Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.) Navient services nearly $300 billion in student loans for more than 12 million borrowers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 70, 159.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Over the past year, there have been numerous lawsuits filed against Navient for, among other things, allegedly improperly steering borrowers towards forbearance instead of IDR plans for financial gain. The Court discusses the actions relevant to this motion below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   a. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 18, 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") filed a regulatory action against Navient and Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc. in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the \"CFPB action\"), alleging that Navient improperly steered borrowers into forbearance; failed to properly service loans in IDR plans; misrepresented borrowers about co-signer release requirements; and misreported information to consumer reporting agencies for certain loans. (CFPB Compl., Suppl. Jarvis Decl. Ex. D, ECF No. 38-2.) The CFPB action asserts claims under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The CFPB action is currently pending before Judge Robert D. Mariani. On August 4, 2018, Judge Mariani denied Navient's motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for a more definite statement. (Jarvis\n   Decl. Ex. C, ECF No. 13-5.) There are no class allegations in the CFPB action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   CFPB Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   b. Demyanenko-Todd Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 1, 2017, proposed intervenor Demyanenko-Todd brought a putative class action against Navient Corp., Navient Solutions, Inc., and Navient Solutions (collectively, the \"Navient entities\") in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the \"Demyanenko-Todd action\"), alleging that the Navient entities improperly steered borrowers into expensive forbearances. (Demyanenko-Todd Compl., Jarvis Decl. Ex. A, ECF No. 13-3.) The Demyanenko-Todd action initially asserted causes of action against the Navient entities for: (1) breach of the Master Promissory Note (the \"loan agreement\"), on behalf of a nationwide class; (2) breach of the Servicing Contract (the \"servicing agreement\"), on behalf of a nationwide class; (3) violations of the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act (\"DCFA\"), on behalf of a nationwide class; and (4) violations of New York General Business Law (\"NY GBL\"), on behalf of a New York subclass.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Demyanenko-Todd, a New York resident, filed her action in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania because Navient has a major call center in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the CFPB action was already pending in that district. (Jarvis Decl. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 21, 2017, Demyanenko-Todd filed her first amended complaint (\"FAC\"), adding Force, a California resident, and Miller, a Florida resident, as plaintiffs. (Demyanenko-Todd FAC, Jarvis Decl. Ex. B, ECF No. 13-4.) The FAC also added respective California and Florida state consumer protection claims, dropped the breach of the servicing agreement claim, and limited the scope of the class seeking damages under the DCFA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jarvis Decl. \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Demyanenko-Todd FAC.) The FAC asserts causes of action against the same Navient entities for: (1) breach of the loan agreement, on behalf of a nationwide class; (2) violations of the DCFA, on behalf of a Delaware subclass (consisting of residents of ten states); (3) violations of NY GBL, on behalf of a New York subclass (consisting of New York residents); (4) violations of California's consumer protection statutes, on behalf of a California subclass (consisting of California residents); and (5) violations of Florida's consumer protection statute, on behalf of a Florida subclass (consisting of Florida residents). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Demyanenko-Todd FAC.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Demyanenko-Todd action seeks certification of these classes and subclasses on behalf of borrowers whose federal student\n   loans were \"serviced by Navient and/or its predecessors between January 1, 2010 and the present, and who (i) were enrolled in forbearance for a period exceeding 3 months immediately prior to their enrollment in an [IDR] plan and/or (ii) were enrolled or are currently enrolled in consecutive forbearances that, in total, exceeded or exceed 12 months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Navient entities' motion to dismiss is currently pending before Judge Mariani in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   c. Travis Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 18, 2017, plaintiff, a New York resident, brought her putative class action against Navient in this Court (the \"Travis action\" or \"instant action\"), alleging that Navient improperly steered her and other loan borrowers into forbearance to maximize their profits. Plaintiff asserts the following causes of action against Navient: (1) violations of the DCFA, on behalf of a nationwide class; (2) breach of the servicing agreement, on behalf of a nationwide class and New York subclass; (3) violations of NY GBL, on behalf of a New York subclass; and (4) declaratory judgment, on behalf of a nationwide class and New York subclass. Travis seeks certification of these classes on behalf of \"direct student loan borrowers from the federal government ... who had at least one federal loan serviced by Navient and/or any of its predecessors between January 1, 2010 and the present who were placed in forbearance.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 118, 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although both the instant action and the Demyanenko-Todd action are premised on the same factual allegations initially asserted in the CFPB complaint-namely, that Navient improperly steered student loan borrowers into forbearance-they differ in two main respects. First, the actions assert different breach of contract theories. The Travis action alleges that Navient breached the servicing agreement, whereas the Demyanenko-Todd action alleges that the Navient entities breached the loan agreement. Second, the Travis action seeks to represent a broader putative class. Travis would not be a member of proposed intervenors' putative class in the Demyanenko-Todd action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this lawsuit on August 18, 2017. (ECF No. 1.) On October 4, 2017, proposed intervenors moved to intervene and to dismiss, or, in the alternative, to stay or transfer this action pursuant to the first-to-file rule. (ECF No. 13.) Plaintiff and defendants separately opposed the motion on October 25, 2017 (ECF Nos. 33, 34), and proposed intervenors submitted their reply brief on November 3, 2017 (ECF No. 38). The Court held oral argument on November 16, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42.) The Court has fully considered the parties' arguments and submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Proposed intervenors' motion is twofold. First, they move to intervene in this action as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) (\" Rule 24(a)\"), or, alternatively, they argue that permissive intervention is warranted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) (\" Rule 24(b)\"). In the event the Court grants their motion to intervene, proposed intervenors move to dismiss, stay, or transfer this action under the first-to-file rule, or, alternatively, they argue that the Court should transfer this action to U.S. District Court in the Middle of the Pennsylvania under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Plaintiff and defendants separately oppose proposed intervenors' motion in all respects. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A. Intervention as of Right\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In order to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a), the proposed intervenor\n   must show that \"(1) the application is timely; (2) the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject matter of the action; (3) the protection of the interest may as a practical matter be impaired by the disposition of the action; and (4) the interest is not adequately protected by an existing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Restor-A-Dent Dental Labs., Inc. v.

Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The movant's interest must be \"direct, substantial, and legally protectable\" in order to warrant intervention as of right.\n   <em>\n    Wash. Elec.

In response, plaintiff argues that proposed intervenors' purported interests are too hypothetical to satisfy the requirements of mandatory intervention. Defendants argue that proposed intervenors do not have a sufficient interest because (1) their breach of contract claim is not implicated in this action, and (2) even though both actions assert Delaware and New York state law claims, proposed intervenors do not share an interest with plaintiff because, before class certification, each action only involves individual claims asserted by individual plaintiffs. The Court agrees with plaintiff and defendants that proposed intervenors' stated interests are insufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 24(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, as defendants argue, this action does not implicate proposed intervenors' breach of contract claim. Whereas proposed intervenors claim in the Demyanenko-Todd action that the Navient entities breached the loan agreement, here, Travis claims that defendants breached the servicing agreement. Thus, proposed intervenors do not have an interest in protecting their rights or the rights of their putative class as to this claim, regardless of whether a class is ultimately certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although both actions assert the same Delaware and New York state law claims, the Court concludes that any interest in protecting the rights of proposed intervenors and their putative class is too speculative to warrant intervention as of right. At this point, no class has been certified in\n   the instant action or in the Demyanenko-Todd action. Accordingly, this action currently involves claims by Travis alone against the Navient defendants, and the Demyanenko-Todd action currently involves claims by proposed intervenors alone against the Navient entities. Thus, the rights of proposed intervenors and their putative class are simply not implicated at this time, and proposed intervenors' argument that they could be implicated if and when a class is certified is too hypothetical to meet the requirements of Rule 24(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mejia v.

Cal.

Assuming proposed intervenors' interest is premised on class certification, it is too speculative to warrant intervention as of right. Otherwise, as non-parties, proposed intervenors' stated interest in litigation efficiency is not affected by this action. In any event, the Court also does not find that this is the type of interest that warrants intervention under Rule 24(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worthington v. Bayer Healthcare LLC\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action Nos. 11-2793 ESCLW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206303999\">\n    2011 WL 6303999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D.N.J. Dec. 15, 2011) (finding movant's \"general and attenuated interest in ... 'minimizing waste[ ]' d[id] not rise to the standard of Rule 24(a)(2)\").

According to proposed intervenors, both this Court and the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania will have to decide essentially identical arguments as to what conduct violates these statutes, and, therefore, proposed intervenors have an interest in how these issues are resolved in this case. Although this is a closer question, the Court concludes that the fact that this Court could decide similar legal issues as the Demyanenko-Todd action does not create a \"legally protectable\" interest under Rule 24(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As an initial matter, this Court's decisions are not binding on the Demyanenko-Todd court, and the mere fact that they could be found persuasive is insufficient to warrant intervention as of right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Penn Cent. Commercial Paper Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703504\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/62/341/#p347\">\n    62 F.R.D. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347 (S.D.N.Y. 1974) (\"While it is true that a decision of one district court may be of some persuasive value in another, a holding that this constitutes an interest sufficient to justify intervention would expand the scope of Rule 24(a)(2) to such an extent that the interest requirement would essentially be read out of the rule.\"). Moreover, the factual differences between the Travis action, on the one hand, and the Demyanenko-Todd action, on the other, reduces any risk that a potential adverse decision as to Travis with respect to the state law claims in this action could be persuasive against proposed intervenors in the Demyanenko-Todd action. Indeed, proposed intervenors state in their reply brief that there are \"significant factual differences between [plaintiff's] position and that of the\n   <em>\n    Demyanenko-Todd\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs\" and assert that \"it is unclear that [plaintiff] was harmed by Navient's conduct.\" (ECF No. 38 at 10-11.) In addition, as noted\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541973\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/922/92/#p96\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , it is undisputed that Travis does not meet the factual requirements for proposed intervenors' putative class.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, proposed intervenors' assertion is also undermined by counsel for proposed intervenors' statement at oral argument that, had plaintiff not brought her suit as a putative class action, proposed intervenors would not be seeking to intervene. Accordingly, proposed intervenors' interests are again contingent on class certification and do not merit mandatory intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   2. Interest Impaired\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the Court determined that proposed intervenors have a sufficient interest in this action, the Court concludes that they have failed to establish that their interests would be impaired by its disposition. Proposed intervenors claim that, without intervention, their interests might be impaired by conflicting rulings in this action or a potential \"reverse auction\" settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff and defendants assert that proposed intervenors' rights would not be impaired because they are still able to litigate their claims in the Demyanenko-Todd action and, in the event the Court certifies a class that includes proposed intervenors and their putative class, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide sufficient protections absent intervention.

Proposed intervenors concede that plaintiff would not be included in their putative class and that they have no intention of bringing her individual claims. Thus, plaintiff's claims would not be part of the Demyanenko-Todd action.

Thus, in considering the equities, plaintiff would clearly be prejudiced were this Court to apply the first-filed rule in favor of the Demyanenko-Todd action. Indeed, were the Court to apply the first-filed rule and (i) dismiss this action, plaintiff's claims would be extinguished, without a forum in which they could be heard; (ii) stay this action, plaintiff's rights would be delayed until some future, unknown time; or (iii) transfer this action to Middle District of Pennsylvania, it is possible that this case would be returned here for lack of personal jurisdiction after inevitable delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Although proposed intervenors assert that that \"similarity of parties has been found where the actions share at least one common defendant and the putative class of the second action is similar to or at least partially subsumed within the putative class of the first-filed action\" (ECF No. 13-1 at 20-21), they fail to cite a case where the court applied the first-filed rule when the plaintiff in the second-filed action would not be included in the putative class of the first-filed action.

When deciding whether transfer would promote convenience and be in the interests of justice, district courts consider:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (1) the plaintiff's choice of forum, (2) the convenience of witnesses, (3) the location of relevant documents and relative ease of access to sources of proof, (4) the convenience of parties, (5) the locus of operative facts, (6) the availability of process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses, [and] (7) the relative means of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    D.H.

There is no strict formula for the application of these factors, and no single factor is determinative.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Indian Harbor Ins. Co. v. Factory Mut.

July 19, 2004). Instead, these factors should be applied and weighed in\n   the context of the individualized circumstances of the particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the parties dispute whether this action could have brought in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In any event, the Court need not, and does not, reach that issue, because the Court concludes, in its discretion, that transfer is not warranted at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   1. Plaintiff's Choice of Forum\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   It is well settled that the first factor-plaintiff's choice of forum-is \"given great weight.\"\n   <em>\n    D.H.

Here, plaintiff chose to file her action in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.

This factor thus weighs in favor of maintaining this action in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   2. Convenience of the Parties\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The convenience of the parties also weighs in favor of maintaining this action before this Court given that that plaintiff and defendants oppose transfer (and proposed intervenors remain non-parties).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   3. Location of Documents,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Witnesses, and Operative Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The second, third, and fifth factors likewise do not favor transfer. Proposed intervenors assert that key documents and witnesses will be located at Navient's Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania call center, and that the pending Demyanenko-Todd and CFPB actions further support that Pennsylvania is the locus of the operative facts. However, proposed intervenors did not submit an affidavit to this effect,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EasyWeb Innovations,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319612\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/888/342/#p347\">\n    888 F.Supp.2d at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Generally, the moving party submits an affidavit explaining why the transferee forum is more convenient, which includes 'the potential principal witnesses expected to be called and the substance of their testimony.' \" (citations omitted) ), and plaintiff and defendants assert that plaintiff has not alleged that she had contact with Navient's Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania call center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that New York and Delaware (plaintiff's residence and Navient Corp.'s headquarters, respectively) are likely to be the location of the operative facts, relevant documents, and witnesses, whereas defendants assert that Navient's activities in Delaware and Virginia (Navient Corp.'s and Navient Solutions' headquarters, respectively) are more relevant to plaintiff's steering allegations than Navient's activities at its Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania call center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the limited, conflicting information before the Court, the Court concludes that these factors are, at best, neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   4. Availability of Process to Compel the Attendance of Unwilling Witnesses and the Relative Means of the Parties\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As for the sixth and seventh factors, none of the parties argue that these factors support their position, and the Court also determines that they are neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   5. Other Factors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, proposed intervenors also claim that judicial economy and the interests of justice favor transfer because Judge Mariani is already presiding over the Demyanenko-Todd and CFPB actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, defendants assert that the CFPB action is fundamentally different from this action, and that the Demyanenko-Todd action is not so far along to warrant transfer. Although the Court recognizes these considerations, they do not outweigh plaintiff's choice of forum and the convenience of the parties at this time, especially given the uncertainty regarding whether plaintiff can maintain her action in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies proposed intervenors' motion in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Navient Solutions, Inc. is the former name for Navient Solutions, LLC (\"Navient Solutions\").

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5.) Navient Solutions and Navient Corp. are both Delaware entities. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5.) Navient Solutions' principal place of business is in Reston, Virginia, and Navient Corp.'s principal place of business is in Wilmington, Delaware. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In addition to its Reston, Virginia headquarters, Navient Solutions also has two offices in Delaware, two offices in Indiana, and one office in each of Washington, D.C., Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, and employs more than 3,000 individuals in total.

In addition, on October 5, 2017, the day after proposed intervenors filed their motion, the Pennsylvania Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Navient Corp. and Navient Solutions in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the \"Pennsylvania Attorney General action\"), seeking a permanent injunction and other relief for, among other things, Navient's alleged deceptive loan servicing practices.

Because the state court actions cannot be consolidated with the federal actions, plaintiff noted in her opposition brief that \"voluntary coordination is both possible and more reasonably calculated to reduce any inefficiencies that Proposed Intervenors purportedly seek to address.\" (ECF No. 34 at 18.) Counsel for plaintiff reiterated this point at oral argument, stating that, to the extent defendants or someone else identifies a gross inefficiency, the parties could voluntarily coordinate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Although proposed intervenors claim that these factual differences \"further demonstrate[ ] the potential issues with having the overall litigation in multiple fora, since Travis' [purported] weak factual position could lead to rulings that negatively impact the individuals in the putative\n    <em>\n     Demyanenko-Todd\n    </em>\n    class who[, according to proposed intervenors,] have-on their face-much stronger claims that they were harmed by Navient's misconduct\" (ECF No. 38 at 11 n.7), the Court disagrees. Instead, as set forth above, the Court determines that the differences between the two actions undercut proposed intervenors' interest in this action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Specifically, proposed intervenors' stated concern is that \"Navient will seek to use the existence of two largely identical class actions to try and settle the overall litigation by bidding the two groups of plaintiffs and lawyers against one another in order to achieve a minimal settlement.\" (ECF No. 38 at 9.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Specifically, plaintiff and defendants argue that (i) Pennsylvania does not have general jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims because Navient is neither incorporated nor headquartered in Pennsylvania and no exceptional circumstances warrant a finding of general jurisdiction over Navient in Pennsylvania, and (ii) the Middle District of Pennsylvania does not have specific jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims because plaintiff does not allege interaction with Navient's Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania call center in connection with her claims.
