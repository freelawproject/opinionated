This case concerns one facet of that right: detainees' right to adequate medical care, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process clause. Following an auto accident in which Plaintiff Aimee Davis broke her wrist, Philadelphia police arrested her and transported\n   her to the hospital. Plaintiff was discharged with instructions from Emergency Room personnel that she needed urgent attention from an orthopedic specialist. Plaintiff remained in custody for six weeks before she received the recommended care, and by the time surgery was ultimately performed, a malunion of the bones allegedly prevented a successful outcome. She contends that she is permanently disfigured as a result, and brings claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the City of Philadelphia, Riverside Correctional Facility's medical provider and medical staff, and several police officers. She also brings medical malpractice claims against Riverside's individual medical staffers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Motions to Dismiss by Defendants City of Philadelphia and Dr. Jonathan Cohen are pending. Because Plaintiff has pled facts sufficient to support an inference that the inadequate medical care she received amounted to punishment under the Fourteenth Amendment, and because such deprivation could potentially be attributed to the City under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   , I deny the City's Motion, except as to claims based on vicarious liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

I likewise deny Dr. Cohen's Motion because Plaintiff has stated claims against him for direct \u00a7 1983 liability and medical malpractice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's relevant factual allegations, separated from her legal conclusions and taken as true, are as follows. Plaintiff broke her wrist (a left distal radius fracture ) in a car accident on October 16, 2015. In connection with the accident, Philadelphia police arrested Plaintiff and took her to the hospital for emergency treatment. Hospital staff determined that her wrist bones were displaced and needed to be realigned, but their two attempts to align the bones were unsuccessful. The hospital informed Plaintiff and the arresting officers (in whose custody she remained) that the fracture was \"unstable\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in need of surgical repair, and that she needed to see an orthopedic specialist within two days. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 25-27. The next day, October 17th, the hospital released Plaintiff and gave her discharge documentation to the police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From the hospital, police transported Plaintiff to Riverside Correctional Facility, where medical staff, including Dr. Jonathan Cohen, conducted a medical intake screening as part of her initial processing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that the police officers did not relay her urgent need for specialist\n   care to Riverside staff or take any other action to ensure she received the specialist treatment they knew she needed for her injured wrist. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 32-34. Riverside's health intake process required Plaintiff to complete an Intake Screening Questionnaire [hereinafter the \"Intake Form\"] that asked whether she had any \"life threatening medical problems\" but did not ask if she had a serious (but not life-threatening) medical need or if she had been prescribed any medical treatment, or request a description of her current conditions. FAC \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From the time of her arrival at Riverside on October 17th to her transfer to another correctional facility (SCI Muncy) on October 22nd, Plaintiff complained to Dr. Cohen and other Riverside medical staff of her \"significant and unbearable pain and swelling\" and repeatedly asked to see a specialist for her fracture, as the hospital had instructed. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 67-68. Plaintiff received over-the-counter pain medication (\"Motrin, only\"), but was not allowed to see a specialist. FAC \u00b6 68. On October 21st-Plaintiff's fifth day at Riverside and one day before her transfer to SCI Muncy-Dr. Cohen noted in a progress report that Plaintiff had been told to consult an orthopedic surgeon and, in the \"treatment\" section of the report, he wrote \"refer to temple orthopedics.\" The next day, sometime after the decision to transfer Plaintiff to SCI Muncy but before her actual transfer, Dr. Cohen \"ordered an x-ray\" of her wrist. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. But neither the x-ray nor the Temple Orthopedics referral happened, and Plaintiff was transferred to SCI Muncy later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Cohen completed a summary \"in connection with\" Plaintiff's transfer to SCI Muncy [hereinafter the \"Transfer Summary\"]. FAC \u00b6 47. Like the Intake Form, the Transfer Summary did not include questions about whether Plaintiff had serious medical needs or had been prescribed medical treatment that she had not yet received.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p691\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Transfer Summary asked whether Plaintiff had any recent hospitalizations and if there were any consults pending, but in response to both questions, Dr. Cohen (or another Riverside medical staffer) incorrectly answered \"no.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. Riverside medical staff wrote \"lower bunk &amp; tier left arm fx\" in the comments section, presumably identifying Plaintiff's fracture and that she should be assigned a bottom bunk at her destination facility. FAC \u00b6 51. Nowhere did Dr. Cohen indicate that Plaintiff's fracture was unstable, awaiting surgery, or that Plaintiff was \"already days overdue\" to be seen by a specialist and have surgery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p691\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Cohen and the medical staffers did not send Plaintiff's medical records-either from Riverside or the hospital-on to SCI Muncy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Plaintiff's transfer to SCI Muncy with nothing in her transfer records to indicate her urgent need for specialist care, she continued to complain of severe pain and swelling and to request the surgery she needed. It was not until November 24th that Plaintiff was finally allowed to see a surgeon-nearly six weeks after her discharge from the hospital. The specialist recommended surgery, which Plaintiff underwent six days later. By then, her wrist had begun to heal in an in improper position, which \"complicat[ed] the surgery and worsen[ed] her recovery.\" FAC \u00b6 73. Plaintiff then underwent a second surgery and received continuing orthopedic supervision and physical therapy. Plaintiff is now left with \"serious and permanent damage to her left wrist,\" including pain, swelling, and loss of strength and motion as a result of being denied treatment while at Riverside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiff's Claims and Defendants' Motions to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on these factual allegations, Plaintiff now brings\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims against the City of Philadelphia under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   , direct \u00a7 1983 claims against Dr. Cohen and all other individual defendants, and state law medical malpractice claims against Dr. Cohen and the other medical professional defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although Plaintiff's new Complaint includes detailed factual allegations sufficient to put Defendants on notice as to her claims, the organization of her Counts is confounding. Plaintiff's Count I is titled \"Deliberate Indifference to Plaintiffs' [sic] Fourteenth Amendment Rights\" and purports to apply to all defendants. Count II is titled \"Monell Claim\" and names the City and Riverside's medical provider. However, Plaintiff attributes conduct to the City in the form of a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim (through \"policy, practice, or custom\" allegations) throughout Counts I and II. I therefore construe all of Plaintiff's \"policy, practice, or custom\" allegations against the City as the collective basis for her\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, regardless of their location in her Complaint (whether under Count I or II). To the extent that Plaintiff's Count I attempts (again) to hold the City vicariously liable for the actions of the individual police officers or Riverside's medical staff, it is dismissed as to the City with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Beyond that, Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that the City violated her Fourteenth Amendment rights in the following ways:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The City has a \"practice, policy, or custom\" under which police officers who transport people with serious medical problems to detention facilities are not required or trained to relay pertinent medical information to medical staff at the receiving facility. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 31, 110.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 The City has a \"policy, practice, and custom\" of allowing its prison medical provider to use a medical Intake Screening Questionnaire that is \"insufficient on its face\" in that it fails to ask if the person has a serious (non-life-threatening) medical need, whether she has been prescribed any\n   medical treatment she has not yet received, and for a description of her medical conditions. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 104.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 The City has likewise \"deliberately chosen\" to use a Transfer Summary in its prisons that fails to ask \"whether the prisoner has a serious medical need\" or \"whether the prison has been prescribed medical treatment that she has not yet received.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   FAC \u00b6 48. This choice, Plaintiff argues, \"minimizes [reporting of] serious medical conditions to receiving institutions at the time of transfers by omitting relevant information,\" FAC \u00b6 105, and amounts to a \"practice, policy, or custom\" of providing \"such little medical information\" about an inmate who is being transferred that the receiving facility must \"rely solely on its own intake assessment.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 58, 61.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The City made each of these decisions, Plaintiff alleges, \"to avoid the burden and necessary expenses\" of providing health care to detainees with serious medical problems. That is, Plaintiff claims the City has decided not to ask about or document detainees' reports of serious, non-life-threatening medical problems in order to avoid the inevitable expense of treatment \"if those questions are answered affirmatively\"-as they would have been here. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 48, 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As to Dr. Cohen, Plaintiff alleges that he violated her Fourteenth Amendment rights\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   when he:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Failed to have her seen by a specialist while she was at Riverside, FAC \u00b6 53;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Failed to order an x-ray until after she was set to be transferred to SCI Muncy, FAC \u00b6 54;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Ignored her \"continuous complaints\" of pain, swelling, and need for specialist treatment and surgery, FAC \u00b6\u00b6 87-88, 91, and, to the extent that Dr. Cohen took any action to address her serious medical needs, he delayed in so doing,\" FAC \u00b6 91, thereby causing her needless suffering and \"a significantly worse recovery,\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 89-90;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Provided false, misleading, or incomplete medical information to SCI Muncy, FAC \u00b6 53, including by failing to notify SCI Muncy that Plaintiff had recently been hospitalized, FAC \u00b6 55, or that \"a consult with an orthopedic surgeon was pending,\" FAC \u00b6 56.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Cohen, like the City, did so in order to avoid the costs and burdens of sending Plaintiff from Riverside to a specialist and getting her surgical treatment while she was at Riverside. FAC \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants City of Philadelphia and Dr. Cohen now move separately under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss Plaintiff's claims against them. The City, moving only on its own behalf (not for its individual employees) argues that Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim must fail because Plaintiff pleads \"no facts\" supporting municipal liability under \u00a7 1983, including how or when the policies or customs were implemented or which municipal policymaker(s) were responsible for them. Def. City's Mot. Dismiss 6-8, ECF No. 18 [hereinafter \"City's MTD\"]. The City also argues that Plaintiff's failure-to-train theory must fail because she does not describe \"a single instance of prior misconduct\" by police or correctional officers and does not \"specifically plead how the [City's] training programs ... are inadequate.\" City's MTD 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In Dr. Cohen's Motion, he mistakenly treats Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment constitutional claim against him as an Eighth Amendment claim, and argues that she has pled no facts showing that he was deliberately indifferent to her medical needs. Def. Cohen's Mot. Dismiss 3, ECF No. 7 [hereinafter \"Cohen's MTD\"]. He asserts that he \"exercised his professional judgment\" and \"treated Plaintiff by ordering an x-ray and referring her for an orthopedic evaluation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without directly addressing Plaintiff's claim that he unduly delayed her treatment, Dr. Cohen notes that \"there is no allegation that [he] had the ability to do any more than make the referral and order the x-ray\" when Plaintiff was at Riverside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 4 n.2. In his opposition to Plaintiff's medical malpractice claim against him, Dr. Cohen argues that Plaintiff has not alleged that he breached the standard of care.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He claims that Plaintiff's allegations-that he failed to treat her or order surgery \"in a timely manner\" and failed to properly respond to her complaints of pain and for appropriate care-are \"directly contradicted\" by Plaintiff's allegations that Dr. Cohen \"told her to see an orthopedic surgeon\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and referred her to Temple Orthopedics.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referencing FAC \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Returning to the two-step test from\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   , I must determine whether Dr. Cohen's conduct, as alleged by Plaintiff, served a \"legitimate purpose\" and, if so, whether his conduct was \"rationally related\" to that purpose, or whether the conduct was \"excessive\" in relation to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1547088\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/150/\">\n    399 F.3d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted above, Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Cohen limited her access to medical care for the \"non-medical reason\" of cost avoidance.

Plaintiff further alleges that, upon her transfer to SCI Muncy, Dr. Cohen further delayed her care when he omitted crucial information from her Transfer Summary that would have indicated to the receiving facility her urgent need for treatment.

Perhaps most importantly, it ignores the reality of prison, where a doctor's recommendation to a detainee that she see a specialist has no effect, since detainees are unable to coordinate their own care and are, as a matter of law, completely reliant on their prison doctors to arrange for it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Estelle v.
