Curiel, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   These three consolidated cases involve challenges to Waiver Determinations made by former Secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security on August 2, 2017 and September 12, 2017 pursuant to section 102 of IIRIRA\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   waiving the legal requirements of NEPA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the ESA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the CZMA\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and more than 30 additional laws not at issue in these cases. The Waiver Determinations concern two types of border wall construction projects in San Diego County: (1) the \"border wall prototype project\"; and (2) the replacement of fifteen miles of existing border fence in the San Diego Sector and three miles of existing border fence in the El Centro Sector (\"border fence replacement projects\"). The Plaintiffs allege variously that (1) the Waivers are ultra vires acts that exceed the authority delegated by Congress; and (2) the Waivers are unconstitutional acts under a variety of legal doctrines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Court is aware that the subject of these lawsuits, border barriers, is currently the subject of heated political debate in and between the United States and the Republic of Mexico as to the need, efficacy and the source of funding for such barriers. In its review of this case, the Court cannot and does not consider whether underlying decisions to construct the border barriers are politically wise or prudent. As fellow Indiana native Chief Justice Roberts observed in addressing a case surrounded by political disagreement: \"Court[s] are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are entrusted to our Nation's elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v.

Eight prototype walls have already been constructed demonstrating that the injury is actual and the El Centro Sector border fence replacement project, which is currently undergoing consultation and may have already begun construction, is also imminent.

The Waiver Determinations will preclude the enforcement of California's laws which will affect its sovereign interests. Defendants object because Plaintiffs merely string cite to eight state code or regulations without explaining how these provisions apply to the projects at issue. But, as noted by Plaintiff, the Waiver Determinations do not identify which California law or regulation Defendants are waiving and as an example it provides some provisions where the waiver would bar California's enforcement of its laws as to DHS, its contractors, or to the State's permitting authority or other legal actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It is not disputed that the Waiver Determinations waive all legal requirements and include related state laws.

They explain that section 102 explicitly expresses Congress' intent to bar the district court from exercising jurisdiction over any claims arising from the Secretary of DHS's waiver determination except for a constitutional violation. Plaintiffs argue that the Court may consider whether the Waivers exercised by the Secretaries constitute ultra vires acts as they exceed the authority granted to the Secretaries under section 102; therefore, they contend section 102(c)(2)'s judicial review bar on non-constitutional claims does not apply. For\n   the reasons stated below, the Court finds that it may consider whether the Secretaries have violated any clear and mandatory statutory obligations set forth in section 102. Finding that there are no such violations, the Court upholds the jurisdictional bar and concludes that it does not have the jurisdiction to hear any claims other than constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Section 102(c)(2)(A) provides that the \"district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1) [the waiver provision].

Instead, all Plaintiffs argue that the August 2, 2017 and September 12, 2017 Waiver Determinations constitute ultra vires acts of the Secretary that do not fall under section 102 because the Waivers are not authorized by sections 102(a) or (b) and were not decisions made \"pursuant to\" section 102(c)(1). Therefore, according to Plaintiffs, section 102(c)(2) does not apply, and the Waiver Determinations are subject to review by the Court. Defendants respond that Plaintiffs cannot bypass the jurisdictional bar by framing their claims as ultra vires challenges when judicial review is expressly prohibited.

This includes actions under any part of section 102 that meet section 102(c)(1)'s criteria. In support, they cite to the Guide to Legislative Drafting which explains that section 102(a) is a \"subsection\"; section 102(b)(1) is a \"paragraph\" and section 102(b)(1)(A) is a \"sub-paragraph.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   House Office of the Legislative Counsel, Guide to Legislative Drafting.

They argue that Defendants' position produces an absurd result\n   in interpreting sections 102(b)(2)-(4). These sections address the procedures for obtaining easements and appropriations, and refer to and apply only to \"this subsection\" which is section 102(b). According to Defendants' interpretation, the procedures and directives regarding easements and appropriations would not apply to section 102(a) border projects and without those provisions, a border barrier could not be built. Moreover, the terms \"section\" and \"subsection\" are used inconsistently as section 102(b)(1)(A) uses the phrase \"[i]n carrying out subsection (a)\" while section 102(b)(1)(B) &amp; (C) uses the phrase \"[i]n carrying out this section\" under section 102(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendants reply that \"when Congress identifies certain specific applications of a general grant of authority, those specific requirements cannot generally be understood to prohibit all other applications of the general authority.\" (Dkt.

Third, the subsequent amendments demonstrate that section 102(b)(1) merely identified Congress' shifting priorities and specific areas for action. Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot overcome the plain meaning of the statute by pointing out that Congress, in passing section 102 in 1996 and the amendment to section 102(c) in 2005, was primarily focused on portions of fencing near San Diego. Congress could have limited the provision to construction near San Diego; instead, it established a broad general mandate in section 102(a) that is not geographically limited and used the words \"under this section\" to extend section 102(c) to the entire section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Certainly, section 102 is not a model of legislative precision. Given the inconsistencies in the use of \"this section\", the Court looks to the legislative history for further guidance. The parties rely on the legislative history that supports their respective positions. Defendants cite to Conference Report 109-72 to support their interpretation because the Report broadly states it \"provides for construction and strengthening of barriers along U.S. land borders.\" (Dkt. No. 18-2, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 2, H.R. Rep. 109-72 at p. 170 (May 3, 2005).

Coalition Plaintiffs and California Plaintiffs argue that section 102 only allows for the installation of \"additional\" barriers and roads and does not authorize the replacement of existing fences. Plaintiffs cite to the dictionary that defines \"additional\" as \"more\", \"extra\" and \"added\" while \"replacement\" is defined as resulting in no net gain or addition and because the new barrier is a substitute or successor to the fence, it is replacing, not adding. Moreover, they argue that the construction of additional barriers through various amendments since 1996 focused solely on adding mileage to the existing fencing such as adding fencing where none existed or adding new layers of fencing to supplement the existing primary fence. Section 102 does not address on-going maintenance or replacement of existing barriers. They contend that none of the prior waivers were initiated for the purpose of replacing, repairing, or enhancing existing barriers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In response, the government argues Plaintiffs' narrow interpretation of \"additional\" is not supported by the statutory language nor the legislative history. According to Defendants, the installation of \"lighting, cameras and sensors\",\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A), falls under \"additional barriers and roads\" under section 102(a) which indicate a broader definition of \"additional.\" Defendants also cite the legislative history of the 2005 REAL ID Act where representatives described section 102 as providing for \"construction and strengthening of barriers along U.S. land borders\" suggesting a broad definition of \"additional.\" (Dkt. No. 18-2, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 2, H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 170 (May 3, 2005).) In 2006, Senator Kyl discussed section 102 and explained the project as \"replacing the so-called landing mat fencing, which does look like a wall, with chain link-type fencing that you can see through.\" (Dkt. No. 18-2, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 9, 152 Cong. Rec. S9871 (Sept. 21, 2006).) He explained that the current fencing is deteriorating and difficult to repair because of its age. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, DHS has used section 102 to replace fencing in 2011 in Arizona, the Nogales Fence Replacement Project, and invoked section 102(c)'s waiver authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 42-2, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 23.) The authority for the project was derived from sections 102(a) and 102(b)(1)(A). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The Nogales Fence Replacement Project was to remove and replace about 2.8 miles of existing primary fence along the United States/Mexico international border, the repair and maintenance of a 20 foot wide construction road parallel to the fence and replacement of a 20-foot-wide gate at a port of entry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The legislative history and the prior projects invoking section 102(c) for the replacement of border fences support the position that building \"additional barriers\" has a broad meaning and can include replacement of fencing. To the extent that this interpretation is plausible, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated the replacement fence clearly falls outside the scope of \"additional physical barriers\" to show that the Secretary violated a \"clear and mandatory\" statutory provision.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Staacke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11295918\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/278/#p281\">\n    841 F.2d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that both parties' construction of \"in addition\" were plausible where one party asserted it meant \"concurrent with\" and the other party maintained it meant \"subsequent to\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. \"areas of high illegal entry\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Waiver Determinations' conclusions that the San Diego and El Centro sectors are \"areas of high illegal entry,\" are improperly based on sector-wide data which are not good indications of whether the Project Areas are areas of high illegal entry. Moreover, sector wide data are not reliable because the amount of drugs seized in a sector usually occur far from the Mexican border at highway checkpoints, during vehicle searches at the points of entry or when border patrol agents discover a drug-smuggling boat or drone. Sector wide data do not demonstrate that the project areas themselves are areas of high illegal entry and the data are less probative when the facts show that the San Diego Project Area has fewer illegal border crossings than the San Diego Sector as a whole. However, even if the Court were to consider sector-wide data, Plaintiffs argue DHS's apprehension records show that these two sectors are no longer areas of high illegal entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Defendants argue that Congress has set no specific threshold for \"high illegal entry\" but Congress has expressly stated that one of the statute's purposes is \"to achieve and maintain operational control\n   over the international border.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(D). \"Operational control\" \"means the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.\" Pub.

Moreover, they note that the number of apprehensions had fallen from more than 480,000 to less than 150,000 by 2006. But when Congress amended section 102 in 2006 and 2008, it did not suggest there was no longer \"high illegal entry\" along the border. Lastly, Congress frequently refers to sector-wide data when discussing the needs for such projects; therefore the use of sector-wide data is not misplaced. (Dkt.

No. 30-5, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 9 at 45.) Moreover, in a television interview, Secretary of DHS Kelly stated that the existing fencing is \"very, very effective\" and \"remarkably effective in keeping down the amount of illegal movements across\" the border. California Plaintiffs argue that most of California's 140 miles border already has fencing including the Project Areas covered by the Waivers. (Dkt.

(Dkt. No. 49-4, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31, Enriquez Decl. \u00b6 11.) The prototype project area is located on Federal government property and used as an enforcement zone for border security purposes and is heavily disturbed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) CBP did not meet with USDA, the State of California, local government or Indian Tribes as it determined they were not stakeholders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, CBP met with one adjacent landowner and in response to the landowner's concerns, installed temporary fencing to prevent unauthorized construction access across the landowner's property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Prior to the San Diego Waiver, on July 13, 2017, CBP met with U.S. Department of Interior, (\"DOI\"), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, (\"USFWS\"), and Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\")'s staff, toured the project area and discussed potential environmental impacts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Before the waiver, CBP also met with General Service Administration (\"GSA\") to discuss potential environmental impacts and routing of construction traffic as it manages an access road in the project area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) CBP also conducted a field survey concerning natural and biological resources and the results are summarized in a final Biological Resources Survey Report dated October 2017. (Dkt. No. 49-5, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31.A, Enriquez Decl., Ex. A.) It also conducted a field survey and records search to identify any cultural and historical resources in the project area and the results are summarized in a final Cultural Resources Survey Report dated October 2017. (Dkt. No. 49-6, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31.B, Enriquez Decl., Ex. B.) After the surveys were completed, CBP conducted additional consultation with DOI. (Dkt. No. 49-4, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31, Enriquez Decl. \u00b6 19.) In September 2017, CBP sent USFWS the results of the biological survey and asked for input from USFWS concerning potential impacts from the project but no response was provided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on the resource surveys, CBP prepared a Memorandum for the Record (\"MFR\") dated September 25, 2017 analyzing the potential environmental impacts.

The Memorandum concluded that the prototype project would have no impact on cultural or historic resources and would not have a significant impact on any endangered species as there are no threatened\n   and endangered species in the project area, and no vernal pools, wetlands, or other surface water located within the project area. (Dkt. No. 49-4, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31, Enriquez Decl. \u00b6 22.) Further, CBP mandated its contractors to follow certain Best Management Practices (\"BMPs\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) CBP made adjustments to the prototype project based on the results of the resource surveys and consultation with stakeholders.

No. 49-11, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31.G, Enriquez Decl., Ex. G.) After the surveys were completed, CBP conducted additional outreach and sent consultation letters, on January 18 and 19, 2018, to USFWS, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, CASHPO, two Native American tribes, the Colorado River Basin Regional Water Quality Control Board (\"CRBRWQCB\"), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Regulatory Division (\"USACE\"), the Imperial Irrigation District (\"IID\"), Imperial County Air Pollution Control District, and the City of Calexico.

To date, CBP received responses from three entities, IID, CRBRWQCB, and USACE. (Dkt. No. 49-13, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31.R-T, Enriquez Decl., Exs. R-T.) The CBP concluded that the USDA and private property owners were not stakeholders in the Calexico replacement fence project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on this information, CBP prepared the Calexico MFR. (Dkt. No. 49-8, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31.D, Enriquez Decl., Ex.

On July 13, 2017, prior to the Waiver, CBP conducted an on-site meeting with DOI, USFWS and BLM officials to discuss the project, and USFWS provided CPB with data and information concerning vernal pools and areas occupied by burrowing owls and the possible presence of habitat for the quino checkerspot butterfly and the California gnatcatcher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   CBP has conducted resource surveys, including biological, cultural and wetlands within the project area and is currently preparing these reports. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Based on these surveys, CBP has made adjustments to the San Diego fence replacement project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) For example, CBP identified two historic sites that will be avoided during construction and is planning on\n   plant and topsoil salvage and making arrangements to have full time environmental and historic/cultural monitors on-site during construction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Prior to the start of construction, CBP will send out letters to stakeholders including Federal, State, and local agencies and Native Americans in the Spring of 2018 to solicit more information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Once that is completed, it will prepare an Environmental Stewardship Plan (\"ESP\") for public review which will include its assessment of potential impacts, BMP's, and if necessary, mitigation or conservation measures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because of the project's location, CBP determined that the USDA and private property owners \"are not likely to be stakeholders for this project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Consistent with Defendants' prior argument that \"carrying out this section\" applies to section 102 as a whole, the Court concludes that the consultation provision applies to any border construction project under section 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   As to the prototype project, it appears that the consultation requirement was met. Prior to the Waiver Determinations, CBP met with representatives of the DOI, including USFWS and BLM, as well as GSA, as these are agencies that would be affected by the project. (Dkt. No. 49-4, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31, Enriquez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17.) They also met with one landowner but it is not clear when that occurred; however, CBP responded by installing temporary fencing due to the landowner's concern. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Defendants did not believe that any other agencies would be affected by the prototype project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Next, as to the Calexico replacement fence which may have begun construction on February 15, 2018, the CBP met with representatives of DOI, including USFWS and BLM, as well as the CASHPO and Native American tribes before the Waiver Determination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 39.) But it did not consult with the City of Calexico prior to the Waiver Determination. Instead, it sent a consultation letter on January 19, 2018 with a requested response date by February 2, 2018. (Dkt. No. 49-12, Ds' Index of Exs., Ex. 31.O, Enriquez Decl., Ex. O at 15.) It also sent consultation letters to nine additional identified stakeholders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. H-Q.) To date, only three entities responded with one entity seeking additional time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. R-T.) While the consultation letters were sent less than a month before construction is to begin, it is not clear that the consultation provision was violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   As to the San Diego replacement project, so far, CBP had a meeting with representatives of DOI, USFWS and BLM, prior to the Waiver Determination and subsequently conducted surveys but has not yet consulted with other stakeholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the consultation should occur prior to any waiver determinations as that information is critical in determining whether to waive certain laws. In contrast, Defendants argue the consultation provision does not expressly specify the subject matter for consultation, when the consultation should happen, or the degree of consultation required. Its purpose is to minimize the impact of construction once a project has been selected. They also assert Congress intended the consultation provision to be enforced through its appropriations power but then note that for the appropriations for the projects at issue, Pub. L. No. 115-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Stat.%20135\">\n    131 Stat. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434 (May 5, 2017), Congress did not require consultation. They further claim that the saving clause precludes a private right of action concerning the consultation requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument that the consultation should occur prior to any waiver determinations so that the Secretary is fully informed when the determination is made is logical. In addition, it makes sense that\n   consultation should occur before contracts are drafted and executed so that the information can have a practical influence on the decision making process and to permit environmental and mitigation measures to be incorporated into the contract. The question is whether such timing is mandatory. Section 102 does not provide any specific limitation or guidance concerning when or how consultation is to occur except expressly stating who shall be consulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Consultation on the Calexico replacement wall is on-going and responses may be forthcoming despite the fact that construction on the project may have already begun. In the Court's opinion, the belated contact with stakeholders reduces the practical benefit of the consultation process. But given the lack of a \"clear and mandatory\" mandate regarding the timing of consultation, the Court cannot conclude that the Secretaries acted in excess of their delegated powers by approving the waivers or executing construction contracts prior to completing the consultation process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    vi. \"necessary to ensure expeditious construction\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Section 102(c) provides that the Secretary of the DHS \"shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements\" that the Secretary, in his or her \"sole discretion\" determines \"necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). This mandatory language gives the Secretary of the DHS discretion to make this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Coalition Plaintiffs argue that section 102(c)'s waiver is subject to the Secretary's determination that it is \"necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section\",\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), but the government has failed to provide any information or bases to support the conclusion that these waivers are necessary. Meanwhile, Center Plaintiff contends that section 102(c)'s requirement that waivers be \"necessary to ensure expeditious construction\" demonstrates that Congress intended to limit the scope of the section 102(c) waiver to specific border barriers under section 102(b). They contend that a logical interpretation of \"expeditious construction\" is that Congress provided the DHS Secretary with the authority to waive laws in order to build the specific border barriers required under section 102(b) as soon as possible after the law's enactment and not to the wall replacement project or the prototype project started a decade later. Also, the text of the statute indicates that the waiver authority was intended to apply only for specific projects mandated by section 102(b) which have long been completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Here, the words used by Plaintiffs in their argument such as \"logical interpretation\" \"intended\" and \"[i[t is far more reasonable to limit the 102(c) waiver authority to those barriers that have been specifically mandated by Congress under \u00a7 102(b) than to adopt the government's boundless interpretation\", (Dkt. No. 28-1 at 39), demonstrate that a determination that a waiver is \"necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads\" is one of statutory interpretation. The Court cannot conclude that the Waiver Determinations are in contravention of clear and mandatory language in section 102(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Staacke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11295918\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/278/#p281\">\n    841 F.2d at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (where the statute is subject to two plausible interpretations, the Secretary of Labor's interpretation cannot constitute a \"violation of a clear mandatory mandate\" and noting that the Secretary's statutory discretion to make policy choices with disability decisions is \"virtually limitless\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Whether Section 102(c)'s Waiver Authority has Expired\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Center Plaintiff argues that there is no evidence in the text or the legislative\n   history that Congress intended the waiver authority to exist in perpetuity or even that Congress intended the waiver authority to be extended beyond the initial San Diego fence. They argue that expeditious construction refers solely to section 102(b) projects as there are time constraints limiting DHS's authority to determine \"other mileage\" to expire on December 31, 2008. California Plaintiffs similarly argue that the 2008 amendment imposed deadlines for the expedited construction of fencing in priority areas. In 2008, former Secretary of DHS Chertoff identified more than 370 miles of priority areas and by April 2013, DHS reported it had completed all but a one-mile stretch of these projects which involved 705 miles of fencing. (Dkt. No. 30-4, Cayaban Decl, Ex. 5;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11295918\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/278/#p281\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11295918\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/278/#p281\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' argument that the December 31, 2008 deadline in section 102(b)(1)(B) applies generally to section 102(c) or section 102 as a whole is implausible. Nothing in the statute demonstrates that Congress intended the waiver authority to sunset and that expeditious construction is limited to section 102(b). When Congress amended section 102(b) in December 2007, it mandated that about half of the \"not less than 700 miles\" be completed within a year, by December 31, 2008. Because Congress did not provide a deadline for the remaining miles, they argue that there is no expiration date on building additional fencing. Moreover, they assert that the section 102(c) waivers would be applicable to the remaining miles to be built.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In 2008, Congress amended section 102(b) requiring DHS to construct reinforced fencing \"along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effect.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). As to priority areas, section 102(b) mandated that the DHS Secretary \"identify 370 miles, or other mileage determined by the Secretary\" and the authority to determine \"other mileage\" would expire on December 31, 2008 and Congress imposed a deadline of December 31, 2008 to complete construction of the fencing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1103(b)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Az. Oct. 21, 2011), the district court addressed section 102(b)(1)(A)'s mandate directing the Secretary to construct 700 miles of fencing. In that decision, the district court stated that there are no deadlines requiring completion of the fencing and infrastructure projects by a specific time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.

The parties' varying plausible interpretations concerning the scope of section 102(c) demonstrate that the statutory language is not clear and unambiguous and the parties' argument is essentially a dispute regarding statutory interpretation. As such, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the Secretaries violated a clear and mandatory statutory provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Whether Section 102 Requires that the Waiver Determinations Include Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   California Plaintiffs assert that the Waivers are invalid because the Secretaries failed to make the requisite findings to demonstrate the requirements of section 102 and only used boiler plate language copied from section 102 without providing reasons behind each Waiver Determination. (Dkt. No. 30-2 at 34-35.)

These cases involve agency determinations that were found to be arbitrary and capricious under the APA where an agency failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision.

In this case, the APA's standard of review and requirement for findings concerning an agency's decision are inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Section 102 only requires that the Secretary's decision be \"published in the Federal Register.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

Instead, California Plaintiffs generally assert that the absence of district court jurisdiction will deprive them of adequate means to vindicate their statutory rights. (Dkt. No. 30-2 at 24.) Assuming for argument's sake that Plaintiffs satisfied the second prong, they have failed to establish the first prong. That is, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not established a plain violation of an unambiguous and mandatory provision of section 102, and, therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear non-constitutional claims under section 102(c)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Whether the Secretaries' Decisions under Sections 102(a) &amp; (b) are Subject to APA Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In order to invoke judicial review under the APA, Coalition Plaintiffs present an alternative argument starting with a strong presumption of judicial review of agency action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argue that the judicial review limiting provision of section 102(c) is distinct from sections 102(a) &amp; (b) because the Secretary must comply with the requirements of sections 102(a) and (b) prior to invoking the waiver provision. Therefore, because sections 102(a) and (b) are separate determinations from section\n   102(c), and the waivers constitute final agency decisions reviewable by a district court, the Secretaries' decisions on the two projects are subject to APA review and under the APA, the two Waivers are \"arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Specifically, Coalition Plaintiffs contend that the language \"notwithstanding any other provision of law\" which is contained in section 102(c)(1) \"demonstrates an intent to limit the waiver authority solely to laws other than the one in which the waiver is contained, meaning the requirements of the section itself are not waivable.\" (Dkt. No. 29-1 at 13.) Accordingly, the requirement of \"high illegal entry\" and the \"consultation\" requirements of sections 102(a) and (b) must be satisfied before the Secretary can invoke section 102(c)'s waiver authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Defendants counter that the section 102(c) waiver determination arises from \"any action undertaken\" pursuant to section 102(c)(1) and cannot be separated from sections 102(a) or (b). They contend that Plaintiffs improperly seek to challenge findings that are integral to the waiver determination itself. Even if the phrase \"pursuant to paragraph (1)\" in section 102(c)(2)(A), refers to the waiver determination in isolation, the terms \"any action undertaken ... pursuant to paragraph (1)\" and \"all clauses or claims arising from\" such actions or decision, broadens the judicial review provision to include more than just the waiver determination, itself. Next, they contend that Plaintiffs' reading that provides sections 102(a) and (b) are subject to APA review would frustrate Congress' purpose in enacting the jurisdictional limitation and waiver provisions which were intended to prevent litigation delays since any invocation of the waiver would be subject to APA review to determine whether the waiver was justified in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   In reply, Coalition Plaintiffs argue that the Secretaries' decisions under section 102(c)(1) to waive any laws as \"necessary to ensure expeditious construction\" do not address whether there is authority to construct the border projects themselves. The authority to construct the border projects are in sections 102(a) and (b). They also argue that these decisions are final agency decisions as they mark the \"consummation\" of the agency's decisionmaking and \"alter[ ] the legal regime to which the action agency is subject\". (Dkt.

They distinguish the Waivers from past waivers found to be constitutional. Past waivers focused solely on building new fencing pursuant to the specific mandates of Congress in section 102(b) which limited the DHS Secretary's waiver authority to the initial border construction. However, the Waivers at issue concern projects not previously identified by section 102. Therefore, they argue that the grant of waiver authority does not apply to these new projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Defendants argue that Congress provided specific boundaries for its delegated authority, satisfying the third prong of the intelligible principle standard. This authority may only be exercised to \"waive all legal requirements [the] Secretary ... determines\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads\n   <em>\n    under this section\n   </em>\n   .\" (Dkt.

The boundaries, they contend, are both geographic, DHS can only waive laws in connection with construction of a physical barrier at the U.S. border, and temporally necessary, DHS can only waive laws necessary to quickly construct a wall.

Border barriers, roads, and detection equipment help provide a measure of deterrence against illegal entries. With section 102, Congress delegated to its executive counterpart, the responsibility to construct border barriers as needed in areas of high illegal entry to detect and deter illegal entries. In an increasingly complex and changing world, this delegation avoids the need for Congress to pass a new law to authorize the construction of every border project. Similarly, Congress enacted a law which attempts to avoid delays caused by lawsuits challenging the construction of barriers by allowing the Secretary to waive the application and enforcement of federal, state and local laws during the construction of a border barrier as necessary. The Court concludes that Congress has clearly delineated the \"boundaries of delegated authority\" in terms previously upheld by the Supreme Court, thereby satisfying the third prong of the intelligible principle standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

California Plaintiffs further contend that judicial review is the only way to ensure that the DHS Secretary adheres to the intelligible principle Congress provided. California cites to three Supreme Court cases in support of this argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   In none of these cases, however, did the Court strike down the statute for lack of judicial review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' argument has been expressly rejected by the Ninth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, it claims that the DHS exceeded the authority delegated to it by issuing the August 2 Waiver under section 102 even though it was not authorized by section 102(b). (Dkt. No. 28-1 at 42-43.) Second, it asserts that even if section 102(c) waiver provision is not limited to those barriers mandated under section 102(b), the August 2 Waiver Determination does not comply with the direction in section 102(a) that the barriers be built in \"areas of high illegal entry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.)

Next, they argue that the San Diego Waiver does not provide reasonable notice as to when undisclosed projects will be constructed and purports to waive federal and state laws for the on-going maintenance of these structures. These uncertainties leave California unable to determine whether the projects will be the types of projects authorized by section 102, whether the areas will be considered areas of high illegal entry at the time they are installed and whether California should file a claim to protect their individual rights.
