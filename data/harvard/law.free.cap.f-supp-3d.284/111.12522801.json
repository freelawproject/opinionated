On July 21, 2017, this Court vacated the Commissioner's decision and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Sinclair now moves for an award of attorneys' fees in the amount of $5,316.59 pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (\"EAJA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Of the three major arguments Sinclair presented in her appeal, this Court rejected the first (incorrect conclusion as to fibromyalgia ) but accepted the second (improper discounting of Dr. Funa's opinion) and third (improper reliance on vocational expert's testimony). While the Commissioner correctly points out that the Court found reasonable one of the hearing officer's four justifications for discounting Dr. Funa's opinion (certain inconsistencies between Dr. Funa's opinion and other medical evidence in the record),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, the Court rejected the hearing officer's three other justifications,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265246\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/545/#p547\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at 556-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Commissioner argues that had the hearing officer provided only that first reason, her decision to discount Dr. Funa's opinion \"would have likely survived substantial evidence review,\" Def.'s Opp'n 7, but this hypothetical assumption is unhelpful. Had the hearing officer based her decision on that factor alone, she might well have discounted Dr.\n   Funa's opinion to a lesser extent and arrived at a reasonable residual functional capacity determination. In reality, she made the decision heavily to discount the opinion based on four reasons, and this Court found her reasons on the whole not to support such a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Commissioner further argues that because the Sixth and Tenth Circuits have affirmed determinations of substantial justification where the error was one of \"articulation,\" this Court ought reach the same result.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265246\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/545/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8-10 (citing\n   <em>\n    DeLong\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner Soc.

There, though the hearing officer had failed to \"adequately address\" the opinion in his report, the district court had nevertheless found his ultimate determination on the issue to have been reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Hays\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=630%20Fed.%20Appx.%20749\">\n    630 Fed.Appx. 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753 (10th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While it may be true that a hearing officer's failure to provide an adequate explanation does not alone establish a lack of substantial justification, neither does it establish the presence of substantial justification. A \"fully justified position\" indeed \"may be poorly explained,\" but an unjustified position also may be poorly explained. This case exemplifies the latter. Here, the hearing officer certainly addressed Dr. Funa's opinion, but unfortunately much of her stated reasoning relied on nonexistent contradictions and unsupported theories of bias,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265246\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/545/#p547\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at 556-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , leading to an unreasonable residual functional capacity finding. When this Court explained that \"the hearing officer erred by assigning little weight to Dr. Funa's opinion without an adequate explanation for doing so,\" it did not intend to imply that the hearing officer's only error was in her articulation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265246\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/545/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265246\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/545/#p547\">\n    at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The error was in her decision to discount Dr. Funa's opinion so heavily, which this Court ruled was unreasonable given the available evidence. The hearing officer's explanation was only inadequate in that it failed to convince the Court that her conclusion was a reasonable one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, the Commissioner argues that its position was substantially justified because the Court acknowledged that the issue of the vocational expert's reliance on outdated job descriptions contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (the \"DOT\") \"was without guidance from the First Circuit, and ... was the subject of a divide amongst other district and circuit courts.\" Def.'s Opp'n 2. This argument, however, is irrelevant, because even assuming that the hearing officer was reasonable to consider testimony relying on\n   the DOT, the Court would not be compelled to conclude that the government's position was substantially justified. This Court concluded that the vocational expert's testimony was unreliable not only because it \"overlooks the reality that jobs have changed over the past forty years,\" but also because \"it is based on a flawed residual functional capacity determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265246\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/545/#p547\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given the relative importance of the residual functional capacity determination to the vocational expert's testimony (even testimony using up-to-date job descriptions would have been unreliable if based on this determination), establishing the reasonableness of the job descriptions relied upon would still not be sufficient to satisfy the government's burden of showing substantial justification.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Secretary of Army\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1704888\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/820/513/#p520\">\n    820 F.2d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 520 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"The government's burden of showing substantial justification is a strong one and is not met merely because the government adduces 'some evidence' in support of its position.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324970\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/756/959/#p961\">\n    756 F.2d 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 961 (3d Cir. 1985) )).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court concludes that the government has not carried its burden of proving substantial justification and thus awards fees to Sinclair pursuant to the EAJA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court concludes that 1.5 hours of preparatory work prior to the filing of the civil complaint is reasonable and compensable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, the Commissioner contests several entries totaling one hour of attorney time for \"ministerial or clerical tasks,\" arguing that the lower paralegal rate ought apply to this work. Def.'s Opp'n 14. Clerical or administrative tasks \"ought not to be billed at lawyers' rates, even if a lawyer performs them.\"\n   <em>\n    Lipsett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Blanco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517554\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/934/#p940\">\n    975 F.2d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 940 (1st Cir. 1992). Such tasks may include \"document preparation, organization, distribution, and copying; drafting emails and other correspondence; data collection; legal cite-checking; scheduling and logistical planning; filing court documents; factual research; and docket review and management.\"\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    AutoZone, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894559\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/934/342/#p353\">\n    934 F.Supp.2d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353-54 (D. Mass. 2013). At the same time, these hours \"should not be completely eliminated.\"\n   <em>\n    Lipsett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517554\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/934/#p940\">\n    975 F.2d at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees with the Commissioner that the\n   paralegal rate of $90 per hour is more appropriate for these services, which include reviewing notices of appearance, confirming receipt of filings, preparing an affidavit of service, and reviewing orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Third, the Commissioner asserts that the Court ought deduct one tenth of an hour for time related to drafting a motion for one attorney to appear pro hac vice. Def.'s Opp'n 14-15. This Court has previously concluded that \"the pro hac vice fee is an expense that should be borne by that attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of McIntyre\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151796\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/739/70/#p76\">\n    739 F.Supp.2d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 (D. Mass. 2010). Accordingly, the Court will deduct this time from the fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lastly, the Commissioner argues that the travel time and rate billed is excessive. Def.'s Opp'n 15. While \"there is no hard-and-fast rule\" regarding fees for travel time,\n   <em>\n    Hutchinson ex rel. Julien\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Patrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4105176\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/1/#p15\">\n    636 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15 (1st Cir. 2011), courts in this circuit typically reduce attorney time spent solely on travel by fifty percent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hermida\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Archstone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3928107\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/950/298/#p311\">\n    950 F.Supp.2d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (D. Mass. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maceira\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1506256\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/698/38/#p40\">\n    698 F.2d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40 (1st Cir. 1983) ;\n   <em>\n    Conservation Law Found., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Patrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4194961\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/767/244/#p255\">\n    767 F.Supp.2d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255 (D. Mass. 2011). Pointing to one entry billing 5.15 hours for a combination of travel and other work, the Commissioner requests that three hours be attributed to travel time and thus reduced by fifty percent. The Court finds this suggestion reasonable and reduces the rate for those hours accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The table below presents a summary of the fees awarded by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-34\"><strong>Fees Awarded</strong> Rate Hours Hours Amount Requested Awarded Attorney Work $198.15 19.95 15.85 $3,140.68 Paralegal Work $ 90.00 15.15 15.15 $1,363.50 Attorney Work $ 90.00 - 1 $ 90.00 at Paralegal Rate Attorney Work $ 99.08 - 3 $ 297.24 at 50% Attorney Rate <strong>Total: $4,891.42</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
