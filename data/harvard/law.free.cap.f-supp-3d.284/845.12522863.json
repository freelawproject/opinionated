Having considered the same, and for the reasons set forth herein, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2014, Ironshore issued an insurance policy to Dorel Juvenile Group, Inc. (\"Dorel\"). (Dkt. No. 10 \u00b6 2.) On May 13, 2015, Dorel was sued by Nicole and Cameron\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   on behalf of their minor child who was injured in a car accident involving a product manufactured by Dorel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hinson v. Dorel Juvenile Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:15-cv-713-JRG-RSP, Dkt. No. 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202374191\">\n    2015 WL 2374191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Tex. May 13, 2015). In this underlying case, Dorel was represented by Schiff, the defendant in the instant case. (Dkt. No. 10 \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While representing Dorel, Schiff regularly communicated with Ironshore.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Specifically, Ironshore was concerned that if the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   case resulted in an award or settlement in excess of $6 million, then Ironshore might have to pay out on its insurance policy with Dorel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Against this backdrop, Ironshore alleges that on several occasions Schiff misled Ironshore into believing it was unlikely the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   case would result in any exposure for Ironshore.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20 (\"At various times during the Lawsuit, Schiff misrepresented to Ironshore that a settlement within Ironshore's policy limits was 'unwarranted.' \"). Ironshore also alleges that Schiff withheld other critical information about developments in the lawsuit. For example, Ironshore alleges that \"Schiff falsely represented that the last offer of settlement received from Plaintiffs was $6.5 million\" when in reality the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs had expressed a willingness to settle for as little as $3.25 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. Ironshore further alleges that \"Schiff's various misrepresentations led Ironshore to believe that the Ironshore Policy was not at risk. Thus, Ironshore did not associate in the defense of the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Had Ironshore been given an accurate picture of the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   case, Ironshore alleges it \"would have exercised its right to settle the case...[or] paid the Plaintiffs to release all claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49. Instead, the case went to trial and the jury awarded the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs $34 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. This verdict, being in excess of $6 million, would have required Ironshore to pay out on its policy with Dorel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. After eventually settling with the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs after trial, Ironshore filed this case against Schiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant has now moved to dismiss Ironshore's negligent misrepresentation claim, which is the only claim in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Applicable Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When a federal court hears state law claims based on diversity jurisdiction, it generally applies the substantive law of the state in which it sits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilbane Bldg.

Primarily, Defendant argues that Ironshore cannot allege causation because Ironshore could not have forced Dorel to settle the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   case. (Dkt. No. 17 at 12-13, 16-19.) Defendant further contends that Ironshore failed to exercise its right to associate at the outset of the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   case and, thus, has no right to \"pursue Dorel's attorneys\" for its own misstep.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.

(Dkt. No. 17 at 11 (\"The Ironshore policy is controlled by New York law....\"); Dkt. No. 28 at 15 (\"New York law applies to the interpretation of the Ironshore Policy.\"); Dkt. No. 17-1 at 71.) Beyond that, the heart of the dispute is whether Ironshore could have settled the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   case without Dorel's consent. Defendant argues that nothing\n   <em>\n    permitted\n   </em>\n   Ironshore to engage in such a settlement and, thus, it could not. (Dkt. No. 17 (\"Ironshore's 'opportunity to associate' in Dorel's defense did not allow Ironshore to force Dorel to settle or take any different actions.\"). Plaintiff, by contrast, argues that because nothing\n   <em>\n    prevented\n   </em>\n   Ironshore from separately settling with the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, Ironshore could have, and would have, settled with the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs had it known what it considers the real truth about the progress and status of the case. (Dkt. No. 28 at 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Given that the Parties disagree about the application of New York law to this case, the Court must again venture an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess to determine whether the highest court in New York State, the New York State Court of Appeals, would recognize that Ironshore could have settled with the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs without Dorel's consent. On this point, neither party offered\n   controlling or even particularly persuasive authority from the New York State Court of Appeals. However, having reviewed several relevant authorities, the Court is persuaded that under New York law Ironshore could have settled with the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs without Dorel's consent.\n   <em>\n    Melendez v.

Plaintiff has alleged that had it known about an earlier settlement offer from the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs it would have either settled the case or come to some sort of agreement that limited its liability. Plaintiff also alleged that the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs would have accepted these offers, which is at least plausible because they had extended the same offers to Dorel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Schiff's argument that Ironshore cannot seek relief from Schiff because it failed to exercise its own right to associate is misplaced. Unlike the cases on which Defendant relies, this is not a malpractice or breach of contract case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 17 at 14 (citing\n   <em>\n    MBIA Inc. v. Fed.

Instead, Plaintiff's allegation is that it did not exercise its right to associate because of Schiff's supposed misrepresentations. Recovery for a claim based on such an allegation may be mitigated by Plaintiff's decision not to associate, but recovery is not foreclosed by it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Ultimately, the Court is persuaded that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss should be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   . Specifically, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   to the extent Ironshore's negligent misrepresentation claim depends on Schiff's predictions about the future, such as the exposure the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   case presented to Ironshore, or Schiff's subjective assessments about trial going \"fine\" or \"pretty well.\" However, Ironshore's allegation that Schiff misrepresented information about offers to settle made by the\n   <em>\n    Hinson\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, either directly or by failing to disclose subsequent, lower offers, is sufficient to state a claim for relief. Moreover, such claim is not barred by the doctrine of attorney immunity.
