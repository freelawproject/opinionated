He sued defendant Securus Technologies, Inc. (\"Securus\"), a company that provides Inmate Calling Services (\"ICS\") to \"more than 3,400 public safety, law enforcement, and corrections agencies and over 1.2 million inmates,\" on behalf of similarly situated persons who were\n   \"charged exorbitant rates and fees\" to use its ICS intrastate services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Antoon filed his complaint on January 9, 2017 in the Western District of Arkansas.

Mot. Quash, ECF No. 1. Thereafter, Mr. Antoon moved to transfer Mr. Lipman's motion to the Western District of Arkansas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot.

R. Civ. P. 45(f). According to the Advisory Committee Note accompanying the 2013 amendments to Rule 45, the \"prime concern\" in assessing whether \"exceptional circumstances\" exist to permit transfer, \"should be avoiding burdens on local nonparties subject to subpoenas ....\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(f) advisory committee's note. While \"it should not be assumed that the issuing court is in a superior position to resolve subpoena-related motions,\" \"transfer may be warranted in order to avoid disrupting the issuing court's management of the underlying litigation ... if such interests outweigh the interests of the nonparty served with the subpoena in obtaining local resolution of the motion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276260\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/39/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To carry out this balancing test, courts in this Circuit have considered \"the complexity, procedural posture, duration of pendency, and the nature of the issues pending before, or already resolved by, the issuing court in the underlying litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

R. Civ. P. 45(f) advisory committee's note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Antoon argues that this Court should transfer Mr. Lipman's motion to quash because his arguments are based on the parties' \"substantive allegations and defenses,\" with which the issuing court is more familiar. Mot. Transfer 2, ECF No. 2. Mr. Antoon further argues that transfer is warranted to avoid issuing inconsistent rulings and disrupting the issuing court's management of the underlying action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759244\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/304/38/#p46\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Mr. Antoon argues that any burden on Mr. Lipman is negligible given that he is represented by the same law firm that represents Securus in the underlying action, and because Judge Brooks permits counsel to argue discovery motions by telephone.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759244\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/304/38/#p46\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Lipman counters that the motion to quash involves a \"threshold application\" of the attorney client-privilege and the work product doctrine, which are\n   \"legal question[s] separate from the underlying litigation's merits.\" Opp'n Transfer 1-2, ECF No. 5. As a nonparty subpoena respondent located in the District of Columbia without a connection to the Western District of Arkansas, Mr. Lipman argues that he will be burdened if he has to argue his motion before the issuing court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court finds that the exceptional circumstances present weigh in favor of transferring the motion to quash because (1) the burden on Mr. Lipman is negligible and (2) consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   factors militates strongly in favor of transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5767668\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/307/30/#p34\">\n    307 F.R.D. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Mr. Antoon argues that the burden on Mr. Lipman is \"negligible\" because he is represented by the same law firm that represents Securus and because the issuing court will preside over Securus' motion for a protective order concerning this very subpoena. Mot. Transfer 10, ECF No. 2. Mr. Antoon also notes that \"Judge Brooks' case management procedures permit counsel to appear for discovery ... hearings telephonically,\" a method of participation specifically contemplated by the Advisory Committee Notes to minimize the burden that transfer could impose on nonparties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5767668\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/307/30/#p34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Mr. Antoon states that any deposition of Mr. Lipman would occur in the District of Columbia, where it was originally noticed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Mr. Lipman argues that his burden is not \"negligible\" because he is represented by different lawyers than those that represent Securus. Opp'n Transfer 16, ECF No. 5. He also asserts that because he and his attorney are based in the District of Columbia, he \"should not be forced to litigate in the Western District of Arkansas-a district to which he has no connection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Lipman has not explained how he would be burdened by litigating the motion in the Western District of Arkansas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duck\n   </em>\n   , 317 F.R.D. at 326 (transferring motion to compel in part because defendant \"fail[ed] to identify any burden that might exist in arguing [its motion] before the [issuing district court]\"). Further, Mr. Lipman, Chairman of Morgan Lewis, is represented by his own firm, the same \"global\" law firm that represents Securus. Mot. Quash 13, ECF No. 1. In this circumstance, \"the general interest in protecting local nonparties by requiring local resolution of subpoena-related disputes is significantly reduced\" because Mr. Lipman is represented by a firm familiar with this litigation and the issuing court.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5767668\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/307/30/#p34\">\n    307 F.R.D. at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, Judge Brooks' case management procedures contemplate resolving discovery disputes by telephone conference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Management Order 4, ECF No. 53 (5:17-cv-5008). Therefore, there is a \"strong possibility that [Mr. Lipman's] counsel will not even need to leave Washington, D.C. to litigate the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Flynn\n   </em>\n   , 216 F.Supp.3d at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exceptional circumstances weigh in favor of transfer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   With regard to the\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   factors, only one of those factors-the short pendency of the underlying suit-weigh against transferring. The remaining factors support Mr. Antoon's argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5767668\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/307/30/#p34\">\n    307 F.R.D. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

With respect to the underlying case's complexity, Mr. Antoon has only two relatively straightforward claims. While his case may not be complex on its own, the underlying suit is complicated because it is one of four related cases challenging ICS practices. The two interstate ICS cases have been pending before Judge Brooks since 2014 and are ready for trial after extensive discovery efforts. Moffa Decl. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 2-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While Mr. Lipman argues that\n   <em>\n    Antoon\n   </em>\n   is distinct from the three pending ICS cases,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Transfer 8-12, ECF No. 5, his arguments in his motion to quash indicate otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot.

For example, Mr. Lipman argues that Mr. Antoon is using this subpoena to fish for information to be used in the related interstate case\n   <em>\n    Mojica\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5767668\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/307/30/#p34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, there is a motion pending in\n   <em>\n    Mojica\n   </em>\n   that concerns the same information requested in the instant subpoena.

As explained more thoroughly below, it is clear to this Court that any decision in\n   <em>\n    Antoon\n   </em>\n   could impact the other three cases pending before Judge Brooks, complicating the underlying suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, transfer is warranted to avoid the \"risk of inconsistent results\" in the underlying litigation.\n   <em>\n    Duck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123778\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/321/#p324\">\n    317 F.R.D. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(f) advisory committee's note). In\n   <em>\n    Duck\n   </em>\n   , transfer was warranted in part because there was a pending motion for summary judgment before the issuing court. Therefore, resolving the motion to compel could \"create the potential for inconsistent or conflicting rulings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123778\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/321/#p324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123778\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/321/#p324\">\n    at 324-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So here too. Pending before Judge Brooks is Securus' motion for summary judgment and its motion for a protective order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot.

Opp'n Transfer 13, ECF No. 5. Not so. This Court's ruling could still disrupt Judge Brooks' management of the case. It is clear that courts in this Circuit are concerned about the\n   <em>\n    poten\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tial\n   </em>\n   for inconsistent results.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759244\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/304/38/#p46\">\n    304 F.R.D. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If this Court resolved Mr. Lipman's motion to quash, its decision could conflict with Judge Brooks' resolution of the same arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This danger is not limited to the motion for a protective order. Also pending before Judge Brooks are other nonparty respondents' motions to quash, which have already been transferred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moffa Decl. \u00b6 8, ECF. No 2-1. Finally, Judge Brooks is reviewing similar discovery issues in the related ICS cases. Mr. Lipman's statements to the FCC-the statements at the heart of this subpoena-are the \"subject\" of a pending motion in limine in\n   <em>\n    Mojica\n   </em>\n   . Moffa Decl. \u00b6 13, ECF No. 2-1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. in limine, ECF No. 282 (\n   <em>\n    Mojica\n   </em>\n   , 14-cv-5258); Subpoena, ECF No. 1-2. Given Judge Brooks' \"familiarity with the full scope of issues involved as well as any implications the resolution of the motion will have on the underlying litigation,\" he is better suited to make consistent determinations across all four cases.\n   <em>\n    Wultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759244\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/304/38/#p46\">\n    304 F.R.D. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Most importantly, Mr. Lipman's motion to quash raises multiple issues that are closely connected to the merits of the underlying case, the interstate ICS cases, and the more than a decade-long FCC ICS rulemaking proceeding. To illustrate, Mr. Lipman puts forward four arguments in support of his motion to quash.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Quash, ECF No. 1-2. First, he argues that the information sought is \"wholly irrelevant\" to Mr. Antoon's claims in the underlying litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Second, he argues that Mr. Antoon should seek the information through party discovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Third and fourth, he argues that the information requested is protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. In opposing the motion to transfer, Mr. Lipman argues that his \"primary\" argument is that the subpoena requests material that is protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. Opp'n Transfer 8-12, ECF No. 5. He downplays his relevance arguments, arguing that the Court need not evaluate relevance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court disagrees, looking no further than Mr. Lipman's own motion to quash.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Quash 10-14, ECF No. 1. Mr. Lipman's first and most robust argument is that the subpoena seeks irrelevant documents and oral testimony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He contends that Mr. Antoon is using the subpoena to improperly harass him as a partner and Chairman of Morgan Lewis, Securus' outside counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Mr. Lipman further asserts that Mr. Antoon is improperly seeking discovery in\n   <em>\n    Antoon\n   </em>\n   to \"fish for information and testimony ... to use in the separate\n   <em>\n    Mojica\n   </em>\n   lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Securus renews these same arguments in its motion for a protective order in the underlying case, highlighting their significance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Protective Order 9-14, ECF No. 65 (5:17-cv-5008). Furthermore, Mr. Lipman's written objections to the subpoena confirm that his primary argument is relevance. See Objections, ECF No. 1-9. The first and lengthiest objection to each of the six categories of subpoenaed documents is that the requested information is \"irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Only after Mr. Antoon moved to transfer did Mr. Lipman reorder his arguments, re-characterizing their primacy. Opp'n Transfer 1, ECF No. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The centrality of the relevance assessment weighs in favor of transfer because determining whether information is relevant requires \"nuanced legal analysis based on a full understanding of the Underlying Action.\"\n   <em>\n    Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Co. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350215\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/309/41/#p43\">\n    309 F.R.D. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43 (D.D.C. 2015). As other courts in this Circuit have routinely recognized,\n   \"[r]uling on the subpoenaed documents' relevance would ... require[ ] the Court to delve into the intricacies of the underlying dispute. Given the close relationship between the motion to quash and the merits of the complex underlying dispute, the issuing court [would be] in a better position to rule on the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    FDIC v.

May 18, 2017) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In contrast, Judge Brooks is already \"knee-deep in the nuances of the underlying litigation\"; he is clearly \"in a much better position than this Court to evaluate relevance.\"\n   <em>\n    Flynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271457\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/216/44/#p47\">\n    216 F.Supp.3d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Mr. Lipman's argument that Mr. Antoon is using the subpoena to \"improperly harass\" him as Chairman of Morgan Lewis and \"fish\" for discovery to use in\n   <em>\n    Mojica\n   </em>\n   weighs in favor of transfer. Mot. Quash 10-14, ECF No. 1.
