This dispute involves the contractual rights and obligations between plaintiff The Pike Company, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\") and defendant Universal Concrete Products, Inc. (\"Defendant\"). Plaintiff, the general contractor for the construction project, claims that Defendant, its subcontractor, materially breached the terms of the parties' subcontract and improperly encumbered the project property with a mechanic's lien that has been discharged by bond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at 6-9). Plaintiff seeks damages for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violations of the New York Lien Law, and an order invalidating and vacating the lien and bond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss, stay, or transfer this action (Dkt. 8), and Marist's motion to intervene as a plaintiff-intervenor (Dkt. 18). For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is denied, and Marist's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Marist, a private liberal arts college located in Poughkeepsie, New York, engaged the services of Kirchoff-Consigli Construction Management, LLC (\"KCCM\") to act as the general contractor for a construction project involving several buildings on Marist's campus (the \"Project\"). (Dkt. 18-1 at \u00b6 4 (Affidavit of Justin Butwell)). Defendant acted as KCCM's subcontractor for the Project until May 4, 2015, when Marist hired Plaintiff to replace KCCM as the general contractor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-7). On May 29, 2015, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a subcontract to perform work on the Project (the \"Subcontract\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Subcontract contains an alternative dispute resolution clause, requiring the parties to proceed with mediation before seeking judicial recourse should a dispute arise under the Subcontract's terms. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at \u00b6 10). Defendant allegedly fell behind on its scheduled timetable, causing Plaintiff to send a number of letters to Defendant requesting that it cure these defaults. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7-1 (Letter Exhibits)). On September 27, 2016, Plaintiff requested damages from Defendant for its failure to remedy its allegedly untimely performance. (Dkt. 7 at \u00b6 14). In response, on October 31, 2016, Defendant filed a mechanic's lien on the subject property, which was discharged by bond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 22, 2016, Defendant filed a writ of summons, without a complaint, in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, naming Plaintiff and Marist as party defendants. (Dkt. 8-2 (Writ of Summons)). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant filed this action without complying with the mediation requirements set forth in the Subcontract. (Dkt. 7 at \u00b6 16). Indeed, after Plaintiff filed for mediation with the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in March of 2017, and the AAA scheduled a preliminary mediation session, Defendant refused to proceed with mediation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 4, 2017, Plaintiff commenced this action against Defendant in New York State Supreme Court, Monroe County, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and unjust enrichment (\"NYS Action\"). (Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-13). On June 8,\n   2017, Defendant filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, requesting the federal court to declare the mediation clause of the Subcontract void and unenforceable, and to enjoin Plaintiff from enforcing that clause against Defendant (\"EDPA Action\"). (Dkt. 8-6 at 12-13). The next day, Defendant removed the NYS Action to this Court, alleging that the Court could entertain this action on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same day, Defendant filed its complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, misappropriation of trade secrets, and tortious interference with business relations. (Dkt. 8-4 at 10-21). Throughout the remainder of this Decision and Order, the Court will refer to the action commenced in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, as the \"State Action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 30, 2017, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint that expounded upon the original complaint, and alleged causes of action against Defendant that included breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violations of the New York Lien Law. (Dkt. 7 at 6-9). On July 14, 2017, Defendant moved to dismiss or stay this action on the ground that the abstention doctrine set forth in\n   <em>\n    Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    424 U.S. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) should apply in light of the pending proceedings in the State Action. (Dkt. 8-7 at 12-18). Alternatively, Defendant requests that the Court transfer this case to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the \"first-to-file\" rule so that this action and the EDPA Action may be consolidated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20). Plaintiff opposes Defendant's motion. (Dkt. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 2, 2017, Marist filed a motion to intervene in this action pursuant to Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 18). Marist is represented on this motion by the same law firm that represents Plaintiff in the instant action. Not surprisingly, Plaintiff does not object to Marist's motion to intervene. However, Defendant opposes the motion. (Dkt. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Oral argument was held before the undersigned on December 13, 2017, at which time the Court reserved decision on both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Motion to Dismiss or to Stay This Action Based on\n     <em>\n      Colorado River\n     </em>\n     Abstention is Denied\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As such, the Court finds that Marist was on notice of Plaintiff's action for about five months before it decided to file a motion to intervene on October 2, 2017. (Dkt. 18).

Marist seeks to intervene as a plaintiff-intervenor to define its contractual relationship with Defendant, and claims that any previous \"discussions [it] may have had with [Defendant] were terminated when [Plaintiff] became general contractor to the project and [Plaintiff] entered into the [S]ubcontract with [Defendant].\" (Dkt. 18-5 at 4). Marist takes the position that any prior relationship it may have had with Defendant was terminated and subsumed by the Subcontract. (Dkt. 24 at 4). This assertion raises common questions of law and fact as to the scope of the responsibilities of the parties and Marist under the Subcontract, and what obligations, if any, the parties and Marist were required to discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.
