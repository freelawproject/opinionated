Hanson, and the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") (collectively, the federal government), seeking a declaration that Section 1373 of the Immigration and Nationalization Act (as interpreted by the federal government) violates the Constitution and an injunction enjoining the federal government from withholding, terminating, disbarring, or making any state entity or local jurisdiction ineligible for certain law enforcement grants. The State then moved for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At some later date, this case may help define the contours of the State's broad constitutional police powers under the Tenth Amendment and the federal government's \"broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

The Trump administration's immigration enforcement policy is clearly at odds with the State's determination of the most effective methods to implement criminal law enforcement. But for today, the question I decide is narrow: is the State entitled to a preliminary injunction to require the federal government to fund a $1 million law enforcement grant that it has held up because it appears likely to decide that the State is not complying with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( Section 1373 ) by restricting its officials from providing personal information and release dates of certain people detained in jails across the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The injury threatened is not irreparable. The amount of money at stake is small compared to the State's budget. Payment is delayed, for the moment. The DOJ appears to be using its regular administrative process to decide whether it will follow its initial inclinations. Given the number of open questions concerning the federal government's positions concerning the provisions of the statutes in question, the relatively minimal injury its delay has caused thus far, and the extraordinary nature of the relief sought, I deny the State's motion without prejudice. These issues will be better addressed on a more complete record after discovery on a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

It contends that because it has not withheld or threatened to withhold grant funding on any state statute except for the Values Act, the State lacks standing to seek a ruling on any other state statute. It also asserts that there is not a ripe controversy because the federal government has not made a final decision as to whether the Values Act violates Section 1373. (Its argument that the Values Act is not currently in effect and may never be in effect due to a proposed voter referendum is moot because the referendum failed due to lack of signatures on January 17, 2017.)

The State asserts that it will be harmed by the federal government's interpretation of Section 1373 because the State's laws violate the federal government's broad interpretation of Section 1373, open up the State to prosecution and endanger its future grant funds. Through the federal government's November letter to the State, it showed that it intends to prosecute any entities that do not comply with its interpretation of Section 1373. The federal government has also sought to enforce the compliance condition with respect to other laws that\n   mirror those of the State. And finally, the federal government has explicitly stated that receipt of both the Byrne JAG Program and COPS funds are conditioned on the Section 1373 certification.

The federal government responds that the Section 1373 condition is consistent with the APA and the spending clause; the State cannot demonstrate that none of its laws would violate the Section 1373 compliance condition; and the State cannot show that the Section 1373 compliance condition violates the Tenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The justification for an agency's final action is typically apparent as the result of formal rulemaking, notice-and-comment requirements, and associated hearings. But because the State's challenge is to grant conditions, these administrative procedures were not required prior to the federal government's decision to impose the certification condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 553(a)(2) (exempting \"matter(s) relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts\" from rulemaking requirements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The State argues that the identification of Section 1373 as an \"applicable law\" for the Byrne JAG Program grant is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.

The federal government responds that it has met its burden to demonstrate that its reasons for imposing the condition were rational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In order to demonstrate these \"rational\" reasons, the federal government points only to a press release that it issued on July 25, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Backgrounder on Grant Requirements (\"Backgrounder\") (July 25, 2017),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.justice.gov/opa/ press-release/file/984346/download. The Backgrounder highlights three of the federal government's concerns as they pertain to Section 1373 compliance condition: (1) jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in information sharing about undocumented immigrants who commit crimes; (2) the use of federal funds for policies that frustrate federal immigration enforcement; and (3) jurisdictions that jeopardize the safety of their residents and undermine the Department's ability to protect the public and reduce crime and violence.\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia v.

Jolls Decl. \u00b6 10. Consequently, withholding the grant funds because of the certification condition does not further the federal government's goal of prohibiting \"use of federal funds for policies that frustrate federal immigration enforcement.\" Instead, the certification condition amounts to a way to target jurisdictions that do not comply with the federal government's interpretation of Section 1373.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Its third concern-jurisdictions that jeopardize the safety of their residents and undermine the Department's ability to protect the public and reduce crime and violence-is unsupported. The federal government presents no evidence that there is any link between increases in crime and violence and imposing the certification condition, especially given that Section 1373's language captures the immigration status of both criminal and non-criminal immigrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The State points to evidence that keeping the immigration status of undocumented immigrants confidential in certain circumstances improves the community's relationship with law enforcement, making immigrants, both documented and undocumented, more likely to report crimes. California Assembly Committee on Public Safety's analysis of AB 2792 (\"the TRUTH Act\"), RJN, Ex. F at 5 (Dkt. No. 27-2). It also highlights studies that concluded that first generation immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, were considerably less likely to commit violent acts than third-generation Americans. This study also revealed that living in neighborhoods of concentrated immigration was associated with lower violence. California Senate Committee on Public Safety's analysis of AB 4 (\"the TRUST Act\"), RJN, Ex. G at 8. Given the State's evidence that immigration status is not linked to pervasive criminal activity and violence and the federal government's lack of evidence supporting such an assertion, there does not appear to be rational connection between imposing the certification condition and \"the Department's ability to protect the public and reduce crime and violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   All that said, criminal law impacts the INA in a variety of ways, and, as discussed below, the relationship the government needs to add conditions to the receipt of grants does not need to be close. While the federal government fails to identify any goal set out in the Backgrounder that is furthered by the imposition of the certification condition, I am not prepared at the moment to find that the certification condition is arbitrary and capricious under the APA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).

Section 1373 can be interpreted not to import an affirmative duty at all. But it is not clear that the federal government has adopted such an interpretation. The question is whether the federal government's interpretation exceeds the constitutional reach of Section 1373.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Section 1373 requires the sharing of information with the federal government \"regarding immigration status.\" The meaning of that phrase is ambiguous. The federal government has not tried to define that phrase, and has not settled on a definition now, even though some of its officials are threatening criminal prosecution against political leaders whose understanding of the constitutional reach of Section 1373 differs from theirs. Under the INA, almost every bit of information about an individual could be relevant to status, particularly with respect to the right to asylum or as a defense to removal. The State reads the phrase narrowly, as requiring only information whether a person is a citizen of the US, present here in some other capacity, or undocumented, which is literally what \"status\" is.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steinle v. City &amp; Cnty. of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270190\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/994/#p1015\">\n    230 F.Supp.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1015-16 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (finding that city policy would only violate Section 1373 by \"restricting the provision of inmates' citizenship and immigration status to ICE\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   At this time, only the State's obligation to communicate \"personal information\" and release dates of detainees is in dispute with respect to the Values Act. There is a nationwide injunction against the federal government regarding the effect of Section 1373 on other aspects of the Byrne grants.\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266915\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/933/#p951\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d at 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The personal information and dates of release from jail of undocumented detainees are of obvious interest to the federal government for purposes of immigration enforcement, but not so obviously for immigration status. It is valuable to ICE to cross-check names and addresses of detainees to insure that it only targets persons eligible for removal, and to pick them up from local jails before their release. But ICE's enforcement interest conflicts with the reason the State passed the Values Act, which was to encourage cooperation between law enforcement and immigrant communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As I understand it, the disagreement here involves a subset of detained, undocumented people. The State's statutes do not impact the free flow of this information regarding those accused of hundreds of the most serious state crimes; it exempts those arrested or convicted of less serious, largely non-violent, offenses. The State's law enforcement strategy depends on keeping the trust of immigrant communities so that, among other things, they will\n   report crimes and rely on law enforcement, not criminal gangs, for protection. The state statutes also explicitly keep confidential information in juvenile records and regarding those people federal law also protects who are eligible for \"U\" and \"T\" visas. The government has not articulated its position regarding the confidentiality statutes in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   DOJ is apparently processing the COPS grant according to its usual administrative procedure and has yet to make a final pronouncement, although all indications are that it will find the State out of compliance with Section 1373 because of the personal information and release date provisions. The federal government has authority to set immigration policy. But where that policy collides with the State's constitutional police powers, it is important to understand the parameters of the federal government's interpretation of Section 1373. Does DOJ assert that the State's confidentiality statutes should not be respected? How does it square that with the INA statutes requiring confidentiality concerning the same subject matter? If personal information and release dates of detainees are encompassed within Section 1373's sweep as \"regarding immigration status,\" what are the contours of DOJ's definition; does it include every fact about a detainee's life, or something else? How does that square with the language and intent regarding Section 1373 ? The State has been transparent about the purpose of its statutes, but the Values Act has just been implemented. What is the burden on a local enforcement agency to provide personal information and release dates for persons the agency knows are undocumented (recognizing the Values Act precludes officers from requesting information on status for less serious offenses, so this information may not be readily available unless it is determined that Section 1373 requires the agency to maintain and disclose status information)? How does the State comply with Section 1373 in providing information regarding immigration status?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Those are a few of the issues that should be clarified. I find that the record is not sufficient at this stage to determine that State has shown a likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    III. IRREPARABLE HARM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The State asserts two ways in which it will suffer imminent and irreparable harm if I deny its motion for a preliminary injunction: (1) it will suffer a constitutional injury to its sovereignty if the fellow government follows its interpretation of Section 1373 and requires certification of such interpretation from applicants of the Byrne JAG Program funds; and (2) construing Section 1373 to invalidate its statutes would either cause harm to its communities, eroding trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, or force the State to lose the Byrne JAG Program funding, which would leave law enforcement programs detrimentally impacted. The federal government argues that the State has failed to demonstrate immediate and irreparable harm because (1) the amount of potential funding at stake is not coercively high; and (2) the State's claim is belied because its long delay in bringing a legal challenge despite the certification requirement was required for FY 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   At the moment, the merits of the State's constitutional claim are uncertain and its injury is the delay of a $1 million grant. While delay in funding is potentially injurious, the amount is not so great that the State could not cover it while the litigation continues. At this point, the injury is not irreparable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. PUBLIC INTEREST AND BALANCE OF EQUITIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The remaining two factors in the preliminary injunction calculus are considered together in litigation in where the federal government is a party.\n   <em>\n    Nken v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    556 U.S. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The State's evidence demonstrates how its statutes related to the confidentiality of and release of immigration status information are consistent with the exercise of its police powers. It also shows the important criminal law enforcement measures for which it intends to use the grant funds. The federal government does not address how declining to enforce the certification condition against the State would affect it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On this record, the public interest would appear to be better served if the State did not have to choose between the Byrne JAG Program grant funds to assist its criminal law enforcement efforts and the health of its relationship with the immigrant community. But in light of the uncertainty of the merits and the current lack of irreparability of the injury, these factors do not tip the scale sufficiently to require injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The issues in this case will benefit from further development. It is unclear to me whether the State's or federal government's interpretation of Section 1373 and the Tenth Amendment will prevail on the personal information and release date issues; moreover, this lawsuit addresses a plethora of other issues besides those discrete ones. While the State to date has suffered an injury, it is only in the delay of $1 million of a federal grant that it previously received, not in the refusal to pay. I find that the State has not demonstrated that I should issue a preliminary injunction at this time. Its motion is DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    As a result of the nationwide injunction, this Order focuses on the certification condition, which has not been enjoined.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    To the extent that I rely on the documents in this docket of which California requests judicial notice, its requests for judicial notice are GRANTED.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt.
