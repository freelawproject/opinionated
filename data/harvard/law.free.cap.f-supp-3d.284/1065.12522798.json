EZ-Pedo merely brands each advertisement in its entirety as trade dress, rather than defining what shapes, sizes, dimensions or specific elements within each advertisement combine to create a distinctive trade dress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Beach Girl\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Specifically, EZ-Pedo's claimed Beach Girl trade dress contains a single stock photograph of a child on a beach that plaintiff downloaded from a third-party website. SUF 3, 5. Also, just below the photograph, there are white tooth composites, dark-colored text describing these zirconia crowns and EZ-Pedo's logo and contact information. SUF 3, 5; Opp'n at 10. Although EZ-Pedo describes the advertisement using adjectives like \"unique\" and \"distinctive,\" without specificity the court cannot evaluate whether the claimed trade dress is inherently distinctive. As currently defined, the court and competitors remain in the dark as to what EZ-Pedo purports to own. Are competitors never to advertise using the same third-party stock photograph? Can they use the same photograph, but pair it with different text, logo and company information?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Gears\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   EZ-Pedo's claimed Gears trade dress is also vaguely defined. The Gears advertisement depicts a graphic of gears accompanied by an \"engineered for\" slogan. Plaintiff has not shown what elements combine with this slogan to create protectable trade dress. For instance, is plaintiff claiming to own the right to arrange any image of metallic gears next to a slogan containing the words \"engineered for\"? Does the font matter? Do the color, size and shape of the gears matter? Can the word \"engineered\" be used without the preposition \"for\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Blue CAD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Blue CAD trade dress likewise lacks detail.

Can a competitor use the same image, but in deep red?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Without the requisite specificity plaintiff's trade dress claims cannot proceed to trial under an inherent distinctiveness theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Savant Homes, Inc. v.

First, there is no consistent theme between the three advertisements, thus diminishing the possibility that consumers associated these advertisements with the same source. Indeed, each advertisement drastically differs from the other two-a blonde girl on the beach, a deep-blue-shaded tooth, and gears next to an \"engineered for\" slogan. Second, not one of these advertisements was ever placed on EZ-Pedo's product or product packaging, further weakening any association. Although plaintiff maintains it started placing small blue dots on some of its smaller dental crowns to associate the product with the Blue-CAD campaign, this argument is unavailing considering plaintiff has filed no evidence or images pertaining to these alleged blue dots.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fisher Decl. \u00b6 7 &amp; Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, the record is completely devoid of direct evidence suggesting any consumer, let alone \"a substantial portion\" of consumers, associates any of the alleged trade dress with the EZ-Pedo brand.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11101721\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/1252/#p1257\">\n    251 F.3d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding \"substantial evidence\" of secondary meaning; \"Chief among this evidence was a survey ... purporting to demonstrate that patrons associated the look of Clicks with that establishment and not others.\"). Instead, EZ-Pedo has filed a single declaration from its founder, stating \"[t]he pediatric dentistry community has come to associate the Blue Crown CAD imagery with EZ-Pedo's products. I know this ... from specific conversations I have had with purchasing pediatric dentists who have stated they recognize the Blue Crown CAD as symbolizing our products.\" Fischer Decl. \u00b6 7. This vague, self-serving\n   declaration pertaining to a single advertisement, without any consumer confirmation, raises no triable issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seirus Innovative Accessories, Inc. v. Gordini U.S.A. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3797990\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/849/963/#p985\">\n    849 F.Supp.2d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 985 (S.D. Cal. 2012) (rejecting similarly vague, self-serving declaration).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   While EZ-Pedo's founder also emphasizes how frequently EZ-Pedo printed and disbursed the claimed trade dress and highlights which trade journals featured the trade dress, this effort does not salvage these claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fisher Decl. \u00b6 6. Although sales success, advertising expenditures and media coverage may show consumers were so exposed to trade dress that they have come to associate it with a single source, the evidence here does not support the possibility of such a finding. EZ-Pedo's evidence again consists solely of the one self-serving declaration containing vague, conclusory facts without any supporting evidence. Fisher Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6 (citing \"thousands\" of printouts and claiming EZ-Pedo spent \"substantial time and energy\" promoting the imagery). Second, that each advertisement was on the market a year at most tempers EZ-Pedo's claim that it expended \"substantial\" time and money acquiring an association in consumers' minds between it and its products. Third, \"prominent display\" in a trade journal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fisher Decl. \u00b6 12, is not the kind of media coverage that shows the \"enthusiasm and loyalty\" of plaintiff's customers.\n   <em>\n    Cicena Ltd. v. Columbia Telecommunications Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540107\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/1546/#p1551\">\n    900 F.2d 1546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1551 (Fed. Cir. 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on the record before the court, no reasonable juror could find EZ-Pedo's claimed Beach Girl, Gears or Blue CAD trade dress has acquired secondary meaning. The court therefore will not infer secondary meaning based on the evidence that defendant imitated the claimed trade dress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fuddruckers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1741242\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/826/837/#p844\">\n    826 F.2d at 844-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Competitors may intentionally copy product features for a variety of reasons unrelated to secondary meaning\"). Summary judgment for defendant is warranted as to this theory as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because plaintiff raises no triable issues regarding either inherent or acquired distinctiveness as to its claimed Beach Girl, Gears and Blue CAD trade dress, the court GRANTS defendant's partial summary judgment motion. Plaintiff's Lanham Act claims remain only to the extent they derive from the one advertising campaign defendant's motion does not address, plaintiff's lavender advertising campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The DOE defendants are DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This resolves ECF No. 42.
