Ward, Sr. and Pamela Ward (collectively \"plaintiffs\") filed this wrongful death action in state court after defendant Anthony Wayne Stewart (\"Stewart\" or \"defendant\") struck and killed their son, Kevin A. Ward, Jr. (\"Ward\"), during a sprint car race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Stewart removed plaintiffs' suit to federal court and asserted an indemnification counterclaim based on two liability releases (the \"Releases\"). Defendant then tried, and failed, to have the case transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, Rochester Division.\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

Although he did not challenge plaintiffs' claims alleging reckless or intentional conduct, defendant argued that any negligence-based causes of action were barred by the Releases or, alternatively, by the doctrine of primary assumption of risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs opposed Stewart's partial summary judgment motion and cross-moved seeking dismissal of defendant's counterclaim for indemnification. According to plaintiffs, the Releases on which this counterclaim relied were either inapplicable to the particular facts of this case or completely unenforceable as a matter of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 12, 2017, a Memorandum-Decision &amp; Order resolved these issues.\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

However, the fact that an immediate appeal might prevent the need for a second trial is not by itself sufficient to trigger Rule 54(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gentiva Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4134204\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/2/384/#p387\">\n    2 F.Supp.3d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The mere potential for duplicative trials should not by itself result in 54(b) certification.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Negrete v. Citibank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202963494\">\n    2017 WL 2963494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 11, 2017) (rejecting claim of \"unnecessary discovery and trial costs\" as justifying Rule 54(b)'s application).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Assuming the parties fail to reach a settlement, Stewart acknowledges a trial is necessary on plaintiffs' claims alleging reckless or intentional conduct. A trial on those claims would be necessary even if the Releases were to apply, and regardless of whether or not Ward assumed the risk of injury from the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As a practical matter, the risk of a second or \"duplicative\" trial resulting from the possibility of a successful appeal on these issues is remote absent a jury verdict in plaintiffs' favor on negligence. Trying all of plaintiffs' claims at once is more economical, and it is also far more likely to result in either a verdict completely in Stewart's favor or in a mixed award possibly unaffected by the Releases or by the assumption-of-risk defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Stewart's assertions to the contrary rely on speculation about what might happen or what the Second Circuit might decide about the issues discussed above. But even if the Releases were applicable and it later became necessary to reach the question of indemnification, it is far from clear that this result would require the Court and the parties to \"duplicate\" their efforts by revisiting the factual disputes surrounding the fatal crash itself.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Harriscom Svenska AB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522352\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/947/627/#p631\">\n    947 F.2d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It does not normally advance the interests of sound judicial administration or efficiency to have piecemeal appeals that require two (or more) three-judge panels to familiarize themselves with a given case, instead of having the trial judge, who sits alone and is intimately familiar with the whole case, revisit a portion of the case if he or she has erred in part and that portion is overturned following the adjudication of the whole case.\").
