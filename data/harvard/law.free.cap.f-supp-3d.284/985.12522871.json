Gerrard, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The primary opponents in this case are Cy Wakeman, founder of plaintiff Cy Wakeman, Inc. (collectively, Wakeman), and Nicole Price, who is a defendant along with her eponymous LLC (collectively, Price). Wakeman accuses Price of, among other things, violating copyrights held by Wakeman and misappropriating Wakeman's trade secrets. Filing 1 at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Wakeman seeks to preliminarily enjoin Price from that alleged conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 26. The parties have presented evidence, and the Court has conducted an evidentiary hearing at which Wakeman and Price both testified. On the evidence presented, the Court finds that Wakeman has failed to show the necessary likelihood of success on the merits of her claims, and failed to demonstrate that she has been-or will be-irreparably harmed in the absence of a preliminary injunction. So, Wakeman's motion (filing 26) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wakeman is in the business of providing business training and coaching services, with speeches and seminars on business leadership and employee advancement. Filing 28-2 at 1. Wakeman's programs are primarily based on a concept she calls \"Reality-Based Leadership.\" Filing 28-2 at 1. Wakeman is also the author of two books based on that concept:\n   <em>\n    Reality-Based Leadership\n   </em>\n   , published in 2010, and\n   <em>\n    The Reality-Based Rules of the Workplace\n   </em>\n   , published in 2013. Those books, according to Wakeman, have combined sales of approximately 46,000 copies. Filing 55 at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Price worked for Wakeman from 2012 until 2016. Filing 28-2 at 1. Price was one of Wakeman's featured speakers, and also assisted in the development of new programs, including a presentation on \"Reality-Based Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace.\" Filing 28-2 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   filing 28-9. Wakeman terminated Price's employment in 2016; according to Wakeman, she fired Price after she found out about Price's intent to launch a competing business. Filing 28-2 at 2. After her termination,\n   Price started her own consulting business. Filing 34-1 at 1. And she published her own book,\n   <em>\n    Lively Paradox\n   </em>\n   , which she says has sold about 200 copies. Filing 34-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wakeman sued Price, alleging in relevant part that\n   <em>\n    Lively Paradox\n   </em>\n   infringed on Wakeman's copyrights in\n   <em>\n    Reality-Based Leadership\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The Reality-Based Rules of the Workplace\n   </em>\n   , and the text and images of the PowerPoint presentation associated with \"Reality-Based Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace.\" Filing 1 at 2-7. Wakeman also alleges that Price has misappropriated Wakeman's trade secrets by publicly revealing some of Wakeman's confidential clients. Filing 1 at 7. Wakeman asks for a preliminary injunction \"with regard to the sales, distribution and use of copyrighted materials and references to confidential Wakeman clients on [Price's] real and virtual materials.\" Filing 26 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the Court weighs the four\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factors: (1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of the balance between this harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other parties; (3) the probability that the movant will succeed on the merits; and (4) the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

COPYRIGHT CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As noted above, Wakeman claims that Price's\n   <em>\n    Lively Paradox\n   </em>\n   infringes on Wakeman's own copyrighted works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (a) Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court begins by assessing Wakeman's likelihood of success on the merits of her copyright claim, because in deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, likelihood of success on the merits is the most significant factor.\n   <em>\n    Laclede Gas Co. v. St. Charles Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559814\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/413/#p419\">\n    713 F.3d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419-20 (8th Cir. 2013). A party seeking injunctive relief need not necessarily show a greater than 50 percent likelihood that it will prevail on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota v.

But the absence of a likelihood of success on the merits strongly suggests that preliminary injunctive relief should be denied.\n   <em>\n    Barrett v.

Filing 27 at 5-14. She argues that \"\n   <em>\n    Lively Paradox\n   </em>\n   violates the 'extrinsic test' by objectively stealing the expression, organization and application of certain ideas from Wakeman-copyrighted works.\" Filing 35 at 3. But the extrinsic test requires more than that: \"[t]he extrinsic inquiry is an objective one, looking to specific and external criteria of substantial similarity between the original elements (and only the original elements) of a protected work and an alleged copy.\"\n   <em>\n    Copeland v.

Wakeman argues that \"[w]hile the entirety of Wakeman's customer list was not, and is not, a trade secret-Wakeman promotes its work on behalf of some clients on its website-the nature of Wakeman's coaching and consulting business make disclosure of other clients' identities a confidential matter.\" Filing 27 at 25. So, those clients have entered into confidentiality agreements with Wakeman. Filing 28-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But even if those customer relationships are sufficiently secret, it is far from clear to the Court how they have independent economic value. Who, precisely, are the \"other persons\" to whom the relationships are unknown, but who \"can obtain economic value from [their] disclosure or use\"? Nebraska's statutory definition of \"trade secret\" is derived from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act \u00a7 1(4), 14 U.L.A. 537-38 (2005 &amp; Supp. 2017), and under that definition, the \"existence of a trade secret is determined by the value of a secret[.]\"\n   <em>\n    AvidAir Helicopter Supply, Inc. v.
