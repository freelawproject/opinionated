They have brought a purported class action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC (\"Sanofi\"), the manufacturer of both products, alleging that Sanofi improperly delayed the entry into the market of a competitive product manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company (\"Lilly\"). In their Amended Class Action Complaint, plaintiffs assert two claims under Section 2 of the Sherman Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )-one for monopolization and one for attempted monopolization. It is the plaintiffs' contention that Sanofi prolonged its monopoly for insulin glargine by (1) improperly listing six patents in the U.S. Federal Drug Administration's\n   <em>\n    Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations\n   </em>\n   (the \"Orange Book\") and (2) pursuing sham litigation against Lilly in which Sanofi asserted claims of patent infringement, allegedly without any basis. The litigation was settled by Sanofi and Lilly shortly before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the court on \"Defendant Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC's Motion\n   to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\" (Docket No. 21). Sanofi argues that the court should dismiss both counts of the Amended Complaint (Docket No. 10) (\"Am. Compl.\") pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to support a finding of antitrust liability against Sanofi for listing patents in the Orange Book unreasonably, or for engaging in sham litigation with Lilly. Therefore, and for the reasons detailed herein, Sanofi's Motion is ALLOWED and the Amended Complaint is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Overview\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sanofi is a life sciences company that sells, among other medicines, Lantus -an insulin glargine solution used for Type I and Type II diabetes.

At issue in this litigation is whether the patents for the Lantus SoloSTAR (including its components) are appropriately listed in the Orange Book as a \"drug product.\" While both parties rely on the Comments and FDA Response generated during rulemaking (as quoted above), the plaintiffs argue that the listing was improper because the patent did not \"claim[ ] the finished dosage form of the approved drug product\" and was just for packaging. Sanofi, on the other hand, argues that the listing was proper because the Lantus SoloSTAR is a \"pre-filled drug delivery device\" and the patent otherwise relates to an approved drug product. As detailed below, this court finds that while the issue of whether the Lantus SoloSTAR patent is appropriately listed in the Orange Book is an open question, Sanofi's interpretation is reasonable and, therefore, defeats the plaintiffs' antitrust claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lilly's Competing Product\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Lilly developed Basaglar, an insulin-glargine product similar to Sanofi's, which Lilly planned to use with its injector pen product KwikPen.

Am. Compl. \u00b6 127.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   note 6,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Given the clear instructions by the FDA that patents for packaging should not be listed, this allegation may have been sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. However, the record is now clear that the Lantus SoloSTAR was approved as a drug delivery system, and not merely as a package. Am. Compl. Ex. D. Therefore, further analysis is needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The FDA has expressly interpreted \"drug products\" which must be listed in the Orange Book to include \"pre-filled drug delivery systems.\" As the plaintiffs recognized in their Amended Complaint, Lantus SoloSTAR was, in fact, sold as a pre-filled drug delivery system. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 127-29. The FDA approval for the Lantus SoloSTAR also contemplated that it would be sold as a pre-filled drug delivery system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. D. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for Sanofi to believe that it should list the Lantus SoloSTAR, and its components, in the Orange Book.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, an argument can be made that listing the Lantus SoloSTAR and its components is consistent with the purposes of the Orange Book, which is to put others on notice of potentially relevant patents. As plaintiffs have alleged in the\n   Amended Complaint, Lilly's competitive products included both a drug and a drug delivery system. Therefore, the patents relating to the drug delivery system would be relevant to determining whether Lilly's products were subject to patent infringement claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   It is also significant that the Lantus SoloSTAR is clearly not just a package, or container to hold a drug, but rather is an integral part of the way insulin glargine can be used to treat diabetes. Therefore, while it may be debatable whether the Lantus SoloSTAR fits neatly into the category of patents that must be disclosed, it does not fit into the category of patents that must not be disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In arguing against the above conclusion, plaintiffs contend that the '864 patent should not have been listed in the Orange Book because the FDA stated in its Response to Comments quoted above that \"the key factor is whether the patent being submitted claims the finished dosage form of the approved drug product\" and there is no such \"claim\" in the '864 patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Moreover, even assuming such a \"claim\" must be made in the patent, it is not clear whether or not the \"claims\" of the '864 patent, which are for a drug delivery device which includes a dose dial sleeve and a dose limiting mechanism, among other things, are sufficient to satisfy any such requirement. In sum, regardless which party's interpretation would ultimately be accepted by the FDA, the plaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts to establish that Sanofi's decision to list the '864 patent in the Orange Book was unreasonable or objectively baseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that Sanofi is not alone in its interpretation of the FDA listing requirements. Sanofi has submitted publicly available evidence that on six different occasions from 2005 to 2012, companies have written to the FDA inquiring about the correct interpretation of the listing requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that there are no other relevant inquiries or responses that the court should consider. These inquiries show that the question asked of the FDA during its rulemaking comment period, i.e., should all patents for \"containers that are 'integral' to the drug product or require prior FDA approval\" be submitted to the Orange Book, remains unanswered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   note 5,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The FDA's \"clarification\" in response to these Comments left a significant ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Since at least 2005, drug manufacturers have sought to determine whether patents directed to drug delivery systems that do not recite the approved active ingredients or formulation should be listed in the Orange Book.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   note 10,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . In the absence of any response to several inquiries to the FDA, in 2007, AstraZeneca informed the FDA that it was going to continue to list in the Orange Book patents for approved pre-filled drug delivery systems even if the patent neither disclosed nor claimed the active ingredient or formulation of the approved drug product. Request for Advisory Opinion on behalf of AstraZeneca, Docket No. FDA-2007-A-0099 (June 21, 2007), available at\n   <em>\n    https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2007-A-0099-0003.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in 2009, GlaxoSmithKline (\"GSK\") wrote to the FDA informing the agency that \"in the absence of further guidance from the FDA, [GSK] has modified its Orange Book listing practice to list those patents ... that claim all or a portion of integrated drug-device products, regardless of whether the approved drug substance is specifically mentioned in the claims of such patents.\" Letter from GSK to FDA, Docket No. FDA-2005-A-0476 (Feb. 11, 2009), available at\n   <em>\n    https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2005-A-0476-0004\n   </em>\n   . In 2011, in response to an inquiry from Forest Laboratories, Inc., the FDA wrote that \"due to the need to address other Agency priorities,\" it \"has been unable to reach a decision\" on \"whether a patent that claims a drug delivery device whose use is integral to the administration of the active ingredient and the approval of the NDA, but that does not claim the active ingredient of the approved drug product, should be submitted for listing in [the Orange Book].\" Interim Response to Forest Laboratories, Inc., Docket No. FDA-2011-A-0363 (Nov. 7, 2011), available at\n   <em>\n    https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2011-A-0363-0008\n   </em>\n   . No further response was received from the FDA and, in 2012, Novo Nordisk again asked for an advisory opinion, and, like others before it, notified the FDA that it intended to list patents in the Orange Book for pre-filled drug delivery systems \"regardless of whether or not the patents disclose or claim the active ingredient or formulation of the approved drug product.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Request for Advisory Opinion, Docket No. FDA-2012-A-1169 (Nov. 26, 2012), available at\n   <em>\n    https://www.regulations.gov/ document?D=FDA-2012-A-1169-0001.\n   </em>\n   Again there was no response from the FDA. Thus, by the time of Lilly's Paragraph IV Certification, the FDA had been informed that a number of drug manufacturers were listing their drug delivery systems in the Orange Book, even if the relevant patents did not claim \"the finished dosage form of the approved drug product,\" but had not indicated that such a listing was improper. The fact that the FDA did not cite to its Response, but, rather, stated that \"it had been unable to reach a decision\" compels the conclusion that the question whether a patent for a delivery system must claim \"the finished dosage form of the approved drug product\" was not answered in the Response, and remains an open question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   While this court makes no determination as to the correct interpretation of the FDA Comments, it is clear from these requests that the issue whether the '864 patent should have been listed is an open question in the industry. For the reasons detailed herein, Sanofi's interpretation of the listing requirements was reasonable. The plaintiffs have pled no other facts that lead to the conclusion that Sanofi knew or should have known that its listing of the '864 patent was incorrect. Therefore, the Sherman Act claims, insofar as they rely on the improper Orange Book listing of the '864 patent, are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Sham Litigation Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that Sanofi sought to wrongfully extend its exclusionary period by \"[c]ommencing and maintaining a sham litigation against Lilly to delay introduction of competing insulin glargine products into the U.S. market.\" Am.

While this is not a prerequisite to a claim of sham litigation, it is not irrelevant: patents are presumed to be valid, and patent holders are entitled to enforce their rights under their patents, so parties claiming sham litigation must overcome these presumptions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United Food\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202837002\">\n     2017 WL 2837002\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *10 (\"The Court declines to adopt a bright-line rule requiring that a patent be invalidated or tarnished before a plaintiff can allege a sham litigation claim, but notes that it is difficult to conceive of a scenario in which a sham litigation claim would go forward without the patent having been invalidated or otherwise tarnished.\"). Moreover, with respect to the '864 patent, as detailed above, there was industry support for the proposition that such patents should be listed in the Orange Book. Thus, the fact that Sanofi sought to protect the '864 patent in the face of a Paragraph IV Certification is not obviously unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Moreover, the record in the underlying litigation establishes that Sanofi's contention that the KwikPen infringed on the '864 patent was not objectively baseless. As detailed above, the plaintiffs' assertion that there was no infringement is not supported by any facts in the Amended Complaint. In contrast, the parties in\n    <em>\n     Sanofi I\n    </em>\n    engaged in a claim construction dispute addressing various elements of the '864 patent. If Lilly's KwikPen was completely different, and bore no relationship to the Lantus SoloSTAR (as plaintiffs allege) there would have been no reason for Lilly to have participated in a claims construction exercise. Instead, both Lilly and Sanofi proposed different interpretations of various elements of the '864 patent, and the court adopted and rejected some of each of the parties' suggestions.\n    <em>\n     See Sanofi I\n    </em>\n    , Docket No. 192. The record does not support the conclusion that Sanofi should have known that there was no way that Lilly's KwikPen could be found to have infringed on Sanofi's product.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The fact that the underlying litigation was heavily contested, while not conclusive, also weighs against a finding that the litigation was a sham. The '864 patent was litigated for over a year and a half before the parties came to a settlement agreement on the eve of trial. The docket indicates an active and hard-fought dispute. The sham litigation exception to the\n    <em>\n     Noerr - Pennington\n    </em>\n    immunity was not intended to provide all third parties with an opportunity to re-litigate cases. Rather, the doctrine is reserved for those cases where plaintiffs can assert facts showing that the patent suit was objectively meritless.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     AstraZeneca AB\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202079722\">\n     2010 WL 2079722\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (finding that the underlying lawsuit was \"hard-fought and close\" and that such an \"outcome hardly bespeaks baseless litigation.\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9055384\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/289/986/#p992\">\n     289 F.Supp.2d at 995\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"... to avoid turning every patent case into an antitrust case, some threshold of plausibility must be crossed at the outset before a patent antitrust case should be permitted to go into its inevitably costly and protracted discovery phase ... an infringement suit must be adjudged to be objectively baseless before it can be considered an unlawful method of competition ...\").

However, Sanofi points to the fact that it is going to be paid royalties from Lilly in connection with the sale of Lilly's products, and that the settlement delayed Lilly's entry into the market until December 2016. Given the existence of the royalty payments, and the delayed entry into the market, it cannot be said that the settlement was so insignificant that the underlying litigation was obviously a sham. Rather, the fact of the settlement helps defeat a finding that the litigation was objectively baseless.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In light of the plaintiffs' failure to establish that the litigation was objectively baseless, this court need not address the second prong of the sham litigation test.

Since Sanofi was entitled to bring its patent litigation against Lilly due to the '864 patent, Sanofi was entitled to the 30 month delay in Lilly's entry into the market.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    \"An antitrust plaintiff must prove a causal connection between the antitrust violation and actual damages suffered.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201657734\">\n     2012 WL 1657734\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *33 (E.D.P.A.

Plaintiffs have alleged harm due to \"artificially-inflated\" prices for insulin glargine products between February of 2015, when the '722 Patent expired, and December 2016, when Lilly was permitted to sell Basaglar pursuant to the\n    <em>\n     Sanofi I\n    </em>\n    settlement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    As explained above, plaintiffs have not pled facts showing that the listing of the '864 patent in the Orange Book was unreasonable, or that the litigation enforcing the '864 patent was a sham. Thus, the '864 patent stood as a lawful bar to Lilly's market entry for as long as it remained in effect, unless otherwise agreed. The '864 patent was set to expire in 2024. Regardless of the anticompetitive harm caused by the formulation and other pen patents on which plaintiffs have sued in the instant case, the '864 patent stood as a lawful bar to entry during the period of alleged harm.
