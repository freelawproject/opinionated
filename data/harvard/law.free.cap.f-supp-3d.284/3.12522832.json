He further contends that after he filed discrimination complaints, WMATA retaliated by burdening him with unfair responsibilities, placing him on a Performance Improvement Plan, giving him poor performance evaluations, and ultimately terminating his employment, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mindful of these standards, I conclude that judgment as a matter of law is not appropriate at this juncture, because at least two material factual disputes preclude summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The first genuine dispute of material fact is whether Tara Wasiak, a Caucasian woman who was the incoming Director of Storerooms and Material Logistics, was at least partially motivated by racial bias when the decision was made to hire Timothy St. John, a white male, rather than Mr. Allison, who is African-American. On this point, WMATA points to Mr. Allison's so-so performance during the first round of interviews, after which Vyron Johnson-an African-American man who at the time served as the hiring manager, Mr. Allison's second-line supervisor, and the Director of Storerooms and Material Logistics-told Mr. Allison, \"Jerry, that wasn't your best interview,\" and his poor performance in the second round, when he scored the lowest of three candidates. Mot. Summ. J. 7, WMATA's St. Mat. Facts. However, a reasonable jury could potentially find that Mr. Allison was better-qualified for the Warehouse Manager role that Mr. St. John: although Mr. St. John had extensive experience in logistics and a bachelor's degree, Mr. Allison had extensive experience in the specific field of warehouse management for transit authorities, and had even served as WMATA's acting Warehouse Manager. Mot. Summ. J. ECF # 20-27, 20-28. Even more importantly, I cannot say as a matter of law that a reasonable jury could not draw an inference of discrimination from the optics of the hiring process. After the two African-American members of the hiring panel (Mr. Johnson and Raphael \"Ray\" Alfred, an African-American man) prepared and signed Mr. Allison's selection letter, the panel's only white member did not sign the letter and thereby select Mr. Allison, then the highest-scoring interviewee. Instead, Ms. Wasiak waited until Mr. Johnson retired, whereupon she became the hiring manager, and opened the interview process to outside candidates. After interviewing these candidates with a two-member panel-in violation of a WMATA policy requiring consistent panels, Opp. Ex. J-Ms. Wasiak ultimately selected Mr. St. John. Although Ms. Wasiak has a track record of hiring minority candidates, a reasonable jury could draw an adverse inference from the fact that Ms. Wasiak denies knowledge of the selection memo that both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Alfred remember,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Opp. Ex. G 48:09-11\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Opp. Ex. E 34:19-35:05 and Opp. Ex. R at 24:10-13, and from the fact that another WMATA employee has filed race, religion, age, and national origin discrimination claims against Ms.\n   Wasiak. Mot. for Leave to File, Exs. AB, AC.0F\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, WMATA has not shown that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The second genuine dispute of material fact is whether WMATA's actions in assigning Mr. Allison the Midlife Overhaul Program, giving him negative performance reviews, placing him in a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), and ultimately terminating him were motivated by a desire to retaliate for his discrimination claims. \"To prove retaliation, the plaintiff generally must establish that he or she suffered (i) a materially adverse action (ii) because he or she had brought or threatened to bring a discrimination claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Baloch v. Kempthorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575311,5742599\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1191/\">\n    550 F.3d 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1198 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). A factfinder could easily find that these were innocent decisions, reasoning that the Midlife Overhaul Program was a reasonable assignment, and that Mr. Allison was terminated for poor job performance. But I cannot say that a reasonable jury could not also conclude that Mr. St. John (and Ms. Wasiak) were already aware of Mr. Allison's allegations, and they retaliated by building a case against Mr. Allison that would provide cover for firing him. Before Mr. St. John became his supervisor, Mr. Allison had consistently received positive performance reviews. Opp. Ex. A. But after Mr. Allison filed race discrimination claims with both WMATA and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in November 2014, Mr. St. John assigned Mr. Allison to manage the Midlife Overhaul Program in February 2015, Mr. Allison began receiving consistently poor performance reviews, and he was eventually terminated in June 2016. Mot. Summ. J. Exs. 15, 18, 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In particular, it is unclear at this stage whether Mr. St. John and/or Ms. Wasiak were aware of Mr. Allison's pending EEO complaints at the time of the assignment of the Midlife Overhaul Program. Mr. Allison testified that when he spoke with Mr. St. John about the EEOC complaint, Mr. St. John said that \"he was already aware,\" Opp. Ex. B at 130:15-131:9, and that the only justification Mr. St. John gave for the assignment at the time, was that \"Tara [Wasiak] supports me giving this to you.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129:18-21. Although significant evidence supports a nondiscriminatory interpretation of Mr. Allison's treatment, \"a factfinder could infer intentional discrimination\" on the evidence presented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11980554,3706563\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/116/876/\">\n    116 F.3d at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
