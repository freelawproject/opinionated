Plaintiffs contend that Defendant has engaged in deceptive acts in connection with the marketing and sale of its Kirkland Signature Premium\n   Chunk Chicken Breast (\"Kirkland Canned Chicken\"). Defendant now moves to dismiss Plaintiff's amended class action complaint (\"Amended Complaint\") pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Defendant argues that the Amended Complaint must be dismissed because (1) Plaintiffs' claims are preempted by federal law; (2) Plaintiffs cannot utilize a state law claim as a vehicle to privately enforce a federal statute that lacks a private right of action; and (3) no reasonable consumer would be misled by the plain language of the packaging and label of Kirkland Canned Chicken.

Accordingly, the following facts are taken from the Amended Complaint and exhibits attached thereto or incorporated by reference therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant is a Washington corporation that, together with its subsidiaries, operates membership warehouses throughout the country offering a range of branded and private-label products, including its house brand, Kirkland Signature. Defendant sells Kirkland Canned Chicken in its membership warehouse stores. (Am. Compl. (ECF No. 1) \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12.) The cans are grouped for sale in packages of six 12.5 ounce cans, each slightly more than two inches tall and four inches in diameter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14.) Each package is covered by an opaque plastic wrapper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) The front of the bulk packaging reads, in large font, \"Premium Chunk CHICKEN BREAST.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Below, in smaller font, are the phrases \"Packed in Water\" and \"Extra Lean.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the very bottom of this side of the packaging the net weight of the cans is listed as \"NET WT 6-12.5 OZ (354g) CANS TOTAL 4.6 LB (2.1kg).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On the reverse side, the bulk packaging includes a Nutrition Facts panel and suggested recipes for the canned chicken. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) The Nutrition Facts panel includes, in bolded font, the phrase \"Nutrition Facts\" and immediately below, in smaller, non-bolded font the phrases \"Serving Size 2 oz drained (56g)\" and \"Servings Per Container About 21.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The individual labels on each can are not visible in the bulk package prior to purchase, but each can is covered with a front label containing the product name in large font, and immediately to left of the name in smaller font the terms \"Packed in Water\" and \"Extra Lean.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) At the bottom of each front label the net weight of the individual can is listed as \"NET WT 12.5 OZ (354g).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Each can also has a back label listing Nutrition Facts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Immediately beneath the bolded phrase \"Nutrition Facts,\" in smaller, non-bolded font are the phrases \"Serving Size 2 oz drained (56g)\" and \"Servings Per Container About 3.5.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant provides members of its warehouse stores with a calculation of the unit price for its Kirkland Canned Chicken,\n   which allegedly \"allows customers to compare the price of its product with a competitor's chicken on a per pound basis...[T]he unit price provided by [Defendant] is calculated using the gross weight of the contents, which includes chicken and water.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   An opened can of Kirkland Canned Chicken reveals chicken covered by a layer of water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) If the consumer drains the 2/3 of a cup of water that the can contains, she is left with between seven and eight ounces of meat, meaning that as much as 44% of the weight of the can's contents is water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.) According to the Amended Complaint, the consumer receives little benefit from the water in the can and Defendant does not intend for consumers to use the water, as evidenced by the recipes Defendant includes with each bulk package, which direct consumers to drain the chicken before using it in a dish. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff La Vigne, Plaintiff Hessler, and Plaintiff Hogan purchased Kirkland Canned Chicken from Defendant at warehouse locations in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, respectively, for between $10.99 and $11.99 per bulk package. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23, 25.) They allege that they \"reasonably believed that they were purchasing a package that contained an adequate amount of chicken in each can because of the misrepresentations on the label, the packaging, the price label on the shelf, the unit pricing, the other materials included with the package, and the size of the can.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) However, upon using the chicken to prepare meals, each Plaintiff allegedly came to learn that she had received a product with \"substantially less chicken than should have been in the can.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs admit that they received the amount of chicken indicated under the Nutrition Facts label on the back of the bulk packaging and on the back label of each can, i.e., 42 ounces divided among six cans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs support their claim that Kirkland Canned Chicken, as labeled, contains too much water and not enough chicken largely through their invocation of federal standards for the marketing of chicken products. Specifically, the Poultry Products Inspection Act (\"PPIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20451\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 72, authorizes regulations relating to the disclosure of the amount of water in canned chicken products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20381.157\">\n    9 C.F.R. \u00a7 381.157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Plaintiffs, these regulations state that \"if the poultry meat is only between 50% and 80% with 20% to 50% water or broth, then the product name must disclose the percentage of water or broth.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 18.) They further claim that Kirkland Canned Chicken does not comply with this requirement since each can, when opened subsequent to purchase, contains less than 80% chicken, even though the product name does not disclose the percentage of water in the can. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Put simply, Plaintiffs allege, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, that Defendant's conduct violates the PPIA and misleads consumers into believing that they are being charged \"a reasonable price to pay for chicken\" when they buy cans of Kirkland Canned Chicken, even though almost half of the contents of each can is water, and that such conduct constitutes \"an unconscionable and deceptive commercial practice\" in violation of consumer protection laws in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-62.)

Second, it argues that Plaintiffs' claims are precluded to the extent they are predicated on violations of the PPIA, which lacks a private right of action (Def.'s Mem. 10-14.)

Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant reasons that because Plaintiffs' challenges to the representations on the Kirkland Canned Chicken label fall within the express preemption clause of the PPIA and the FSIS has preapproved the challenged label, Plaintiffs' state law claims are expressly preempted. (Def.'s Mem. 10.) The Court, noting that Plaintiffs also fail to allege a violation of applicable federal law, agrees that Plaintiffs' labeling-related claims are preempted under the facts alleged. In addressing this argument, the Court will begin by describing the relevant statutory and regulatory framework controlling the labeling of poultry products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1. Regulatory Scheme\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under the PPIA, Congress granted the USDA the authority to regulate the distribution and sale of poultry products shipped in interstate commerce by ensuring, among other things, that poultry products are \"properly marked, labeled, and packaged.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20451\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The relevant requirement in this case states: \"Canned boned poultry, except poultry within paragraph (c) of this section,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   shall meet the requirements set forth in Table II.

Table II, in turn, contains a list of percentages specifying the minimum amount of meat and maximum amount of liquid a canned chicken product may contain for each of four categories and, alongside each category's percentages, the naming requirements for products falling into each specified range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20381.157\">\n    9 C.F.R. \u00a7 381.157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

Instead, Plaintiffs challenge the FSIS review itself because they claim that \"any determination by FSIS through the pre-market label review program that Kirkland Canned Chicken meets [the federal standard in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20381.157\">\n    9 C.F.R. \u00a7 381.157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with the regulation\" and that the FSIS review process \"does not have sufficient indications of reliability to justify judicial deference to any finding\" that the\n   label complies with the regulation. (Pls.' Opp'n 11-12.) This argument is unavailing as it is unpersuasive and unsupported by authority. Further, this Court disagrees with Plaintiffs' assertion that Defendant's conduct, as alleged in the Amended Complaint, is inconsistent with the federal regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because Plaintiffs claim that Defendant's label is misleading is based on its presentation of information disclosing the contents of Kirkland Canned Chicken, a jury's finding for Plaintiffs would directly conflict with the FSIS's assessment, in which case it would introduce requirements in addition to or different from those imposed by the PPIA and its corresponding regulations. Thus, while FSIS review and approval may not be an impenetrable barrier to state law deceptive practice claims, under the circumstances presented here, the FSIS review of Kirkland Canned Chicken's label is entitled to preemptive effect. The Court notes further that even if it were to limit the preemptive scope of the FSIS review in this case, the result would not change. Based on the allegations in the Amended Complaint, the success of Plaintiffs' state law claims is dependent on a showing that Defendant should have made disclosures on its label that were affirmatively not required under federal regulations. Therefore, even without considering the FSIS review, Plaintiffs' state law claims impose requirements different from or additional to federal requirements regulating canned chicken and are preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   However, preemption does not bar Plaintiffs' state law claims to the extent that they are not based on labeling-related allegations. While Plaintiffs devote much of their attention in the pleadings to Kirkland Canned Chicken's labeling deficiencies, they also incorporate assertions related to \"the packaging, the price label on the shelf, the unit pricing [on a separate shelf label showing the price per ounce of the product], the other materials included with the package, and the size of the can,\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 27.) Insofar as Plaintiffs' challenges to these aspects of Defendant's marketing practices do not implicate the FSIS-approved labeling, they are not preempted and survive at this stage of the Court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Private Right of Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant argues that \"[b]ecause Plaintiffs' claims are predicated on violations of the labeling regulations promulgated pursuant to the PPIA, those claims thwart Congress's intent in enacting the PPIA, where it purposefully refused to provide a private right of action.\" (Def. Mem. 11.) As Plaintiffs' labeling-related claims are disposed of on other grounds, the Court need not address the merits of this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because Plaintiffs' labeling-related claims are preempted, Plaintiffs can bring their state law claims only if their remaining allegations with regard to packaging size and Defendant's use of a shelf label calculating unit price are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Plaintiffs' state law claims ultimately fail on the merits because Plaintiff cannot plausibly state that Defendant's alleged practices rendered Kirkland Canned Chicken's label false or misleading under the applicable standards of consumer protection laws in New York, Pennsylvania, or Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Here, the front of each can of Kirkland Canned Chicken is labeled to clearly indicate that it contains canned chicken \"packed in water.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 18.) The label also displays the net weight per can of the enclosed product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) This net weight is presumably used to calculate the unit pricing per ounce of product, as listed on a separate shelf label.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Furthermore, the back of a package of Kirkland Canned Chicken clearly states the total servings of chicken available in each package after the water has been drained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Given the clear disclosure on the bulk packaging and each individual can that the chicken is packed in water, as well as the indication under the Nutrition Facts label that a serving of the product is calculated on a \"drained\" weight basis, it seems clear that a reasonable consumer would understand a can of Kirkland Canned Chicken to contain both chicken and some amount of water. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs apparently did not rely on the disclosures on the packaging, which they agree accurately convey the contents of the product, in making their purchases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1 (noting that each can \"contains slightly more than seven ounces of chicken,\" in accordance\n   with the information on the label).) Rather, they allege that the size of the product containers and the unit pricing label based on net weight led them to expect that they were purchasing a \"substantial\" amount of chicken. Plaintiffs provide no basis for ignoring the plain language on Kirkland Canned Chicken's packaging, or for assuming that the unit pricing labels were based on the net weight of the chicken alone rather than the total contents of the cans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Having considered Plaintiff La Vigne's allegations in the context of the entire Kirkland Canned Chicken package, including its label, the Court finds as a matter of law that the size of the cans and the unit pricing label would not have misled the reasonable consumer.

However, as discussed above, the cans' labels clearly stated that the chicken was packed in water. The back of each label also accurately disclosed the amount of drained chicken product in each can. Plaintiffs provide no basis for ignoring these disclosures, nor do they dispute that they received the amount of chicken indicated on the package labels. Furthermore, they have made no assertion that the unit pricing labels, which are calculated on the basis of a product's net weight, were incorrect with regard to the total contents of a can of Kirkland Canned Chicken. Thus, Plaintiff Hessler fails to allege a misrepresentation in satisfaction of the first element of a Section 202-2(4)(v) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(vii)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Subsection 201-2(4)(vii) defines \"unfair methods of competition\" and \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" to include \"[r]epresenting that goods are of a particular standard, quality or grade, or that goods are of a particular style or model, if they are of another.\" 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(vii).
