Trageser appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint alleging that the termination of her employment at Libbie Rehabilitation Center constituted handicap discrimination in violation of \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We affirm because \u00a7 120(a) of the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services Amendments of 1978 forecloses her claim under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and lack of governmental action precludes recovery on the other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b159-23\">Libbie, a private corporation, operates a nursing home for profit in Richmond, Vir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ginia. It receives substantial income from the state and federal governments in the form of Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, and welfare payments. The purpose of these payments is to compensate for treatment of specified patients who are entitled to the benefits. The home is subject t\u00f3 inspection by the Virginia Department of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Trageser, a registered nurse, was hired in 1971 and promoted to director of nurses in 1975. Her sight is impaired by a condition known as retinitis pigmentosa, which is hereditary and progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On April 28,1976, the certification officer from the Virginia Department of Health conducted a regular inspection of the nursing home. The inspector told the administrator of the home that Trageser\u2019s eyesight had deteriorated since the last inspection and asked what the home intended to do about it. The administrator relayed these comments to the board of directors. At its meeting on June 7,1976, the' board resolved to dismiss her. Upon learning of this decision, Trageser resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Trageser then brought this action seeking reinstatement, back pay, and an injunction against payment of federal financial assistance to the home unless she was reinstated. The district court treated the termination of her employment as tantamount to discharge, but it granted Libbie\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See Trageser v. Libbie Rehabilitation Center, </em>16 E.P.D. \u00b6 8117, 17 F.E.P. Cases 398 (E.D.Va.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Trageser bases her claim on_\u00a7_ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act-of \u2014 1973<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-15\">No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">In \u00a7 120(a) of the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services Amendments of 1978, Congress added, among other provisions, \u00a7 505(a)(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-18\">The remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be available to any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance or Federal provider of such assistance under \u00a7 504 of this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-19\">Title VI contains the prototype of \u00a7 50\u00cd of the Rehabilitation Act. <em>See Lloyd v. Regional Transportation Authority, </em>548 F.2d 1277, 1280 and n.9 (7th Cir. 1977). Section 601 of Title VI<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6I\">No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-20\">The broad prohibition of \u00a7 601 is, however, qualified by \u00a7 604,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which creates the following limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-21\">Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed to authorize action under this subchapter by any department or agency with respect to any employment practice of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization except where a primary objective of the Federal , financial assistance is to provide employ-/ ment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Although \u00a7 604 expressly curtails the authority of federal departments and agencies, it also restricts private_suits. Thus, because of \u00a7 604, Title VI doqp not provide a judicial remedy for employment discrimination by institutions receiving federal funds unless (1) providing employment is a primary objective of the federal aid,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or (2) discrimination in employment necessarily causes discrimination against the primary beneficiaries of the federal aid.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXc\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides the primary statutory remedies for racial and ethnic discrimination in employment. Recognizing this, Congress supplemented the Rehabilitation Act by including in \u00a7 120(a) of the 1978 amendments a new subsection 505(a)(1)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which makes the pertinent remedies, procedures, and rights of Title VII available to federal employees who complain of handicap discrimination in employment in violation of \u00a7 501 of the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Congress also could have utilized Title VII to define the rights and remedies of a person in Trageser\u2019s position who must rely on \u00a7 504. Instead, for \u00a1employees of private institutions receiving (federal financial aid, \u00a7 120(a) of the 1978 amendments makes available only the remedies, procedures, and rights of Title VI, which, as we have noted above, contains the restriction of \u00a7 604. The distinction that \u00a7 120(a) draws between the relief available to federal employees and that available to j employees of private institutions receiving (federal assistance could not have been inadvertent. We therefore conclude that we must apply the limitation contained in $ 604 \u00bff.Title yi.io_\u00a7_5il4^i_the_Rfihabilita\u00b1ion__ Act in literal_.complianc.p..Jivi120(a) of thelOl^aniendments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">We cannot accept Trageser\u2019s contention that the 1978 amendments are inapplicable to her 1976 dismissal. We must decide this case in accordance with the law as it exists at the time we render our decision \u201c \u2018unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 76-77, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 2087, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975). In the absence of legislative history to the contrary, the explicit incorporation of \u00a7 604 of Title VI simply confirms a plausible reading of \u00a7 504 as originally enacted. <em>See, e. g., </em>Guy, The Developing Law on Equal Employment Opportunity for the Handicapped: An Overview and Analysis of the Major Issues, 7 U.Balt.L.Rev. 183, 207 (1978). We therefore find no manifest injustice in applying the amendments to illuminate this case which was pending when they were enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">A private action under \u00a7 504 to redress employment discrimination therefore may not be maintained unless a primary_..obj\u00a3fir,'' tive of the federal financial assistance is to <em>f </em>provide employment,^ There has been no] such allegation in this case; nor could there be one. Viewing the complaint in the light most favorable to Trageser, in compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>12(b)(6), we nevertheless hold that she cannot prevail on her \u00a7 504 claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">I\u00cdI</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Trageser also based her complaint \"'on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the fourteenth amendment, and the equal protection component of the due process clause in the fifth junendment. We conclude, however, that the district court correctly granted Libbie\u2019s motion to dismiss these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Section 1983 requires Trageser to show that Libbie acted under color of either a state law or regulation or a state-enforced custom. <em>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 148, 161-69, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). To establish a denial of , equal. protection of the laws in violation of the fifth and_fourteenth amendment&amp;, Trageser is required to do more than merely allege governmental regulation of the nursing home. She must demonstrate that Libbie\u2019s ostensibly private conduct was in reality an act of either the state or federal government. There must exist \u201ca sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 453, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974). To satisfy this requirement, Trageser relies on (1) Libbie's receipt of public funds and (2) the state inspector\u2019s role in Libbie\u2019s decision to dismiss her.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">.Libbie did not participate in the Hill-Burton construction program which \"subjects hospitals to an elaborate and intricate pattern of governmental regulations, both state and federal.\u201d <em>See Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, </em>323 F.2d 959, 964 (4th Cir. 1963). Consequently, our decision in <em>Simkins </em>which detected state action in the operation of participating hospitals does not control here. Moreover, we have previously held that the receipt of Medicaid funds does not conv\u00e9rt'privateln\u00e9dical' c to state action. <em>Walker v. Pierce, </em>560 F.2d 609 (4th Cir. 1977). For similar reasons, we decline to ascribe state action to Libbie\u2019s receipt of Medicare and Veterans Administration benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">To show state action, Trageser also relies on the query of the state inspector who, noting that her eyesight had deteriorated, asked what Libbie intended to do about it. The inspector did not include this observation about Trageser among the deficiencies found at the home, and Trageser does not allege that the state would or could impose any sanctions on Libbie if it continued to employ her. Libbie\u2019s subsequent decision to dismiss her, therefore, cannot be considered an action of the state itself. <em>See Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Consequently, neither Libbie\u2019s receipt of patients\u2019 benefits nor Virginia\u2019s regulation of the home constitutes state action sufficient to sustain the \u00a7 1983 and constitutional claims.-</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\">.
