We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">I. <em>Statement of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">On April 29, 1974, Forman pleaded guilty in Nevada state court to an information charging illegal sale of cocaine and received a sentence of fifteen years in Nevada state prison. Two years later the Nevada Supreme Court held that the statute under which Forman had been prosecuted required the prosecution to allege and prove the defendant\u2019s age as an essential element of the crime. <em>Hass v. State, </em>92 Nev. 256, 548 P.2d 1367 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">Forman then filed a petition for habeas corpus in Nevada state district court, claiming that the state had failed to allege his age in its information. The state court ordered Forman\u2019s unconditional release. The state of Nevada appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court. Noting that it overruled <em>Hass </em>that very day in <em>State v. Wright, </em>92 Nev. 734, 558 P.2d 1139 (1976), the Nevada Supreme Court reversed the granting of habeas relief. <em>Warden v. Forman, </em>92 Nev. 739, 558 P.2d 1141 (1976). The state district court ordered Forman remanded to custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">Forman then filed a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in federal district court, claiming that his remand into custody violated the ex post facto and double jeopardy provisions of the United States Constitution. From the district court\u2019s denial of those claims Forman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">II. <em>Ex Post Facto Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-19\">The ex post facto clause limits the powers of the legislature and does not of its own force apply to the judicial branch. <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 191, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977). Nonetheless, the courts have recognized that the principle of fair warning underlying the ex post facto clause limits the retroactive application of judicial decisions. <em>Marks, </em>430 U.S. at 191, 97 S.Ct. 990; <em>Bouie v. Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 350-51, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964). In <em>Bouie, </em>for example, the Supreme Court found that defendants had been denied due process when convicted under an unforeseeable interpretation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>state trespass statute which deprived them of \u201cthe fair warning to which the Constitution entitles\u201d them. <em>Id. </em>at 354, 84 S.Ct. at 1703.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Forman, by contrast, has not been punished under an unforeseeable construction which prevented fair warning. In <em>Wright </em>the Nevada Supreme Court simply reinstated the law as it had been at the time Forman was arrested. Thus, at the time he performed the illegal act, Forman had adequate warning of the prohibited conduct as defined both at that time and after <em>Wright. </em>Indeed, at the time he did the illegal deed, the only construction of which Forman was not put on notice was that enunciated in the short-lived <em>Hass </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">III. <em>Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Our decision in <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>554 F.2d 938 (9th Cir. 1977), belies appellant\u2019s double jeopardy contention. A jury had found Rojas guilty of the crime charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court thereafter set aside the jury\u2019s verdict. We held that the Government could appeal the court\u2019s acquittal, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">[I]t is the possibility of a second trial with its attendant \u201cembarrassment, expense and ordeal,\u201d which the [double jeopardy] clause was designed to prevent. [Citations omitted.] This potential danger of a second trial is not present, however, in a situation such as this where the district court grants a posttrial motion for judgment of acquittal . . . and thereby sets aside the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. In this situation, a successful government appeal will not result in the defendant\u2019s required subjection to a second trial, but rather will merely cause reinstatement of the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. Since no further factfinding proceedings will be necessary upon reversal and remand, the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy interests are not implicated by the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 941 (footnotes omitted). Finding that the district judge had erred in granting the dismissal, we remanded to the district court to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Here too there was a resolution of guilt followed by a determination that under applicable law defendant was not guilty. In both cases this latter determination was later reversed by a higher court. Thus <em>Rojas </em>compels the conclusion that the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the grant of habeas relief did not violate the double jeopardy protection of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\">. In <em>Rojas </em>we noted that \u201c[t]here of course is no question that jeopardy had already \u2018attached\u2019 in this case at the time the jury was impaneled and sworn.\u201d 554 F.2d at 941 n. 3. We assume <em>arguendo </em>that jeopardy had attached when Forman entered his guilty plea. If it did not, Forman\u2019s double jeopardy interests would of course not be implicated. <em>Compare Bell v. Wainright, </em>476 F.2d 964, 965 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1000, 94 S.Ct. 352, 38 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) <em>with United States v. Jerry, </em>487 F.2d 600, 606 (3rd Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
