The Commission\u2019s Broadcast Bureau ruled that such taped broadcast would create \u201can obligation by the licensee, to afford \u2018equal opportunities\u2019 to all legally qualified candidates for the office in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1031. The Commission, however, citing the need to preserve \u201cconsiderable discretion in the presentation of news programming,\u201d reversed the Broadcast Bureau.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The FCC opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>stressed the broadcaster\u2019s responsibility to judge whether delayed broadcast of such a public event would be justified by the event\u2019s \u201ccurrent newsworthiness.\u201d The FCC stated that length of delay would be \u201ca factor in determining the broadcaster\u2019s reasonableness and good faith,\u201d adding, \u201cabsent unusual circumstances, a delay of-more than a day would raise questions\u201d as to the broadcast\u2019s eligibility for a \u00a7 315(a)(4) exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 1032-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Petitioner, in challenging the FCC decision, contends that the Commission erred (I) in interpreting the \u201con-the-spot\u201d exemption to cover the broadcast of taped political events; and (II) in adopting this interpretation in an adjudication of a particular case rather than in a rulemaking proceeding with provision for notice and comment. We affirm the FCC\u2019s- decision against both claims. ^</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">I. THE CONSTRUCTION OF \u00a7 315(a)(4)</p>\n<p id=\"ATx\">A. <em>The Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">Section 315(a) establishes four exemptions to the equal opportunities requirement, determined according to type of news coverage: (1) regularly scheduled newscasts, (2) news interview shows, (3) news documentaries, and (4) on-the-spot coverage of news events.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By modifying all four categories with the phrase ' \u201cbona fide,\u201d Congress plainly emphasized its reliance on newsworthiness as the basis for an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-15\">Section 315(a)(4) exempts a broadcast licensee from an equal time obligation if any candidates appear in \u201con-the-spot coverage of bona fide news events (including but not limited to political conventions and activities incidental thereto).\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(a)(4) (1970). The central ambiguity in the provision is the meaning of the phrase \u201con-the-spot.\u201d Petitioner insists that the term refers to events broadcast \u201cas they happen, i. e., on the spot.\u201d Reply Brief of Petitioner, at 9. Respondents, citing submissions by intervenors from the broadcast industry, contend that the phrase is a \u201cterm of art\u201d in the industry that refers \u201cprimarily to the location of the news coverage rather than to the time it was broadcast.\u201d Brief for Respondents, at 7. This view contrasts on-the-spot coverage with in-studio broadcasts, and suggests that there is no temporal content to the statutory phrase.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the FCC did not directly address the precise meaning of the term in the decision under review here, in a subsequent case the Commission held that the language refers to \u201ccontemporary, if not simulta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>neous, broadcast\u201d of news events. <em>John F. Donato, </em>66 F.C.C.2d 599, 601 (1977). This interpretation underlies the Commission\u2019s view that broadcasts delayed up to one day are presumptively exempt from the equal opportunities obligation, but that longer delays are less likely to qualify for the exemption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">Some light is shed on the meaning of the phrase \u201con-the-spot coverage\u201d by the statute\u2019s use of political conventions as a paradigm for such coverage, and by the shared characteristics of the parallel exemptions granted in \u00a7 315(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">The exemption in question developed in some measure from a congressional desire to protect news coverage of national political conventions from the equal time doctrine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That Congress intended the exemption to reach more broadly, however, is clear from its inclusion of news events other than conventions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although much convention coverage is ordinarily presented live, the use of taped or filmed segments on such broadcasts is common, suggesting that on-the-spot coverage is not necessarily limited to live broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">In addition, the other exempt news shows \u2014 regular newscasts, documentaries, and news interviews \u2014 make liberal use of previously recorded material. Admittedly, the term \u201con-the-spot\u201d connotes an element of timeliness or newsworthiness. Nevertheless, it seems most unlikely that, in the absence of more specific language, Congress would have singled out on-the-spot coverage for a complete prohibition on the use of taped material. Since distorted treatment of candidates is equally possible in all four categories of exemptions, congressional concern that broadcasters might play favorites among political candidates provides no basis for distinguishing on-the-spot coverage from the other three categories.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">B. <em>The Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-13\">The exemptions to \u00a7 315\u2019s requirement of equal broadcast opportunities were enacted in 1959, immediately following a controversial FCC decision requiring broadcasters to provide equal time if a regular newscast contained coverage of a political candidate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The purpose of the legislative action, taken before court review of the FCC decision,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was to reverse the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>construction of the equal opportunities requirement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Congress feared that the Commission policy would deter broadcast licensees from covering political news by inspiring \u201ca parade of aspirants\u201d to seek free air time following any coverage of political campaigns.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">Under the 1959 Amendments, the equal opportunities doctrine was tempered by the conviction that broadcasters should have greater freedom to perform their professional function of informing the public on current issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">Thus, it is necessary, in the public interest, to achieve a balance between substantial equality of opportunity of political candidates on the one hand, and the need, on the other hand, of broadcasters to be free from unreasonable restraints in the exercise of their news judgment insofar as the appearance of political candidates is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">H.R.Rep.No. 802, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 4-5 (1959).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The automatic equal time provision was supplanted by a legislative directive to balance the competing interests of equal treatment of candidates and full coverage of political questions. Congress recognized that striking a proper balance would be difficult, but insisted that \u201c[t]he difficulties which lie in the path of achieving such a balance should not be magnified to an extent where either of these principles is lost sight of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-12\">The decision to favor political discussion was made despite Congressional fears that broadcasters might abuse their position by favoring particular candidates.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Senate Report dealt directly with this problem. Arguing that \u201c[t]he public should not be deprived of the benefits that flow from this dynamic form of communications during the critical times of a political campaign,\u201d the Report concluded, \u201cThe public benefits [of political news coverage] are so great that they outweigh the risk that may result from the favoritism that may be shown by some partisan broadcasters.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-13\">Still, Congress was not resigned to unrestrained favoritism in the broadcast coverage of political campaigns when it amended \u00a7 315. In the first instance, it relied on the professional standards of journalistic integrity \u2014 on \u201cthe maturity of our broadcasters\u201d and their commitment \u201cto serve the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Congress, however, also called upon the Commission to develop and enforce the policy articulated in the 1959 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-14\">It is difficult to define with precision what is a newscast, news interview, news documentary, or on-the-spot coverage of news event or panel discussion. That is why the committee in adopting the language of the proposed legislation carefully gave the Federal Communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>Commission full flexibility and complete discretion to examine the facts in each complaint .</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">Based on [its expertise in broadcast regulation] and other information that it is in a position to develop, the Commission can set down some definite guidelines through rules and regulations and wherever possible by interpretations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">By responding to particular complaints of unequal treatment, and by reviewing such complaints in license renewal proceedings, the FCC was to monitor broadcasting practices.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> And the Senate Report took pains to point out the broadcasts qualifying for a \u00a7 315 exemption would still be subject to the Communication Act\u2019s \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard, and would have to provide fair and objective presentation of issues.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">C. <em>The FCC Did Not Exceed Its Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">The foregoing discussion indicates both that the statute does not on its face preclude delayed broadcasts of political events and that it confers agency discretion to strike a balance between the rival interests of the equal opportunities provision and the exemptions to \u00a7 315.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-15\">An agency\u2019s construction of open-ended provisions in its statute will prevail unless there are \u201ccompelling indications\u201d that it has misconstrued the law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If there is a \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d and in the administrative record for the agency\u2019s position, a court will sustain that construction even though it is not \u201cthe only reasonable one, or . the result we would have reached had the question arisen in the first instance in judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Unemployment Commission v. Aragon, </em>329 U.S. 143, 153, 154, 67 S.Ct. 245, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Our task is not to evaluate the merits of the Commission\u2019s policy choice, but only to assure ourselves that agency action is consonant with congressional directives. This principle applies equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>where, as here, we review modification of a previous policy.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\">The agency, however, must provide a reasoned basis for its action, fully explaining the course it has taken in light of relevant legal and policy issues.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Here, the Commission satisfied this requirement. Its view of the legislative history of the 1959 Amendments and its discretion thereunder is described in the opinion. <em>Delaware Broadcasting Co., supra, </em>at 1031. After asserting that it could see \u201cno valid reason\u201d for distinguishing the facts in <em>Chisholm </em>from the delayed broadcast involved here, the FCC emphasized that broadcast coverage of political news should \u201creach the individual so as to permit reasonable opportunity to evaluate legally qualified candidates for public office . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1032. To that end, the agency cited the need to grant broadcasters substantial discretion in determining on-the-spot political coverage. The Commission also noted that some flexibility in broadcast time is warranted to accommodate scheduling problems, particularly when a news event is broadcast across several time zones, and to deal with special concerns such as captioning for deaf viewers and delayed transmission for broadcasters with daytime-only licenses. <em>Id. </em>at 1032 n.8.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">Nor can we agree that the Commission overstepped its legal powers in dealing with this difficult problem. By revising its interpretation of \u00a7 315(a)(4), the FCC attempted to reconcile the arguably contradictory currents within the statute. The concern in the original provision for fairness to candidates confronts the congressional desire, expressed in the 1959 Amendments, to encourage coverage of political campaigns by broadcast licensees.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> When such important interests must be balanced, there can be no simple, clear resolution of the matter. The range of interpretations of the on-the-spot coverage provision \u2014 amply illustrated by the FCC\u2019s shifting view of it \u2014 reflects the tensions within the statute.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Although that range is not unlimited, we cannot find that the Commission has exceeded its delegated authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>II. ADJUDICATION V. RULE-MAKING'</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">In <em>Chisholm v. FCC, supra, </em>this court rejected the contention that the Commission improperly used an adjudicative proceeding to expand its interpretation of \u00a7 315(a)(4). The ruling in <em>Chisholm, </em>which involved a more drastic shift of FCC policy than that before us in this case, was based on the proposition that, absent a demonstration of abuse of discretion, an agency can reasonably determine whether to proceed by rulemaking or adjudication. 176 U.S. App.D.C. at 16, 538 F.2d at 364-65.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">In ratifying the use of an adjudicative proceeding, the <em>Chisholm </em>court stressed that the Commission provided a reasoned opinion explaining its action, and that interested groups who were not parties to the proceeding had an opportunity to comment on the matter before the agency. 176 U.S.App.D.C. at 15, 538 F.2d at 365. Both criteria are satisfied in this case. As discussed above, the FCC\u2019s opinion presented a sound analysis of the issues involved, satisfying the requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act that agency action not be arbitrary or capricious. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). In addition, there were seven intervenors, including petitioner, in the Commission\u2019s proceeding, providing some assurance that there was an extensive discussion of the issues before the Commission.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Indeed, the instant case may present an even stronger basis for acting through adjudication since, unlike <em>Chisholm, </em>the Commission here reviewed specific facts involving an attempt to provide on-the-spot news coverage. As the FCC\u2019s earlier rulings did not reach the question of delayed broadcasts under the on-the-spot exemption, adjudication of that issue was appropriate.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ad3\">Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"AXr\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1136-12\">.

(P &amp; F) 2063 (7th Cir. 1963), the Commission approved the taped broadcast of coverage of a county court session in Gary, Indiana. Although the FCC found that such coverage fell within the \u00a7 315(a)(4) exemption, the case is not a strong precedent for the situation before us. The complaint in <em>Fadell </em>charged that the program violated \u00a7 315 because the judge of the court was a candidate for election to another office. The FCC ruled that since the judge had appeared on the show for the preceding seven years, the broadcast was on-the-spot coverage of a \u201cbona fide\u201d news event. The question of delayed broadcast was never considered explicitly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1140-18\">. <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.

The Commission\u2019s present view of the exemption may be seen as part of the rising tide of deregulation that has washed away much public support for government restrictions on private activity. Examples of this trend within the communications area, in addition to the FCC\u2019s actions in <em>Aspen </em>and <em>Delaware Broadcasting, </em>are numerous. After this case was argued, the Commission restricted the definition of \u201clegally qualified candidate\u201d and thereby limited the number of candidates who might qualify for equal access under section 315(a). In the same order, the Commission also reduced the period before a nominating procedure during which a candidate could claim equal time. 43 Fed.Reg. 32,790-97 (July 28, 1978).

In affirming the Commission in this case we \u25a0 note that, in addition to the \u201creasonableness and good faith\u201d standard for evaluating compliance with \u00a7 315, 60 F.C.C.2d at 1032; John F. Donato, <em>supra, </em>at 601, the broadcast delay recognized under the \u00a7 315(a)(4) exemption is basically limited to 24 hours. Moreover, it should be noted that the purpose of \u00a7 315(a)(4) is to permit broadcast of those events not suitable for coverage in excerpted form in regularly scheduled broadcasts. Consequently, delayed airing of excerpts of \u201con-the-spot coverage of bona fide news events\u201d would blur the distinction between \u00a7 315(a)(4) and the \u00a7 315(a)(1) exemption for newscasts, and, more important, would further increase the licensee\u2019s opportunity for favoritism with respect to political candidates for the same office.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
