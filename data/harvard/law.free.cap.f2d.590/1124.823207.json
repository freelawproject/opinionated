ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1197-23\">Appellants instituted suit to recover damages allegedly flowing from the deployment and utilization of Army and Air Force personnel for law-enforcement purposes pursuant to a conspiracy by appellees, present or past officers or employees of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The episode complained of took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>place in and around the Village of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, from February until May of 1973. Appellants assert that the events that transpired then and there gave rise to an implied civil, cause of action under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1385, which penalizes criminally the use of elements of the Army or Air Force to execute the laws, absent express constitutional or statutory authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court dismissed the action for lack of venue<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and expressly declined to rule on other procedural objections advanced by appellees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">We hold that Section 1391(e) conferred venue only with respect to those appellees who retained positions in the Federal Government at the time appellants\u2019 suit was commenced.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find, however, that ambiguity in appellants\u2019 complaint precludes determination of whether Section 1391(b) bestows venue over claims against the remaining appellees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, we remand to permit amendments to the complaint and to enable the District Court to reconsider its ruling in light of the clarification to be afforded thereby.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-14\">I. SECTION 1391(e) VENUE</p>\n<p id=\"Afg\">In relevant part Section 1391(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT9p\">A civil action in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal authority . . . may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in which (1) a defendant in the action resides, or (2) the cause of action arose, or (3) any real property involved in the action is situated, or (4) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action. Additional persons may be joined as parties to any such action in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and with such other venue requirements as would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>applicable if the United States or one of its officers [or] employees were not a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-5\">The summons and complaint in such an action shall be served as provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure except that the delivery of the summons and complaint to the officer or agency as required by the rules may be made by certified mail beyond the territorial limits of the district in which the action is brought.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">Very recently, in <em>Briggs v. Goodwin,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we construed this provision as encompassing suits for money damages against federal officers who had acted under color of law though in excess of legal authority. In <em>Briggs, </em>the defendants all held federal posts at the time suit was filed, as well as when the cause of action arose.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the case at bar, the constitutional and statutory violations charged were allegedly perpetrated by appellees while they were federal incumbents and were acting as such under color of their official authority.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The similarity ends at this point, however, for prior to commencement of appellants\u2019 action, several of the 14 appellees withdrew from federal service. Whether that occurrence renders Section 1391(e) inapplicable to them\u2014 though there is no venue problem as to the others \u2014 is the question we must first address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-15\">A. <em>The Statutory Text</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-16\">Our quest begins with a close look at the language of Section 1391(e), and several of its ramifications become quite readily apparent. It has no application unless at least one defendant to the action<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is either (a) \u201can officer or employee of the United States or [some] agency thereof,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or (b) \u201can agency of the United States\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>\u201cthe United States\u201d itself.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, if venue is predicated upon the presence of a federal officer or employee as a defendant, he must, as we have indicated, have \u201cact[ed] in his official capacity or under color of legal authority.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If a defendant is a federal officer or employee who has taken such action, or is the United States or one of its agencies, and no other statute requires otherwise,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the plaintiff may choose from among as many as three alternative forums where venue is proper. The first is \u201cwhere a defendant in the action resides.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The second is where \u201cthe cause of action arose.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The third is where \u201cany real property involved in the action is situated\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or, if none is involved, where \u201cthe plaintiff resides.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">Section 1391(e) thus addresses the issue of venue proper as to the United States, a federal agency, or a federal officer or employee whose conduct meets the statutory specifications. The section makes clear, moreover, that \u201cadditional persons may be joined as parties to any such action\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u2014 an action against a federal defendant just described \u2014 but its instruction regarding venue with respect to \u201c[ajdditional persons\u201d is quite different. For them it is necessary to satisfy \u201csuch other venue requirements as would be applicable if the United States or one of its officers, employees, or agencies were not a party.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> So, while Section 1391(e) has provided specially for and, indeed, has broadened<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> venue vis-a-vis the federal defendants it designates, the conditions conferring venue as to an \u201c[ajdditional person[j\u201d must also exist before that person may be joined in the litigation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>follows that if suit is sought to be maintained not only against a federal defendant embraced within Section 1391(e) but also against an \u201c[additional. person[ ],\u201d there must be proper venue \u2014 as specified in the pertinent statutes \u2014 as to each.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Aside from venue, there may of course be other problems for the plaintiff in a suit against several defendants, some of whom are federal officers. Joinder of \u201c[additional persons\u201d must conform to standard practice,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>, and it goes without saying that personal jurisdiction over each defendant is indispensable to in personam actions. Save in one respect, Section 1391(e) itself governs neither of these matters; on the contrary, it makes clear that joinder of parties and service of process must observe relevant demands of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The sole exception is that in cases wherein it applies, \u201cthe delivery of the summons and complaint to the officer or agency as required by the rules may be made by certified mail beyond the territorial limits of the district in which the action is brought.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Section 1391(e), fully analyzed, emerges as a provision according federal agencies and servants special treatment for venue purposes \u2014 treatment unlike that extended to any other litigant. And the statutory language indicates that its unique venue specifications regarding individual defendants are limited to those enjoying federal office or employment when initially sued. One searches Section 1391(e) in vain for even so much as a hint of any congressional desire to widen venue or ameliorate service of process in suits against those whose federal incumbency is a thing of the past. As \u201cwe are not at liberty to act in [Congress\u2019] stead,\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> we must construe Section 1391(e) as its terms apparently demand absent evidence of a contrary legislative intent or a showing that adherence to a natural reading of the statutory language will produce a result at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-14\">B. <em>The Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-15\">Less than striking is the discovery that nothing in the legislative history of Section 1391(e) specifically indicates that its provisions were meant to apply to suits filed against former federal personnel. In the committee reports and during debate in both Houses, reference was commonly made to federal officers and employees, but in no instance was coverage of past jobholders explicitly addressed. It is surprising that if Section 1391(e) was actually intended to reach bygone federal servants, some congressional articulation of that purpose did not eventuate. For \u201c[t]he construction urged by [appellants] would potentially subject a retired government official to suit in any federal court in the country,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and it seems \u201cinconceivable that Congress would so substantially broaden the venue provision applicable to every individual once employed by the federal government without comment.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>To be sure, Congress did outline the legislation\u2019s broad objectives, and principal among the congressional aims was provision of a \u201creadily available, inexpensive judicial remed[y] for the citizen who is aggrieved by the workings of Government.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> By expanding venue and easing the rigors of process-service requirements in suits against federal officials, Congress certainly advanced that goal considerably. It does not necessarily follow, however, that Congress meant to go further and \u201cprovide a net that could draw everyone connected with a governmental action into litigation in a particular district. . . . <em>,,</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We are mindful that legal representation at governmental expense is frequently, though discretionarity, extended to those who were in federal employ in the past.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> But, counsel fees aside, defense of a damage action is hardly a desired experience, and its situs in a distant forum may well entail an appreciable disruption of the defendant\u2019s ongoing affairs.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> A congressional determination to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>treat burdens of that magnitude as incidents of current federal service is not readily transferable to actions against those who have shed the mantel of federal office.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">C. <em>The Sum of Relevant Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">Confronted, then, with a relatively unambiguous statute, an absence of any specific indication of congressional intent to deny erstwhile federal officials the venue protection traditionally afforded defendants, and a general statutory design largely unadaptable to the context of the present controversy, our course seems relatively clear. However the inclusion of former federal officeholders within the purview of Section 1391(e) may fare on the scale of wisdom, the judgment was one for Congress to make, and we are constrained to acknowledge their exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">Our conclusion draws strong support from the well considered decision of the only other federal appellate court to address the issue thus far. Recently, in <em>Driver v. Helms,</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the First Circuit endorsed our determination in Briggs<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> that Section 1391(e) embraces actions for money damages but ruled that it does not extend to suits against those no longer in federal employment. Moreover, our holding today was foreshadowed, if not compelled, by one of our earlier pronouncements on the subject. We had occasion to construe Section 1391(e) in <em>Relf v. Gasch,</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which involved a transfer of civil litigation purportedly under authority of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) to a district \u201cwhere it might have been brought.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The <em>Relf </em>plaintiffs pressed a claim for damages against present and past federal officials not only for misuse of authority but also for purely personal conduct.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Insofar as the plaintiffs sought relief for activities of the latter sort, we doubted that Section 1391(e) authorized venue in or service of process from the transferee court.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Even \u201capart from the inefficacy of process available in [the transferee] district for any defendant sued only in a purely personal role,\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> we pointed out that the departure of some of the defendants from federal service prior to institution of suit \u201cincreased] the likelihood that they were not amenable to service of process from\u201d [the transferee] court.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Personal jurisdiction over the defendants in <em>Relf </em>could have rested only on Section 1391(e) or on the defendants\u2019 presence in the transferee district, and on the record the latter seemed improbable. We remanded the case to enable amendments to the complaint for the purpose of developing a more complete basis for determining whether venue was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>proper and personal jurisdiction existed in the transferee district.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">We now reaffirm <em>Relf </em>and explicitly hold that former federal officers and employees are beyond the reach of Section 1391(e).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> That does not mean that the section is completely inapplicable to the case at bar, for one or more appellees remained in federal employ at the time appellants\u2019 suit was filed.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Section 1391(e) furnished venue for the action against those appellees and, as we have said, it specifically authorizes joinder of additional persons as parties if venue requirements otherwise applicable are met.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The only possible alternative basis for venue, however, is Section 1391(b), a general provision pertaining to civil litigation not resting jurisdictionally on diverse citizenship. Since the District court ruled broadly here that venue did not lie in the District of Columbia under Section 1391,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> we must review the determination, implicit in its dismissal of appellants\u2019 lawsuit, with respect to Section 1391(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">II. VENUE UNDER SECTION 1391(b)</p>\n<p id=\"AlKm\">In Section 1391(b) Congress ordained;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjM7\">A civil action wherein jurisdiction is not founded solely on diversity of citizenship may be brought only in the judicial district where all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose, except as otherwise provided by law.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbX\">As some of those made defendants to this litigation did not reside in the District of Columbia, venue under Section 1391(b) is proper only if it is a district \u201cin which the claim arose.\u201d At first blush that might appear to be a determination easy enough to make but, though simply phrased, this component of Section 1391(b) has sometimes proved puzzling in application for two principal reasons. In the first place, Congress did not supply any particular definition of the language \u201cin which the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>arose,\u201d either in statutory text or in pertinent legislative history, and no black-letter rule is derivable from other legal contexts in which that phraseology is employed.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Perhaps more seriously, the reference to <em>\u201cthe </em>judicial district\u201d in which the claim arose might suggest that only a single district can satisfy the st\u00e1tutory standard with respect to any given claim. Though resort to familiar common law theories might furnish a reasonable ground for selection of a particular district in uncomplicated tort or contract actions,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> choice of a single district is a much more difficult undertaking when sophisticated multistate activities of relative complexity are in issue.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-11\">The legislative history of Section 1391(b), by its very generality, is helpful in the resolution of the problem. The portion of Section 1391(b) extending venue to a district \u201cin which the claim arose\u201d was added by amendment in 1966,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and the resulting \u201cenlargement of venue\u201d was intended merely to \u201cfacilitate the disposition of . claims by providing, in appropriate cases, a more convenient forum to the litigants and the witnesses involved.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The legislative concern was pragmatic: Since the place where the claim arose is the situs of events important to the case, Congress undertook \u201cto facilitate the administration of jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>tice\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> by permitting suit in a district where the litigation might more handily progress.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">This practical orientation of Section 1391(b), then, counsels against adherence to mechanical standards in its application.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Rather, where \u201cthe claim arose\u201d should in our view be ascertained by advertence to events having operative significance in the case, and a commonsense appraisal of the implications of those events for accessibility to witnesses and records.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> And, though a proliferation of permissible forums is staunchly to be avoided,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> it is evident that the often unfruitful pursuit of a single locality as the one and only district in which the claim arose is not needed to ensure the efficient conduct of the litigation. Not surprisingly, then, courts in some number have construed Section 1391(b) as conferring venue in a district where a substantial portion of the acts or omissions giving rise to the actions occurred, notwithstanding that venue might also lie in other districts.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> We endorse that interpretation wholeheartedly. So long as the substantial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>ity of the operative events is determined by assessment of their ramifications for efficient conduct of the suit<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> \u2014 an important step upon which we would unfailingly insist \u2014 loyalty to the objectives of Section 1391(b) will be amply preserved.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> We come, then, to the question whether the case at bar can pass muster on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">Appellants seek damages for depredations assertedly inflicted in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1385<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. They aver an appropriation of military equipment and a deployment of military personnel for the purpose of executing the laws in and around the Village of Wounded Knee.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Consonantly with the principles we have delineated, Section 139\u00ed(b) venue of appellants\u2019 claims would lie in the District of Columbia if appellees\u2019 liability expectably could be established in substantial part by proof of acts, or omissions occurring here. Success in that endeavor would depend, however, upon appellants\u2019 ability to demonstrate proper venue with respect to each cause of action<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> and each appellee.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>Appellants\u2019 complaint makes evident that in some appreciable measure defendants\u2019 allegedly unlawful activities happened in South Dakota. Indeed, Wounded Knee will long be remembered for the notorious conflagration occurring there. But appellants tell us that events having a major role in the putatively illegal operations took place in the District of Columbia. In their brief, they state that \u201cWashington was \u2018command central\u2019 for the Wounded Knee seige [sic]\u201d;<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> they insist that \u201c[i]t was there that the conspiracy for execution of that scheme was developed[;] [i]t was from Washington that the critical orders, authorizations, and instructions issued throughout the seige [sic], and it was to Washington that the principal on-site officials periodically returned for consultation and strategy sessions with the officials who held in their Washington offices the ultimate operational control.\u201d <footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">Since appellants do not contend that the asserted conspiracy itself is civilly actionable,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> the mere fact that the conspiracy was formulated in the District of Columbia may bear little significance for potential liability of any appellee whose own contribution to its consummation was confined wholly to South Dakota. At the moment, however, there is no call for a decision on Section 1391(b) venue with respect to any particular appellee. To begin with, the record on appeal, as we shall shortly see, lacks the information vital to individual determinations. Moreover, appellees who assertedly exercised \u201coperational control\u201d from the District of Columbia may be legally accountable even absent willful participation by others in South Dakota. Consequently, appellants might be able to establish liability on the part of \u201coperational controllers\u201d by proof that in substantial part their activities occurred within the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> That could be true even as to appellees whose connection with the Wounded Knee affair was limited to planning in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-10\">The problem, however, is that appellants\u2019 complaint does not explicate the claims indicated more comprehensively in their brief before this court. Although conferences and other conduct related to the conspiracy were chronicled in the complaint, with rare exception the locus of those activities does not appear. We thus are unable to appraise the tenor and extent \u2014 or the implications for facility of this litigation \u2014 of events that may have taken place in the District of Columbia, and the same, disability may well have precluded a considered judgment by the District Court. In these circumstances, we think appellants should have the opportunity to amend the complaint to specify more clearly which of the asserted activities transpired here and which appellees are thought to have had a hand therein.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Then, in light of the amendments and our construction of Section 1391(b), the District Court can more soundly determine whether and to what extent venue may be proper under that section.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>The judgment dismissing appellants\u2019 suit for want of proper venue is accordingly vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The legislative history of the 1976 amendment to \u00a7 1391(e) provides additional evidence that advancement of a plaintiffs interest in conveniently prosecuting claims based on official misconduct must be tempered to avoid hardship to defendants not employed by the United States. Prior to the amendment, as we have observed, \u00a7 1391(e) applied only when \u201ceach defendant\u201d was a federal officer or employee. See note 13 <em>supra. </em>Because adherence to that requirement would exempt actions involving nonfederal defendants otherwise subject to venue and personal jurisdiction in the forum district, compare <em>Town of East Haven v. Eastern Airlines, </em>282 F.Supp. 507 (D.Conn. 1968), with <em>Green v. Laird, </em>357 F.Supp. 227 (N.D.Ill.1973), Congress amended the section to enable its application when \u201ca defendant\u201d is. a federal officer or employee. See note 13 <em>supra. </em>The Department of Justice objected to the bill as introduced because it \u201c \u2018would permit any plaintiff to obtain venue against any private defendant by simply joining as a party to the action a Federal official over whom venue may be obtained under 28 U.S.C. section 1391(e).\u2019 \u201d S.Rep. No. 996, <em>supra </em>notes 13, 18, quoting Letter from Antonin Scalia, Assistant Attorney General, to Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman, Subcommittee on Ad. Practice and Procedure, U.S. Senate (May 10, 1976); H.R.Rep. No. 1656, <em>supra </em>note 13, at 18 (same). So, \u201c[t]o avoid any hardship or unfair disadvantage to private defendants that might result from subjecting them to plaintiffs broadened choice of venue under section 1391(e) as amended,\u201d S.Rep. No. 996, <em>supra </em>note 13, at 18, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary amended the pertinent sentence of the bill to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-7\">Additional persons may be joined as parties to any such action in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure <em>and with such other venue requirements as would be applicable if the United States or one of its officers, employees or agencies were not a party.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1202-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied by the Committee). The Committee recognized that \u201c[i]n effect, this will mean that a private defendant can only be sued in a venue where he could have been sued if the Government had not been a party. As a practical matter it will usually mean that the plaintiff will have to bring suit in the district where the defendant resides rather than in- his own district.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under \u00a7 1391(e) as amended, a plaintiff distressed by official misconduct who sues both a federal and a nonfederal defendant who participated in the activity under-girding the lawsuit must press his claim in a district having venue with respect to the non-federal defendant by authority other than \u00a7 1391(e), notwithstanding the procedural burden on vindication of the plaintiffs grievance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b1202-12\">. See 28 C.F.R. pt. 50 (1977). When it is \u201cin the interest of the United States,\u201d the Department of Justice will undertake the representation \u2014 or pay for representation by a private attorney when a conflict of interest might otherwise ensue \u2014 of former federal servants sued in an individual capacity for acts reasonably appearing to have been performed within the scope of the former employment. <em>Id. </em>See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 516 (1976). Defense of past personnel may well be less commonly compelled by governmental interest than defense of those currently employ\u00e9d simply because an adverse judgment might impact less on continuing governmental operations in the former context than in the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b1202-13\">. In <em>Driver v. Helms, </em>74 F.R.D. 382 (D.R.I.1977), <em>rev'd, </em>557 F.2d 147 (1st Cir. 1978), the District Court had determined that \u201cthe greatest portion of effort required in defending <em>this </em>lawsuit will not require defendants to travel or undertake other actions interfering with their ongoing activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400 (emphasis supplied). That extension of \u00a7 1391(e) to reach defendants in one particular action would not result in significant impositions does not justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>categorical inclusion of former federal jobholders in the class of defendants affected by that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">. We need not ponder whether the same considerations of repose militate against \u00a7 1391(e) coverage of a defendant who, though in federal employ at the time suit is filed, holds a position distinctly different from that occupied at the time the acts or omissions complained of transpired. It may be that \u00a7 1391(e) is most naturally read as covering suits against a federal officeholder for activity in the selfsame office. See <em>Driver v. Helms, supra </em>note 32, 577 F.2d at 151 n. 11. We intimate no view in this regard, however, for the record is unclear as to whether the issue is directly involved in this case.

The language of \u00a7 1391(e) and its legislative history reflect focused congressional, attention on a discrete class of defendants to which former federal jobholders do not belong. Their inclusion in the category of defendants amenable to the expanded venue and lax service requirements of \u00a7 1391(e) subjects them to suit anywhere in the United States that a potential plaintiff might reside and accordingly threatens hardships Congress may never have intended to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-12\">By' contrast, liberal interpretation of \u00a7 1391(c) and the Clayton Act accords with their legislative history, see Comment, <em>Time of Venue Under Section 12 of the Clayton Act Refers to Time When Action Accrued, </em>65 Mich. L.Rev. 995 (1967); <em>cf. </em>Comment, <em>Venue: Then or Now?

And hardship resulting from geographical distance, while of concern in the context of natural defendants, is considerably less significant when corporate defendants are involved. See 1 J.

In some cases, testimony of nonparties and records or other evidence not in the parties\u2019 possession may be insignificant; in others, it may be most readily available in areas in which none of the principal events in issue in the suit occurred. In such situations, the forum court should not oppose the plaintiffs choice of venue if the activities that transpired in the forum district were not insubstantial in relation to the totality of events giving rise to the plaintiffs grievance and if the forum is generally convenient for all litigants. An additional, important consideration might be ensuring the existence of at least one forum wherein venue and personal jurisdiction requirements permit multiple-party litigation to proceed.

See also Comment, <em>supra </em>note 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-14\">A number of courts have adopted a weight-of-the-contacts test, first announced in <em>Philadelphia Housing Auth. v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., supra </em>note 56. See, e. <em>g., ABC Great States, Inc. v. Globe Ticket Co., </em>310 F.Supp. 739 (N.D.Ill.1970); <em>Ghazoul </em>v. <em>International Management Servs., Inc., supra </em>note 56. Though, in principle, that test may permit selection of a single forum \u201cin which the claim arose,\u201d the factors sometimes deemed determinative might well indicate the suitability of several such forums in other cases involving similar causes of action. See, e. <em>g., Philadelphia Housing Auth. v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., supra </em>note 56 (in antitrust action, venue would lie in any district in which injury occurred if some overt act pursuant to conspiratorial meetings took place in the district and it was a substantial element of the offense; conversely, if a meaningless and insignificant meeting of the conspirators took place in a district, venue would not exist there). Generally, the cases purporting to apply this standard have not illuminated how the contacts are to be weighed or when they are significant. See 15 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice \u00a7 3806, at 36 (1976); <em>cf. Iranian Shipping Lines v. Moraites, supra </em>note 62, 377 F.Supp. at 647 (rejecting version of test contemplating evaluation of specific calculus of contacts).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">. See note 62 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">. We think this construction is consistent with the text and intent of \u00a7 1391(b). See 1 J. Moore, <em>supra </em>note 19:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-8\">[T]the language of both subsections (a) and (b) refer to <em>\u201cthe </em>district ... in which <em>the </em>claim arose,\u201d lending some inference that the draftsmen assumed that every claim arises in some <em>one </em>district. Given the looseness with which \u201cthe\u201d is sometimes used in statutes, however, this inference, while perhaps persuasive, is not compelling. As to the first \u201cthe,\u201d there is no reason to suppose that the draftsmen of the 1966 amendment gave it any thought, since they appear to have simply spliced in the phrase \u201cor where the claim arose\u201d in the fashion that would obviate the need to rewrite the subsection. Indeed there appears to be some question as to whether \u201cthe\u201d was appropriate in subsection (a) as originally enacted, since \u201cthe judicial district where all plaintiffs or all defendants reside\u201d does not refer to a single district, but to one, two, or none, as the case may be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1207-9\">1[ 0.142[5.-2], at 1431 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-10\">The \u201csubstantial part\u201d standard was expressly incorporated into the present \u00a7 1391(f), added by amendment in 1976, which concerns venue over actions against foreign states. Act of Oct. 21, 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-583, \u00a7 5, 90 Stat. 2897, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-11\">A civil action against a foreign state as defined in section 1603(a) of this title may be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1207-12\">(1) in any judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-13\">The House Committee on the Judiciary explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-14\">This provision is analogous to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e), which allows an action against the United States to be brought, <em>inter alia, </em>in any judicial district in which \u201cthe cause of action arose.\u201d The test adopted, however, is the newer test recommended by the American Law Institute . . . which does not imply that there is only one such district applicable in each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1207-17\">H.R.Rep. No. 1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 31-32 (1976); accord, S.Rep. No. 1310, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-18\">The fact that amendments to \u00a7 1391(e) were pending in the same session before Congress but were not supplemented to include the \u201csubstantial part\u201d language arguably indicates an intention to preserve a distinction between the standard of \u00a7 1391(f) and that of \u00a7\u00a7 1391(a), (b), and (e). But the 1976 amendment to \u00a7 1391(e) was addressed to a very specific congressional concern, see note 36 <em>supra, </em>and the amendment adding the present \u00a7 1391(f) was part of similarly specific legislation concerning the multi-district nature of suits against foreign sovereigns. See Act of Oct. 21, 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-583, 90 Stat. 2897. To boot, Congress was fashioning a completely new venue provision in \u00a7 1391(f) and in that posture opted for the ALI suggestion, so it is not surprising, that the opportunity was not taken to amend the venue laws generally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b1207-19\">.
