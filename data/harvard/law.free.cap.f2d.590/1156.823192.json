In the District Court plaintiffs American Maritime Association (U.S. steamship companies), Shipbuilders Council of America (domestic shipbuilders), and Seafarers International Union (maritime labor union) sought a declaratory judgment against the defendant Secretary of the Treasury and intervening defendant Amerada Hess Corporation (owner of the crude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>oil cargo) providing that the transport of the oil violated the Jones Act and an injunction to compel the U.S. Customs Service (Treasury Department) not to issue permits and clearances needed for its transport.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> District Judge Oliver Gasch ruled against the plaintiffs and dismissed the action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finding the action of the trial court and the Customs Service preceding it to be based on sound statutory interpretation, judicial and administrative precedent, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">Among the many diversified petroleum interests of Hess is the ownership and operation of an oil refinery in St. Croix, Virgin Islands. Constructed in 1966, this refinery is the principal manufacturing facility of Hess and, apart from port and other facilities at St. Croix owned by Hess, represents an investment of some $650 million.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a representative period, 83% of the products produced at the Virgin Islands refinery are shipped by Hess to the continental United States, and the remainder marketed for use in the Virgin Islands or sold to the United States Government.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 1969 Hess acquired an interest in Alaska\u2019s North Slope oil, which, from the southern terminus of the Alaska pipeline at Valdez, must be transported by tanker to a refinery for processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-16\">Planners of the Alaska pipeline system initially contemplated that the sea leg from Valdez would be relatively short, as the crude oil would be transported only to the U.S. West Coast.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The current glut of oil in the Western United States, however, has made it necessary to transport and refine Alaskan crude oil elsewhere. In 1969 Hess announced its. plans to transport its share of the Prudhoe Bay crude from Valdez around Cape Horn to its St. Croix refinery in foreign-flag tankers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At St. Croix the crude would be r\u00e9fined into some eleven separate products which, with the exception of a small portion consumed in the Virgin Islands, would be exported to the United States.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In furtherance of Hess\u2019 petroleum enterprise, the <em>Hercules, </em>a foreign-flag tanker, began its voyage from Valdez to St. Croix on 3 September 1977.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-17\">We now turn to the maritime laws of the United States and the Government enforcement agency involved here. From our First Congress in 1789, American shipping in the United States coastwise maritime trade has been protected from foreign competition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Traditionally, in order to encourage the development of an American merchant ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>rine, for both national defense and commercial purposes, all vessels engaged in the coastwise or other domestic trade have been required to be American-built and American-owned.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">The foreign maritime trade of the United States has always \u2014 and necessarily \u2014 been different. As a practical commercial matter it would be impossible to prohibit foreign-flag vessels from carrying goods to and from the United States and another country. The purchaser or supplier of goods to or from the United States would have equal right, and the commercial and political leverage to enforce such right, to have the goods transported in vessels of its choice. Hence, the United States effort to maintain an adequate merchant marine in foreign commerce has, at least in the twentieth century, gone the route of subsidizing the construction of vessels in American shipyards and subsidizing the additional operational costs of an American crew manning the ship by American safety standards.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">While most of the Congressional discussions in regard to tanker shipments from Valdez assumed carriage in American-flag vessels, it is clear that this assumption was based on the original belief that Alaskan crude would be transported to and refined in West Coast ports.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The coastwise laws of the United States would then have unquestionably required the transport to be in American bottoms,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and this would also be true if the transport of Alaskan crude were from Valdez to, say, Delaware. It was the introduction of the St. Croix refinery in the Virgin Islands into the processing of Alaskan crude which first arguably made possible the use of foreign-flag vessels to carry the cargo.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">On B October 1969 plaintiff Shipbuilders Council inquired of the Commissioner of Customs as to whether Alaskan crude could, under the coastwise laws, be transported to the Virgin Islands, refined there, and then the products shipped to the United States in tankers not entitled to engage in the coast-wise trade; in other words, whether the use of a foreign-flag tanker such as the <em>Hercu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number><em>les </em>would violate the Jones Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In reply the Commissioner referred to \u201ca number of cases involving the transportation of merchandise between coastwise points by way of an intermediate foreign port at which the merchandise underwent some form of processing,\u201d and stated that \u201cif the main purpose of the exportation was to have the merchandise thus processed and if the processing was not merely incidental to an intended transportation between American ports,\u201d then the prohibition of the Jones Act did not apply and the transportation could be by a foreign vessel.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission pointed out that the Bureau of Customs ordinarily considered processing to be \u201csubstantial,\u201d and thus likely to be the \u201cmain purpose\u201d of the exportation, if it \u201cchanged the merchandise physically, improved its condition, and advanced it in value, so that after processing it was a new and different product. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> No formal ruling from the Customs Service was then forthcoming, but plaintiffs renewed their effort to obtain such ruling at the time of the voyage of the <em>Hercules </em>in 1977. The Service responded by issuing formal notice of a proposed amendment to the Customs Regulations, which would provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-5\">A coastwise transportation of merchandise takes place, within the meaning of the coastwise laws, when merchandise laden at a point embraced within the coastwise laws (\u201ccoastwise point\u201d) is unladen at another coastwise point, regardless of the origin or ultimate destination of the merchandise. However, merchandise is not transported coastwise if at an intermediate port, or place other than a coastwise point (that is, at a foreign port or place, or at a port or place in a territory or possession of the United States not subject to the coastwise laws), it is manufactured or processed into a new and different product, and the new and different product thereafter is transported to a coastwise point.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-10\">The Service further explained that where such manufacturing or processing of a product takes place at a non-coastwise point, \u201ceither segment (or both segments) of the overall transportation [to and from the noncoastwise point] may be accomplished by vessels not qualified to engage in the coast-wise trade\u201d because \u201cthe continuity of the transportation is broken at the intermediate port or place and . . . the new and different product resulting from the manufacturing or processing is not the same as that laden at the initial coastwise point.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-12\">On 2 September 1977, the day before the <em>Hercules </em>was to commence its voyage, plaintiff American Maritime Association sought a temporary restraining order to enjoin the Secretary of the Treasury from permitting the Hercules, or any other foreign-flag vessel, from departing Valdez, Alaska, laden with Alaskan crude for the Virgin Islands.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The TRO was denied that same day, but because of the imminent voyage, the hearing on motions for preliminary and final injunction was consolidated and tried on 3-4 October. On 13 October 1977 District Judge Gasch ruled that carriage by a foreign-flag vessel of Alaskan oil to the Hess refinery in the Virgin Islands, where the oil would be refined and the products thereafter shipped to the continental United States, was not a violation of the Jones Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-13\">II. THE STATUTES AND ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-14\">The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, \u00a7 27 (the Jones Act) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-15\"><em>No merchandise </em>shall be transported by water, or by land and water, on penalty of <em>forfeiture </em>thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>between points in the United States, including Districts, Territories, and <em>possessions thereof embraced within the coast-wise laws, either directly or via a foreign port, </em>or for any part of the transportation, in any other vessel than a vessel built in and documented under the laws of the United States and owned by persons who are citizens of the United States <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">With regard to the Virgin Islands, however, the above language is qualified by \u00a7 21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqIQ\">. <em>[T]he coastwise laws of the United States shall not extend to the Virgin Islands </em>of the United States until the President of the United States shall, by proclamation, declare that such coast-wise laws shall extend to the Virgin Islands and fix a date for the going into effect of same.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> [No party contends such proclamation has ever issued.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">While the parties have argued extensively on the overall purpose of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the numerous decisions dealing with the continuity of flow in foreign and interstate commerce<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>, and the impact of the Magnuson Amendment to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we view the problem as one of straightforward statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">On the facts of this case, the key words of the Jones Act are its flat prohibition: <em>\u201cNo merchandise </em>shall be transported . <em>between points in the United States . </em>[in foreign vessels] . . .\u201d The central issue, therefore, is whether the \u201cmerchandise\u201d (crude oil) transported from Valdez to St. Croix by Hess is so similar to the \u201cmerchandise\u201d (refined oil products) subsequently shipped from St. Croix to the continental United States that the processing at St. Croix fails to interrupt an essentially single voyage of the oil from Valdez, Alaska, to the East Coast. If the oil and its by-products are deemed to constitute a single element of \u201cmerchandise,\u201d then the same \u201cmerchandise\u201d travels between Valdez and an East Coast <em>port </em>\u2014 i. e., between two \u201cpoints in the United States\u201d \u2014 and is subject throughout that voyage to the prohibitions of the Jones Act. If, on the other hand, the processing at St. Croix effects such a substantial metamorphosis of the oil that an essentially different \u201cmerchandise\u201d is transported on the second leg of the trip than on the first, the \u201csingle\u201d voyage from Valdez to the East Coast is severed at St. Croix. Because the Virgin Islands are expressly excluded from U.S. coastwise laws,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> neither of these two sub-voyages would be between two \u201cpoints in the United States, including . . . possessions thereof embraced within the coastwise laws,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and no vessel carrying merchandise on the two voyages would fall within the proscriptions of the Jones Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-17\">Further, we must consider the argument of appellant Seafarers Union that the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization (TAPS) Act<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the Magnuson Amendment<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> bar the transportation of Alaskan oil in foreign vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-18\">We turn first to the issues related to the identity of \u201cmerchandise\u201d argument under \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>1920, and then consider separately the impact of the TAPS Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">III. APPLICABILITY OF THE MERCHANT MARINE ACT OF 1920</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">A. <em>\u201cMerchandise\u201d </em>\u2014 Section <em>27 (Jones Act)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">Section 27 speaks of \u201cmerchandise\u201d being transported.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The inquiry thus becomes what merchandise is transported from Valdez to St. Croix and what merchandise is transported from St. Croix to the continental United States? It is clear that the merchandise on the first leg is Alaskan crude oil. If the facts of this case ended with the arrival of the Alaskan crude at the Hess refinery in St. Croix, Virgin Islands, the case would be very simple, because \u00a7 21 plainly states, \u201c[T]he coastwise laws of the United States shall not extend to the Virgin Islands\u201d;<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> hence \u00a7 27, perhaps the most important of the \u201ccoastwise\u201d laws, would not restrict the transport to American vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">But the facts do not end at the Hess refinery, for it is there that the Alaskan crude is refined into eleven products, which are then largely transported to the continental United States.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Appellants contend that the two voyages must be considered as one and that the petroleum, whether in crude or refined form, must be thought of as one product, <em>i. </em>e., one type of \u201cmerchandise\u201d within the statute. It is only on this theory that the Jones Act (\u00a7 27) can apply to this case, <em>i. </em>e., if the \u201cmerchandise\u201d transported from Valdez to St. Croix is the same \u201cmerchandise\u201d subsequently transported to the continental United States, and if the two legs of the voyage thus must be treated as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">We cannot agree with this concept, because crude oil is simply quite different from the ultimate products which come out of a refinery. Judge Gasch found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amn\">Alaskan oil that is refined at the Hess refinery will yield the following products ini the following amounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-13\">Product <em>% </em>Volume</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-14\">benzene .47</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-15\">toluene 2.23</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-16\">xylene 0.27</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-17\">paraxylene 1.08</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-18\">regular gasoline 4.19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-19\">premium gasoline 4.19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As3\">unleaded gasoline 3.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANN\">jet fuel 8.70</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-20\">No. 2 Oil 14.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-21\">No. 6 Oil 55.82</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-22\">sulfur pellets 0,30</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-23\">94.75 total marketable product recovery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Xh\">5.25 fuel gas equivalent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyxT\">Benzene, toluene, xylene and paraxylene are petrochemicals used in the manufacture of finished chemical products. Jet fuel is used as fuel for jet aircraft, and gasoline as fuel for motor vehicles. Sulphur is used in the manufacture of fertilizers and pharmaceuticals. No. 2 oil is used as home heating oil No. 6 oil is used as fuel by power plants. <em>Each of these products is different in name, physical and chemical character, and use from each other and from crude oil. Moreover, crude oil cannot be used for any of these purposes.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-24\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201call the credible evidence of record conclusively demonstrates that the products of the Hess refinery are new and different merchandise from the Alaskan crude oil.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It thus seems clear that the \u201cmerchandise,\u201d the language of the statute, transported between Valdez and St. Croix is one thing, crude oil, while the \u201cmerchandise\u201d transported from St. Croix to the continental United States is a collection of quite different other things, <em>i. e., </em>products which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>physically, chemically, and usefully different from the original crude oil.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Assuming that the exception of \u00a7 21, \u201c[t]he coastwise laws of the United States shall not extend to the Virgin Islands,\u201d applies in full vigor, then each voyage, carrying different merchandise, is between a point within the coastwise laws of the United States and a point outside the coastwise laws of the United States. We hold that the requirement of the Jones Act that the cargo be carried in American vessels does not apply to either voyage; each is outside the coast-wise trade of the United States.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>Further, under the circumstances of this case, we hold that it is not the <em>intent </em>of a shipper to send goods to a final destination that governs, but the degree to which the goods are altered <em>in fact </em>in the course of commercial dealings.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Thus we must reject appellants\u2019 contention that because Hess may have intended that most of the crude oil shipped from Valdez return in some form to the mainland United States\u2014 in fact, that it was bound by law not to sell it abroad<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> \u2014 the prohibitions of the Jones Act apply.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The enforcement provision cited by appellants which applies the penalty of forfeiture where there is \u201cintent to evade\u201d foreign vessel prohibitions<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> does not define under what circumstances evasion takes place. Such definition is provided in the substantive provisions of the Jones Act itself, which speaks not of <em>intent </em>but of actual \u201ctransport\u201d of \u201cmerchandise.\u201d Since appellants have not contended in this ease that in the absence of an actual violation of the Jones Act the forfeiture provisions should apply, and since no evidence has been adduced of any intent by Hess to evade the Act absent such actual violation, the issue of intent does not govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">B. <em>\u201cVia a Foreign Port\u201d </em>\u2014 Section <em>27 (Jones Act)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-13\">Two other points should be noticed in regard to our interpretation of \u00a7 27. The words \u201ceither directly or via a foreign port\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> were inserted in the original statute<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> by the Congress in 1893<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> after the decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>250 Kegs of Nails.</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em> </em>n that case the Government sought forfeiture of 250 kegs of nails which had been transported in a Belgian vessel from New York to Antwerp, there unloaded and reloaded upon a British vessel, which then transported the same nails <em>(i. </em>e., the same merchandise) to California. The statute then in effect did not contain the phrase \u201ceither directly or via a foreign port.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>Both the District Court and the Ninth Circuit found the statute inapplicable to the transportation of the nails, because \u201c[i]n the plain and ordinary meaning of the words, \u2018to transport goods from one domestic port to another\u2019 means to carry goods <em>in one continuous voyage . </em>. . It does not mean to carry them in two distinct and separate voyages, or in two distinct vessels. .\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Congress, seeing how easily the protection to American shipping would be vitiated by a simple transshipment of the same cargo, inserted the words \u201ceither directly or via a foreign port\u201d to prohibit such simple transshipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">The legislative history of the \u201cvia a foreign port\u201d amendment shows the limited purpose of Congress, only to extend coverage to the type activity involved in <em>250 Kegs of </em>Nails; the debates did not even refer to merchandise that was to any degree processed in a foreign country.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> No language in the statute indicates that the landing of the cargo in a foreign port for the legitimate purpose of manufacture or processing of the goods would not convert the goods to other merchandise or would not interrupt the continuity of the voyage.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The words \u201ceither directly or via a foreign port\u201d have reference only to the <em>Keg of Nails </em>situation, <em>i. e., </em>the simple transshipment of the same goods in a foreign port, which under the amended statute does not break the continuity of the voyage. What we have here in the operations of the St. Croix refinery is a far different undertaking from simple transshipment of the same \u201cmerchandise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-13\">C. <em>\u201cForfeiture\" </em>\u2014 Section <em>27 (Jones Act)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-14\">The last point to be made in regard to \u00a7 27 is the implication derived from the penalty of <em>forfeiture </em>for a. violation of carrying cargo by non-U.S. vessels in the coastwise trade. It is well understood that statutes imposing a forfeiture, particularly the horrendous penalty of forfeiture of an entire cargo worth millions of dollars, are to be construed strictly.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The rationale for such strict construction \u2014 that persons should receive clear and unequivocal warning before facing exposure to harsh penalties<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> \u2014 is especially applicable here, where the penalty for noncompliance is enormous.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The application of this principle is not undercut by the argument, strenuously urged by the appellants, as to the applicability of numerous judicial precedents involving the flow of interstate and foreign commerce. It is also well understood that such statutes of a regulatory nature are to be construed broadly, and appellants urge that this applies to the Jones Act in this case.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-15\">We do not agree; the Jones Act is an Act for a very specific purpose, with sharply defined contours, and the forfeiture provi: sion is a strict penalty for a violation of such a limited and sharply defined statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>In its effect the Jones Act, though pertaining to commerce, thus bears a closer resemblance to other penal statutes than it does to statutes generally regulating commerce. Decisions construing regulatory statutes broadly, from their very nature and purpose, are of doubtful applicability.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">D. <em>Policy Concerns Behind the Virgin Islands Exemption </em>\u2014 Section <em>21</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9YM\">There is another and stronger reason why the long line of unquestioned authority in regard to interstate and foreign commerce should not govern our interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. No one here contends that the flow, of crude oil from Prudhoe Bay and then in the form of gasoline to the gas tank of the ultimate consumer anywhere in the continental United States is not domestic, interstate U.S. commerce. Such flow of commerce can be considered to take place through foreign ports, and through ports outside of the coastwise trade, even though the substances involved go through numerous transformations. This process is all in the flow of commerce, no one here contends otherwise, and Congress regulates this commerce in a myriad of ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">But what we have here is a statute which regulates the coastwise trade, defines very strictly what is covered within the coast-wise laws, and in so doing excludes the Virgin Islands from the coverage of the coastwise laws, all for the very specific purpose of insuring that American-flag shipping has a monopoly on the carriage of goods in the coastwise trade. However, for reasons clear to Congress at the time, and probably for additional and different reasons equally clear to Congress later, the Virgin Islands have been excluded from the application of the coastwise laws, and have continued to be so excluded for many years, for national policies quite separate from those justifying the Jones Act restriction of carriage in American-flag vessels.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> If Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>gress wishes to bring the Virgin Islands into the ambit of the U.S. coastwise trade, it can do so, and in fact has already left the decision up to the President to do so if the President so desires.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">The plaintiff-appellants themselves have recognized the long-standing interpretation of the Customs Service of the statute placing the Virgin Islands outside the coastwise laws; <em>i. e., </em>goods processed there originate for the next leg of their seaborne transportation outside the restriction of the Jones Act. In 1971 the Executive Director of appellant American Maritime Association, in connection with this statutory exemption for the Virgin Islands, advised a colleague, \u201c[T]he present situation permits foreign-flag tankers to carry crude oil from, say, Alaska, to be refined on the islands and then transshipped, again by foreign flags, to the East Coast.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> As recently as February 1976, representatives of all three appellants here testified or submitted statements to Congress in support of a bill which would amend coastwise laws to extend them to the Virgin Islands with respect to the transportation of crude oil, residual crude oil, and refined petroleum products.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> This was but one of at least ten unsuccessful attempts to have the exemption modified or repealed.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">It is quite apparent that there are strong policy arguments, economic and political, dictating that the Virgin Islands exemption from the coastwise laws remain. Two tankers the size of the <em>Hercules, </em>transporting almost 220,000 tons of crude each, operating in full service the year around from Valdez to St. Croix, would only bring to the Hess refinery 5% of its annual output.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> All the other crude comes from sources outside the United States, is transported in either foreign-flag or U.S.-subsidized vessels to St. Croix, and is then transported in either foreign-flag or U.S.-subsidized vessels from St. Croix to the continental United States. In addition to petroleum and its products, there are large cargoes of rum and sugar which flow from the Virgin Islands to the United States in foreign bottoms. If the economics and politics of the matter call for the inclusion of the Virgin Islands in the coastwise trade of the United States, then all of this would have to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>carried in American-flag ships. Obviously, there are large and conflicting economic and political interests both opposing and supporting the continuation of the Virgin Islands exemption from the coastwise laws; it all adds up to a policy choice for Congress, not any court, where the language and intent of the statute are as clear as they are in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">We appreciate the fact that appellants here do not petition this court to lift, by fiat, the Virgin Islands exemption. Rather, appellants aim were narrowly to invoke the prohibitions of the Jones Act only against foreign vessels involved in the transport of crude oil from the mainland United States to the Virgin Islands, where petroleum products refined from that same oil are transported back to the mainland. Yet we believe that to grant appellants\u2019 petition, even on the narrow facts of the Alaskan crude oil trade, would inevitably jeopardize the export from the Virgin Islands to the United States not only of petroleum products refined from mainland oil, but of <em>all </em>products manufactured or processed in the Virgin Islands of constituent elements brought from the United States. For we are not convinced that the facts of the Alaska crude oil trade, or of the petroleum trade generally, are so particularized as to distinguish that trade from other forms of trade carried on between the Virgin Islands and the United States.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-11\">Even more significantly, a holding favorable to appellants in this case would jeopardize innumerable foreign industries, in lands other than the Virgin Islands, that rely both on American sources of supply for raw materials and on the vast American market for re-export. For a holding in favor of appellants would seriously undermine the general proposition, on which significant sectors of world trade rely, that goods exported from the United States to undergo substantial processing or manufacture abroad before re-entering the American market are, upon their re-entry, new and different products not subject to the Jones Act prohibition.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">In a world of increasingly complex and interdependent patterns of commerce, no court should rush to erect new and formidable trade barriers without clearest guidance from other, accountable branches of Government. Though appellants here seek a limited decision, we believe that the decision they seek could not logically or practically be bound to its particular facts and that its effects could bring serious harm to the foreign commerce of the United States and to other foreign shores and markets. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>For compelling reasons of both law and policy, we decline to set in motion such an unwarranted and unwanted train of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">IV. THE NON-APPLICABILITY TO THIS CASE OF THE MAGNUSON AMENDMENT TO THE PORTS AND WATERWAYS SAFETY ACT OF 1972</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">In addition to the argument advanced by appellants American Maritime Association and Shipbuilders Council, the Seafarers Union contends that \u201cquite apart from the Jones Act, for environmental purposes, the carriage of TAPS<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> oil in the coastwise trade is confined to American vessels and . the carriage of that oil by foreign tankers in the coastwise trade is illegal.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Seafarers draws this argument from the Magnuson Amendment,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> which was introduced to advance the date for environmental rules and regulations applicable under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 <footnotemark>66</footnotemark> to U.S.-flag vessels in the coastwise trade. This was accomplished by differentiating between foreign and U.S. vessels in the foreign trade on one hand, and U.S. vessels in the coastwise trade on the other, by inserting two clauses and adding a sentence to the existing law, thus (amendment italicized):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-7\">(C) Rules and regulations published pursuant to subsection (7)(A) shall be effective not earlier than January 1, 1974, <em>with respect to foreign vessels and United States-flag vessels operating in the foreign trade, </em>unless the Secretary shall earlier establish rules and regulations consonant with international treaty, convention, or agreement, which generally address the regulation of similar topics for the protection of the marine environment. In absence of the promulgation of such rules and regulations consonant with international treaty, convention, or agreement, the Secretary shall establish an effective date not later than January 1, 1976, <em>with respect to foreign vessels and United States-flag vessels operating in the foreign trade, </em>for rules and regulations previously published pursuant to this subsection (7) which he then deems appropriate. <em>Rules and regulations published pursuant to subsection (7)(A) shall be effective not later than June SO, 1974, with respect to United States-flag vessels engaged in the coastwise trade.</em><footnotemark><em>67</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-12\">From this Seafarers Union argues that there are only three types of vessels covered: foreign vessels in the U.S. foreign trade, U.S. vessels in the same trade, and U.S. vessels in the coastwise <em>trade </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that there is a singular omission of U.S. vessels in the continental United States-Virgin Islands trade, which, by \u00a7 21 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, is <em>not </em>within the coastwise trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-13\">From this the Seafarers Union further argues that \u201cthe TAPS act and particularly its Magnuson Amendment, was an environmental law, not a coastwise law, and that since the Virgin Islands exemption from the Jones Act applied only to the coastwise, cabotage, laws, there was no Virgin Islands exemption in the clear Congressional mandate in the TAPS Act that, for environmental reasons, only American vessels could carry TAPS oil in the coastwise trade.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> We agree with the Seafarers Union that the Magnuson Amendment dealt with an environmental law, not a coastwise law, but we cannot find the rationale for the rest of its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>First, it is clear, as Seafarers Union itself points out, that the environmental provisions of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a apply to all vessels entering the navigable waters of the United States which have on board a cargo of oil. This includes, of course, the Virgin Islands.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> In other words, the ship <em>Hercules, </em>of foreign registry, is completely subject to U.S. environmental laws while in U.S. navigable waters near Valdez, the Virgin Islands, or the continental United States. The Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, as amended by the Magnuson Amendment, applies broadly and clearly to \u201c[a]ll vessels . . . which are documented under the laws of the United States <em>or enter the navigable waters of the United States . . </em>. .\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The <em>Hercules </em>is such a vessel, and thus is covered by the amendment and by its environmental provisions.-<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">Second, and fundamentally, the purpose of the Magnuson Amendment had nothing whatsoever to do with restricting foreign vessels in American maritime commerce. True, there is much dialogue on the Congressional floor in regard to the carriage of the Alaskan crude by American vessels in the \u201cmaritime leg\u201d of the oil transport, but in every instance brought to our attention, the maritime leg in the contemplation of the speaker was from Valdez to a West Coast continental United States port, where the Jones Act clearly would have required an American-flag vessel to be used.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The purpose of the Magnuson Amendment was simply to advance the effective date for rules and regulations in regard to the coast-wise trade, pursuant to 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(7)(A), to be effective not later than 30 June 1974. Actually, since there was a delay in the flow of Alaskan oil through the pipeline, both this advanced date and the effective date for the environmental rules and regulations pertaining to the foreign trade vessels, both U.S. and foreign, arrived before there was any oil to be carried anyway. The Magnuson Amendment thus had no practical effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">Third, no negative inference can be drawn from the arguable omission of the <em>Hercules </em>and like vessels from the reach of the amendments. In light of the Virgin Islands exemption from United States coastwise laws,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> a vessel transporting goods from the mainland United States to the Virgin Islands arguably is engaged in an anomalous species of \u201cforeign trade,\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and thus falls within the class of \u201cforeign vessels . . . operating in the foreign trade\u201d to which the Magnuson Amendment specifically applies.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">Finally, fundamentally, and devastatingly, there is not one word in the Magnuson Amendment or any part of the whole TAPS Act which explicitly commands that only U.S.-flag vessels be used in the transport of Alaskan crude. The Virgin Islands exception to the Jones Act is not cited and is certainly not repealed by these environmental amendments. The most that can be said, and really this is all Seafarers\u2019 brief says, is that various Congressmen <em>assumed </em>that, because of the requirements of the Jones Act and because they were thinking in terms of West Coast U.S. ports, only American vessels would be involved in the transport of Alaskan crude to the United States. But this assumption was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>written into law, and it is highly doubtful, given the obvious powerful economic and political forces lined up on either side of the Virgin Islands exemption from the coast-wise laws question, whether it could have been. Certainly all efforts to repeal the Jones Act Virgin Islands exemption have failed, as discussed above.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\">In summary, if the TAPS Act and the Magnuson Amendment particularly are considered as separate statutes with a separate environmental purpose, as appellant urges and with which we agree, then there is not one word in that statute which restricts the carriage of Alaskan crude oil to American-flag vessels. To find such a restriction in the United States Code, one must resort to the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, and there one simultaneously finds the exemption of the Virgin Islands from the coastwise trade, without which the coastwise trade restriction would otherwise govern the carriage of Alaskan crude from Valdez to any U.S. territory port. The Magnuson Amendment simply has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the case is</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1229-11\"><em>. </em>Pub.L.No.66-261, 41 Stat. 988, ch. 250 (5 June 1920), as amended, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 861-89 (1970 &amp; Supp. V 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1229-12\"><em>. </em>Merchant Marine Act of 1920, \u00a7 27, 41 Stat. 999, as amended, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 883 (Supp. V 1975).

But the task of construing words of a statute and applying those words to an actual commercial situation, in light also of policy concerns and the reasonableness of a statute\u2019s particular application, is precisely what we are called upon to do in this case. The task is a recurrent one for lawyers, and though the relevant considerations may be \u201cabstract,\u201d <em>see id., </em>they are decidedly not \u201cirrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-13\">Appellant argues, for example, that the process of refining oil is insignificant because it merely \u201cseparates . . . molecules according to their boiling points\u201d and leaves the fundamental physical \u201cmatter\u201d of the oil the same. <em>See id. </em>at 3. The issue, it' is contended, is reducible merely to \u201cwhether one regards the whole (crude oil) as being more or less than the sum of its parts (the products).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. We would state the question differently. The issue is not whether the whole of a particular substance is <em>more or less than its parts, </em>but whether after a refining or manufacturing process which, for example, breaks the substance down into constituent elements or combines it with other elements to create new substances, the product remains largely the <em>same </em>in such respects as form, composition, value or function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-15\">In a complex physical world in which matter is constantly being transformed into other forms, appellants\u2019 simplistic argument concerning the identity of physical \u201cmatter\u201d after a refining process would prove too much. It would compel the conclusion that because of the innumerable forms which matter may take, no degree of transformation of one good into another changes the essential nature of that good and its by-products. For practical and commercial purposes, however, this is not correct. In commercial usage, for example, sea water is not the same as the hydrogen, oxygen, and various chemicals and minerals into which it- can be broken down, and a soft drink bottled for sale is not the \u201csame\u201d as the water, sweeteners, and other substances from which it is made. Of course the opposite argument can also be taken too far: that even the slightest alteration of a substance (for example, perhaps, the mere bottling of spring water) effects a \u201cnew and different product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-17\">Thus the precise point at which a substance subjected to an altering process becomes \u201cdifferent\u201d eludes simple definition; attempts at a universal description would lead into metaphysical realms which a court should fear to enter. But we submit that along a spectrum of possible change for any particular item, there exists a point \u2014 determinable perhaps only through experience and subject to change through time and circumstance \u2014 at which that item, when altered in some substantial respect, becomes new and different. The fact, for example, that the oil in the present case may increase little in market value after processing, <em>see </em>Brief for Appellant American Maritime Association at 5, is not dispositive, because value is only one of the considerations that a court must make in determining if a product has changed through processing. Common sense and experience\u2014 the best guides to courts \u2014 will aid the determination of the point at which substantial change has occurred in particular cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b1235-18\">. This holding should come as no surprise to appellants, since it coincides with their own, earlier interpretation of the implications of the Merchant Marine Act for the Virgin Islands oil trade. <em>See </em>page-of 192 U.S.App.D.C., page 1167 of 590 F.2d &amp; note 57 <em>infra </em>(statement of Executive Director of appellant American Maritime Association).</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-21\">This holding also is consistent with \u201cletter rulings\u201d of the Customs Service in the past on transshipment issues under the Jones Act.

In these rulings the degree to which a product has been altered by processing at the point of transshipment has generally been dispositive of whether the continuity of its transportation has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>been broken at that point and of whether the product, for purposes of the Jones Act, is the same or different \u201cmerchandise\u201d upon re-entry to the United States. <em>See </em>rulings of 17 Oct. 1938; 15 Jan. 1963; 6 July 1964; 9 Sept. 1964; 22 Nov. 1968; 18 March 1969; 7 July 1969; 6 Oct. 1971; 12 Feb. 1975; rulings <em>reprinted in </em>Brief for Appellant Shipbuilders Council app. at 3a-30a. <em>Cf. </em>Schedule 8, Part 1, of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202 (\u201cAny product of the United States which is returned after having been advanced in value or improved in condition abroad by any process of manufacture or other means, or any imported article which has been assembled abroad in whole or in part of products of the United States, shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as a foreign article . . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">.

The court also must reject appellants\u2019 argument, urged at length, that the present case is governed by domestic commerce clause cases. <em>See, e. g., </em>Brief for Appellant American Maritime Association at 25-32; Brief for Appellant Shipbuilders Council at 32-33. To support the contention that the refining of oil at St. Croix fails to interrupt the flow of that oil between points in the United States for purposes of the Jones Act, appellants cite the venerable line of early twentieth century cases which sustained congressional power to regulate allegedly intrastate economic activity because of the flow of subject goods in inter-state commerce. See, e. <em>g., Bd. of Trade of the City of Chicago </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>262 U.S. 1, 43 S.Ct. 470, 67 L.Ed. 839 (1922) (federal regulation of grain traders upheld despite interruption of transit of grain within state for storing and processing); <em>Stafford v.

ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 526, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911) (food stuffs of local manufacturers subject to federal regulation because of sale for export);' <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>196 U.S. 375, 25 S.Ct. 276, 49 L.Ed. 518 (1905). But in citing such authority, appellants misconceive the issue of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">The issue here is not whether Congress has the power to regulate a particular flow of commerce, but whether it has <em>exercised that power </em>in a particular case. The fact that an interruption to the flow of goods in inter-state commerce does not oust federal regulatory power does not suggest that Congress intended that all regulatory statutes it enacts in the commercial area be applied to every imaginable perambulation of commercial goods. Though manufacture or processing of a product may be too \u201cincidental\u201d to interrupt the flow of commerce generally, such alteration in the nature of the goods may yet be substantial enough to exempt those goods from the intended reach of a particular statute. If Congress wishes to confine the shipping of Alaskan oil to American vessels, it may do so; if it wishes to lift the Virgin Islands exception from the coastwise laws, it may do so; and if Congress wishes to set conditions to the mode of re-entry to this country of goods manufactured abroad of American components, doubtless it may do so. But it has <em>not </em>yet done these things, and it is not for this court to construe a statute passed for more limited purposes so as to assume these tasks itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">. Substantial economic and political interests both oppose and support this policy. The trial judge in the present case acknowledged, for example, that continued use of foreign vessels by petroleum companies involved in the Virgin Islands trade would injure the American marine industry. He noted that because of lower costs of foreign flag tankers, \u201ca substantial amount of trade will be diverted from the American shipping industry\u201d and \u201cAmerican ship owners and operators, shipbuilders, and seamen will lose significant business and suffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>economic harm.\u201d <em>American Maritime Association et al. v. Blumenthal et </em>al., <em>supra, </em>at 855. The petroleum industry, on the other hand, has an interest in controlling costs and in making full use of existing refinery facilities, <em>see </em>Brief of Appellee Hess Corp. at 4-5 (describing costly investments in refineries on St. Croix), and presumably the Virgin Islands and business and other interests associated with the Islands have an interest in continuing to enjoy the stimulative effect on Virgin Islands commerce of the coastwise laws exemption. The economic and other interests at stake may have been quite different in 1936 when the Merchant Marine Act was amended to provide for that exemption. <em>See Hearings on S. 754 before the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, </em>74th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (26 March 1936) (testimony of E. Gruening for Dep\u2019t of Interior) (purpose of exemption to enhance \u201cbunkering\u201d trade on St. Thomas Island); <em>id. </em>at 21 (testimony of Governor of Virgin Islands) (no purpose to affect \u201cunderlying economy\u201d of St. Croix). Yet the relevant consideration today is that economic development has occurred and substantial investments made in reliance on this exemption, which both Congress and the President have seen fit to keep in force. <em>See </em>note 56 <em>infra </em>(statutory role of President).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">. The President plays a decisive role in the continuing exemption of the Virgin Islands from the coastwise laws because the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 provides for such exemption \u201cuntil the President of the United States shall, by proclamation, declare that such coast-wise laws shall extend to the Virgin Islands and fix a date for the going into effect of same.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 877. The President to date has issued no such proclamation. This delegation of authority by Congress to the President, however, provides a second focus for attempts to lift that exemption through political channels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b1239-10\">. <em>See </em>letter of 15 September 1971, <em>reprinted in </em>Jt.App. at 926.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">. <em>See Hearings on S. 2422, \u201cAn Act to Amend the Merchant Marine Act of 1920,\u201d </em>94th Cong., 1st Sess.

The only special factors that can be cited with regard to the Alaskan crude oil trade are export restrictions on Alaskan oil, <em>see </em>note 9 <em>supra, </em>and environmental laws specially enacted to guard against environmental injury from the Alaskan oil trade, <em>see </em>pages---of 192 U.S.App.D.C., pages 1169-1171 of 590 F.2d &amp; notes 63-76 <em>infra. </em>But export restrictions are not unique to Alaskan oil and do not, in any event, apply to the Virgin Islands, which has the peculiar status of a \u201cpossession\u201d of the United States exempt from U.S. \u201ccoastwise laws.\u201d Though these export restrictions do have the effect of ensuring that oil shipped by Hess does not enter the stream of foreign commerce, this fact is relevant only to the question of the shipper\u2019s intent concerning eventual destination of carried goods \u2014 a consideration which we have stated elsewhere is irrelevant to the present case. See pages---of 192 U.S.App.D.C., page 1164 of 590 F.2d &amp; notes 39-42 <em>supra. </em>We also find that the environmental laws cited by appellant Seafarers Union have no bearing on the present case, <em>see </em>pages ---of 192 U.S.App.D.C., pages 1169-1171 of 590 F.2d &amp; notes 63-76 <em>infra, </em>and that those laws certainly do not distinguish Alaskan oil from other goods carried to and from the Virgin Islands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b1240-14\">.
