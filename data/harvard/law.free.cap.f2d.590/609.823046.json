Appellant also urges the recusal of eight judges of this court who were panel members in prior appeals of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>conventional appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of this diversity action for slander and libel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against appellant\u2019s former employer, Southern Methodist University (SMU), and his former attorneys, James A. Johnston and Robert E. Alexander, III. We hold that the district court\u2019s dismissal for want of prosecution was not an abuse of discretion and affirm the judgment. The failure of the district judge to consider the motion for recusal is not reversible error. Appellant\u2019s motion for recusal of members of this court is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Appellant <em>pro </em>se filed his complaint on March 3, 1975. Appellees filed various motions for dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(l, 6) and a more definite statement under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(e). Appellant then filed a \u201cPreliminary Answer to Defendant SMU\u2019s Motion for More Definitive Statement, and My Motion for Discovery.\u201d His \u201cMotion for Discovery\u201d was a request for any documents or files pertaining to him in SMU\u2019s possession pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 34. On August 6,1975, appellant filed with supporting affidavit a \u201cMotion for Production of Documents by Defendant Southern Methodist University.\u201d SMU resisted the motion by claiming that the documents were privileged as work product under Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(l, 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">After an untimely interlocutory appeal, <em>Hepperle v. Southern Methodist University, </em>526 F.2d 1257 (5th Cir. 1976), and a successful appeal from an order of dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>Hepperle v. Johnston, </em>544 F.2d 201 (5th Cir. 1976), appellant was noticed for deposition in Dallas but failed to appear on four separate occasions over a five month period. During this time, appellant was residing in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida. He was given advance notice of from five to fifteen days to appear for his depositions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After his first failure to appear, appellant filed a motion on July 25, 1977, for a protective order under Fed.R. Civ.P. 26(c)(l, 2), seeking to delay the taking of his deposition because of inconvenience and unfairness to him. The alleged inconvenience was that in view of appellant\u2019s duties as a landlord, travel during the summer months presented a hardship. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>alleged unfairness was that he was being asked to submit to questioning about an allegedly slanderous and libelous publication which SMU had refused to produce for his inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">On July 26,1977, appellant moved for the recusal of the district judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (1976),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alleging bias and prejudice. The district court did not rule on appellant\u2019s motion for recusal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The district court did grant appellees\u2019 motions to compel appellant to submit to deposition under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a). On September 7, 1977, the court entered an order compelling appellant\u2019s appearance for deposition before October 1, 1977. Appellees, on September 13, 1977, filed notice to take appellant\u2019s deposition on September 23, 1977. Having received no ruling on his earlier motion for a protective order, appellant filed with this court on September 21, 1977, a \u201cMotion for Stay Pending Review\u201d which was denied on October 27, 1977. On October 4, 1977, the court entered an order compelling appellant to appear for deposition on October 24, 1977. Appellant\u2019s \u201cReply to Judge Porter\u2019s Order of October 4, 1977,\u201d mailed on October 19, 1977, and filed with the clerk on October 25, 1977, explained that October 24 was an inconvenient date because he was required to attend a hearing in Panama City, Florida, on the same date. On November 10, 1977, the court entered an order compelling appellant\u2019s deposition on November 21, 1977, with the following threat: <em>\u201cIf </em>the plaintiff again fails to appear for deposition, the court will consider dismissal of this case for lack of prosecution.\u201d Appellant filed a \u201cReply to Order of November 10, 1977\u201d on November 17,' 1977, stating his intention not to appear for the November 21 deposition pending a ruling on his \u201cApplication for Stay\u201d to Mr. Justice Powell.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">The action was dismissed by the court sua <em>sponte </em>for lack of prosecution when appellant failed to appear for deposition on November 21, 1977. In its \u201cMemorandum of Opinion\u201d filed in support of the judgment of dismissal, the court stated that no action had been taken on appellant\u2019s discovery motions because the motions \u201ccould have been stricken under Rule 12(f) as redundant, impertinent and scandalous.\u201d No reference was made to the motion for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Rule 41(b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> authorizes the district court to dismiss with prejudice an action for want of prosecution by the plaintiff. <em>Link v. Wabash R. R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 629, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961). However, involuntary dismissal \u201cis a drastic remedy to which a court may resort only in extreme circumstances.\u201d <em>Silas v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Inc., </em>586 F.2d 382 (5th Cir. 1978). We have approved the sanction only where there is \u201ca clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Durham v. Florida East Coast R. R. Co., </em>385 F.2d 366, 368 (5th Cir. 1967). <em>See also, e. g., Graves v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Co., </em>528 F.2d 1360 (5th Cir. 1976). Our review is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>limited to whether the district court\u2019s dismissal was an abuse of discretion. <em>Flaksa v. Little River Marine Construction Co., </em>389 F.2d 885, 887 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The district court rested its dismissal upon appellant\u2019s repeated failures to appear for deposition. The instant case is controlled by <em>Durgin v. Graham, </em>372 F.2d 130 (5th Cir. 1967). In <em>Durgin, </em>we upheld dismissal for lack of prosecution, where the plaintiffs willfully refused to appear for the taking of their depositions. <em>Id. </em>at 131. In the instant case appellant not only exhibited a pattern of delay, but also received a warning of dismissal and refused to obey court orders to appear. <em>See Ramsay v. Bailey, </em>531 F.2d 706, 709 (5th Cir. 1976). Since appellant was acting <em>pro se, </em>he cannot attribute his dereliction of duty to another. <em>See Flaksa, </em>389 F.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Appellant claims that the district court\u2019s dismissal was an abuse of discretion, because of the court\u2019s refusal to rule on his various motions. Appellant filed a motion to compel SMU\u2019s production of documents pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 34, before he was noticed for deposition. Appellant filed a motion for a protective order to postpone the taking of his deposition pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c)(l, 3), after he received his first notice for deposition. The court\u2019s inaction on appellant\u2019s motion did not relieve him of the duty to appear for his deposition. <em>Cf. Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835 n. 46, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1974); <em>Martinez-McBean v. Government of Virgin Islands, </em>562 F.2d 908, 913 (3rd Cir. 1977). Moreover, as the Ninth Circuit has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">Rule 30(b) places the burden on the proposed deponent to get an order, not just to make a motion. And if there is not time to have his motion heard, the least that he can be expected to do is to get an order postponing the time of the deposition until his motion can be heard. He might also appear and seek to adjourn the deposition until an order can be obtained. But unless he has obtained a court order that postpones or dispenses with his duty to appear, that duty remains.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-13\"><em>Pioche Mines Consolidated, Inc. v. Dolman, </em>333 F.2d 257, 269 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">Appellant urges that the district court\u2019s failure to rule on his motion for recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (1976) constitutes reversible error. We disagree. Although the court erred in failing to pass on the sufficiency of the affidavit, see <em>Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, </em>517 F.2d 1044, 1051 (5th Cir. 1975), the error is not reversible, because the affidavit is clearly insufficient as a matter of law. <em>See United States v. Torbert, </em>496 F.2d 154, 157 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1974). \u201c[T]he facts alleged in the affidavit must show that the judge\u2019s bias is personal, as opposed to judicial, in nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Archbold-Newball, </em>554 F.2d 665, 682 (5th Cir. 1977). Appellant\u2019s affidavit is barren of factual allegations of personal bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">Appellant further urges by an original motion filed with this court the disqualification of members of this court who have served on panels in prior reviews of this case. Appellant incorrectly bases his motion upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (1976), which by its terms applies only to district judges. <em>See Millslagle v. Olson, </em>128 F.2d 1015 (8th Cir. 1942). Construing the <em>pro se </em>motion liberally as a motion for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 (1974),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we deny the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>motion. The standard for determining whether a judge should disqualify himself under \u00a7 455 is whether a reasonable person knowing all the facts would conclude that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. <em>Davis, </em>517 F.2d at 1052. The \u00a7 455 determination, like the \u00a7 144 determination, should rest upon extra-judicial rather than judicial conduct. <em>Id. </em>Appellant\u2019s grievance against members of this court concerns only judicial conduct: he complains of prior rulings by the court. Such allegations are insufficient grounds for disqualification. <em>See United States v. Partin, </em>552 F.2d 621, 637 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Cowden, </em>545 F.2d 257, 265 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 1181, 51 L.Ed.2d 585 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the action for want of prosecution was not an abuse of discretion and its failure to consider the motion for recusal was not reversible error. Appellant\u2019s motion for disqualification of members of this court is without merit and is, therefore, denied. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-17\">. By motion filed on December 28, 1977, appellant seeks recusal because of \u201cpersonal bias or prejudice\u201d of Judges Clark, Dyer, Fay, God-bold, Goldberg, Hill, Roney and Thomberry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\">. Mr. Hepperle first appealed the district court\u2019s August 19, 1975, order dismissing the action against Mr. Alexander and SMU. The appeal was dismissed as interlocutory. <em>Hepperle </em>v. <em>Southern Methodist University, </em>526 F.2d 1257, 1259 (5th Cir. 1976). After the district court entered an order declaring the prior interlocutory order of dismissal to be a final judgment, we reversed the dismissal and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Hepperle v. Johnston, </em>544 F.2d 201, 203 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Thereafter, Mr. Hepperle filed three original jurisdiction motions with this court styled \u201cMANDAMUS,\u201d \u201cMOTION FOR CHANGE OF VENUE,\u201d and \u201cMOTION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL.\u201d The motion styled \u201cMANDAMUS\u201d sought to compel the district judge to issue discovery orders and to recuse himself. Treating the \u201cMANDAMUS\u201d and \u201cMOTION FOR CHANGE OF VENUE\u201d as a petition for writ of mandamus, we denied the petition in part and dismissed the petition in part without prejudice. <em>Hepperle </em>v. Southern <em>Methodist University, et al., </em>560 F.2d 1021 (5th Cir. 1977) (unpublished). We followed \u201cthe general rule that mandamus is not available to review the denial of a discovery order if the aggrieved party has an adequate remedy by appeal from the final judgment of the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. The petition was held to be premature with regard to the recusal motion, because Mr. Hepperle had not yet filed the affidavit required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (1976). The \u201cMOTION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL\u201d was denied on October 27, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-11\">. In his complaint, appellant alleges that SMU maintains a \u201clibelous file\u201d on him, has \u201cslandered me and threatened to further publish their slander if I sued them (blackmail),\u201d that appellee Johnston\u2019s agent \u201crecklessly published SMU\u2019s slander,\u201d that appellee Johnston attempted \u201cblackmailing me into allowing him to breach his contract with me,\u201d and that appellee Alexander \u201chas suppressed evidence of Johnston\u2019s wrongdoing.\u201d We have previously characterized the action as one based upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976). <em>Hepperle v. Southern Methodist University, </em>526 F.2d 1257, 1258 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b683-12\">.
