The Commission found that the petitioner was not financially qualified, as required by \u00a7 308(b) of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 308(b)), because it had not presented reasonable assurance that a $4 million bank loan would be available to finance construction and operation of the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-28\">Multi-State filed its application with the FCC on May 1, 1972. Accompanying this application was a Chase Manhattan Bank letter signed by Kaye H. Jones, a vice president of the bank. The letter was intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>by Multi-State to demonstrate that it fulfilled FCC requirements of financial qualification, namely that it had funds available to construct the station and to operate it for three months without relying on revenue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The bank letter stated in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">\u2022 We are willing to lend you up to $4,000,-000 provided the following conditions are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-5\">(1) You are successful in obtaining approval from the Federal Communications Commission to construct and operate a television broadcast station on VHF Channel 9 in New York City; and, \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-6\">(2) All reasonable and ordinary credit criteria of the Chase Manhattan Bank are met at such time as you (a) have received the license to operate said station; and (b) request from the Chase Manhattan Bank a formal lending commitment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">While the pricing and terms of amortization of any loan commitment will of course be contingent upon the exact credit conditions prevailing at the time of such commitment, we contemplate calculating interest on any loan made at the rate of 2% above the prime rate of this bank at the time of each advance (for information, the prime rate of this bank is presently 5%); and, any loan made will be repaid, after a one year moratorium on principal repayment as necessary, in eight equal, semi-annual installments or as otherwise reasonable in line with financial projections received prior to the time of borrowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">This bank is personally and favorably acquainted with several of the stockholders listed in your application to the Federal Communications Commission. As a condition of our intent to finance Multi-State Communications, Inc., we are depending on the continued participation in your venture of substantially all of the stockholders named in your application or substitute stockholders which are acceptable to the Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-12\">The incumbent licensee, RKO General, Inc., intervenor here, had also applied for renewal of its license. Because RKO\u2019s and Multi-State\u2019s applications were mutually exclusive, they were set for a consolidated hearing at which several issues were designated to be aired. In its order designating issues the FCC stated that \u201cMulti-State has established the availability of the $4,000,000 bank loan from the Chase Manhattan Bank.\u201d However, because the letter was silent on the question of collateral, one of the issues set for hearing was to determine whether Chase Manhattan would require collateral and whether Multi-State could comply with any such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-13\">Subsequently to the designation of issues and before the hearing, RKO was permitted to depose Jones, the author of the bank letter upon which Multi-State relied. On the basis of the contents of this deposition, the FCC Review Board added an issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqe\">To determine whether Multi-State Communications, Inc. will have available a $4,000,000 loan to finance its construction and first three months\u2019 operating expenses, and, in light thereof, whether Multi-State Communications, Inc. is financially qualified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1190-14\">Because the presiding administrative law judge felt that the resolution of this issue was likely to be dispositive of Multi-State\u2019s application, he ordered the single issue to be heard before the other designated issues.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hearing consisted mainly of Jones\u2019 testimony. On the basis of that testimony, the administrative law judge concluded that Multi-State had failed to carry its burden of proving that there was reasonable assurance that the bank loan would be available. Because the loan was an essential part of Multi-State\u2019s proposed financing, the ALJ held that the absence of the loan rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>Multi-State financially disqualified. The findings and conclusions of the ALJ were subsequently affirmed by the FCC<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and this appeal followed. After carefully scrutinizing Jones\u2019 testimony and the remainder of the evidence, we are of the opinion that the record evidence does not support the Commission\u2019s holding that Multi-State had failed to establish its \u2022 financial qualifications to be a licensee. Consequently we reverse and remand for further proceedings in which the petitioner is not regarded as disqualified for financial reasons on the basis of the unavailability of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">It is clear that the administrative law judge based his findings of lack of qualification on Jones\u2019 testimony. These findings were adopted by the Commission and formed the basis for the Commission\u2019s dismissal of Multi-State\u2019s application. Close scrutiny of that testimony reveals, however, that Jones did not state that the letter of intent was no longer operative in accordance with its terms. In fact, when asked if this was \u201ca viable, subsisting letter which Chase Manhattan now regards as outstanding to Multi-State Communications,\u201d Jones responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Jones did testify that the bank did not consider the letter a final and binding commitment in the sense that the bank was legally obligated to make the loan under any and all circumstances, but the Commission concedes that it does not require a legally binding commitment. A \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that the loan will be available is all that the Commission requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">The testimony of Jones also established that the letter did not represent an intention to make a loan based upon the continuation of the existence of facts as they existed at the time of the letter. The Commission construed this portion of the testimony as an indication that the letter was devoid of significance. However, this conclusion ignores Jones\u2019 testimony that the final decision on the loan could not be made in advance because the bank was precisely interested in the situation as it would exist at the time that Multi-State received the grant from the Commission to operate the station. Obviously, then, the bank\u2019s present lack of information about certain aspects of Multi-State\u2019s \u201ccredit-worthiness\u201d does not undercut the import of the letter. When Multi-State\u2019s attorney asked Jones whether \u201c[i]t would be an exercise in futility . to assemble materials of the sort indicated here, when such materials might be entirely passe and outdated many months in the future at such time as the condition in here is met, namely a grant to Multi-State,\u201d Jones responded: \u201cWe look at the situation as of a specific point in time, when we are putting up the money, yes, sir.\u201d Nor is it of crucial importance that further actions remained to be taken by the bank before the loan would be finalized. For if the need for additional information and further action could be said to render the bank letter worthless, then the Commission has in essence required a legally binding commitment at the same time that it professes to require something less.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">The letter did not purport to be a legally binding loan commitment and Jones\u2019 testimony made this clear. Consequently, he testified that he did \u201cnot wish to start defining a loan proposition that would take place in the future that was not a commitment that would start taking on the aspects of a commitment.\u201d For this reason, he had been unwilling previously to alter the letter to include a provision for collateral. Yet he insisted that the bank stood upon the letter as written, that all of the conditions affecting the loan were contained within the four corners of the letter, and that \u201cthe time that we are looking forward to consider it [is] the time that these conditions are operative.\u201d By the terms of the letter, the conditions do not become operative until the grant of the license, at which time MultiState is to request a formal lending commitment and meet \u201c[a]ll reasonable and ordinary credit criteria\u201d of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>We construe Jones\u2019 testimony as establishing that the bank had gone as far as it could under the circumstances in providing reasonable assurance that the loan would be made short of making a legally binding loan commitment. Jones expressed the bank\u2019s continuing willingness to lend up to $4 million, as stated in the first sentence of the letter. It is common business practice for transactions to proceed on just this type of letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">The Chase bank letter was initially accepted by the Commission as indicating a present firm intention to make the loan. The administrative law judge\u2019s initial decision acknowledges this fact. It was only the erroneous belief that Jones\u2019 testimony somehow modified the meaning of the letter that led the judge and then the Commission to alter this belief. Indeed, no one contends that the letter on its face is inadequate by the Commission\u2019s standards to constitute proof of financial qualification. Because we hold that the Commission erred in construing the import of Jones\u2019 testimony, that letter should have been accepted by the Commission as satisfying its requirement of reasonable assurance that the loan would be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1190-9\">. This is the standard enunciated by the Commission in <em>Orange Nine, Inc., </em>7 FCC 2d 788 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1190-10\"><em>. </em>On appeal Multi-State asserts that the isolation of one issue for hearing and decision in advance of the others violated its statutory right to due process. Our resolution of the substantive issue makes it unnecessary for us to consider this and another procedural issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">. The Commission ordered the presiding judge to resume hearings on the issues relating to RKO\u2019s renewal application. These hearings have now been held and an initial decision granting the renewal application for RKO has been issued. The matter is now pending before the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1192-6\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aj5\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">I would remand the case for consideration of a second financial commitment presented to the FCC by Multi-State in May, 1977. Although produced late in the proceeding, the second commitment was submitted before the Commission\u2019s order was final.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court has recognized that such late presentations, when changing a \u201ccore\u201d circumstance of the case and when supported by equitable considerations, can be accepted by the FCC without disturbing the value of administrative finality.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A second commitment would clearly affect the core circumstances of the case. Moreover, the issues raised by Multi-State\u2019s appeal were substantial, as the majority decision today demonstrates, and the difficulties of acquiring a second financial commitment were also substantial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, I cannot say that Multi-State\u2019s delay in obtaining the second commitment bars its consideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1192-8\">. The FCC order was under judicial review at the time the Commission confronted the second financial commitment, RKO General, Inc., FCC 78-96 (Feb. 22, 1978). <em>See Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>149 U.S.App.D.C. 322, 336, 463 F.2d 268, 282 (1971), <em>cert. denied sub nom. WHDH, Inc. v. FCC, </em>406 U.S. 950, 92 S.Ct. 2042, 32 L.Ed.2d 338 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1192-9\">. <em>Crosthwait v. FCC, </em>1-89 U.S.App.D.C. 392, at 396-398, 584 F.2d 550, at 554-556, (1978); <em>Fleming v. FCC, </em>96 U.S.App.D.C. 223, 225 F.2d 523 (1955); <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, supra, </em>at 337, 463 F.2d at 283.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1192-20\">. Additional factors appear in the background of this case which may not, by themselves, mandate a remand, but which touch directly on the question of fairness to Multi-State. RKO General, the incumbent licensee, was a major customer of Chase Manhattan. This potential conflict of interest shadows the bank officer\u2019s failure to review the creditworthiness of MultiState before issuing the letter, and his subsequent testimony on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
