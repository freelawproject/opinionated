ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1144-25\">Humana of South Carolina, Inc., a proprietary hospital, asserts procedural, statutory and constitutional challenges to a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare limiting the rate of return on equity capital recoverable as a cost item by providers of services under the Medicare Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court assumed jurisdiction, rejected Humana\u2019s procedural objection, ruled in its favor on the statutory ground and accordingly declined to reach its constitutional arguments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that the court lacked power to entertain the statutory contentions because Humana failed to pursue available administrative procedures furnishing the exclusive approach to judicial review of claims such as these. We affirm the District Court\u2019s disposition in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-27\">In 1965, Congress adopted the Medicare program to extend federal subsidization of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>medical care to the aged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hospital insurance coverage under Part A of the Medicare Act ordinarily is effected through cost-reimbursement directly to providers of services rather than to beneficiaries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Generally, reimbursement is handled by private organizations acting as fiscal intermediaries pursuant to contract with the Secretary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Amounts paid are dictated by the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of covered services or the provider\u2019s \u201ccustomary charge\u201d therefor, whichever is less.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">As originally enacted, the Medicare legislation made no provision for a return on equity capital to proprietary facilities. By virtue of his authority to promulgate regulations governing payment of \u201creasonable cost[s],\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> however, the Secretary undertook to afford a \u201cbonus factor\u201d \u2014 an allowance of two percent above costs otherwise recoverable \u2014 to all participating institutions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1966, Congress amended the Act by adding Section 1395x(v)(l)(B), which expressly recognized return on equity capital to proprietary skilled nursing facilities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In its report on the amending bill, the House Ways and Means Committee urged the Secretary to fashion regulations enabling a return for proprietary hospitals,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the rate therefor to be determined by resort to principles \u201ccomparable\u201d to those underlying Section 1395x(v)(l)(B), which in terms related only to skilled nursing facilities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Secretary issued a regulation to that end, incorporating for proprietary hospitals the maximum rate authorized in Section 1395x(v)(l)(B) for nursing institutions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-17\">Humana commenced suit in May 1975, predicating jurisdiction on the federal questions presented,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and two other statutory provisions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Its complaint sought an injunction against enforcement of the Secretaryis return-on-equity regulation for proprietary hospitals, a declaration of the regulation\u2019s incompatibility with the governing statute, and retroactive corrective adjustments in amounts theretofore paid under the regulation. Humana alleged tha;t reimbursement authorized by the regulation was so low as to contravene statutory principles mandating reimbursement of \u201creasonable costs\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and proscribing subsidization by non-Medicare patients of hospitalization costs<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of Medicare beneficiaries. Inadequate reimbursement was said also to constitute a taking of property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Humana challenged the Secretary\u2019s regulation on procedural grounds as well, asserting that it had been promulgated without required adherence to procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>The District Court took jurisdiction of all counts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It held that administrative prescriptions of the sort in issue are exempt from the procedural demands of the Administrative Procedure Act,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but that Humana had shown prima facie that the Secretary\u2019s regulation, in tying the maximum rate for proprietary hospitals to that statutorily set for proprietary skilled nursing facilities, operated to keep reimbursement<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> unreasonably. low. The court granted a summary judgment for Humana on the statutory ground without reaching the constitutional contentions<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and ordered the Secretary to conduct a study to determine a rate of return on equity capital for proprietary hospitals consonant with the principles under-girding the rate that Congress fixed for proprietary skilled nursing facilities.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">The Secretary appeals from the rulings on jurisdiction and statutory entitlement. In turn, Humana cross-appeals the determination on applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act to the contested regulation. We hold that the District Court lacked power to entertain Humana\u2019s substantive claims because of its failure to resort preliminarily to the administrative process erected by the Medicare Act. We reach a contrary conclusion in regard to Humana\u2019s procedural challenge, and on that issue we affirm the District Court on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">Jurisdiction of Humana\u2019s suit hangs on the interplay of several provisions of the Social Security Act. Section 205(h), directly applicable to Title II of the Act, ordains that the \u201cfindings and decisions of the Secretary after a hearing shall be binding\u201d upon all participants therein.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It further specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1146-15\">No findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided. No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 41 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1146-16\">In <em>Weinberger v. Salfi,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court construed Section 205(h) to intercept jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) \u2014 the successor to the Section mentioned<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u2014 over a constitutional assault on a duration-of-relationship requirement of the Social Security Act limiting eligibility of surviving wives and step-children for Social Security disability insurance benefits.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Court noted that the language of Section 205(h) is \u201csweeping and direct,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> precluding general federal-question jurisdiction under Section 1331(a) \u201cirrespective of whether resort to judicial processes is necessitated by discretionary decisions of the Secretary or by his nondiscretionary application of allegedly unconstitutional statutory restrictions.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> By operation of Section 205(h), the sole avenue to judicial review is that provided in Title II of the Social Security Act itself\u2014 Section 205(g),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> which exacts as a \u201cjurisdictional prerequisite\u201d a \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>Secretary.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Since that requirement, the Court added, is \u201csomething more than simply a codification of the judicially developed doctrine of exhaustion\u201d it could \u201cnot be dispensed with merely by a judicial conclusion of futility.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">Section 205(h) \u2014 and consequently <em>Salfi </em>\u2014has bearing on the litigation before us because it was incorporated into the Medicare Act by Section 1395\u00dc \u201cto the same extent . . . applicable ... to [Title II].\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Section 205(g), however, was borrowed only for limited purposes not here pertinent;<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the review procedure applicable to provider-reimbursement disputes is found in Section 1395oo.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Under that provision, administrative review must be obtained before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board when a provider is displeased with the total amount of reimbursement approved by its fiscal intermediary<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Following a \u201cfinal decision\u201d by the Board or a \u201creversal, affirmance, or modification\u201d thereof by the Secretary, a provider can press its claims in a federal court.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-22\">In <em>Association of American Medical Colleges v. </em>Califano,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> we construed Section 205(h), in light of <em>Salfi, </em>to foreclose jurisdiction under Section 1331(a) and to direct litigation through Section 1395oo in a suit challenging an administrative regulation limiting allowable reimbursement as inconsistent with the statutory mandate to recompense \u201creasonable costs.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>held that Section 205(h), in order to preserve the integrity of the statutory review process, shuts off all alternative routes to court \u201cwhen the Act\u2019s review procedures . allow judicial consideration of the particular action.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In such cases, \u201cbefore a suitor may obtain judicial consideration of a claim\u201d <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> \u201cseeking eventual realization of provider-cost reimbursement under the Medicare Act,\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> \u201che must first present the claim to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board and obtain a \u2018final decision\u2019 by it.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Humana endeavors to distinguish the present case from our decision in <em>American Medical Colleges </em>on several grounds, each of which we consider in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">Humana first points out that the regulation it seeks to nullify was promulgated in 1966, and asserts that it has been responsible for inadequate cost-reimbursement since that time. Moreover, the Provider Reimbursement Review Board is an available forum only with respect to claims for accounting periods ending on or after June 30, 1973.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As Humana seeks readjustment of its cost allowances for periods both before and after the creation of the Review Board, it asserts that jurisdiction lies for the whole of its suit. Denial of jurisdiction over this litigation, so the argument goes, would leave Humana completely without remedy for its pre-1973 claims, and its constitutional contentions would thus never be judicially evaluated. This problem was not presented in <em>American Medical Colleges, </em>which concerned only periods within the Review Board\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-14\">Several courts have addressed the questions of federal-court jurisdiction over Medicare actions arising before provision for effective judicial review following determinations by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board. These courts generally agree that the Supreme Court\u2019s approach to Section 1331(a) jurisdiction in <em>Salfi </em>was influenced by the availability there of judicial review under Section 205(g).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Accordingly, they have declined to construe Section 205(h) as barring all avenues to review of provider-reimbursement controversies prior to establishment of a statutory process culminating in judicial consideration of a provider\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> \u201cThat all decisions ultimately find a jurisdictional basis demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>strates,\u201d in the Seventh Circuit\u2019s view, \u201cthat there is little judicial quarrel with the proposition that, when constitutional questions are in issue, the courts generally will not read a statutory scheme as taking the extraordinary step of foreclosing jurisdiction unless Congress\u2019 intent to do so is manifested by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The existence of jurisdiction by some mode or another with respect to pre1973 provider actions is also suggested by pertinent legislative history<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">But Humana\u2019s suit, unlike those' just discussed, involves not only pre-1973 claims but also claims implicating periods susceptible to Review Board jurisdiction, and the same assertedly infirm regulation underlies each. The District Court assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the validity of the Secretary\u2019s regulation without differentiating between its pre-1973 and post-1973 effects, and the remedy it afforded is wholly prospective.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> We think that in permitting Humana to succeed in its broad-based legal assault on a reimbursement-limiting regulation without first resorting to the administrative process to the extent usable, the District Court sanctioned a circumvention of the congressional scheme. Whether or not Humana\u2019s pre-1973 claims for reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>bursement were reviewable by a statutorily-specified route, its post-1973 claims certainly were. And as our decision in <em>American Medical Colleges </em>\u2014 and, indirectly, the Supreme Court\u2019s in <em>Salfi </em>\u2014 make clear, any grievance respecting the amount of cost reimbursement due a provider must first be submitted for any administrative processing available under the Act\u2019s procedures.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">To be sure, that may be a fruitless pursuit even with respect to accounting periods amenable to Review Board adjudication, let alone those preceding. But because the requirement is \u201csomething more than simply a codification of the judicially developed doctrine of exhaustion,\u201d as the Supreme Court instructs it may \u201cnot be dispensed with merely by a judicial conclusion of futility.\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Congress has made the judgment that the Secretary in the first instance must decide whether any administrative relief is forthcoming, and the question grinds to a halt right there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">We do not mean to suggest that an administrative endeavor will necessarily turn out to be unrewarding. An unanticipated construction of a governing regulation by the Review Board, or a decision on grounds alternative to those advanced by the intermediary or provider,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> might well defy appearances of inanity. Even an adverse determination might be instructive to a reviewing court.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> And when, as here, operation of the same regulation is responsible for pre-1973 and post-1973 complaints alike, a determination on the latter may shed light on the former. Moreover, the Medicare provider-reimbursement deliberative process contemplates possible review by the Secretary of the Review Board\u2019s decision; <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and, as the Secretary suggested at oral argument, he can discretionarily confer relief for periods antedating the Review Board\u2019s jurisdiction or otherwise unobtainable from that body.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Thus Humana\u2019s assertion of pre-1973 claims cannot excuse, in the circumstances of this case, its failure to resort to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board before institution of its suit in the District Court.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">Humana asserts secondly that general federal-question jurisdiction extends to this case because its challenge is essentially procedural. As we have indicated, the District Court ordered the Secretary to undertake a study to ascertain a reasonable return on equity capital for proprietary hospitals,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> but purported not to find the current level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>actually unreasonable.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In view of that, Humana maintains that this suit falls without the ambit of Section 205(h). Put another way, this supposedly is not an \u201caction . brought ... to recover on any claim\u201d arising under the Medicare Act,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> but one designed to compel the Secretary to give appropriate procedural consideration to the issue of allowable return on equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">In addressing this contention, we think it necessary to separate Humana\u2019s statutory and constitutional arguments from its Administrative Procedure Act thesis.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The former are unmistakably directed at upsetting on the merits the Secretary\u2019s determination on an element of cost-reimbursement. As we have noted, the Secretary specified by regulation the maximum return on equity capital affordable to participating proprietary hospitals, based on his reading of the Medicare Act.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Humana has disputed the Secretary\u2019s view that the Act imposes a rigid constraint on return on equity when a proprietary hospital is involved, and has insisted that the Secretary\u2019s regulation affirmatively affronts the Act as a barrier to payment of reasonable costs, and as a virtual requirement that non-Medicare patients bear a portion of the cost of services extended to individuals protected by the Act.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Humana has contended additionally that should the statute be interpreted to authorize a return on equity capital in an amount no greater than that provided by the regulation, it would violate the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-13\">Humana\u2019s presentation to the District Court was designed to demonstrate that reimbursement obtained in the past compares unfavorably with the return on equity capital realized by comparable institutions \u2014 resulting in adverse financial consequences and subsidization of Medicare beneficiaries by non-Medicare patients \u2014 and that adherence to the statutory command to recompense reasonable costs would inexorably result in an appreciable hike in available return. Accepting Humana\u2019s statutory construction, and perceiving a prima facie case that past reimbursement was inadequate, the court ordered the Secretary to conduct a rulemaking proceeding to find an acceptable reimbursement level.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Accordingly, Humana\u2019s request for retroactive adjustments was deferred.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Humana\u2019s fundamental grievance, then, centers on the amount of cost-reimbursement representing a return on equity capital, a subject amenable to Review Board adjudication. That Humana solicited and obtained an order compelling the Secretary to engage in a full-dress redetermination of the allowable rate of reimbursement does not except this case from Section 205(h). Unquestionably, it is a challenge on the merits to the limitation on returns-on-equity reimbursement imposed by the Secretary\u2019s regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-14\">In <em>American Medical Colleges, </em>appellants sought, among other things, mandamus to compel the Secretary to promulgate new regulations on cost-reimbursement, arguing that the Secretary, in promulgating the regulation on review, had failed to take into account all factors made relevant by stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>ute.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> We held that neither general federal-question nor mandamus jurisdiction supported the suit. We observed that \u201cthe \u2018sweeping and direct\u2019 language of Section 205(h) precludes Section 1331(a) jurisdiction of suits seeking eventual realization of provider-cost reimbursement under the Medicare Act.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Humana\u2019s statutory and constitutional claims rather obviously are of the same breed.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">Section 205(h), as applicable to the Medicare Act,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> embodies a congressional determination that before suit can be brought to secure greater reimbursement, the Secretary must have an opportunity to evaluate the provider\u2019s grievance. Humana\u2019s statutory and constitutional claims were indisputably intended to supplant the Secretary\u2019s assessment of permissible cost-reimbursement with a judicial appraisal that, according to Humana, will undoubtedly ensure more abundant returns. That the District Court declined actually to order retroactive corrective adjustments, but instead directed an administrative redetermination of the acceptable level of reimbursement, cannot alter the essential character and objective of Humana\u2019s suit, nor the need for prior resort to the administrative process.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Truly this was an \u201caction . brought ... to recover on [a] claim\u201d within the contemplation of Section 205(h), at least insofar as the statutory and constitutional grounds are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">We conclude, however, that Humana\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act claim is not intercepted by Section 205(h). In stark contrast to its statutory and constitutional contentions, its rulemaking challenge is not directed at establishing error in the Secretary\u2019s view of what limits on reimbursement Congress intended or at demonstrating a fundamental unreasonableness in benefit amounts. Rather, the gravamen of the procedural attack is simply that the Secretary failed to adhere to the methodology generally applicable to any rulemaking effort. As such, it falls outside the purview of Section 205(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">We are mindful that Section 205(h) is \u201csweeping and direct\u201d in its preclusion of federal-question jurisdiction.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> But, in terms, it bars only actions brought \u201cto recover on any claim\u201d arising under the Medicare Act.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Suits questioning the constitutionality of statutory provisions limiting the availability of benefits are encompassed within that class,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> as are statutory and constitutional assaults on regulations restricting reimbursement-amount.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> We think, however, that when suit is brought simply to vindicate an interest in procedural regularity, Section 205(h) is not summoned into play.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Congress felt that before its own; or the Secretary\u2019s, assessment of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>funds might permissibly be forthcoming should be contested in a federal court, administrative remedies ought to be first pursued, notwithstanding apparent futility of that course. Plainly, that purpose does not buttress a contention that processes mandated by the Administrative Procedure Act were improperly eschewed in promulgation of a rule.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">Nor do we believe that traditional exhaustion principles bar immediate adjudication of Humana\u2019s procedural claim, for it is elementary that \u201cthe exhaustion [doctrine] contemplates an efficacious administrative remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Consideration by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, confined as it is to disputes over the amount properly reimbursable,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> is unavailable with respect to procedural contentions of the sort here advanced, and the Secretary has not adduced an alternative avenue of redress, Moreover, the Secretary has advised that he will not undertake to promulgate a replacement regulation unless judicially compelled to do so.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Thus, in all probability, Humana will not obtain full relief on its substantive claims \u2014 which might assuage its procedural complaints \u2014 by resort to the Review Board.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">Though Section 205(h) precludes a case-by-case determination of futility in circumstances in which it applies, we might take a less wooden approach when not so constrained.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The issue on Humana\u2019s cross-appeal has been decided by the District Court and developed fully by the parties. In light of the fact that it may not be submitted directly for administrative review, and lacking weighty considerations militating against present consideration,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>we think judicial efficacy is best served if we address it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">Humana contends, and the Secretary appears to concede, that the challenged return-on-equity regulation was not promulgated compliantly with the notice-and-comment requirements delineated in the Administrative Procedure Act. The controversy, rather, is whether the rulemaking in question was exempt from the strictures of the Act by virtue of the \u201cbenefits\u201d exception in Section 553(a)(2). By that section, the notice-and-comment method is inapplicable \u201cto the extent that there is involved . a matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, <em>benefits, </em>or contracts.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The District Court agreed with the Secretary that this provision is broad enough to embrace the reimbursement rule that Humana seeks to nullify, and we are of the same view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">The salutary effect of the Act\u2019s public comment procedures cannot be gainsaid, so only reluctantly should courts recognize exemptions therefrom.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> But even construed narrowly, Section 553(a)(2) cuts a wide swath through the safeguards generally imposed on agency action.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Its literal reach is circumscribed somewhat by relevant legislative history,<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> but nonetheless a broad domain is preserved for its operation. More specifically, \u201cto the extent that\u201d any one of the enumerated categories is \u201cclearly and directly\u201d involved in the regulatory effort at issue, the Act\u2019s procedural compulsions are suspended.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> That the governmental function is not strictly \u201cproprietary,\u201d or the regulation\u2019s character is not \u201cmechanical,\u201d does not curtail Section 553(a)(2)\u2019s permissive effect.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Public policy may be sorely affected, and the wisdom of public input manifest, but the statutory exemption still prevails when \u201cgrants,\u201d \u201cbenefits\u201d or other named subjects are \u201cclearly and directly\u201d implicated.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-16\">Brief review of the schematics of the Medicare Act relative .to provider cost-reimbursement evidences the applicability of Section 552(a)(3) in accordance with the foregoing principles. The Medicare program has as an essential objective alleviation of the financial burdens associated with medical needs borne by the aged and the disabled.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> To effectuate that goal, federal subsidization of indispensable health services may be forthcoming in one of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>ways. The first and least common mode is program-reimbursement of medical payments actually made by eligible beneficiaries.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> The alternative method is extension of Medicare funds directly to providers of services on behalf of patients participating in the program.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">Regulations governing the amount of reimbursement allocable to providers, then, plainly implicate administration of Medicare funds. The extent to which providers incidentally benefit from participation in the program may be somewhat uncertain.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> But, as the District Court observed, rules \u201cestablishing a reimbursement formula for payments to organizations in order that they actually deliver . . . benefits [to subscribing patients] can only be viewed as \u2018relating to\u2019 those benefits.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> To this we might add our own conviction that the nexus is \u201cclear[ ] and direct[ ].\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AcI\">Humana contends, however, that the situation of a provider is closer to that of firms in regulated industries, which generally are afforded an opportunity to participate in rulemaking, than to aid-beneficiaries, who indisputably are affected by the benefits exemption.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Humana makes much of the fact that providers themselves are not recipients of gratuitous benefits, but of compensation for services performed.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> And though participation in the Medicare hospitalization-insurance program must be initiated by the hospital,<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Humana maintains that as a practical matter such organizations have little choice but to seek certification as a \u201cprovider of services.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0F\">That providers are not afforded governmental assistance in the strict sense has little bearing on the applicability of Section 553(a)(2). Certainly a provider\u2019s interest in reimbursement is of no greater magnitude than a beneficiary\u2019s concern for program funding, and the citizenry is affected no more substantially by rules implicating one rather than the other. Nor does the record indicate that providers participate significantly less willingly in the Medicare program than do beneficiaries. \u201cRealistically, the conditions imposed on [all] recipients of . grants, benefits, or public contracts . . . frequently cannot be avoided\u201d for \u201cin the world as it actually is, most people are in no position to refuse the \u2018privilege\u2019 to which the strings are attached.\u201d <footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Thus neither the impact of the reimbursement regulation on Humana nor the public interest more generally implicated by its promulgation distinguishes the present regulation from others concededly encompassed by Section 553(a)(2). In all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>cases in which the excepted subject matter is \u201cclearly and directly\u201d involved, the congressional aim was to afford agencies procedural latitude regardless of the interest of affected parties and the public generally in Contributing to formulation of the exempted rule.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Cognizant of the prudence, however, of allowing public input in the wide variety of rulemaking covered by Section 553(a)(2), the Secretary in 1971 elected to waive the exemption and to submit to the normal requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> and regulations promulgated since that time are subject to mandatory rulemaking procedures.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> But the regulation challenged in the instant case was issued in 1966, and consequently was not dependent for its effectiveness upon the Secretary\u2019s adherence to the Act\u2019s commands. Humana\u2019s procedural challenge therefore cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-13\">We conclude that the District Court correctly resolved the jurisdictional and con-structural issues imposed by Humana\u2019s procedural attack. We hold, however, that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to hear Humana\u2019s statutory and constitutional objections to the Secretary\u2019s determination respecting return on equity capital allowable to proprietary hospitals. Before litigating these issues in a federal court, Humana must first resort to the administrative process set forth in Section 1395oo.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>Humana has expressed concern that dismissal of its suit pending administrative review could prejudice its pre-1973 reimbursement claims because the Secretary might endeavor to prevent their reassertion on statute-of-limitations grounds.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> We see no need for anxiety on that score. Our holding today is simply that Humana may not maintain its suit as framed in the District Court, nor obtain relief not limited to remediation for periods prior to 1973, without first pursuing available statutory procedures. We thus have not passed directly upon the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over Humana\u2019s pre-1973 claims in isolation, and until it becomes clear that judicial power over them is lacking a dismissal of that aspect of the suit would be improper. Accordingly, the District Court should retain Humana\u2019s request for an order mandating retroactive corrective adjustments for accounting periods predating the years amenable to Provider Reimbursement Review Board jurisdiction, but pretermit any determination of its own jurisdiction with respect to those claims standing alone. At such time as Humana has satisfied the jurisdictional prerequisites to' its post-1973 claims, the District Court can, if necessary, undertake to assess its authority to order adjustments for the earlier years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1144-18\">.

The Secretary has insisted that provision of the \u00a7 1395oo review mechanism for accounting periods ending on or after June 30, 1973, reflects a congressional intention to leave all claims arising before then unreviewable. The legislative history of \u00a7 1395oo, however, is to the contrary. Section 1395oo was first added to the Medicare Act in 1972, and became effective June 30, 1973. Pub.L.No.92-603, tit. II, \u00a7 243(a), 86 Stat. 1420 (1972), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 oo (Supp. Ill 1973). Judicial review under \u00a7 1395oo as originally enacted was confined to decisions by the Secretary reversing or adversely modifying \u2014 but not those affirming\u2014 determinations by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f) (Supp. Ill 1973). Section 1395oo was amended in 1974 to permit review of final decisions of the Board and of any affirmance, reversal or modification of any Board decision by the Secretary. Pub.L.No.93 \u2014 484, \u00a7 3(a), 88 Stat. 1459 (1974). The amendment originated as a House Finance Committee change in H.R. 13631. The Committee explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-10\">\u201cUnder present law, the provider has a right to judicial review of the [Board\u2019s] decision <em>only </em>where the Secretary has caused a reversal or modification.

Compare 120 Cong.Rec. 35675 (1974) (Senator Long, Senate Manager of Conference Committee) (\u201ca minor change designed to conform the wording of the effective date provision to the text of the original Provider Reimbursement Review Board provision in Public Law 92-603\u201d). Thus the Conference provision was not designed to alter the House Finance Committee\u2019s intent that providers could resort to other available judicial remedies for claims springing up before June 30, 1973. Indeed, the Conference Report itself observed that \u201c[t]he amendment [broadening \u00a7 1395oo (f)] would specifically not apply to other judicial review avenues existing with respect to cost reports for periods prior to June 30, 1973.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.93-1407, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1974).

Developments since decision by the District Court may bear on exhaustion of Humana\u2019s claims. In July 1977, Humana, along with other proprietary hospitals, prosecuted a group appeal to the Review Board to contest return on equity capital allocated by the group\u2019s physical intermediary for the 1973 accounting period. <em>Group Appeal of Humana, Inc., </em>No. 76-197 C (PRRB Dec. 1, 1977), reproduced as Exhibit A in Supplemental Brief for Appellant/Cross-Appellee. Specifically, the hospitals complained that failure to treat income tax as a reimbursable cost, and inclusion of income tax in the equity computation, resulted in a return on equity capital at less than half the amount properly allowable. And the hospitals developed in the administrative record essentially the same data submitted to the District Court in the instant case with respect to the return realized by providers vis-a-vis comparable institutions. The Review Board implicitly recognized its authority to afford relief but ruled against the hospitals on the merits, construing the Medicare Act as sanctioning reimbursement in the amount afforded by the intermediary. Humana and the other petitioners have recently filed suit in the District Court challenging the same regulation at issue in the instant case. See Complaint, <em>Humana, Inc. v. Califano, </em>No. 78-0175 (D.D.C. filed Jan. 31, 1978), reproduced as Attachment A in Supplemental Brief for Appellant/Cross-Appellee. Therein they advance the same statutory, constitutional and procedural grounds urged in the present litigation, and request retroactive corrective adjustments \u201cfor the cost-reporting period ending August 31, 1973 and for all other Medicare reimbursements since the promulga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>tion of the illegal regulation on November 22, 1966.\u201d Complaint Count II, fl 27, at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">Thus Humana may well obtain, in the action recently commenced, judicial evaluation of its statutory and constitutional contentions in the manner prescribed by the Medicare Act. Indeed, the Secretary has opined that \u201cHumana of South Carolina, by its new complaint has now properly presented jurisdiction in the federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo.\u201d Supplemental Brief for Appellant/Cross-Appellee at 2. We need not now decide whether presentation of claims for a single accounting period might supply jurisdiction to order relief for earlier periods when a regulation applicable to all is challenged. In any event, Humana perhaps may obtain at least the relief secured in the District Court in the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"106\">\n<p id=\"b1157-21\">.
