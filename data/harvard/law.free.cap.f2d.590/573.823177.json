On claimants\u2019 appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">In June 1970, Tom Carter, when applying for black lung benefits under the Act, acknowledged the five James children as his off-spring and dependents. He died two months later, leaving a widow, Pauline Carter, from whom he had become estranged, as well as his illegitimate children. Since their father had been totally disabled by pneumoconiosis, the children received black lung benefits, but only for the last two months of their father\u2019s life. Thereafter, the widow became the sole qualified beneficiary. As long as the miner\u2019s widow remains eligible to receive benefits, the children of the miner, in their own right, may not. <em>Supra </em>note 1. After the death of both the miner and his wife, however, the children will be entitled to payments. Presently unable to establish dependency on the widow, the James children no longer receive the stipend previously theirs. This deprivation prompted them to attack the scheme of qualification for survivor\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">Appellants contend that establishing dependency upon the widow as a prerequisite to receiving benefits under the Act defeats the Congressional purpose of providing for the \u201csurviving dependents of miners,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> thus prejudicing them because they are illegitimate and not dependent on their father\u2019s widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-17\">In establishing a scheme to compensate the family of a miner for its suffering, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Congress permissibly exercised its judgment to pronounce a general rule that is easily administered and does not require case-by-case determination. <em>See Califano v. Jobst, </em>484 U.S. 47, 56-57, 98 S.Ct. 95, 54 L.Ed.2d 228 (1977). That the statute may not treat children who were dependent only on the parent disabled by mining in the same way it treats children dependent on both parents, or only on the widow, does not constitute a violation of due process. Congress could rationally have assumed that those who are dependent on the miner\u2019s widow are those who were likely to have shared in the miner\u2019s suffering and probably were also his dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><em>Mathews v. De Castro, </em>429 U.S. 181, 185, 97 S.Ct. 431, 434, 50 L.Ed.2d 389 (1976) states the general standard applicable to a constitutional attack of a statute that provides for the general public welfare:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\u201cThe discretion belongs to Congress, unless the choice is clearly wrong, a display of arbitrary power, not an exercise of judgment.\u201d <em>Helvering v. Davis, </em>301 U.S. 619, 640, 57 S.Ct. 904, 81 L.Ed. 1307. In enacting legislation of this kind a government does , not - deny equal protection \u201cmerely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some \u2018reasonable basis,\u2019 it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification \u2018is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dandridge v.
