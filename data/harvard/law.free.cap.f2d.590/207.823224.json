Taylor, Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b280-13\">MERRITT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">The question on appeal is whether a lien foreclosure action is an \u201cancillary\u201d remedy for the collection of a judgment under Rule 64, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and, if not, whether the District Judge abused his discretion in refusing to consider the foreclosure claim as a pendent state claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">A contractor\u2019s employees were laborers on a construction project. They are members of the plaintiff union, the appellant in this case. The contractor failed to make contributions to the union for his employees\u2019 fringe benefits as required by their collective bargaining agreement. The labor union brought suit against the contractor for breach of contract under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185. The District Court entered a default judgment against the contractor for the amount of the unpaid employee fringe benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">The union\u2019s complaint against the contractor also sought foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien against the construction project property owned by a church and a bank who were added party defendants below and are the appellees here. The plaintiff labor union appeals from a District Court order dismissing its mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure claim against the church and the bank. These foreclosure claims are characterized on appeal as pendent state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-17\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the foreclosure claims. The District Court has discretion to exercise jurisdiction with respect to such pendent state claims under <em>Aldinger v. Howard, </em>427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976), and <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Our review of the record and briefs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>case disclose that the District Judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction, especially in light of the fact that the foreclosure claims appear to raise unresolved questions of Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Neither do we believe that plaintiff\u2019s foreclosure claims against the owners of the project fall within the remedies contemplated by Rule 64 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, governing seizure of property in order to satisfy the judgment against the contractor. For the purpose of executing on a judgment rendered by a federal court, Rule 64 provides \u201cancillary\u201d remedies including \u201carrest, attachment, garnishment . . . and other . equivalent remedies.\u201d We do not believe that a lien foreclosure proceeding is \u201cequivalent\u201d to any of these ancillary remedies because it is not a remedy against the judgment debtor or against a person who is personally indebted to, or in possession of the property of, the judgment debtor. Moreover, Rule 64 provides for such execution on a federal judgment \u201cin the manner provided by the law of the state in which the District Court is held.\u201d We find no federal or Michigan authority characterizing a lien foreclosure action under Michigan law as an \u201cancillary\u201d remedy for the purpose of executing on a judgment. Indeed, it is unresolved under Michigan law whether a labor union is entitled to bring such a lien foreclosure action on behalf of its members at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
