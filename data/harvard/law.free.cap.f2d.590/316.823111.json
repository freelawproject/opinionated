In our opinion, there was more than ample evidence to support the conclusion that the Union illegally discriminated against its involved member, violating \u00a7 8(a)(3) of the Act, and thus engaged in grossly unfair labor practices, as to the involved employee, within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) and (2) and \u00a7 2(6) and (7) of the Act. Accordingly, we reject the contentions made by the Union in its Petition to Review and grant the Board\u2019s Cross-Application for the enforcement of its Order. The Board\u2019s Order will, by this Court, be</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">ENFORCED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
