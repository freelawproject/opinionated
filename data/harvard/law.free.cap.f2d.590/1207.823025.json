We grant the motion for expedited consideration and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because the Commission\u2019s action is not a reviewable \u201cfinal order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-22\">On July 29,1978, petitioner filed with the Commission the emergency petition at issue here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 7, 1978 the Commission replied with a letter explaining that the technical complexity of the issues raised \u201eby the emergency petition requires staff analysis and response before a decision can be made. In concluding, the Commission stated: \u201c[i]n view of its intention to address the matter expeditiously, and the lack of a clear demonstration of need for emergency action, the Commission determined that such action was not warranted at this time.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-23\">Petitioner considered the Commission\u2019s September 7th letter as a \u201cfinal agency decision\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appealable to this Court, and on November 6, 1978 she filed this petition for review. Petitioner charges that the Commission has denied her due process and breached a \u201cnon-discretionary duty to license the handling of radioactive poisons in such a manner that they would not inflict involuntary harm.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The relief sought is (1) reversal of the \u201cfinal order\u201d of the Commission and (2) a temporary restraining order directing the Commission to stop operation of nuclear power plants pending the Commission\u2019s decision on her emergency petition. We hold that the Commission\u2019s letter is not a reviewable \u201cfinal order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\">The pertinent judicial review statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2842(4) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b); provide for judicial review of \u201cfinal orders\u201d of the Atomic Energy Commission <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> relating to activities of licensees. A \u201cfinal order\u201d is one that imposes an obligation, denies a right, or fixes some legal relationship, usually at the consummation of an administrative process. <em>Illinois Citizens Committee v. FCC, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. 166, 515 F.2d 397, 402 (1975); <em>Bethesda-Chevy Chase Broadcasters, Inc. v. FCC, </em>128 U.S.App.D.C. 185, 385 F.2d 967, 968 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">In this case, petitioner points to no statutory or regulatory authority, and apparently there is none, giving her a right to file an emergency petition for direct and immediate action by the Commission. There is a procedure which provides for citizens to file enforcement requests with the Commission, whereupon the Commission may then decide to institute a proceeding to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Theoretically, the Commission may also, as it implies it has done here, voluntarily consider an enforcement request as one for direct, immediate action under the Commission\u2019s supervisory authority. However, there is no statutory or regulatory scheme obligating the Commission to do so. Thus, the Commission\u2019s September 7th letter denying the emergency petition was not a final order or final agency action within the meaning of the review statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(4) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">Here, the Commission, which is experienced in analyzing and weighing information and data of the kind presented in petitioner\u2019s emergency petition,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> has decided that, though the emergency petition does not warrant emergency action, the issues raised do demand further study and analysis. The administrative process is not completed, and there is no record or final determination of the substantive issues for reviewable appeal. The only issue which has been decided is the question of whether the petition raised concerns which necessitated emergency relief. In denying petitioner\u2019s request for emergency relief, the Commission has not denied petitioner any cognizable legal right. Moreover, even if such emergency relief were part of the applicable statutory or regulatory scheme, the appropriate disposition of this appeal would be to defer to the Commission\u2019s discretion and greater expertise on such questions of \u201cinterim relief.\u201d <em>Nader v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 255, 513 F.2d 1045, 1055 (1975). We therefore dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1280-15\">. The emergency petition sought \u201cto compel the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to cease operation of all parts of the nuclear fuel cycle except those involving isolation of hazards from the biosphere, to undertake all measures necessary to prevent or lessen the impact of emergency conditions already created, and to begin emergency and remedial action within 30 days.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s emergency petition, 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1280-25\">.
