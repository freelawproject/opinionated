The appellants allege negligence in the supervision of the decedent and in the decision to induct him into the Air Force. Recovery on the supervision claim is barred by <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), and like cases precluding recovery for malpractice in treating the infirmities of military personnel. The negligent induction claim is also barred by <em>Feres </em>and its progeny. <em>See Joseph v. United States, </em>505 F.2d 525 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>Healy v. United States, </em>192 F.Supp. 325 (S.D.N.Y.1961). Moreover, even were we to assume that a negligent induction is not within the <em>Feres </em>rule, we fail to perceive any causal relation between the alleged negligence and the injury, since the appellants concede that the serviceman\u2019s military experience did not cause or exacerbate his mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
