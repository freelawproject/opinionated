(\u201cFox\u201d) appeal from an order of the District Court (Hon. Constance Baker Motley, <em>Judge) refusing approval </em>of a stipulation of settlement under F.R.Civ.P. 23.1. The settlement that was disapproved by Judge Motley involved the granting of options, which were restricted in certain ways, to defendant-directors at a certain striking price, a consideration being paid for the options. The objectors attacked the settlement as illusory and unfair to Fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">Fox and objectors to the settlement have moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order of the District Court refusing to approve the settlement is not an appealable order. Fox contends that appellants, by the terms of the stipulation, have waived their right to appeal. The objectors add that the order, even without regard to the stipulation, is not a final order. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We hold that the refusal of the District Court to approve a settlement in a stockholder derivative action is not appealable under \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-18\">The question is one of first impression in this circuit. On its face the order is clearly not a final order within the literal meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, for the order-did not result in a judgment that would terminate the proceeding. <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945). Nor did appellants seek .an order from the District Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) certifying that the non-appealable order involves a controlling question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">The only ground upon which appealability may conceivably be premised is the collateral order doctrine of <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). In that well-known case, the question was whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>federal court, having jurisdiction of a stockholder derivative action through diversity of citizenship, must apply a statute of the forum state which made plaintiffs post security for costs and certain expenses as a condition to suit. The District Court had decided that the state statute was not applicable to an action in the federal court. 7 F.R.D. 352 (D.N.J.1947). The Court of Appeals thought otherwise and reversed. 170 F.2d 44 (3d Cir. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The Supreme Court held the decision appealable because it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">appears to fall in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">We hold this order appealable because it is a final disposition of a claimed right which is not an ingredient of the cause of action and does not require consideration with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">337 U.S. at 546-47, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-26.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">Significantly, the Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">But we do not mean that every order fixing security is subject to appeal. Here it is the right to security that presents a serious and unsettled question. If the right were admitted or clear and the order involved only an exercise of discretion as to the amount of security, a matter the statute makes subject to reconsideration from time to time, appealability would present a different question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">337 U.S. at 547, 69 S.Ct. at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Thus, <em>Cohen </em>decided an important categorical question of federalism which, because it could arise only at the threshold of litigation, had to be reviewed before final judgment if an appellate decision was to have any meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\"><em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Beneficial, </em>as might have been expected, has spawned a host of legitimate and illegitimate progeny. As we have had occasion to note, <em>\u201cCohen </em>must be kept within narrow bounds, lest this exception swallow the salutary \u2018final judgment\u2019 rule.\u201d <em>Weight Watchers of Philadelphia v. Weight Watchers International, </em>455 F.2d 770, 773 (2d Cir. 1972) (citations omitted). We had earlier declared that the gist of the <em>Cohen </em>doctrine \u201crevolved about issues concerning the <em>power </em>of the district court to render its decision, as distinct from the propriety of its exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Bancroft Navigation Co. v. Chadade Steamship Co., </em>349 F.2d 527, 529 (2d Cir. 1965) (emphasis in original). And while we, like other circuits, have probably not been entirely consistent in our application of the collateral order doctrine, we have tended to adhere to our disinclination to erode the finality doctrine by indirection.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">The Supreme Court has recently given an even firmer direction to this trend. In <em>Coopers and Lvbrand v. Livesay. </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), the Court held that a determination that an action may <em>not </em>be maintained as a class action is not appealable as a matter of right, even though it may spell the \u201cdeath knell\u201d of the action. The Court there noted that to be appealable the \u201corder must conclusively determine the disputed question . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2458. That test cannot be met for an order disapproving a settlement. Such an order is based, in part, upon an assessment of the merit of the positions of the respective parties, and permits the parties to proceed with the litigation or to propose a different settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">A settlement in an ordinary civil litigation is normally the sole concern of the parties. In stockholder derivative actions, on the other hand, because of the vicarious representation involved, the court has a duty to perform before an action can be \u201csettled.\u201d The court must \u201capprove\u201d the settlement under F.R.Civ.P. 23.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This approval cannot be a rubber stamp adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of what the parties alone agree is fair and equitable. The test is more rigorous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The Court also declared in <em>Livesay </em>that \u201callowing appeals of right from nonfinal orders that turn on the facts of a particular case thrusts appellate courts indiscriminately into the trial process and thus defeats one vital purpose of the final judgment rule \u2014 \u2018that of maintaining the appropriate relationship between the respective courts. ... . This goal, in the absence of most compelling reasons to the contrary, is very much worth preserving.\u2019 <em>Parkinson v. April Industries, Inc., </em>520 F.2d 650, 654 (CA 2, 1975).\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2462 &amp; n.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The latest word from the Supreme Court serves as a guide to our decision. The requirement of court approval for compromises, as we know, is found in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That code applies to District Courts alone. F.R.Civ.P. 1. There is no provision for the substitution of an appellate opinion save when the settlement decree is final, in which case appellate review is still subject to severe limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The determination of whether to approve a Rule 23.1 settlement is peculiarly an amalgam of fact and law. Most derivative actions probably are settled rather than litigated to final judgment. This course of settlement, however, is not a deviation from the main path of the litigating process. It is a step on that path directly leading to final judgment. An approval of a compromise, after appropriate notice, becomes a final judgment. <em>Smith v. Alleghany Corp., </em>394 F.2d 381, 391 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 939, 89 S.Ct. 300, 21 L.Ed.2d 276 (1968). So, a <em>disapproval </em>of a compromise that would have resulted in a final judgment if it had been approved is not different from a denial of summary judgment or the grant of a new trial which are surely not appealable orders. <em>See Compagnie Nationale Air France v. Port of New York Authority, </em>427 F.2d 951, 954 (2d Cir. 1970). In only one sense, of course, is the refusal to approve a proposed settlement final, for that <em>particular </em>settlement will never be revived.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">One cannot, as appellants here urge us to do, successfully separate specific questions of law from the settlement as a whole. An appellate court is severely restricted when it attempts to weigh the chances of success of the plaintiff\u2019s case against the sufficiency of the settlement. That is particularly true when the credibility of experts is involved, and when, as here, the settlement itself involves a complicated formula of give and take.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">It is easy enough to suggest that we can rely on the elusive test of \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d as our guide. The difficulty is that if we remand for alleged errors of law, we still cannot force the District Court to exercise the ample remaining balance of its discretion to reach a result contrary to its original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">What is even more striking here is that appellants contend that Judge Motley, in fact, failed to use her discretion because she did not evaluate the likelihood of success in the plaintiffs\u2019 case. Hence, they assert, she rested her decision entirely upon an erroneous resolution of two \u201cpurely\u201d legal issues \u2014 at what date the value of an option is measured and whether the particular value of an option is measured by market considerations without evaluating the personal stake which the <em>particular </em>optionee already has and will have in terms of control of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Assuming that it were possible to decide these questions as if they were legal abstractions, and that we remanded, Judge Motley could still properly proceed to balance the chances of litigation against some new putative value of the settlement and thus render our determinations merely precatory. In fact, if we were to entertain the appeal, \u201c. . . there is no assurance that the trial process will not again be disrupted by interlocutory review.\u201d <em>Livesay, </em>98 S.Ct. at 2461. For the denial of one compromise does not necessarily mean that a \u201csweetened\u201d compromise may not be approved. The management of a derivative suit gives the trial judge a chance not only to disapprove a compromise but to edge the parties toward more equitable terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">This particular litigation illustrates that concretely. While this appeal was pending, the parties entered into an amended stipulation which purportedly made the settlement more attractive for Fox. There was an attempt to submit the \u201cappellate\u201d settlement to us for approval. We declined to entertain it as beyond our jurisdiction. The making of the new compromise emphasizes the very point, however, that it might have been presented to the District Court. If settlement denial orders were held appealable, one could foresee a series of disapprovals and a series of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">We recognize that in the only case raising the question of appealability of an order refusing to approve the settlement of a derivative action (brought under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-l <em>et seq.), </em>a panel of the Ninth Circuit, in an opinion by District Judge Battin, held the order to be appealable as a collateral order. <em>Norman v. McKee, </em>431 F.2d 769 (9th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 912, 91 S.Ct. 879, 27 L.Ed.2d 811 (1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Norman v. McKee, </em>the court emphasized that a trial would be expensive and lengthy and that, hence, the cost and delay of piecemeal review, as balancing factors, were diminished in importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">We know that this argument that justice will be denied by delay has been made a cardinal point in many and diverse instances where review is sought of interlocutory orders. We have set ourselves resolutely against this consideration which, if freely accepted, would in time completely dilute the finality rule. <em>See U. S. Tour Operators Ass\u2019n v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>556 F.2d 126, 128 (2d Cir. 1977). With great respect, we must differ with our friends on the Ninth Circuit, for the reasons we have given, and deny appealability to this order. We think, moreover, that a contrary trend has set in since 1970 when <em>Norman </em>v. <em>McKee </em>was decided, which has, thus far, culminated in <em>Livesay, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">In view of our disposition, we need not enter into the semantic debate on whether the stipulation of settlement waived a right to appeal in the event that the District Court should refuse to approve the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-16\">. Rule 23.1: \u201cThe action shall not be dismissed -or compromised without the approval of the court . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">. The standard for approval of compromises in stockholder derivative actions involving alleged breaches of the securities laws is akin to the standard used in bankruptcy reorganization. See Saylor v. <em>Lindsley, </em>456 F.2d 896, 904 (2d Cir. 1972). And the Bankruptcy Act standard of \u201cfair and equitable\u201d (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 574, 621(2)) applies \u201cto compromises just as to other aspects of reorganizations.\u201d <em>Protective Committee for Independent Stockholders v. Anderson, </em>390 U.S. 414, 424, 88 S.Ct. 1157, 1163, 20 L.Ed.2d 1 (1968). \u201cBasic to this process in every instance, of course, is the need to compare the terms of the compromise with the likely rewards of litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424r-25, 88 S.Ct. at 1163.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">. The Eighth Circuit also reviewed such an order on the merits, but the question of appeal-ability had neither been raised nor discussed. See <em>In re International House of Pancakes Franchise Litigation, </em>487 F.2d 303 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
