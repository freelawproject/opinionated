Influenced largely by decisions that have sustained the Secretary on this issue,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-25\">Title XVIII of the Social Security Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> established a federally-funded health insurance program for the elderly popularly known as Medicare. From 1967 until July 31, 1975, Fairfax Nursing Center, Inc., provided skilled nursing services to beneficiaries of the Medicare program. Its agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>ment with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, as well as the terms of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395f(b), 1395g, and 1395x(v)(l)(A), directed the Secretary to reimburse Fairfax for the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of these services, including the cost of depreciation of capital assets used for Medicare patients. Section 1395x(v)(l)(A) requires the Secretary to issue regulations establishing permissible methods of cost calculation as well as providing for retroactive corrective adjustments in appropriate cases. Reimbursement of reasonable costs to Fair-fax was administered by Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company, an intermediary acting on behalf of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">Fairfax had elected to have its reimbursement payments computed by calculating the depreciation of its capital assets on an accelerated basis rather than by a straight-line method, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary in 1966.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In comparison with straight-line depreciation, which assumes a linear rate of decline in asset value and results in identical reimbursement payments in each year of an asset\u2019s expected life, accelerated depreciation assumes a more rapid rate of decline in value in the early years and therefore produces large payments in the early years and small payments in the later years of the asset\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">On August 1, 1970, the Secretary promulgated new regulations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> precluding accelerated depreciation payments for newly acquired assets and for new providers entering the program after that date. These regulations also authorized the recapture, upon a provider\u2019s withdrawal from the Medicare program, of any difference between previously claimed accelerated depreciation and the amount which would have been paid on a straight-line basis. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) (1977).'<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">Fairfax voluntarily withdrew from the Medicare program on July 31, 1975. On March 19, 1976, Mutual of Omaha notified Fairfax that the depreciation portion of its allowable costs for the periods ending December 31,1967, through July 31, 1975, had been recomputed and that $39,087, the excess of accelerated over straight-line depreciation, would be deducted from the amount owed to Fairfax for the final accounting period. After Fairfax\u2019s protests were denied by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board and the Secretary declined to affirm, reverse, or modify the Board\u2019s decision, Fairfax brought suit in the district court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court granted Fairfax\u2019s motion for summary judgment, reasoning that, as applied to periods before its effective date, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) was beyond the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority and violated the constitutional guarantee of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-14\">Fairfax advances a number of arguments in support of the district court\u2019s judgment. The principal ones can be grouped as follows: I, the Secretary did not comply with the Medicare Act; II, he violated the Administrative Procedure Act by making a substantive rule under the guise of a practice manual; and III, he deprived Fairfax of its property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-16\"> Fairfax contends that as applied, the regulation exceeds the Secretary\u2019s au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>thority under the Medicare Act. Fairfax directs our attention to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A)(ii), which allows the Secretary to make</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-4\">suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">Fairfax argues that this provision does not authorize retroactive adjustments beyond the current fiscal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">We find Fairfax\u2019s argument untenable. The Medicare Act calls for two distinct types of retroactive adjustments: (1) adjustments to bring a provider\u2019s interim payments into agreement with the audit results for a given fiscal period, which are required by \u00a7 1395g, and (2) adjustments \u201cto correct flaws in the aggregate reimbursement to which a provider is entitled due to an erroneous method of determining reimbursable cost,\u201d dictated by \u00a7 1395x(v). <em>Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center v. Richardson, </em>486 F.2d 663, 669 (2d Cir. 1973). The regulation involved in this litigation implements the latter provision and therefore is not limited to any specific fiscal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">Fairfax also directs our attention to a regulation proposed by the Commissioner of Social Security in 1975 which dealt with the question of retroactivity when there is a change in the method used to determine a provider\u2019s \u201creasonable costs.\u201d 40 Fed.Reg. 26535 (June 24, 1975). The regulation would have made such changes effective \u201cin the provider\u2019s reporting period that begins after the date of [the] change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">We decline to draw any conclusions from this proposed regulation. Regulations which are proposed but not subsequently promulgated indicate little about the agency\u2019s statutory authority. <em>Cf. New Jersey Chapter, Inc. of APTA, Inc. v. Prudential Life Insurance Co., </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 45 n. 1, 502 F.2d 500, 505 n. 1 (1974). Nor do we find anything in the legislative history of the Medicare Act proscribing the Secretary\u2019s retroactive recovery of accelerated depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">Fairfax also argues that under \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A)(ii), the Secretary was obliged to make explicit findings that accelerated depreciation generally leads to excessive reimbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">The district court correctly rejected this argument. Neither the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3), nor the Medicare statute mandates formal findings or justifications in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. <em>See Summit Nursing Home, Inc. v. United States, </em>572 F.2d 737, 741-42 (Ct.Cl.1978); <em>E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Train, </em>541 F.2d 1018, 1026 (4th Cir. 1976). The regulation itself is a determination that accelerated depreciation exaggerates the true costs of providing services. <em>Adams Nursing Home of Williamstown, Inc. v. Mathews, </em>548 F.2d 1077, 1082 (1st Cir. 1977). No contrary determination may be found in the provisions allowing accelerated depreciation to continue beyond August 1, 1970, in special circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">As a participant in an ongoing regulated program, Fairfax could have benefited from retroactive upward adjustments in reasonable cost payments. <em>See, e. g., Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center v. Richardson, </em>486 F.2d at 670. It has no grounds to complain upon encountering periodic downward adjustments, unless those adjustments produced less than a \u201creasonable cost\u201d reimbursement. <em>Accord, Hazelwood Chronic &amp; Convalescent Hospital, Inc. v. Weinberger, </em>543 F.2d 703, 708 (9th Cir. 1976), vacated on jurisdictional grounds, 430 U.S. 952, 97 S.Ct. 1595, 51 L.Ed.2d 801 (1977). <em>See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 15-20, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). Fairfax suggests that the government had the burden of estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>lishing that payments to the nursing home had exceeded \u201creasonable cost.\u201d This is not correct. The judicial presumption of legality of administrative action places the burden on Fairfax to establish the contrary proposition. <em>Springdale Convalescent Center v. Mathews, </em>545 F.2d 943, 955 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>see Campaign Clean Water, Inc. v. Train, </em>489 F.2d 492, 501 (4th Cir. 1973), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 420 U.S. 136, 95 S.Ct. 847, 43 L.Ed.2d 82 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">Fairfax argues that \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) is not retroactive on its face and was made retroactive only by the 1972 addition of \u00a7 136 to the Provider Reimbursement Manual. Section 136.2 states that the excess depreciation payments for all accounting periods, including those prior to 1970, will be recovered from the provider when it terminates participation in the program. Providers who withdrew prior to 1970 were exempted. Since the latter provision was not promulgated in accordance with the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, Fairfax contends that \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) may not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">The Secretary is not free to promulgate regulations and then change their meaning by \u201cclarifications\u201d or \u201cinterpretations\u201d issued without formal notice and comment. To do so would frustrate the policies of fair notice and comment in the Administrative. Procedure Act. However, \u00a7 136.2 raises no such problem. The language of \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) neither mentions nor necessarily mandates retroactivity. The regulation might be construed to apply only to accelerated depreciation payments made on or after August 1, 1970. But an equally plausible reading is that the regulation was intended to effect recapture of <em>any </em>net excess of accelerated over straight-line depreciation upon termination after 1970 of a provider\u2019s participation in the program. This interpretation is consistent with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A)(ii) which, as we noted in Part I, specifically authorizes the' Secretary to make retroactive adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-10\">Although Fairfax insists that the manual creates a new substantive rule, we need not analyze the question in terms of the difference between substantive and interpretative rules. <em>See Gosman v. United States, </em>573 F.2d 31, 39 (Ct.Cl.1978). The regulation can readily be understood as authorizing retroactive recapture of depreciation payments, and \u00a7 136 of the manual merely clarifies it. The manual expressly provides that it does not have the force of regulations. Therefore, it need not have been promulgated in accordance with the standard notice and comment procedure. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3), (B). <em>See New Jersey Chapter, Inc. of APTA, Inc. v. Prudential Life Insurance Co., </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 45, 502 F.2d 500, 505 (1974). An agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations should be accepted by the courts unless it is shown to be unreasonable or inconsistent with statutory authority. <em>United States v. Davison Fuel &amp; Dock Co., </em>371 F.2d 705, 714 (4th Cir. 1967); <em>cf. Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 4, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). Withdrawal from the program before a provider\u2019s assets are fully depreciated introduces a new factor into the calculation of reasonable costs. Therefore, full implementation of the recapture policy of \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) requires reaching all payments of accelerated depreciation to providers who withdraw after 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">Finally, Fairfax contends that retroactive application of \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) violated its fifth amendment right to due process of law. The district court agreed, citing <em>South </em>Windsor <em>Convalescent Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>403 F.Supp. 515 (D.Conn.1975), rev\u2019d on jurisdictional grounds, 541 F.2d 910 (2d Cir. 1976); and <em>Columbia Heights Nursing Home &amp; Hospital, Inc. v. Weinberger, </em>380 F.Supp. 1066 (M.D.La.1974).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>We believe the correct analysis of the constitutional issue is that of the First Circuit in <em>Adams Nursing Home of Williamstown, Inc. v. Mathews, </em>548 F.2d at 1080-81. Writing for the court in that case, Judge Coffin said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-4\">The theme of <em>[South Windsor </em>and other] cases is that the recapture regulation overturns vested property rights and is therefore an invalid retrospective act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-6\">Retrospective laws are often viewed with some suspicion. . . . [L]aws that unsettle settled rights can be harsh, and they deserve a special scrutiny. This principle has received explicit constitutional recognition in the taking and contract clauses .... Of course, not every law that upsets expectations is invalid; courts have generally compared the public interest in the retroactive rule with the private interests that are overturned by it. . . . Putting aside any attempt to tailor the conclusory label \u201cvested right\u201d to fit Adams\u2019 depreciation payments, and inquiring instead into Adams\u2019 actual expectations and the reasonableness of those expectations, we find that only a modest private interest is affected by the Secretary\u2019s rule. In any retroactivity challenge, a central question is how the challenger\u2019s conduct, or the conduct of others in his class, would have differed if the law in issue had applied from the start. If the recapture rule had been laid down in 1966, those providers who planned to stay in the program would not have changed their behavior significantly. In the long run there is no difference between accelerated and straight line depreciation; higher payments generated by the accelerated method in early years are recouped by reduced payments later. Although Adams now claims that it would have chosen straight line depreciation if it had foreseen the recapture regulation, the regulation is designed to leave Adams no better \u2014 and no worse \u2014 off than if the nursing home had chosen the straight line method in the first place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-9\">Our belief that \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) does not offend due process is supported not only by <em>Adams, </em>but also by other courts. <em>See </em>n. 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-10\">Finally, Fairfax argues that we have expressly prohibited retroactive action in Medicare cases. <em>Coe v. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, </em>502 F.2d 1337 (4th Cir. 1974). In that case, we held that HEW regulations promulgated in June, 1971, should not have been applied retroactively to deny an individual\u2019s claim for services rendered in October and November of 1970. <em>Coe </em>was not a provider reimbursement case and did not involve adjustments under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A). Moreover, in <em>Coe </em>retroactive application would have resulted in \u201cmanifest injustice,\u201d interference with an individual patient\u2019s matured right to reimbursement. 502 F.2d at 1340. Similar evidence is absent in the present case. The overpayment arose because Fairfax chose to leave the program before its assets were fully depreciated. If the Secretary had not recaptured the excess depreciation owing to Fairfax\u2019s early withdrawal, he would not have discharged his statutory duty to hold provider reimbursements to \u201creasonable costs.\u201d Since there is no evidence of manifest injustice, the Board did not err in applying the change in the Medicare depreciation policy retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">The judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1370-16\">. <em>Adams Nursing Home of Williamstown, Inc. v.
