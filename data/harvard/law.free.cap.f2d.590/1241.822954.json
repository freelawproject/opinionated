Three male Health and Physical Education teachers (HPETs) in the New York City school system appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Morris E. Lasker, J., disqualifying their counsel upon the motion of three female HPETs. Appellant male teachers claim that the order was an abuse of discretion because it disregarded their constitutional rights, and was without any sound basis. For reasons set forth below, we hold that the motion to disqualify should have been denied, and we therefore reverse the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">The contending parties on appeal \u2014 the male and female HPETs \u2014 are all defendants in this declaratory judgment action brought by the Board of Education of the City of New York and the Chancellor of the City School District. In February 1977, these plaintiffs found themselves in the middle of apparently contradictory positions held by the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the office of Civil Rights of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). In a case involving one of these appellants, the State Commissioner had ruled that the use of separate seniority lists for male and female HPETs for the purpose of layoffs was illegal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, HEW initially indicated to the Board that HEW took exactly the contrary view, that merger of the lists would violate Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681 et seq. Caught in this apparent dilemma, plaintiffs provisionally merged the seniority lists of male and female HPETs and commenced this action for a declaratory judgment in which all concerned parties would be present. The complaint named as defendants HEW and its Secretary,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the New York State Commissioner of Education, the State Division of Human Rights, three named male HPETs, individually and as representatives of all male HPETs, and three named female HPETs, individually and as representatives of all female HPETs. The male and female defendants have asserted counterclaims and cross-claims. The relief sought by plaintiffs is a judgment declaring that the provisional policy of merging the seniority lists, effective February 1, 1977 but not retroactively, is lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-14\">The two classes of defendants are the actual contending parties in this litigation. The male HPETs allege that maintaining separate seniority lists for male and female HPETs is illegal and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av3\">all defendant male Health and Physical Education teachers who were laid off on or after September 1,1975, are entitled to reinstatement with back pay and all other retroactive benefits incident to their positions to the date of their layoff if less senior female teachers were retained at that time or at any time thereafter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afqp\">The female HPETs allege that their seniority status perpetuates past discriminatory practices of plaintiffs and that if the provisional merged seniority list is used for layoff purposes \u201cit will result in the layoff of at least six times as many female HPETs as male HPETs.\u201d The stakes in the lawsuit are obviously high.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-15\">The male HPETs are represented .in this action by James R. Sandner, Esq., who is also General Counsel of New York State United Teachers (NYSUT). That organization is an unincorporated membership association of approximately 180,000 teachers, librarians, guidance counsellors and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>school related employees of the almost 800 school districts in New York State.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are told that in each of the school districts there is a separate local union, which is the exclusive bargaining representative for employees in that unit. The majority of these individual unions have chosen to affiliate themselves with NYSUT, but the latter does not collectively bargain for any public employees. It does, however, provide a number of services to its members, including a legal service program under the direction and control of Mr. Sandner. Both the male and female HPETs are represented in collective bargaining by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), to whom they pay dues. A portion of the dues paid to the AFT is remitted to NYSUT, which, at least in part, apparently finances the legal service program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">Under the program, NYSUT\u2019s members may apply to obtain legal representation free of charge. Mr. Sandner and his staff may take an applicant\u2019s case when, in their judgment, the claim is both job-related and meritorious. It is through this procedure that the male defendants retained Mr. Sandner as their attorney. \u201e NYSUT itself, however, has taken no position on the merits or on any other issue in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">The female HPETs moved to disqualify Mr. Sandner as counsel for the male HPETs or, in the alternative, to require NYSUT to furnish counsel for the female teachers. Judge Lasker concluded that \u201cthe female teachers are paying, in part, for their opponents\u2019 legal expenses.\u201d This violated \u201cat least the spirit, if not the letter, of Canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility that \u2018A lawyer should avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, the judge granted the motion and this appeal by the male HPETs followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">Appellants\u2019 briefs discuss at length various Supreme Court cases dealing with the rights of associational free speech, group-sponsored legal action and First Amendment considerations, e. g., <em>United Transportation Union v. Michigan, </em>401 U.S. 576, 91 S.Ct. 1076, 28 L.Ed.2d 339 (1971); <em>United Mine Workers v. Illinois State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 217, 88 S.Ct. 353, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967); <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, </em>377 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1113, 12 L.Ed.2d 89 (1964); <em>NAACP v. Button, </em>371 U.S. 415, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963). These issues are not substantially implicated on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-11\"><em>Button </em>established as part of the First Amendment freedoms of association and political expression the right of a group to litigate controversial points of view in court free of governmental action purporting to regulate the practice of law. Here, however, NYSUT has made no effort to appear in the litigation either as a party or as an amicus. And indeed, appellants repeatedly insist that NYSUT has taken no position on any issue in this litigation. Since there has been no activity by the group, the <em>Button </em>principle is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-12\"><em>Transportation Union, Mine Workers </em>and <em>Trainmen </em>hold that a state may not, in the guise of regulating the practice of law, consistent with the First Amendment prevent efforts of a union to provide its members practical and economical access to courts to press work-related personal injury claims. Those cases establish the right to engage in \u201ccollective activity undertaken to obtain meaningful access to the courts,\u201d <em>Transportation Union, supra, </em>401 U.S. at 585, 91 S.Ct. at 1082, where the members of the group are at least substantially united in interest. None of the claims asserted with the aid of those legal plans would, if successful, have disadvantaged any union member. In contrast, this case presents a seniority dispute where the real adversaries are union members. It is thus difficult to characterize Mr. Sandner\u2019s representation of the men as \u201ccollective activity\u201d of the group within the meaning of those cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>It is true that also underlying those cases \u201cwas the Court\u2019s concern that the aggrieved receive information regarding their legal rights and the means of effectuating them.\u201d See <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U.S. 350, 376 n. 32, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977). But here there is no claim that the male defendants were unaware of their legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">Also not controlling, though not necessarily irrelevant, are the fair representation cases, e. g., <em>Humphrey v. Moore, </em>375 U.S. 335, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, </em>345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953), discussed by appellants. Those eases hold that, in the context of a union\u2019s duty fairly to represent the bargaining unit, a union may, if in good faith, assert a position that benefits some of its members to the detriment of others. Since NYSUT has taken no position on the merits, it is far from clear that the union\u2019s right to take a position, established by those cases, is implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">Appellants suggest that the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>In re Primus, </em>436 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 1893, 56 L.Ed.2d 417 (1978) supports the view that an individual attorney like Mr. Sandner has a First Amendment right to make his views known in the courts even though his conduct in that direction might otherwise breach ethical canons. In <em>Primus, </em>a lawyer, who was also an officer of the Columbia, South Carolina branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), orally suggested the possibility of a lawsuit to a woman who had been sterilized as a condition of continued state medical assistance. This was followed by a letter offering the ACLU\u2019s free legal assistance. The Supreme Court described appellant\u2019s actions as \u201cundertaken to express personal political beliefs and to advance the civil-liberties objectives of the ACLU.\u201d 436 U.S. at 422, 98 S.Ct. at 1900. The Court held that attorney Primus\u2019s activities so characterized could not be punished as \u201csolicitation\u201d without violating First Amendment freedoms. While the language just quoted refers to the attorney\u2019s \u201cpersonal political beliefs,\u201d the main emphasis in the Court\u2019s opinion was that the activities under question were \u201con behalf of the ACLU,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 432, 98 S.Ct. 1893, and were protected under the freedom of association cases already referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-11\">We doubt that the principle of <em>Primus </em>extends to control this case. The freedom of association cases are distinguishable for the reasons already given. To the extent that <em>Primus </em>protects simply a lawyer\u2019s First Amendment rights, the attorney there was encouraging the airing in court of a point of view she believed in, that otherwise probably would not have been asserted by the potential plaintiff with whom she communicated. By contrast, Mr. Sandner\u2019s activity here was not really of that informative character. The male HPETs he represents are defendants and would have litigated their point of view (and Mr. Sandner\u2019s) regardless of his input. Indeed, it should be noted that the male HPETs sought out Mr. Sandner, not the other way around. <em>Primus </em>does not suggest that an attorney has a First Amendment right to conduct any particular representation, in the face of ethical proscriptions to the contrary, in the absence of any showing that such representation is necessary to facilitate assertion of a specific point of view in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-12\">Thus, while the male defendants have a right to obtain legal advice and representation, we do not believe that on these facts the First Amendment protects the right of a particular attorney to represent them in court. We thus conclude that the First Amendment does not constrain consideration of the propriety of Mr. Sandner\u2019s representation and the disqualification order, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-14\">We begin the discussion by noting that, curiously, the power of the federal courts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>disqualify attorneys in litigation pending before them has long been assumed without discussion, see, e. g., <em>General Contract Purchase Corp. v. Armour, </em>125 F.2d 147, 149 (5th Cir. 1942); <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>90 F.2d 65, 66 (6th Cir. 1937); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>52 App.D.C. 330, 286 F. 994, 997 (1923); <em>T. C. &amp; Theatre Corp. v. Warner Bros. Pictures, </em>113 F.Supp. 265, 271 n. 15 (S.D.N.Y.1953), and attention has focused on identifying the circumstances in which exercise of the power is appropriate. Our reading of the cases in this circuit suggests that we have utilized the power of trial judges to disqualify counsel where necessary to preserve the integrity of the adversary process in actions before them. In other words, with rare exceptions disqualification has been ordered only in essentially two kinds of cases: (1) where an attorney\u2019s conflict of interests in violation of Canons 5 and 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> undermines the court\u2019s confidence in the vigor of the attorney\u2019s representation of his client, see, e. g., <em>Fund of Funds, Ltd. v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>567 F.2d 225 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>Cinema 5, Ltd. v. Cinerama, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 1384 (2d Cir. 1976), or more commonly (2) where the attorney is at least potentially in a position to use privileged information concerning the other side through prior representation, for example, in violation of Canons 4 and 9,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> thus giving his present client an unfair advantage, see, e. g., <em>Fund of Funds, Ltd. v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., supra; Emle Industries, Inc. v. Patentex, Inc., </em>478 F.2d 562 (2d Cir. 1973). In such cases, we note Chief Judge Kaufman\u2019s oft-quoted admonition that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1318-4\">When dealing with ethical principles, we cannot paint with broad strokes. The lines are fine and must be so marked. Guideposts can be established when virgin ground is being explored, and the conclusion in a particular case can be reached only after a painstaking analysis of the facts and precise application of precedent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\"><em>Fund of Funds, Ltd., supra, </em>567 F.2d at 227, quoting <em>United States v. Standard Oil Co., </em>136 F.Supp. 345, 367 (S.D.N.Y.1955). But in other kinds of cases, we have shown considerable reluctance to disqualify attorneys despite misgivings about the attorney\u2019s conduct. See, e. g., <em>W. T. Grant Co. v. Haines, </em>531 F.2d 671 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Ceramco, Inc. v. Lee Pharmaceuticals, </em>510 F.2d 268 (2d Cir. 1975). This reluctance probably derives from the fact that disqualification has an immediate adverse effect on the client by separating him from counsel of his choice, and that disqualification motions are often interposed for tactical reasons. See <em>Allegaert </em>v. <em>Perot, </em>565 F.2d 246, 251 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>J. P. Foley &amp; Co., Inc. v. Vanderbilt, </em>523 F.2d 1357, 1360 (2d Cir. 1975) (Gurfein, J., concurring). And even when made in the best of faith, such motions inevitably cause delay. For example, this lawsuit has been at a standstill now for close to a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-11\">Weighing the needs of efficient judicial administration against the potential advantage of immediate preventive measures, we believe that unless an attorney\u2019s conduct tends to \u201ctaint the underlying trial,\u201d see <em>W. T. Grant Co., supra, </em>531 F.2d at 678, by disturbing the balance of the presentations in one of the two ways indicated above, courts should be quite hesitant to disqualify an attorney. Given the availability of both federal and state comprehensive disciplinary machinery, see, e. g., Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \u00a7 46(h) (1978), there is usually no need to deal with all other kinds of ethical violations in the very litigation in which they surface. See <em>Lefrak v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., </em>527 F.2d 1136, 1141 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Ceramco, Inc. v. Lee Pharmaceuticals, supra, </em>510 F.2d at 271. Cf. <em>United States v. Pastore, </em>537 F.2d 675 (2d Cir. 1976) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>With these thoughts in mind, we turn to the ethical problems presented by the instant appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court disqualified Mr. Sandner because a \u201clayman\u2019s faith would be severely troubled\u201d by the fact that \u201cthe female teachers are paying, in part, for their opponents\u2019 legal expenses.\u201d There is no claim, however, that Mr. Sandner feels any sense of loyalty to the women that would undermine his representation of the men. Nor is there evidence that his representation of the men is anything less than vigorous. There is also no claim that the men have gained an unfair advantage through any access to privileged information about the women. Were there any such problem, the women would not be asking, and the district judge would not have ordered, as an alternative to disqualification of Mr. Sandner, that NYSUT pay their attorney\u2019s fees. Thus, in no real sense can Mr. Sandner\u2019s representation of the men be said to taint the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">We agree that there is at least some possibility that Mr. Sandner\u2019s representation of the men has the appearance of impropriety, because of the large number of union members involved and the public importance of the civil rights issue at the heart of the dispute. But in any event, we think that disqualification was inappropriate. We believe that when there is \u25a0 no claim that the trial will be tainted, appearance of impropriety is simply too slender a reed on which to rest a disqualification order except in the rarest cases. This is particularly true where, as in this case, the appearance of impropriety is not very clear. We note that while on one hand there is an element of unfairness to the women,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on the other it seems probable that if NYSUT were to take a position on the merits of this litigation, Mr. Sandner\u2019s representation of the men would apparently be within the protection of the \u201cfair representation\u201d cases discussed in Part II, <em>supra. </em>This means that the question whether Mr. Sandner\u2019s conduct is unethical could be a very close one. Since disqualification entails immediate disruption of the litigation, it is better to relegate any questions about Mr. Sandner\u2019s conduct to other appropriate proceedings. In addition to the possibility of grievance proceedings and an internal union attack on the legal plan, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>it may be that judicial construction of the plan, in an appropriate lawsuit, could provide some relief for the women.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-9\">We therefore reverse the order of the district court disqualifying counsel, and remand for continuation of the action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">. At that time, the Commissioner was Ewald Nyquist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">. <em>In the Matter of the Appeal of Daniel Gavrin, </em>No. 9321 (Oct. 5, 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1315-16\">.

Some NYSUT members are employees of private schools and universities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">. Nor is there here the need to provide representation to the men in order to redress an imbalance in legal resources. In the Supreme Court\u2019s group legal plan cases, there was evidence that the plans\u2019 purpose was to combat the overreaching by both employers and mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>bers of the bar that had in the past effectively thwarted recovery of adequate compensation for injuries. Since the contending parties here are all union members, the men\u2019s resources are presumably comparable to their adversaries\u2019.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AYuV\">. C\u00e1non 5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1318-6\">A lawyer should exercise independent judgment on behalf of a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">Canon 9 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1318-8\">A lawyer should avoid even the appearance of professional impropriety.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1318-14\">. Canon 4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1318-15\">A lawyer should preserve the confidences and secrets of a client.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">. There is no dispute that the order here is appealable, but we do take note of recent controversy centering on appealability of district court orders <em>denying </em>a disqualification motion. See Note, The Appealability of Orders Denying Motions for Disqualification of Counsel in the Federal Courts, 45 Chi.L.Rev. 450 (1978). Although <em>Silver Chrysler Plymouth, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>496 F.2d 800 (2d Cir. 1974) (en banc) recently established that such orders denying disqualification are appealable in this circuit, there have been later rumbles of discontent regarding the new rule. See <em>Allegaert v. Perot, </em>565 F.2d 246, 251 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>W. T. Grant Co. v. Haines, supra, </em>531 F.2d at 677-78; Van Graafeiland, Lawyer\u2019s Conflict of Interest \u2014 A Judge\u2019s View (Part II), N.Y.L.J., July 20, 1977, at 1, col. 2. Obviously where, as here, the motion seeking disqualification has been <em>granted, </em>appellate review is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1319-13\">. The unfairness may in part be due to the nature of the plan adopted by NYSUT which leaves so much to Mr. Sandner\u2019s discretion. This suggests that the women should take whatever steps are possible within normal internal union processes. Cf. also <em>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, </em>431 U.S. 209, <em>237-42, </em>97 S.Ct. 1782, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1319-10\">MANSFIELD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AfTA\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-11\">For the reasons ably stated by Judge Feinberg, I concur in the view that a federal court should not disqualify an attorney on ethical grounds from representing a party in a pending lawsuit in the absence of a reasonable basis for believing that his or her unprofessional conduct may affect the outcome. An \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d orTah attorney\u2019s part would rarely have this effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The attorney is the client\u2019s choice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>Disqualification is wasteful and time-consuming. Only where the attorney\u2019s unprofessional conduct may affect the outcome of the case is there any necessity to nip it in the bud. Otherwise conventional disciplinary machinery should be used and, if this is inadequate, the organized bar must assume th\u00e9 burden of making it effective as a deterrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">Regardless of the foregoing principle, however, in the present case I would reverse the district court\u2019s decision on the ground that there is no \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d in the representation by an association-salaried lawyer such as Mr. Sandner of one set of dues-paying members pursuant to its legal services program in a case involving other dues-paying members with conflicting interests. Obviously if NYSUT, either through its charter, by-laws or some other authoritative official action, had prohibited its counsel from representing members in such a situation or had specified the terms and conditions under which legal services could be provided to members, those provisions would govern and the association\u2019s counsel would be obligated to conduct himself accordingly. But absent such a bar or blueprint, an organization financed with dues received from all members may properly take a position that benefits some members at the expense of others, provided it acts reasonably, in good faith and without hostility or arbitrary discrimination. <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>375 U.S. 335, 349-50, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, </em>345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953). If it is proper for the organization to do so, there is no impropriety in its counsel doing likewise, subject to the same conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">The relevant legal principle has been clearly stated by the Supreme Court with respect to the analogous question of fair union representation in <em>Humphrey, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq4D\">\u201cBut we are not ready to find a breach of the collective bargaining agent\u2019s duty of fair representation in taking a good faith position contrary to that of some individuals whom it represents nor in supporting the position of one group of employees against that of another. In <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, </em>345 U.S. 330 [73 S.Ct. 681, 97 S.Ct. 1048], the Court found no breach of duty by the union in agreeing to an amendment of an existing collective bargaining contract, granting enhanced seniority to a particular group of employees and resulting in layoffs which otherwise would not have occurred. \u2018Inevitably differences arise in the manner and degree to which the terms of any negotiated agreement affect individual employees and classes of employees. The mere existence of such differences does not make them invalid. The complete satisfaction of all who are represented is hardly to be expected. A wide range of reasonableness must be allowed a statutory bargaining representative in serving the unit it represents, subject always to complete good faith and honesty of purpose in the exercise of its discretion.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 338 [73 S.Ct. 681]. Just as a union must be free to sift out wholly frivolous grievances which would only clog the grievance process, so it must be free to take a position on the not so frivolous disputes. Nor should it be neutralized when the issue is chiefly between two sets of em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>ployees. Conflict between employees represented by the same union is a recurring fact. To remove or gag the union in these cases would surely weaken the collective bargaining . and . grievance processes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1321-5\">\u201cAs far as this record shows, the union took its position honestly, in good faith and without hostility or arbitrary discrimination. ... By choosing to integrate seniority lists based upon length of service at either company, the union acted upon wholly relevant considerations, not upon capricious or arbitrary factors. The evidence shows no breach by the union of its duty of fair representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">In my view the same principles govern NY-SUT\u2019s administration of its legal services plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">Although NYSUT has not taken any official position with respect to the issues at stake in this case, its members have adopted a legal services plan authorizing its salaried counsel to represent such members as he determines in good faith to have claims or defenses that are job-related and meritorious. Nothing in the plan requires prior approval by NYSUT of such representation or limits the representation to legal controversies with third parties, as distinguished from representation of NYSUT or some of its members in differences with other members. The sole standard is whether in the opinion of NYSUT\u2019s counsel the claim or defense is job-related and meritorious, regardless of the identity or membership of other parties involved in the legal controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-8\">This standard strikes me as fair and reasonable. I fail to detect in it any appearance of impropriety, as long as NYSUT\u2019s counsel, in the course of representing the male HPETs, does not express. or imply without authority that he speaks for NY-SUT. Membership in NYSUT is entirely voluntary. A dues-paying member should recognize that situations will arise where the successful-representation of one member or a group of members may benefit them at the expense of other members. Common examples are disputes over seniority rules, claims of unfair layoffs, transfers and denials of promotion. A person joining the organization and paying dues should therefore anticipate that if he or she becomes embroiled in a job-related controversy with NYSUT or another member, (1) NYSUT\u2019s counsel must make a choice and render services only to those members believed in good faith by him or her to have meritorious job-related claims or defenses, (2) NYSUT will not provide counsel to members whose claims or defenses are believed by its .counsel in good faith to be frivolous or not job-related, and (3) in a dispute between members of the organization its counsel, in representing those believed to have a meritorious cause, will be financed by NYSUT through funds derived in part from dues-paying members who are adverse parties in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-10\">NYSUT\u2019s provision of legal services to one member or group of members believed in good faith to have meritorious job-related claims against other members should not be labelled as . creating an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d simply because the other members may take adverse positions believed by NYSUT\u2019s counsel to be frivolous or meritless. Nor should the organization, absent a contrary provision in its plan, be forced to represent members believed by it to be asserting such frivolous claims or defenses. Cf. <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 191, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967); <em>Humphrey v. Moore, </em>375 U.S. 335, 349-50, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964). None of this is intended to imply that we, as distinguished from NYSUT or its counsel, have any views regarding the merits of the claims of the male and female HPETs respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-11\">It could be argued that the NYSUT legal services plan vests its counsel with too wide a discretion to determine what members\u2019 claims are meritorious or job-related in an intra-organizational dispute, or that the plan poses too great a risk of erroneous, invidious, fraudulent or discriminatory decisions by its counsel in such matters. If so, the remedy rests in the hands of NYSUT\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>members who have the power to change or modify its legal services plan. In addition, of course, they would be entitled to seek relief from the court upon a showing that NYSUT\u2019s counsel had abused his powers or acted in bad faith or for reasons unconnected with the merits of the cause which he chose to advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">In the recent decision of <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., East Meadow Union Free School District, </em>App.Div., 409 N.Y.S.2d 234 (2d Dept. 1978), which was handed down since the argument of this appeal, the Appellate Division, Second Department, of the New York Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision that had been relied upon by appellees and decided that there was no impropriety in representation by NYSUT\u2019s counsel of one of its members in a so-called \u201cone-on-one\u201d dispute with another member with respect to seniority, even though the organization had not taken any more of an \u201cofficial\u201d position with respect to the merits of the dispute than has NYSUT in the present case. Assuming it is proper for an organization\u2019s counsel to represent one member against another in a \u201cone-on-one\u201d seniority dispute, despite the absence of any organizational position with respect to the issue in dispute, I find no rational basis for distinguishing <em>Jacobs </em>from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">Applying these relevant legal principles here, it was not improper for NYSUT\u2019s counsel to provide legal representation to the male HPETs whose job-related claim was reasonably believed by him to be meritorious. I would therefore hold not only that an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d is an insufficient ground, by itself, to justify a court\u2019s disqualification of an attorney during the prosecution of a case absent a reasonable basis for believing that such an appearance may affect the outcome, but also that in any event there was no such \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d on the facts of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1319-14\">. Our decision in <em>General Motors Corporation v. City of New York, </em>501 F.2d 639 (2d Cir. 1974), is an example of a case where a combination of an attorney\u2019s \u201cappearance of impro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>priety\u201d plus his violation of another disciplinary rule might have affected the outcome. There we held that a lawyer who had, as an attorney for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, been involved with a Government investigation of and lawsuit against General Motors alleging monopolization of the market for city buses, was barred from later representation in private practice of the City of New York in its antitrust suit for damages against General Motors based on essentially the same claims, albeit with respect to a later point in time. Although we there noted the importance of a lawyer\u2019s avoiding an appearance of impropriety as required by Canon 9, we also emphasized the additional specific prohibition of D.R. 9-101(B), not applicable here, to the effect that \u201cA lawyer shall not accept private employment in a matter in which he had substantial responsibility while he was a public employee,\u201d 501 F.2d at 648-49. Implicit in this Disciplinary Rule is the concern that the former <em>Government </em>attorney might in the later private action use information with respect to the matter in issue which was gained in confidence as a public employee and was unavailable to the other side.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
