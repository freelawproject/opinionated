The district court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the Loan Company\u2019s failures to disclose the acceleration clause on the face of its promissory note and to disclose the rebate policy upon acceleration were violations of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(a)(7) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.-8(b)(4). <em>Burley v. Bastrop Loan Co., </em>407 F.Supp. 773 (W.D.La.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-28\">After the district court\u2019s opinion, this court decided <em>Martin v. Commercial Securities Co., </em>539 F.2d 521 (5 Cir. 1976). In <em>Martin </em>we rejected the contentions that failure, either to disclose an acceleration clause or the lender\u2019s concomitant rebate policy could give rise to a statutory viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following Martin<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we reverse the summary judgment and remand to the district court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-11\">. Appellee seeks to distinguish <em>Martin </em>on several grounds. First, he contends that the method of rebate employed in this case \u2014 the Rule of 78\u2019s \u2014 is inaccurate and allows the creditor to retain <em>unearned </em>interest. Appellee contends that this retention of unearned charges must be disclosed. <em>Martin </em>has been construed, however, to encompass this distinction. See <em>McDaniel v. Fulton National Bank, </em>571 F.2d 948 (5 Cir.) (en banc), petition for rehearing en banc, 576 F.2d 1156 (5 Cir. 1978). Second, appellee contends that failure to disclose an acceleration clause violates 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.-8(b)(7) (disclosure of method of rebate upon prepayment). <em>Martin, </em>however, effectively rejected this argument. 539 F.2d at 528-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">The district court briefly posited, as an alternative basis for his decision, the notion that \u201cmeaningful disclosure\u201d under the Act required disclosure of the right and consequences of acceleration. The <em>per se </em>rule of <em>Martin, </em>however, cannot be effectively vitiated by applying the inchoate principle of meaningful disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-13\">. In <em>McDaniel v. Fulton National Bank, </em>571 F.2d 948 (5 Cir.) (en banc), on petition for rehearing en banc, 576 F.2d 1156 (5 Cir. 1978), the en banc court, overruling <em>Martin </em>in part, held that disclosure of rebate provisions on acceleration is necessary when the creditor does not rebate unearned finance charges in accordance with disclosed provisions for rebate upon prepayment. This ruling, however, was made prospective from the date of decision plus 90 days, applying to obligations incurred or renewed after that date. 571 F.2d at 951. Even if <em>McDaniel </em>applied, the result in this case would be the same since the prepayment rebate policy was disclosed and is applied in the event of acceleration.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-24\">The Eighth and Ninth Circuits have rejected the contention that the Rule of 78\u2019s results in retention of unearned interest upon prepayment. <em>Gantt v. Commonwealth Loan Co., </em>573 F.2d 520 (8 Cir. 1978); <em>Bone v. Hibernia Bank, </em>493 F.2d 135 (9 Cir. 1974). Since <em>Martin </em>controls in this case, we need not decide if the Rule results in retention of unearned interest upon acceleration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-25\">. Appellee is not required to cross-appeal in order to urge before this court a theory in support of the district court\u2019s decision, <em>see Matter of Henderson, </em>577 F.2d 997, 1002 n.5 (5 Cir. 1978); <em>Lowe v. Pate Stevedoring Co., </em>558 F.2d 769, 770-71 n.2 (5 Cir. 1977); <em>Spurlin v. General Motors Corp., </em>531 F.2d 279 (5 Cir. 1976), and he asserts that we should affirm on the basis of other purported violations appearing in the record. We decline to do so for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-26\">First, appellee tenders as evidence a deposition taken after oral argument in this case. The court of appeals, however, is an inappropriate forum for the initial submission of evidence and we suggest that such evidence properly should be submitted to the district court. Second, appellee asserts that in the record made in the district court defendant admitted in answer to an interrogatory that the annual percentage rate was <em>overstated </em>in the disclosure statement. On the limited record relating to this particular violation, however, we decline to grant a summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
