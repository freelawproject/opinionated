United States, </em>412 U.S. 837, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973), held the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury to have been erroneous. Upon reconsideration it is concluded that the instruction, \u201c[possession of property recently stolen if not satisfactorily explained is . ordinarily a circumstance from which the jury may reasonably draw the inference and find in the light of surrounding circumstances shown by the evidence in this case that the person in possession not only knew it was stolen property but also participated in some way in the theft of the property,\u201d did not misstate the applicable law. <em>See United States v. Nalley, </em>455 F.2d 259 (6th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>425 F.2d 226 (6th Cir. 1970); <em>Prince </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 F.2d 838 (6th Cir. 1954), and cases therein cited. Accordingly, the petition for rehearing is granted, and upon reconsideration, it being further concluded that the other contentions made by the appellant are without merit,</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the district court be and it hereby is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
