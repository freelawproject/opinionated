The issue presented is whether 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 702c <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides immunity to the United States for the water damage that occurred to appellee-plaintiffs Donald and Doris Taylor\u2019s property in the summer of 1975. We hold the government immune from all claims alleged in the Taylors\u2019 first amended complaint<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we reverse and remand this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>case to the district court with instructions to enter a summary judgment for the government pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The Taylors own a farm adjacent to the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers in western North Dakota. Their farm is located midway between the Ft. Peck Dam, located in Montana, and the Garrison Dam, located in North Dakota. There are four other dams, all located downstream from the' Garrison Dam, and the six projects together operate for the purposes of flood control, irrigation, navigation, hydroelectric power generation, water supply, water quality improvement, recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement. Lake Sakakawea is located behind the Garrison Dam on the Missouri River in North Dakota. Thus the Taylors\u2019 farm is upstream from Lake Sakakawea and the Garrison Dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On June 18 and 19, 1975, severe rains occurred in east-central Montana, causing severe flooding along many tributary streams of the Missouri River. During this general time period, the Taylors alleged that the government wrongfully and negligently operated the Garrison Dam and the reservoir impoundment, Lake Sakakawea, above the legally authorized water level. It is the Taylors\u2019 contention that this caused the impoundment waters of Lake Sakakawea to back up on their property; the accumulation of water on the Taylor farm in June, July and August, 1975, caused crop damage to 23 acres of wheat, 22 acres of hay, and 135 acres of pasture.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The Taylors\u2019 first amended complaint was filed against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) and 2671 et seq., and alleged the wrongful operation by the government of the Garrison Dam and Reservoir and further claimed damages of $11,862.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The trial court denied .the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, stating that \u201c[t]he Court is persuaded * * * that 33 U.S.C. Section 702c does <em>not </em>provide absolute immunity to the United States under the circumstances alleged in Plaintiff\u2019s First Amended Complaint, and, further, that the operation of the Garrison Dam and the maintenance of the water level in Lake Sakakawea beyond its legally authorized level is <em>not </em>a \u2018discretionary function\u2019 within the exception provided by 28 U.S.C. Section 2680(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The trial court then certified, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), the issue raised by the motion for summary judgment: \u201c[wjhether or not 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 702c provides absolute immunity to the United States for damages tortious in nature caused to the Plaintiffs by actions of the Defendants,\u201d and this court granted, leave to appeal. Fed.R. App.P. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The stringent requirements for the moving party on a summary judgment motion are well known:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">[Sjummary judgment is an extreme remedy and one which is not to be entered unless the movant has established his right to a judgment with such clarity as to leave no room for controversy and that the other party is not entitled to recover under any discernible circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az4\"><em>Bellflower v. Pennise, </em>548 F.2d 776, 777 (8th Cir. 1977). Thus, for the purposes of this appeal, we will assume all facts favorably to'the Taylors.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">Interpreting the scope of immunity of section 702c is not a new task for this court. The Eighth Circuit has written the leading case in this regard, <em>National Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>210 F.2d 263 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>347 U.S. 967, 74 S.Ct. 778, 98 L.Ed. 1108 (1954), wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">[Wjhen Congress entered upon flood control on the great scale contemplated by the Acts [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq.] it safeguarded the United States against liability of any kind for damage from or by floods or flood waters in the broadest and most emphatic language. The cost of the flood control works itself would inevita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>bly be very great and Congress plainly manifested its will that those costs should not have the flood damages that will inevitably recur added to them. Undoubtedly floods which have traditionally been deemed \u201cActs of God\u201d wreak the greatest property destruction of all natural catastrophies and where floods occur after flood control work has been done and relied on the damages are vastly increased. But there is no question of the power and right of Congress to keep the government entirely free from liability when floods occur, notwithstanding the great government works undertaken to minimize them. Congress included Section 3 [702c] in the 1928 Act and carried it forward into the 1936 Act and others with intent to exercise that power completely and to absolutely bar any such federal liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">$ sfc * * ' * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">Undoubtedly that absolute freedom of the government from liability for flood damages is and has been a factor of the greatest importance in the extent to which Congress has been and is willing to make appropriations for flood control and to engage in costly undertakings to reduce flood damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">* * * [Section 702c] does not limit the bar against such recovery to cases where floods or flood waters are the sole cause of damages. It does bar liability of any kind from damages \u201cby\u201d floods or flood waters but it goes further and in addition it bars liability for damages that result (even <em>indirectly) </em>\u201cfrom\u201d floods. The use of the word \u201cfrom\u201d in addition to \u201cby\u201d makes it clear that the bar against federal liability for damages is made to apply wherever floods or flood waters have been substantial and material factors in destroying or damaging property. The language used shows Congressional anticipation that it will be claimed after the happening of floods that negligence of government employees was a proximate cause of damages where floods or flood waters have destroyed or damaged goods. But the section prohibits government liability of \u201cany kind\u201d and at \u201cany place\u201d. So that uniformly and throughout the country at any place where there is damage \u201cfrom\u201d or \u201cby\u201d a flood or flood waters in spite of and notwithstanding federal flood control works no liability of any kind may attach to or rest upon the United States therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 270, 271 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\"><em>National Mfg. Co. v. United States, supra, </em>has frequently been cited as support for the broad-based immunity grant of section 702c.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>E. g., Callaway v. United States, </em>568 F.2d 684, 686 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>Florida East Coast Ry. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>519 F.2d 1184, 1191-92 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Graci </em>v. <em>United States, </em>456 F.2d 20, 23-25 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>Parks v. United States, </em>370 F.2d 92 (2d Cir. 1966); <em>Ledford v. United States, </em>429 F.Supp. 204, 205 (W.D.Okl.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The Taylors admit to the immunity status accorded the government by section 702c; they contend, however, that their situation is factually distinct and thus outside the scope of section 702c. The Taylors state in their brief: \u201cIf floods or flood waters remain so after impoundment, for the immunity of this statute, so that all torts committed in the operation of an impoundment are barred, then Summary Judgment for the Government wouid be correct.\u201d It is their position that the water which did damage to their property was <em>backwater, </em>and that section 702c does not grant the government immunity from the tort of trespass by backwater impoundment injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">For the purpose of summary judgment, we assume the Taylors' allegations to be true. Backwater is a body or accumulation of water resulting from an obstruction or opposing current. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. 1971). Flood water has been defined as \u201c[w]ater which has overflowed the natural banks of the stream in its natu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ral channel, and which is contained by a system of levees;\u201d flood has been defined as \u201cwater which inundates an area of the surface of the earth where it ordinarily would not be expected to be.\u201d <em>Stover v. United States, </em>204 F.Supp. 477, 485 (N.D.Cal.1962), <em>affirmed, </em>332 F.2d 204 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 922, 85 S.Ct. 276, 13 L.Ed.2d 335 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">It is argued by the Taylors that over a period of time the Garrison Dam obstructed sufficient water such that Lake Sakakawea was filled close to or at the maximum level. When the rains in June came, the additional water was impounded in the lake, took on the identity of backwater as opposed to floodwater, and increased the level to the point where backwater settled upon the Taylors\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">We do not believe the Taylors\u2019 distinction between floodwaters and backwaters to be valid for the purposes of section 702c. Despite the allegations \u2014 which for summary judgment purposes we take to be true\u2014 that the government wrongfully and negligently operated the dam; that the water was obstructed to the point where it increased the water level to beyond the maximum; that the backwater level was result-an tly increased; and that the water which damaged the Taylors\u2019 property was backwater, this factual situation falls within that which section 702c was meant to cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The Taylors do not deny that the rainstorm in June was severe<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and they do not deny that the Garrison Dam and the other connected dams were built, inter alia, for the purpose of flood control. <em>See Callaway v. United States, supra, </em>568 F.2d at 687. We can see no rational distinction between floodwaters and backwaters that would lead to a different result in this case. The most favorable chain of events that we can presume is that the water already impounded in Lake Sakakawea was backwater. The rains of June were negligently impounded beyond the maximum operating level, which pushed the previously existing backwater onto the Taylors\u2019 property. To presume such a distinction is difficult enough, but it still does not escape the breadth of section 702c immunity. As we stated in <em>National Mfg. Co. v. United States, supra, </em>210 F.2d at 271, section 702c \u201cbars liability for damages that result (even indirectly) \u2018from\u2019 floods.\u201d Thus, even if it was backwater that damaged the Taylors\u2019 property, and even if section 702c would not cover \u201cbackwater\u201d per se, the backwater was pushed onto the Taylors\u2019 property \u201cin whole or in part from unusual or extraordinary climatic conditions.\u201d <em>Stover v. United States, supra, </em>204 F.Supp. at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Because we can conceive of no set of facts to be drawn from this case that would fall outside the scope of immunity in section 702c, we reverse and remand with instructions for the trial court to enter summary judgment for the government.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-5\">.

On November 22, 1976, the Taylors filed suit against the United States Government, seeking recovery for both a taking, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1402, and tort claim damages, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671 et seq. On February 22, 1977, the United States filed an answer to the Taylors\u2019 complaint. On March 2, 1977, the Taylors initiated discovery procedures by filing their first set of interrogatories. Then, on April 29, 1977, the United States filed a motion for summary judgment with supporting affidavit. There was no action by either of the parties or the district court until January 5, 1978, when the Taylors filed a motion to amend their complaint, brief and affidavit in support thereof, and a first amended complaint, which dismissed the taking claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1402, <em>see United States v. Cress, </em>243 U.S. 316, 37 S.Ct. 380, 61 L.Ed. 746 (1917), and restated the tort claim. The district court granted this motion and ordered the first amended complaint to be filed on February 13, 1978. The district court then considered the motion for summary judgment filed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>United States in response to the original complaint as being responsive to the first amended complaint. The district court denied the United States\u2019 motion for summary judgment on March 9, 1978, and entered an order on March 10, 1978. Consequently, on this appeal, we are concerned only with the issues raised in the first amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">. \u201cIt is well-settled that the later passage of the [Federal Tort Claims Act] in 1946 did not repeal by implication the immunity granted under \u00a7 702c.\u201d <em>Lunsford v.

The April rise is generally the most destructive, for it shows, for a time at least, a tendency to follow the channels developed during the low water season preceding, and, as a consequence, the banks are attacked with extreme violence. . . .
