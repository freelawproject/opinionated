The Commission evaluated the proposed tariff under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(4), (6)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and determined that ConRail was entitled to discontinue its Trailer services to these terminals as no \u201creasonable request\u201d for their continuation had been advanced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioners do not challenge the factual basis for the Commission\u2019s order, but rather only the criteria it applied in weighing the evidence presented. As we find that the standard adopted by the ICC was reasonable, within its statutory authority and not inconsistent with its previous decisions in similar eases, we affirm the Commission\u2019s order in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-16\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-17\">ConRail was established pursuant to the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>with the purpose of \u201creorganization of the railroads, stripped of excess facilities, into a single, viable system operated by a private, for-profit corporation.\u201d <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, [Blanchette </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Ins. Corps.], </em>419 U.S. 102, 109, 95 S.Ct. 335, 342, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974). To undertake the planning necessary to implement such reorganization of a number of bankrupt railroads, Congress established the United States Railway Association (USRA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 711, charged with developing a \u201cFinal System Plan\u201d for restructuring the northeastern railroads, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-18\">The Final System Plan was published in due course by the USRA in July 26, 1975, and supplemented on September 18 of the same year. This Plan transferred approximately 70% of the lines of six northeastern railroads<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to ConRail and referred specifically to the necessity of restructuring the Trailer service offered by these bankrupt lines.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-19\">On April 1, 1976, ConRail commenced common carrier operations, having filed its Tariff No. 1 in which it proposed to cancel trailer service to 31 ramps previously serviced by the railroads from which ConRail had been constituted. On March 22, 1976, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission filed a protest and petitioned for suspension of the proposed cancellation of TOFC service with the ICC. Many similar protests were filed by parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>concerning other TOFC ramps where Con-Rail planned to terminate service. On March 31, the Commission, Division 2, suspended 27 of ConRail\u2019s proposed TOFC cancellations until October 31, 1976, and ordered an investigation into the lawfulness of ConRail\u2019s proposals, I &amp; S Docket No. 9108.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is undisputed that all such investigation proceedings after February 5, 1976 are governed by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(8)(a). This provision of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 requires that when the Commission investigates a proposed change in a railroad\u2019s tariff it shall render a final decision within 7 months of the date that the change was scheduled to become effective.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">Oral hearings were held in the TOFC investigation on May 26 and 27<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and briefs were submitted by participating parties. The ICC, Division 2, served and published its Report and Order on October 29, 1976, two days before the expiration of the statutory seven month period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It found that cancellation of TOFC service to or from 24 of the originally proposed 31 terminals had been shown to be just and reasonable. Included among these 24 terminals were Sharon and Reading, Pennsylvania and Elmira, New York. ConRail thereupon ceased Trailer service to these points. On November 24, Pennsylvania filed a \u201cpetition for reconsideration\u201d of the order of October 29 requesting the resumption of service to Sharon and Reading. This Petition for Reconsideration was within the 30 day period provided for such petitions by Commission regulations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Corning Glass Works and Thatcher Glass Manufacturing Company also filed similar petitions with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>the cancellation of the Elmira service and also on December 27,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> filed petitions for review of the ICC\u2019s order in this court, Docket No. 76-2153.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">' The Commission denied both of these \u201cpetitions for reconsideration\u201d by its order of February 2, 1977 in I &amp; S No. 9108 (complaint).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The ICC stated in this order that due to the seven month time limit established in 15(8)(a), the October 29 order was statutorily and administratively final. Thus, by statute, the Commission asserted that it was precluded from acting on petitions for reconsideration and it was likewise precluded from reversing itself on reconsideration sua sponte.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, it elected to treat the petitions in question as new \u201ccomplaints\u201d within the meaning of 15(8)(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-11\">Acting on these \u201cnew complaints\u201d the Commission granted Corning and Thatcher\u2019s complaint that termination of the Elmira service was unlawful. However, it dismissed Pennsylvania\u2019s complaint by discontinuing the proceeding on the ground that it could not take any further action on its <footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> final </em>decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-12\">On February 3, Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (Utility Commission) filed a petition for review in this court, Docket No. 77-1147 and at the same time intervened in No. 76-2153, the action filed on December 27 by Corning and Thatcher. On February 18, however, Corning and Thatcher moved to dismiss No. 76-2153 on the grounds that the relief that they were seeking had been granted by the Commission\u2019s decision to restore service to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>Elmira (ConRail had resumed TOFC service to Elmira on February 15, 1977). Pennsylvania and the Utility Commission opposed this motion to dismiss because, as more than sixty days had elapsed between the October 29th order and their filing for judicial review, dismissing No. 76-2153 might cause the court to lose jurisdiction over 77-1147 according to the I.C.C.\u2019s interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This court, however, granted the motion to dismiss and denied a petition for rehearing on that ruling on April 28, 1977. On June 16, the petitioners filed their opening brief in 77-1147. Con-Rail and Corning Glass and Thatcher Manufacturing were permitted to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">As a threshold issue, the ICC raises a challenge to the jurisdiction of this court. This challenge is based on the Commission\u2019s interpretation of two statutes. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(8)(a)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> requires that the Commission issue a \u201cfinal decision\u201d on the reasonableness of proposed tariffs no later than seven months after their scheduled effective date. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (the Hobbs Act) specifies that \u201cany party aggrieved by a final order [of an Agency] may, within 60 days after its entry, file a petition to review the order in the court of appeals wherein venue lies.\u201d The ICC contends that since Pennsylvania and the Utility Commission did not file for review within sixty days of the ICC order of October 29, they are barred by the Hobbs Act from being heard in this court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Petitioners, on the other hand, argue that the 60 day period provided for by the Hobbs Act was tolled until the Commission disposed of their Petition for Reconsideration. The ICC acknowledges that usually a party has sixty days from the denial of a Petition for Reconsideration to file for judicial review, but insists that the requirement embodied in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(8)(a) that a \u201cfinal decision [be] rendered\u201d not later than 7 months after the scheduled effective date supercedes the usual review procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">The jurisdictional argument raised by the Commission is sufficiently surprising that it is worth summarizing what it considers to be the basic issue raised by the timing of the various petitions for review and reconsideration presented in this case. Pennsylvania complied with all the time limits applicable in the usual case of obtaining judicial review of administrative action in that it filed for reconsideration by the agency within the prescribed 30 day period and for judicial review within the sixty days prescribed by the Hobbs Act from the date of the denial of the petition for reconsideration. Respondents, however, argue that petitioners\u2019 suit should be barred as untimely. The Commission maintains that 15(8)(a) changed the normal review procedure by foreclosing <em>all </em>possibility of further agency review after the lapsing of the seven month period. Thus, because the Commission\u2019s order in this case was issued at the very end of this period, it necessarily became the agency\u2019s final order, without possibility of reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">Accordingly, the Commission argues that the sixty day period of the Hobbs Act began to run, not from the date of the disposition of the Petition for Reconsideration but from the earlier date of the issuance of the original order embracing the \u201cfinal decision.\u201d The Commission, however, does an end run around its construction of the statute by treating what it terms an untimely petition for review as a new \u201ccomplaint\u201d because it deemed itself barred by 15(8)(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>from following its normal procedure of giving further consideration to its order upon a petition for reconsideration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">We readily agree that time limitations for seeking judicial review of agency orders are jurisdictional, Fed.R.App.P. 26(b); <em>Microwave Communications, Inc. v. F.C.C., </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. 154, 157-158, 515 F.2d 385, 388-389 (1974), so that had petitioners in fact been tardy in seeking review we would be required to dismiss the case. We cannot, however, concur in the Commission\u2019s construction of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(8)(a). Petitions for reconsideration are a basic feature of administrative decision making and explicitly provided for in the Interstate Commerce Act, <em>see </em>Guandolo, Transportation Law 970 (1973); 1 Davis, Administrative Law 602 (1958); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(6), and \u201c[a] general notion [is that] ... an administrative order is not \u2018final,\u2019 for purposes of judicial review, until outstanding petitions for reconsideration have been disposed of,\u201d <em>Civil Aeronautics Board v. Delta Air Lines, </em>367 U.S. 316, 326, 81 S.Ct. 1611, 1619, 6 L.Ed.2d 869 (1961); see, e. <em>g., Tallman v. Udall, </em>116 U.S.App.D.C. 379, 324 F.2d 411, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1963); <em>Montship Lines v. Federal Maritime Board, </em>111 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 295 F.2d 147 (1961); <em>Outland v. Civil Aeronautics Board, </em>109 U.S.App.D.C. 90, 284 F.2d 224 (1960); <em>Braniff Airways, Inc. </em>v. <em>Civil Aeronautics Board, </em>79 U.S.App.D.C. 341, 147 F.2d 152 (1945); <em>cf. American Farm Lines v. Black Ball, </em>397 U.S. 532, 541, 90 S.Ct. 1288, 25 L.Ed.2d 547 (1970). The ICC\u2019s argument hinges on its position that Congress intended in section 15(8)(a), solely with respect to the ICC, to alter the usual practice of filing for judicial review only after administrative reconsideration has been denied. An order \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of 15(8)(a) should, the ICC asserts, be treated as \u201cfinal for purposes of the Hobbs Act as well<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> because by 15(8)(a) Congress meant to foreclose the ICC from further consideration \u2014 even on petitions, for reconsideration \u2014 of the tariffs submitted to it. We view this provision, however, as merely intending to require the Commission to act with sufficient promptness so that the railroad could place the tariff into effect within a reasonable period or begin its normal procedures to test the Commission\u2019s ruling. The last sentence of \u00a7 15(8)(a) which provides \u201cSuch rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation or practice may be set aside thereafter by the Commission if, upon complaint of an interested party, the Commission finds it to be unlawful\u201d \u2014 was merely intended to authorize <em>other parties </em>to attack the Commission\u2019s ruling on various tariffs by subsequent complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">In enacting 15(8)(a) Congress was undoubtedly concerned to speed up the often dilatory deliberations of the ICC.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s suggestion that Congress meant to require it to act definitively within seven months and did not intend this time limit to be subject to extension by the pendency of petitions for reconsideration has some cogency. Upon analysis, however, to consider the \u201cfinal decisions\u201d within 7 months required by \u00a7 15(8)(a) as entailing \u201cfinality\u201d for purposes of the Hobbs Act seems clearly mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">15(8)(a) was designed to speed up the consideration of tariffs by providing that within seven months of their proposed effective dates, Commission action on suspended tariffs must become \u201cfinal\u201d under penalty of having tariffs go into effect in their original form. Section 15(8)(a) reflects such a purpose on its face, and specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>ic allusions abound in the Committee reports to the \u201cexcessive regulatory delay\u201d and \u201cwasteful and time-consuming\u201d regulatory practices at the Commission.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We conclude, consonant with this legislative history, that any petition for reconsideration that may be filed in regard to a Commission ruling under 15(8)(a) should not interfere with the finality \u2014 in the sense of <em>effectiveness </em>\u2014 of a tariff after the expiration of the seven months period. It is, however, a far cry from reaching this conclusion to accepting the Commission\u2019s jurisdictional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">That tariffs must become effective within seven months does not mean that the Commission, without further suspending such effectiveness, cannot entertain a proper petition for reconsideration after this time. The October 29 order was \u201cfinal\u201d \u2014 despite the filing of a petition for reconsideration \u2014 in the sense of being operative in allowing the proposed cancellation of TOFC service by ConRail to become effective.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The petition for reconsideration thus did not deprive the Commission\u2019s decision of its quality as a final order in the sense of effectiveness, but there is no justification for holding that its failure to toll the effectiveness of the tariff also involved a failure to toll the sixty day period within which a petition for review under the Hobbs Act must be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">As mentioned above, the legislative history of the Railroad Revitalization Act explicitly refers to reducing the delays caused by the Commission\u2019s deliberations. There is no indication, however, that Congress considered it advisable to force the expedition of judicial review<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> of the Commission orders by requiring petitions for reconsideration to be filed within the seven months prescribed by 15(8)(a) or not allowing the pendency of such a petition to toll the running of the Hobbs Act period even after the expiration of seven months. It would be surprising were there any evidence of such a legislative purpose, as nothing would be gained by precluding the ICC from considering petitions for reconsideration or refusing to toll the Hobbs Act period while it was doing so. Administrative reconsideration is a more expeditious and efficient means of achieving an adjustment of agency policy than is resort to the federal courts, and it is hard to see why a Congress concerned to hasten the process of implementing new railroad tariffs would have wanted to restrict the availability of this avenue of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">If it had been the intention of Congress absolutely to preclude administrative consideration of tariffs after the running of the seven month time period \u2014 the only legislative purpose consistent with the Commission\u2019s position \u2014 the Reorganization Act would hardly have provided explicitly for a complaint procedure whereby <em>any </em>\u201cinterested party\u201d may challenge effective tariffs as unlawful. The last sentence of \u00a7 15(8)(a) specifies that after the seven month period has elapsed a tariff may only thereafter be set aside \u201cif, upon complaint of an interested party, the Commission finds it to. be unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Parties who initially file protests qualify as \u201cinterested parties\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and as Congress thus obviously did not mean to limit them to agency consideration during the seven month period, it is difficult to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>why it would wish to foreclose consideration of timely petitions for reconsideration after this period. It is hardly \u201cstreamlining\u201d procedures to require litigating parties to open up a <em>new proceeding, </em>to obtain agency reconsideration of a decision which it has just announced. The manner in which the ICC acted on the new \u201ccomplaints\u201d in this proceeding clearly indicates that such action would have been handled with less complication on a petition for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">On its face the final proviso of 15(8)(a) appears only explicitly to establish a possibility of obtaining administrative review of a tariff after it has gone into effect. The Commission, however, both in this case and in its notice of changes in practices issued on January 28, 1977<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> imaginatively interprets this language to mean that petitions for reconsideration must be treated as complaints after the seven month period has expired. There is nothing in the statutory language or the legislative history that makes even an indirect allusion to transforming petitions for' reconsideration of agency decisions into new complaints. In fact, no reference appears in any context to petitions for reconsideration. We are thus unwilling to accede to an agency construction that would alter a long-standing practice in administrative review that is neither referred to in the statutory language nor alluded to in Congressional reports or debate. Section 15(8)(a) is silent concerning such petitions and we interpret this silence as supporting the interpretation that Congress did not intend to change the established practice with respect to such motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-10\">In light of the unusual interpretation by the Commission of the complaint proviso of 15(8)(a) and the inconsistency of this position with past administrative practice, we would require the ICC to produce a forceful argument in order to prevail. Significantly, neither ConRail nor the Commission is able to produce any concrete support for their position. Respondents go no further in defending their position than to cite the \u201cplain meaning of the statute\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and to attempt to distinguish various cases tending to support petitioner\u2019s contention that the Hobbs Act period is tolled pending resolution of a petition for reconsideration.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Intervenor ConRail makes much of the legislative history\u2019s unmistakable emphasis on streamlining the operations of the ICC,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> but this argument \u2014 as explained above \u2014 is of little force.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">The Commission seems to concede that \u201cpolicy arguments\u201d might not support its interpretation of the statute, but insists that \u201cpolicy considerations cannot be permitted to override the express statutory requirements of Section 15(8)(a).\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As we find the intent of these \u201cexpress statutory requirements\u201d to be quite different from those that the Commission perceives, we have no difficulty accommodating the pertinent \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d to the terms of 15(8)(a), nor in determining that this court does indeed have jurisdiction to review the ICC order in question as the petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>review of this order was filed in a timely manner within sixty days of the dismissal of the petition for reconsideration.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">III. THE VALIDITY OF THE COMMISSION\u2019S ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"A77K\">Petitioners\u2019 argument for the invalidity of the Commission\u2019s order is unusual in that it explicitly does not \u201creach the evidentiary issue.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> They do not deny that the Commission\u2019s findings were based on substantial evidence, rather petitioners maintain that in arriving at a conclusion from these findings, the ICC applied improper criteria.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Due to the nature of petitioners\u2019 approach, it is not necessary for us to look beyond the face of the standards invoked by the Commission. So viewed, we see no alternative but to affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Pennsylvania and the Utility Commission advance essentially two different arguments in seeking to invalidate the Commission\u2019s order. First, they allege that the balancing standard applied in this case differed from that applied in previous similar decisions, and that the ICC has failed to explain the discrepancy.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> More substantively, petitioners insist that the Commission could not make a finding that, on balance, there had been no \u201creasonable request\u201d for TOFC service at Sharon and Reading without first making a finding that the TOFC service at these ramps had been operating at a deficit.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Both these arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">Concerning the alleged discrepancy with past agency decisions, we agree that were there such a discrepancy, it would indeed have to be explained, or the Commission\u2019s decision could not be affirmed, <em>Greyhound Corp. v. I.C.C., </em>179 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 230, 551 F.2d 414, 416 (1977); <em>Greater Boston T.V. v. F.C.C., </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 396, 444 F.2d 841, 852 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). We do not, however, find that the Commission has made any significant departure in this case from its past approach in dealing with service terminations. In arriving at its conclusion, the Commission explicitly referred to the two previous decisions, <em>Livestock, South, Southwest, Central, and Western Territories, </em>346 I.C.C. 418 (1974) <em>(Livestock) </em>and <em>Icing Services, U.S. Railroads, </em>343 I.C.C. 67 (1973) <em>(Icing) </em>with which the petitioners claim its present determination is at variance.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Through a consideration of <em>Livestock </em>and <em>Icing, </em>the Commission determined that a balancing test was the appropriate standard to be applied in this case. In <em>Icing </em>and <em>Livestock, </em>although only the latter specifically alluded to a balancing test,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the Commission in both cases clearly proceeded by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>weighing the interests of the shippers against those of the carriers.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In the present proceeding, the Commission defined its inquiry as involving just such a balancing test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-5\">[The Commission\u2019s responsibility is] to seek a proper balance between the interests of the individual shippers and communities, on the one hand, and those of the carrier on the other. On the user side we will address reliance, past and present, on these services, the prospective need for service, proximity of comparable alternative service, and the cost and convenience of alternative service. As to the carrier interests involved, we will look to the financial and operational burden of continuing service, the likelihood that continuing service will be consistent with the carrier\u2019s prior holding out to perform the service, see <em>I.C.C. v. Oregon-Washington R. Co., </em>288 U.S. 14 [53 S.Ct. 266, 77 L.Ed. 588] (1932), and whether an order to continue service would be an undue or stifling interference with reasonable efforts to conduct an economically viable operation. In balancing these competing interests and shifting the opposing claims we should be able to identify reasonable requests for service which Conrail must, by law, respond to.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">There is no question that some of the factors involved in the balancing tests applied in <em>Livestock </em>and <em>Icing </em>differed from those applicable in this case. In fact, the Commission explicitly alluded to the fact that in <em>Livestock </em>and <em>Icing </em>it was confronted with the phasing out of admittedly obsolete services rather than, as here, with the reduction of inefficient stations of a service with considerable potential for growth.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> That somewhat different factual contexts were involved does not, however, mean that the Commission\u2019s approach was different in these three cases. The difference in the results reached by the Commission is the natural result of the different factual situations that were presented. It by no means indicates an abrogation of reasoned analysis for pure administrative caprice, <em>Greater Boston T.V. v. F.C.C., supra, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. at 396, 444 F.2d at 852, nor an alteration in the I.C.C.\u2019s basic policies and approach.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> This circuit \u201cemphatically requires that administrative agencies adhere to their own precedents or explain deviations from them,\u201d <em>Greyhound v. I.C.C., supra, </em>179 U.S.App.D.C. at 230, 551 F.2d at 416,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> but the numerous different factors specifically discussed by the Commission<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> in this case are more than sufficient to justify the difference in result between its decision here and in <em>Icing </em>and <em>Livestock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>The contention that petitioners advance most strenuously, however, is not that the Commission acted inconsistently with previous practice. Their chief point is rather that ConRail, which has the burden of justifying the cancellation of existing services,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> had not made out a prima facie case that Pennsylvania\u2019s request for continued TOFC service was \u201cunreasonable\u201d because it had not shown that the TOFC operations at Sharon or Reading ran at a deficit.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The petitioners insist that a showing of an operating deficit is necessary because ConRail must meet a higher standard, due to its obligations under \u00a7\u2022 1(4),<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> than merely demonstrating that the carrier\u2019s interest in terminating TOFC service outbalanced the public\u2019s interest in the continuance.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Asserting that the Final System Plan did not specifically suggest curtailment of piggyback service,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Pennsylvania argues that \u201ca reduction in cost and improvement in efficiency do not substitute for a showing of losses under the existing arrangement.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> It contends that as a prerequisite for cancellation, ConRail must show the unprofitability of TOFC operations at the specific ramp slated for termination<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and that without such a showing the application of the customary balancing test is inappropriate.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-13\">We find petitioners\u2019 position wholly untenable. In light of the clear emphasis of the Final System Plan on the importance of culling away <em>inefficient </em>routes from the Northeast rail system,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> there is simply no basis for asserting that even if a cancellation would contribute to the greater efficiency and economic viability of ConRail that this cancellation should nevertheless be prohibited if the depot terminated had not itself been losing money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-14\">Respondents do not seek to disavow Con-Rail\u2019s responsibility under 1(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act to provide service upon \u201creasonable request,\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and railroads under this section clearly owe the public \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to maintain the services they seek to terminate, <em>Livestock, supra, </em>446 I.C.C. at 435. The duty to provide services is not, however, absolute, e. <em>g., Livestock, supra, </em>446 I.C.C. at 435, and one should be extremely hesitant before establishing any absolute prerequisites for service cancellation. Whether or not the TOFC operation at Sharon or Reading was itself unprofitable,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> the circumstances which might in the past have justified providing this service to these stations were changed considerably in light of the creation and purposes of Con-Rail. Given the objective of Congress to allow ConRail to reorganize and restructure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>the Northeastern railroad lines,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> we would not be justified in limiting the company\u2019s ability reasonably to adjust its routes by insisting that every previously operating ramp at which service was to be terminated must be shown to be individually unprofitable. The loss test advocated by Pennsylvania would regard each station as a self-contained microcosm and blind itself to the broader public interest in increasing the efficiency of ConRail. It is an over narrow view of the decision making authority vested by Congress in the ConRail management <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and the I.C.C.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> to require that service termination cannot be considered unless actual loss is demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Petitioners cite no authority whatsoever for their view that a loss must be shown before termination of service can be approved,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> nor is there likely to be any precedent for this position. Where other factors suggest significant justification for terminating a service ramp, profitability alone should not preclude such a step. For example, in this case, although the Final System Plan anticipated a major increase in such \u201cintermodal rail traffic\u201d as TOFC and considered this increase as an important element on ConRail\u2019s hopes for success,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> both Sharon and Reading showed little chance for any meaningful increase in such traffic.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Furthermore, having to maintain the availability of these ramps might well have forced ConRail to continue inconvenient, or at least non-optimal, car-allocations and routings. The ICC expressly found that \u201calthough there is no reliable quantification of dollar savings that will be achieved by the ConRail proposal, there is ample evidence that ConRail\u2019s costs will be reduced and its TOFC operation made more efficient and more competitive with motor carrier service\u201d by the elimination of \u201ca number of the smaller TOFC ramp facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-12\">Given such findings, which petitioners do not deny are supported by substantial evidence, it would be highly unreasonable to insist that cancellation of an individual ramp was not possible unless specific financial loss was demonstrated. We do not, of course, assert that the profitability of a given ramp is irrelevant to the termination decision. We do, however, feel that in this ease \u2014 where exact profit and loss figures were difficult to determine<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> and there was clear Congressional emphasis on efficiently reorganizing the rail services in question \u2014 the Commission was fully justified in deciding that even if the stations involved were individually profitable to some extent, ConRail was justified in terminating them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-13\">Finding that the Commission\u2019s analysis in the instant case was in accord rather than at variance with its prior decisions, and that unprofitability need not be established before service at a given ConRail terminal may be cancelled, we affirm the Commission\u2019s order in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-14\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1261-12\">.
