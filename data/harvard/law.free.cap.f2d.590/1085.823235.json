In No. 77-1199, petitioners ask this court to set aside the Commission\u2019s conditional approval of the application of intervenor National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) for registration as a clearing agency pursuant to section 17A(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q-l(b). <em>In re The Application of Nat\u2019l Securities Clearing Corp. for Registration as a Clearing Agency </em>(hereinafter <em>Order I), </em>SEC Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13,163 (Jan. 13, 1977), 42 Fed.Reg. 3916 (1977). No. 77-1547 seeks reversal of a subsequent SEC order under section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78s(b), allowing NSCC to adopt two self-regulatory rules that are purportedly aimed at meeting the conditions set by the Commission in approving NSCC\u2019s registration as a clearing agency. <em>In re Nat\u2019l Securities Clearing Corp. </em>(hereinafter <em>Order II), </em>SEC Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13,456 (Apr. 21, 1977), 42 Fed.Reg. 21881 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\">In light of the significant overlap in the issues involved in the two petitions, we have decided to treat both in the same opinion. The order involved in No. 77-1199 is affirmed, except insofar as the Commission approved NSCC\u2019s use of \u201cgeographic price mutualization\u201d and its mode of allocating its facilities management contract. As to those issues the case is remanded to the SEC for further consideration. The order under review in No. 77-1547 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-15\">Much of the historical and statutory background for this suit is laid out in considerable detail in <em>Order I.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>From 1934 to the present, the Commission has exercised regulatory jurisdiction over transactions in major securities markets under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [hereinafter 1934 Act], 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a et <em>seq. </em>For most of that period, the SEC\u2019s attention was directed to the registration and oversight of the major classes of participants in those markets, and particularly to the prevention of certain manipulative and abusive practices. In carrying out these duties, the SEC took the securities markets essentially as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>found them, and attempted to establish and preserve a high degree of openness and fairness. <em>See generally </em>section 2 of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">In the 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s, however, more attention began to be paid to the possibility of changing the overall structure of the securities industry in order to make it more competitive, national, and efficient. Of particular relevance in this suit, the late 1960\u2019s saw the breakdown of the efficient functioning of brokers\u2019 \u201cback <em>offices\u201d </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>of the segment of the industry that effectuates trades after they are initially negotiated on an exchange or in the over-the-counter market.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of this \u201cpaperwork crisis,\u201d many purchasers never actually received their stock certificates nor sellers their money. Moreover, a goodly number of brokers, faced with liability for these incomplete transactions, went bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">In response to these \u201coperational breakdowns and economic distortions,\u201d Congress and the Commission undertook \u201cthe most searching reexamination of the competitive, statutory, and economic issues facing the securities markets, the securities industry, and . . . public investors, since the 1930\u2019s.\u201d House Comm, of Conference, Conference Report on ' the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, H.Rep.No.229, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 91 (1975), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1975, pp. 179, 322 [hereinafter referred to as Conf.Rep.]. The outgrowth of these investigations, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>was the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 (1975 Amendments), Pub.L. 94-29, 89 Stat. 141 (1975). With this legislation, the SEC\u2019s regulatory authority under the 1934 Act was expanded to enable it to effect major changes in the method of handling securities transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">Two such changes bear directly on the issues raised by the petitions. Most critically, in terms of these petitions, Congress recognized the need for a \u201c[njational system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions,\u201d the objective of which is to interconnect all American clearing agencies and place them under uniform rules, so that together they can provide prompt, safe, and efficient clearance facilities that take full advantage of modern data processing and communications technology. Section 17A(a)(l) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q-1(a)(1). The 1975 Amendments direct the Commission to \u201cfacilitate the establishment\u201d of this national system \u201cin accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>anee with\u201d the objective paraphrased above and \u201chaving due regard for\u201d several other concerns, including the \u201cmaintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 17A(a)(2), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q-l(a)(2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">To carry out this broad directive, Congress gave the SEC authority to register clearing agencies that meet certain specified criteria, including an ability to clear and settle securities transactions promptly and accurately and an absence of rules that impose \u201cany burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes\u201d of the 1934 Act. Without such registration, or an SEC exemption therefrom, it is illegal to operate such an agency. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 17A(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q-l(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-15\">That Congress conceived of the registration process as a means toward the end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>of a Commission-generated national clearing system is apparent from that process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather than mandating an adjudicatory procedure, as might be expected of an administrative mechanism aimed at conferring a government license, Congress made the process distinctly legislative in nature. After the application is filed, the agency must publish it and receive public comments thereon. The Commission may then grant registration, or institute proceedings to determine whether the application should be denied. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 19(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78s(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The quasi-legislative nature of registration decisions is further indicated by congressional references to the informal rulemaking provision in the Administrative Procedure Act and to the need to preserve the SEC\u2019s rulemaking authority in the clearing area,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and by the fact that judicial review of the SEC\u2019s decision, while controlled by the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d rule in its factual aspects, is otherwise left unspecified, and, therefore, is apparently limited to review for arbitrariness, caprice, and abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 25(a)(4), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(a)(4). <em>See generally Industrial Union Dep\u2019t v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number><em>Hodgson, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 499 F.2d 467 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">Congress further cemented the SEC\u2019s control over the shape of the clearing industry by requiring its approval of any new or modified rules adopted by a clearing agency. A similarly quasi-legislative procedure is established for the Commission\u2019s consideration of such rules, and its decision is judicially reviewable under the same provision governing review of its registration decisions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 19(b), 25(a)(4), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78s(b), 78y(a)(4).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">The second major accomplishment of the 1975 Amendments, as relevant here, is the granting of responsibility to the SEC to facilitate the establishment of a \u201c[njational market system for securities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11A, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78k-l. The goal of this system is to use modern communication and data processing equipment to link all securities markets nationwide, so that (i) information is equally available, and securities transactions may be completed equally cheaply and easily, anywhere in the nation, and (ii) \u201cfair competition\u201d may exist between all investors, brokers, dealers, and securities markets, no matter where they are located. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 HA(a)(l), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78k-l(a)(l). Once again the Commission is \u201cdirected\u201d to carry out this objective, and is given several types of authority toward that end, including the authority and responsibility to register and regulate \u201csecurities information processors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 HA(a)(2), (b), (c), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78k-l(a)(2), (b), (c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>The drafters of the 1975 Amendments assumed that the national market and national clearing systems would reinforce each other. <em>See </em>House Comm, on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Securities Reform Act of 1975, H.Rep.No.123, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 44, 51 (1975) [hereinafter referred to as H.Rep.]. Together, they would allow an investor anywhere in the United States to initiate and then complete a securities transaction with the aid solely of a local broker of his choice, dealing on a regional exchange and clearing through a regional agency also of his choosing, and having available throughout the process the most complete and up-to-date national information possible. <em>See </em>S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 7. <em>See also </em>Section 2, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78b. Moreover, as to both of the projected systems Congress self-consciously refused to determine \u201cthe merits of any particular system.\u201d S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 5, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1975, p. 184. Instead, it hoped that the impetus for both would come from the private sector and it provided the Commission with \u201cintentionally broad\u201d and \u201cclear power\u201d and \u201cdiscretion\u201d to shape the developing systems.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As to both systems, the Commission\u2019s primary directive from Congress was to be \u201cbold and effective\u201d and to act quickly. <em>Id. </em>at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"ASd\">Despite their interdependence and their common subjection to broad SEC authority, the national market and clearing systems were not perceived by Congress as identical pillars supporting the legislators\u2019 conception of a modernized approach to securities marketing. Most importantly, Congress\u2019 directives to the Commission with respect to the two systems vary slightly but significantly. Although in facilitating the establishment of both systems, the SEC is required to adhere to \u201cthe findings and to carry out the objectives set forth\u201d in the first subsection of each of the two relevant provisions, those findings and objectives are not entirely parallel. Sections HA(a), 17A(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78k-l(a), 78q-l(a); <em>see </em>notes 3 &amp; 9 supra. Thus, while both lists of objectives include the full exploitation of technological advances in communication and data processing equipment, efficiency, and the linkage of all relevant facilities nationally,.only the national market system objectives include the \u201cenhancement]\u201d of \u201cfair competition among brokers and . exchange markets . . . \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and only the national clearing system objectives include promptness and the development of uniform standards and procedures. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>\u00a7 llA(a)(l), 17A(a)(l), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78k-1(a)(1), 78q-l(a)(l).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">At the time of the passage of the 1975 Amendments, a separate clearing agency owned by each of the national and regional stock exchanges, and one owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) \u2014 which operates the over-the-counter (hereinafter \u201cOTC\u201d) market \u2014 performed all of the clearing services for transactions initiated on the exchange or in the market with which it was affiliated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Recently, petitioner Bradford National Clearing Corp. (BNCC) has made inroads into the clearing industry by competitively bidding on and winning two facilities management contracts under which it operates the clearing agencies owned by the Pacific Stock Exchange \u2014 one of the regional exchanges \u2014 and by NASD.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">In the past, the rigid division of the clearing market along the lines of the various trading markets virtually precluded any competition between clearing agencies. This division stemmed in large part from rules promulgated by each of the exchanges and by NASD that required brokers trading in that market to utilize only the clearing agency affiliated therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">Even before the 1975 Amendments passed, Congress, representatives of various exchanges, NASD, and independent associations of brokers and dealers had begun exploring the possibility of dramatically centralizing the clearing facilities in this country. The initial efforts in this discretion began in earnest in the fall of 1973 and contemplated the merger of several existing clearing agencies, including those owned by NYSE, AMEX, NASD, and most of the regional exchanges. The impetus for merger came from the expectation that by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>elimination of duplicative services and facilities the clearing industry would reduce costs and avoid a recurrence of the \u201cpaperwork crisis.\u201d The negotiators \u2014 particularly those representing brokers and dealers \u2014 apparently concentrated on finding a way to combine the three clearing agencies (NYSE\u2019s SCC, AMEX\u2019s ASECC, and NASD\u2019s NCC (hereinafter, \u201cthe New York clearing agencies\u201d) then operating virtually identical facilities located within a few blocks of each other in downtown New York.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">Actually, NYSE and AMEX had already pioneered the merger approach by jointly establishing the Securities Industry Automation Corp. (SIAC), and by contracting with SIAC to operate the two clearing corporations (SCC and ASECC) affiliated with the two parent exchanges. Nevertheless, the NYSE-AMEX \u201cmerger\u201d was not complete because SIAC continued to operate the two clearing corporations separately, and the exchanges continued to enforce their rules that tied each of their trading facilities to their clearing facilities. The 1973-74 merger negotiations seem to have contemplated an expansion of SIAC not only to take over the operation of all of the merged clearing agencies, but also to integrate them fully. Nonetheless, these negotiations proved unsuccessful and were discontinued in mid-1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">Soon after passage of the 1975 Amendments, NYSE, AMEX, NASD, and committees made up of their member-brokers renewed their efforts to negotiate a merger of the New York clearing agencies. These efforts came to fruition on July 15, 1975 when representatives of NYSE, AMEX, and NASD signed an agreement in principle to establish a jointly owned entity to which would be transferred the operations of the three New York clearing corporations. The agreement further provided for participant control of the new entity by way of a board of directors composed in the main of brokers and dealers,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> although its structure and rules would be designed to \u201cavoid any loss [of revenues] to the respective parent companies [NYSE, AMEX, NASD].\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-11\">In addition, the agreement in principle specified that SIAC would act as facilities manager and processor for the new entity. The parties included this last provision in their agreement despite the fact that during these latest negotiations BNCC offered to bid competitively against SIAC for the management-processing contract with the new entity. The parties to the agreement informed BNCC that its offer was premature, because negotiations were still going on, and they refused to honor BNCC\u2019s request for information on which to base its bid. In the negotiators\u2019 eyes, however, the time for BNCC\u2019s proposal apparently never matured, as they accepted SIAC as the manager-processor without further exploration of BNCC\u2019s counter proposal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>Final negotiations continued throughout 1975 and into 1976, leading in March of that year to the incorporation of the National Securities Clearing Corp. (NSCC), the entity into which the three New York clearing organizations were to be merged, and to the filing with the Commission of NSCC\u2019s application for registration as a clearing agency under sections 17A(b), 19(a)(1), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78q-l(b), 78s(a)(l). <em>See </em>notes 4-5 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">In summary, NSCC\u2019s application contemplated that the merger would be accomplished in two phases. During Phase I, projected to last approximately four months,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> NSCC, through SIAC,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> would operate the three merged New York clearing agencies as separate divisions, and the rules tying each of the two parent exchanges and NASD\u2019s over-the-counter market to one of those divisions would be retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">In Phase II, NSCC would convert the three New York clearing operations into a single system capable of providing its participants with all of the services that previously were provided by at least one of the New York clearing agencies. At this point, of course, the rules tying trading markets to clearing agencies, if still intact, <em>but see </em>note 25 <em>infra, </em>would become obsolete. Moreover, NSCC\u2019s plan called for its services to be made available not only to the current participants in the three New York clearing agencies but also to certain other (financially responsible and otherwise qualified) entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">Nonetheless, even during Phase II, NSCC proposed to restrict its \u201ccomparison\u201d services, <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra, </em>and thus the possibility of \u201cone-shot\u201d clearing and settlement, to (1) its participants located in New York who submit NYSE, AMEX, or OTC transactions for comparison, (2) its participants located outside of New York insofar as (a) they act through the regional network formerly operated by NCC, see note 15 <em>supra, </em>and (b) the transactions submitted for comparison occurred over the counter. Only later would it compare NYSE and AMEX transactions through its regional offices. Hence, its restrictions on comparison facilities even in Phase II assured that only NYSE, AMEX, and OTC traders in New York, OTC traders outside of New York, and eventually NYSE and AMEX traders outside of New York would have direct access to its one-shot comparison, clearing, and settlement services.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As in Phase I, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>nonparticipant in NSCC, even if trading NYSE, AMEX, or OTC securities and even if trading with an NSCC participant, would not have access to NSCC\u2019s comparison facilities. Nor, of course, would anyone \u2014 participant or nonparticipant in NSCC \u2014 have such access if the trade took place on a regional exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">In both phases, NSCC proposed to base its fees to participants on the total cost of providing its services. <em>See also </em>note 17 <em>supra. </em>The fees charged individual participants in a transaction, however, would not necessarily reflect the cost of that transaction. Instead, the merged entity would design its fee structure so that participants in New York and those outside of New York who utilized the regional network formerly operated by NCC, <em>see </em>note 15 <em>supra, </em>would pay the same clearing fees, even though, as was likely, at least in the early stages, the New York transactions cost less. This pricing scheme, \u201cgeographic price mutualization,\u201d was designed to allow greater \u201ccompetition\u201d between brokers in and outside of New York.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">As required by statute, the SEC made NSCC\u2019s proposal the subject of public notice, and received comments thereon from various parties.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition, the full Commission held informal hearings at which twenty-three organizations were represented. The SEC explicitly expanded the time and fora available for public comment \u2014 as well as the substantive scope thereof \u2014 beyond that required by the statute and traditionally afforded by the agency for registration applications. It did so in recognition of the \u201clikely . . . determinative impact\u201d this particular application would have on its accomplishment of its duty to facilitate the establishment of a national clearing system. <em>See </em>note 5 supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-26\">In general, NSCC registration was supported by brokers and dealers whether located in New York or elsewhere. Opposing registration were the regional exchanges and their affiliated clearing agencies, as well as petitioners and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department (hereinafter, the Justice Department). In November 1976, the Commission again issued a public notice soliciting comments \u2014 this time concerning its tentative decision to approve registration contingent upon NSCC\u2019s meeting four conditions designed to ameliorate the anticompetitive effects that NSCC\u2019s opponents feared. Although most commentators reiterated their earlier positions, the opposition to registration softened somewhat, and on January 13,1977, the Commission, in a lengthy order, granted NSCC registration with four conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-27\">Under Condition 1, NSCC must, before Phase II begins, establish \u201cfull interfaces\u201d or \u201cappropriate links\u201d with several specified clearing agencies \u2014 most particularly, those affiliated with the regional exchanges, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>eluding one operated by petitioner BNCC.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Other clearing agencies, including petitioners herein, have been offered the right to like interfaces as soon as they have the capability of offering minimally adequate clearing services.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> NSCC must offer these interfaces without any charges amounting to a fee for moving data through an interface. Consequently, all users of NSCC will help fund its establishment and maintenance of the interfaces.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">Condition 2 requires NSCC, before inaugurating Phase II, to provide at cost facilities to which other clearing agencies as well as its own branch offices may forward trade data for comparison. <em>See </em>note 21 <em>supra. </em>Together, Conditions 1 and 2 assure that any clearing agency in which a broker chooses to participate either (1) may clear and settle that broker\u2019s transaction after the parties to it have compared their trade themselves through NSCC, or (2) may itself submit the broker\u2019s data to NSCC for comparison, and then complete the clearing and settlement functions. In either case, the agency may represent any broker no matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>what clearing agency serves the broker or the other side of the transaction, what kind of security is traded, and what market or exchange is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Under Condition 3, NSCC must share with any competing clearing agency that comes forward the operation (and expenses) of the regional branches that NCC has operated in the past. <em>See </em>note 15 <em>supra. </em>By this mechanism, a regional clearing agency located in one city might find it easier to compete with NSCC in other cities as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">Finally, Condition 4 attempts to fill the void created by NSCC\u2019s refusal to compare OTC trades between nonparticipants and between a participant and a nonparticipant. Under this requirement, NSCC (1) must, without charge, share its computer program technology with any clearing agency that proposes to compare OTC transactions between that agency\u2019s participants, and it (2) must convince some other clearing agency, or must itself offer, to compare OTC transactions between participants in different clearing agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">The upshot of the four conditions plus NSCC\u2019s proposal is that, for purposes of comparing NYSE and AMEX transactions, NSCC is essentially a public utility that is afforded a monopoly but must offer its services to all qualified customers (its own participants or other clearing agencies) at cost. NSCC (or some other clearing agency, if one comes forward) must also serve this utility function for purposes of making OTC comparisons for participants in different clearing agencies. By contrast, as to the remaining clearing functions, NSCC is perceived by the Commission as in competition with all other agencies offering like services. Given NSCC\u2019s geographic monopoly in New York as well as its established set of regional branches, however, the Commission realized that NSCC would be \u201clikely to achieve a dominant position\u201d as to <em>all </em>\u201csecurities processing\u201d functions. Release No. 12,489, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 2. Consequently, in order partially to blunt that competitive edge, the SEC insisted that NSCC allow full interfaces with other qualified clearing agencies so that they can clear and settle any of their customers\u2019 transactions even if an NSCC participant is on the other side of the trade. It also encouraged other agencies to expand their portion of the market at NSCC\u2019s expense by requiring the latter to share with them its computer program technology and its branch office facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">Several months after securing registration, NSCC once again approached the Commission concerning actions it desired to take in the clearing field. In this case, NSCC desired to initiate two new rules that it portrayed as necessary to aid it in achieving, the conditions imposed on its registration by the SEC, and thus to move a couple of steps closer to Phase II. It sought the SEC\u2019s approval under section 19(bXl), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78s(b)(l). See note 8 <em>supra. </em>Here again, the Commission accepted public comments on the rules, and it made them the subject of a meeting before some of the Commissioners. Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 13,308, 13,318 (Feb. 28, 1977). On the same day as the meeting, the Commission issued an order approving the proposed rules with minor modifications. <em>Order II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-12\">The first rule, the \u201cBond Rule,\u201d allowed NSCC, during Phase I, to transfer the clearing function for bonds traded on AMEX from its ASECC to its SCC division. In other words, it made its division that formerly was the sole clearing facility for all securities traded on the NYSE the sole clearing facility, in addition, for all debt securities traded on the AMEX. It argued that a further consolidation of services and data processing facilities in the SCC division, which already operates the limited RIO interfaces, <em>see </em>note 26 <em>supra, </em>would enable it more easily to establish the .full interfaces with other clearing agencies as required by Condition 1 in <em>Order I.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>The second rule, the \u201cSpecial Representative Rule,\u201d is much more complicated, but essentially takes some additional tentative steps in the direction of fully interfacing NSCC with other clearing agencies and of streamlining its own- operations. In part, the rule expands the number of brokers and securities that are allowed access to the experimental interface program (RIO) begun in 1975 by SCC and several of the regional clearing agencies. <em>See </em>note 26 <em>supra. </em>As a result, more nonparticipants in NSCC can use the regional clearing agency in which they do participate to clear NYSE and AMEX transactions, and they can do so even if they do not participate in the same clearing agency as the brokers on the other side of their trades.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">After each of the two SEC orders at issue here was issued by the Commission, petitioners brought separate direct actions for review. This court set both petitions down for argument on the same day before the same panel, in light of their related nature. <em>Bradford Nat\u2019l Clearing Corp. v. SEC, </em>Nos. 77-1199, 77-1547 (D.C.Cir. Jan. 10, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">During the spring of this year \u2014 after the briefing of these cases \u2014 the SEC held a series of hearings and received public comments exploring the reasons for NSCC\u2019s delay in meeting the four conditions imposed by the Commission and thus in inaugurating Phase II of its operations. SEC Securities Exchange Release Act No. 14,648 (April 11, 1978); SEC Securities Exchange Act Release No. 14,411 (Jan. 25, 1978); <em>see </em>note 19 <em>supra. </em>Although in announcing these hearings, the Commission clearly broached the possibility of modification of <em>Order I </em>in light of the actual operation thereof, it made clear that it ordered the hearings not because it has lost confidence in its registration decision, but in order to carry out the expansive oversight role that it explicitly accepted for itself when it approved registration. <em>Order I, </em>at 111-12. Accordingly, we denied petitioners\u2019 pre-argument motion to remand these cases or hold them in abeyance pending the outcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>of the current proceedings before the Commission.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Petitioners\u2019 challenges in No. 77-1199 to <em>Order I </em>have a common theme \u2014 that NSCC\u2019s clearing operation, as approved by the SEC, has anticompetitive effects that frustrate the provisions and policies of the 1975 Amendments. Petitioners argue both that the SEC misinterpreted the statute by underemphasizing the importance of enhancing and maintaining a competitive clearing environment, and that its predictions about the competitive and anticompetitive impact of registering NSCC do not have substantial support in the record and are arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">Before examining petitioners\u2019 specific arguments, a word is necessary about the narrowness of our review function. An overview of the administrative authority and action in this case reveals a broad statutory directive and informal administrative proceedings leading to predictive judgments about a variety of relevant factors, such as rapidity of development, geographically national access, and centralization of planning, as well as competition. In the interpretation of that statutory directive, the courts share an important responsibility and expertise with the agency. <em>SEC v. Sloan, </em>436 U.S. 103, 98 S.Ct. 1702, 1712, 56 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978), but the latter\u2019s interpretation is worthy of significant deference insofar as it is contemporaneous with passage of the statute being interpreted, <em>Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, </em>288 U.S. 294, 315, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933), and insofar as its course of consideration envinces \u201cspecific attention\u201d to that statute, <em>Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 275, 98 S.Ct. 566, 570 n.5, 54 L.Ed.2d 538 (1978). <em>See United States v. NASD, </em>422 U.S. 694, 719, 95 S.Ct. 2427, 45 L.Ed.2d 486 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">This deference increases and becomes less qualified when courts are reviewing the exercise of administrative discretion and especially, when, as here, the agency\u2019s decision partakes primarily of \u201cprediction[s] based upon pure legislative judgment.\u201d <em>Industrial Union, supra, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. at 338, 499 F.2d at 474; <em>accord, FCC v. National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, </em>436 U.S. 775, 98 S.Ct. 2096, 2122, 56 L.Ed.2d 697 (1978); <em>Braniff Airways, Inc. v. CAB, </em>126 U.S.App.D.C. 399, 409, 379 F.2d 453, 463 (1967). Even when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>faced with the perplexing combination of informal agency action and \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review that Congress occasionally includes in specific pieces of delegative legislation, including the 1975 Amendments, <em>see generally Industrial Union, supra, </em>the future-oriented \u201cfacts\u201d involved as well as the undisciplined nature of the informal rulemaking record from whence those \u201cfacts\u201d are derived impose obvious limitations and restrictions upon the intensity of judicial scrutiny.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">In delegating informal decisionmaking to an administrative agency, Congress generally expects the agency to draw heavily upon its expertise. Accordingly, in reviewing the resulting decisions while not sharing that expertise courts typically accord agency conclusions considerable respect. <em>FPC v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., </em>365 U.S. 1, 29, 81 S.Ct. 435, 5 L.Ed.2d 377 (1961); <em>General Tel. Co. v. United States, </em>449 F.2d 846, 861 (5th Cir. 1971). This general congressional expectation is particularly manifest in the national market and national clearing provisions of the 1975 Amendments. First, the drafters of these provisions explicitly endeavored to leave the Commission substantial flexibility of choice in \u201cbold[ly] and effectively]\u201d accomplishing the herculean task of rapidly restructuring an entire industry. <em>See </em>notes 3-4 &amp; 10 <em>supra </em>and accompanying texts. In addition, to the extent that they guided the Commission, it was by way of a list of relevant factors \u2014 each of which generally calls for a difficult \u201cdetermination[ ] ... of a judgmental or predictive nature,\u201d and none of which predominates. <em>FCC v. National Citizens Comm., supra, </em>98 S.Ct. at 2121. Hence, a wide range of conclusions will inevitably lie within the range of reasonable nonarbitrary choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">It also bears remembering that, despite the undoubted relevance of competitive concerns to the disposition of these petitions, these are not cases brought initially in the courts under the antitrust laws, but are administrative review petitions brought under the 1975 Amendments to the 1934 Act. Thus, the tendency in antitrust adjudication to view business relationships in the black and white terms of legality or illegality, based solely on their competitive or anticompetitive impact, has no place here.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Stated another way, we see no reason generally to treat competitive concerns as any more important or any less subject to judicial deference to administrative choices, than any other factor that is relevant to the legality of administrative action. <em>See, e. g., California Gas Producers Ass\u2019n v. FPC, </em>421 F.2d 422, 429 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>California v. FPC, </em>111 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 231-32, 296 F.2d 348, 353-54 (1961), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>369 U.S. 482, 82 S.Ct. 901, 8 L.Ed.2d 54 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-11\">As noted, enhancing competition within the securities industry, while not an \u201cobjective\u201d of the 1975 Amendments with respect to the establishment of a national clearing system, is a factor to be considered. Section 17A(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q-l(a); <em>see </em>notes 3 &amp; 11 <em>supra </em>and accompanying texts. In addition, no clearing agency may be registered, if its rules \u201cimpose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes\u201d of the securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>ties laws. Sections 17A(b)(3)(I), 78q-l(b)(3)(I); <em>see </em>note 4 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Petitioners argue that the statute charges the SEC with enforcing the antitrust laws or at least , with avoiding any <em>unnecessary </em>anticompetitive consequences. Their position thus approaches that taken by the Justice Department in the proceedings below \u2014 that the Commission must achieve its objectives in the least anticompetitive manner possible. The statute, however; does not support such an interpretation. At most, it only requires the Commission to decide that any anticompetitive effects of its actions are \u201cnecessary <em>or appropriate </em>\u201d to the achievement of its objectives. In fact, Congress \u2014 responding to importunities by the Justice Department \u2014 explicitly refused to include a \u201cleast anticompetitive\u201d requirement in the 1975 legislation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Competition was simply not to \u201cbecome paramount to the great purposes of the [1934] Act. . . . \u201d S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">Instead, to the extent that the legislative history provides any guidance to the Commission in taking competitive concerns into consideration in its deliberations on the national clearing system,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> it merely requires the SEC to \u201cbalance\u201d those concerns against all others that are relevant under the statute. Accordingly, only if some action\u2019s anticompetitive impact outweighs in importance the product of the 1975 Amendments\u2019 other objectives and the likelihood that the action will achieve those objectives, is the Commission prohibited from taking that action.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>Accordingly, an independent review of the statute and legislative history bears out the Commission\u2019s view that it need do no more than \u201cbalance the maintenance of fair competition and a number of other equally important express purposes of the Act.\u201d <em>Order I, </em>at 21; <em>accord, id. </em>at 53-54. There is consequently no need in this case to resort to the rule of deference that would otherwise apply to the SEC\u2019s contemporaneous and reasoned statutory interpretation. <em>See id. </em>at 20-21, 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">Petitioners\u2019 only other interpretive challenge to <em>Order I </em>stems from the Commission\u2019s alleged unwillingness to consider \u201cregulatory costs,\u201d <em>see </em>S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 14, as one of the factors relevant to its decisions. Were their characterization correct, petitioners would have a valid claim, for high enforcement costs mean reduced effectiveness in achieving the statute\u2019s other objectives and thus could result in the anticompetitive harms outweighing the benefits. Nonetheless, it is apparent to us that the Commission, not only-in <em>Order I </em>itself, but also in the public notices preceding it, clearly acknowledged the relevance to its registration decision of the cost to it of overseeing NSCC\u2019s actions in the future. <em>See Order I, </em>111-15; Release No. 12,489, <em>supra </em>not\u00e9 5, at 16. In. large part, it accounted for those costs by making NSCC\u2019s registration contingent on its avoiding delay or other untoward activities that could increase enforcement costs and by repeatedly warning NSCC that such activities could result in modification or even revocation of its registration. <em>See </em>note 29 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">We are consequently left with the question of whether, having properly identified the relevant statutory considerations, the Commission appropriately assessed their importance herein and balanced the results, and whether, in particular, the purely factual premises for its conclusions are supported in the record, and its legislative and predictive premises as well as the conclusions ultimately drawn are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">Petitioners make two basic claims to the effect that the SEC\u2019s decision lacks factual support and is irrational. First, they claim that the anticompetitive impact of NSCC\u2019s operation outweighs the beneficial effects thereof, and accordingly that registration should have been denied in favor of SEC efforts to put into operation an alternative approach proposed by petitioners and endorsed by the Justice Department. Second, they claim that even if conditional registration might be appropriate, the Commission at least should weed out two particularly anticompetitive aspects of NSCC\u2019s plan; \u201cgeographic price mutualization,\u201d and the awarding of NSCC\u2019s facilities management contract to SIAC without competitive bidding. <em>See </em>notes 18 &amp; 22 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">The Commission approved'NSCC\u2019s registration with the recognition that doing so would largely determine the shape of the national clearing system. <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>It assumed, however \u2014 and petitioners apparently do not disagree \u2014 that, at the time, only two established plans existed that would allow such a system to be initiated with anything approaching'the degree of dispatch desired by Congress. <em>Order I, </em>at 66,110. The first plan, of course, is NSCC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>while the second, referred to as Model II, was developed by petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Model II contemplated that NASD\u2019s clearing agency NCC (operated under contract by petitioner BNCC) would remain independent of the other, merged New York clearing agencies (SCC and ASECC), and that, bolstered by its regional branch offices, it would attempt to compete therewith. Under this approach, petitioners argued, two national clearing agencies would exist, and would compete with each other (and with the regional clearing agencies) for clearing business both within and without New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">Although based on their former volumes of trade, NCC would be likely to begin competing with a much smaller market share (12%) than the SCC-ASECC group (73%), see note 13 <em>supra, </em>petitioners nonetheless contend that, under Model II, NCC would confront the other New York clearing operation with a geographically and quantitatively closer competitor than would any of the regional agencies that are NSCC\u2019s chief competition under its plan. The result, it is argued, would be a greater likelihood that competition would have the congressionally desired effect of keeping clearing prices down, and, in turn, would relieve the SEC of much of the regulatory burden of assuring that a giant and peerless clearing agency such as NSCC does not attain and exploit a monopoly position. Put in the statutory terms developed earlier, petitioners claim that Model II would not only reduce the anticompetitive effects below those characteristic of NSCC\u2019s plan, but would increase the effectiveness of the Commission and industry efforts to achieve the other goals of the Act because it would reduce regulatory costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">Whether or not petitioners\u2019 analysis of the comparative costs and benefits of NSCC\u2019s plan and Model II is correct,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> however, it cannot by itself convince us to overturn <em>Order I. </em>That is to say, even if the SEC could have struck a <em>better </em>balance in favor of achieving the Act\u2019s goals and against anticompetitive impacts, its decision passes statutory muster so long as the former achievements \u2014 by whatever margin\u2014 outweigh the latter impacts. Stated differently, our task is not to decide whether the Commission made the \u201cright\u201d (or least anti-competitive) decision \u2014 or the one that this court might have made were it charged with doing so \u2014 but rather whether the Commission\u2019s decision falls within- the boundaries of its broad authority. We think that, in its basic outlines, <em>Order I </em>meets this test.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>On the benefits side of the scale, the SEC made several predictions about NSCC operations. As undisputed matters, the Commission noted that those operations seem capable of providing \u201ca first . . . important step\u201d toward achievement of a national clearing system \u2014 itself a \u201cprior or at least contemporaneous\u201d prerequisite to the \u201cearly achievement of a national market system.\u201d <em>Order I, supra, </em>at 60, 55. The past experience of the three merging clearing agencies and their more recently developed \u201cproficiency\u201d in molding communications and data processing equipment to the needs of the industry assured that the new entity would provide \u201cprompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions\u201d at current and expanding trade volumes. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 62, 63. Particularly ASECC and SCC, with their already operative continuous netting system, could provide the backbone of a national clearing system. <em>Id. </em>at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">In addition to technical proficiency and one-step <em>(i. e., </em>efficient) processing, the Commission cited several other benefits of NSCC registration that we find adequately supported. The Commission, for example, pointed to cost savings incident to the combination of the three New York clearing agencies into one and the consequent \u201cdiscontinuation of unnecessary operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65. Although the SEC is unconvinced at this stage that the clearing business nationally \u201cis a natural monopoly,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 109 &amp; n.198, its data indicate that higher trade volumes, as will occur from consolidation of the formerly separate clearing operations, will reduce costs \u2014 perhaps by as much as $17.4 million annually.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">Another crucial reason for the SEC\u2019s registration decision was NSCC\u2019s technological and financial \u201ccapacity to make . substantial contributions to the establishment of a national system. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. Especially by utilizing and expanding NCC\u2019s system of branch offices and SCC-ASECC\u2019s Regional Interface Operation, <em>see </em>notes 21 &amp; 26 <em>supra, </em>the Commission felt that NSCC could quickly establish a stable framework for a national clearing system. <em>Id. </em>at 68-71, 73-74. Most important, the NSC plan would allow brokers formerly forced to deal with several clearing agencies to deal with one, and to have only one daily settling position in each NYSE, AMEX, or OTC security, and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>daily money settlement. Moreover, in response to petitioners\u2019 warning that NSCC might have important incentives <em>not </em>to take advantage of its capacity to foster a national clearing system \u2014 or at least not to do so in cooperation with the regional clearing agencies and their participants \u2014 the Commission adopted Conditions 1 and 2. These requirements are designed to make full and free clearing interfaces with other agencies, and the national availability of NSCC comparison facilities (either through its own regional offices or through arrangements with other clearing agencies), prerequisites to NSCC\u2019s entering Phase II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">As a final important benefit of the NSCC plan, the Commission noted that it would significantly improve competition between brokers and dealers, particularly between those located inside and outside of New York. <em>Id. </em>at 76-79. This improvement primarily would follow from the \u201cexpansion and upgrading of the existing NCC branch network\u201d and also from the interface and comparison requirements in Condition 1 and 2 \u2014 all of which would enhance the range and quality (and reduce the cost.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>) of services that brokers outside of New York could offer their customers. <em>Id. </em>at 76-77. The SEC placed considerable emphasis on this benefit, both because of the acute congressional interest in aiding regional brokers and their customers, <em>see </em>S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 7; H.Rep., <em>supra, </em>at 90, and because broker-dealer competition has much greater impact on the overall level and cost of securities services available to the public than does competition between clearing agencies. <em>Order I, </em>at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">Ranged against these benefits is the admitted monopolistic potential of NSCC\u2019s merger of the three New York clearing agencies. Simply by its likely attractiveness, at least initially, to the former participants in SCC,. ASECC, and NCC (representing about 85% of the market), NSCC will begin operating its integrated services with a huge market share. Moreover, its continued ability to perform comparison on all NYSE and AMEX traded securities, its exclusive geographical proximity to the nation\u2019s securities center, its control of the most modern and sophisticated clearing technology, and its operation of the only set of integrated regional clearing offices suggest that NSCC may well be able to hold on to its initial participants centered in New York and to secure new participants elsewhere. Not only might this economic power undermine the viability of the regional clearing agencies, but it could deny potential entrants in the market any access to a sufficiently large clientele'.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">The evils generated by unregulated aggregation of economic power need not be reiterated here. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Grinnell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966); <em>United States v. Von\u2019s Grocery Co., </em>384 U.S. 270, 86 S.Ct. 1478, 16 L.Ed.2d 555 (1966); <em>United States v. First Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>376 U.S. 665, 84 S.Ct. 1033, 12 L.Ed.2d 1 (1964); <em>United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, </em>148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945), <em>But cf. </em>note 31 <em>supra. </em>As required by Congress, the SEC paid close attention to these evils and to NSCC\u2019s susceptibility thereto. Rather than downplaying these problems,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>sion has taken one step and promised to take another that together, it believes, will alleviate the problems sufficiently so that they do not outweigh the benefits of registration. <em>Order I, </em>at 79-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">First, the SEC imposed four conditions aimed at assuring that (1) brokers everywhere can obtain full and inexpensive clearing services, including comparison of NYSE and AMEX trades, even if they participate in a clearing agency other than NSCC (Conditions 1, 2, and 3), (2) any clearing agency that now has, or later develops, a capacity for continuous netting may, without charge, interface with NSCC (Condition l),<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and (3)' NSCC shares its network of branch offices with any current or new competitors (Conditions 2 and 4). <em>Order I, </em>at 87-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Second, the Commission promised in the future, and particularly when NSCC declares itself ready to enter Phase II, to monitor the actual anticompetitive effects of NSCC operations to make sure that its four conditions are being effectuated and will have their desired impact, and, generally, to assure that registration has occasioned no \u201cunnecessary or inappropriate burdens on competition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. If necessary, the Commission will even consider \u201crevoking NSCC\u2019s registration,\u201d \u201c[ujndoing the . . combination\u201d already effected during Phase I, and adopting some plan similar to Model II.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-12\">Thus, the Commission assumed that by taking these two steps it could keep the anticompetitive debits to a minimum, while incurring only moderate regulatory costs, and that those debits and costs would not overcome the substantial benefits of registration. On the assumption that the SEC will indeed take the second step, if necessary, <em>see </em>note 29 <em>supra, </em>we find these two steps sufficient to justify the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the benefits of registering NSCC outweigh the anticompetitive and regulatory costs thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-13\">In sum, we find as much support in the record and in logic as may be expected in a proceeding of this kind for the SEC\u2019s predictions about the future benefits and anticompetitive impacts of registering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>NSCC. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s weighing of those predictive assessments is not irrational. Essentially, the Commission felt that the establishment of a national clearing framework that was virtually certain to be dependable, stable, efficient \u2014 and more rapidly achievable than any other alternative \u2014 justified it in risking considerable amounts of its regulatory time and effort in restraining NSCC\u2019s monopolistic tendencies. <em>See Order I, </em>at 79-80, 83-84. In the mind of the Commission, this approach made more sense than establishing an admittedly more competitive and eventually less regulated system that for years to come would be still developing, precarious, and thus less certain to provide safe, efficient, and inexpensive services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">We also find reasonable the SEC\u2019s expectation that its vigilance can forestall any irreparable anticompetitive harms from accompanying NSCC\u2019s registration. The four conditions generally seem designed to do just that, and to the extent they are unsuccessful, the Commission has committed itself to reevaluating the situation looking toward further modifications, conditions, or even a withdrawal of registration in favor of a more competitive approach. <em>See </em>note 29 <em>supra. </em>Having no cause at this time to doubt the Commission\u2019s willingness and ability to honor this commitment, we generally uphold the registration decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">Petitioners next contend that, even if the Commission was within its discretion in finding that the benefits of registering NSCC generally outweigh the anticompetitive impact thereof, as to two aspects of NSCC\u2019s plan it miscalculated those benefits and impacts. In both cases, petitioners argue, the SEC should have conditioned registration on NSCC\u2019s deletion of the offending aspects of its plan. We do not agree with petitioners that the Commission\u2019s asserted errors in assessing and balancing the benefits and impacts of these two parts of NSCC\u2019s plan are grievous enough on their face to invalidate registration absent imposition of the conditions requested by petitioners. Nonetheless, we do find insufficient the Commission\u2019s explanation of its conclusions in these two limited instances, and we accordingly remand both for further study and explication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-11\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-12\">The Commission originally approved NSCC\u2019s adoption of \u201cgeographic price mutualization\u201d (GPM), <em>see </em>note 22 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text, because it felt that that GPM would allow NSCC participants outside of New York to obtain the same services <em>for the same price </em>as participants in New York. <em>Order I, </em>at 76-77, 86. It was believed that this price equalization would allow regional brokers better to \u201ccompete\u201d with those in New York. Although it is unclear whether GPM actually fosters competition, in the strict sense, or whether it simply subsidizes regional brokers at the expense of those in New York, it would at least seem capable of accomplishing the congressional goal of improving the status of the former brokers vis-a-vis the latter. <em>See </em>note 22 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-13\">Not only petitioners, but also the Justice Department and the regional clearing agencies have vigorously opposed GPM, both before and since the issuance of <em>Order I, </em>leading the Commission to specify the pricing mechanism as one subject of its recent hearings on NSCC\u2019s progress from Phase I to Phase II. <em>See </em>Release No. 14,411, <em>supra </em>; Comments of the United States Department of Justice, <em>supra </em>note 36, at 27-29; note 29 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. The primary objections to GPM are, first, that it is anticompetitive because it forces New York brokers to pay more for clearing than they would if free competitive forces were allowed to force the price down to the level of cost.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In addition, GPM is seen by its opponents as allowing NSCC essentially to engage in predatory <em>(i. e., </em>unduly <em>low) </em>pricing in the branch offices so that it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>underprice and eventually put out of business its regional competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">The Commission has responded to these arguments by noting that without GPM, NSCC\u2019s regional offices may not attract enough customers to justify their expansion. <em>Order I, </em>at 86. And expansion of those offices is considered crucial to the establishment of a national clearing system. The Commission further claims that by providing NSCC\u2019s regional competitors with the right \u201cto participate in the branch network by paying a proportionate share of the branches\u2019 operating overhead,\u201d those regional agencies can \u201ccompete with NSCC in offering services to brokers . . . outside New York City.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87 (footnotes omitted) (discussing Condition 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">This justification for GPM appears to contradict other parts of the Commission\u2019s analysis of NSCC\u2019s plan. Most importantly, the SEC represents that there is no evidence indicating that, nationally, clearing is a natural monopoly. <em>Id. </em>at 109 &amp; n.198. Consequently, it believes that competition between NSCC and the regional exchanges is achievable, and worthy of its encouragement by way of Conditions 1-4. <em>Id. </em>at 77. In fact, the Commission relied in part on this competition in arguing that the overall anticompetitive effects of NSCC\u2019s plan were not so large as to outweigh its benefits. Yet, the rationale behind GPM appears to be that regional competition between NSCC\u2019s branches and the local exchanges will not push regional prices down enough to make them competitive with New York prices, and, therefore, that NSCC, in order to aid its participant-regional brokers and to aid itself in obtaining those brokers\u2019 participation, must be permitted to set regional prices below cost, and, presumably, to price its competitors out of the market.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">Nor does Condition 3 appear to ameliorate the tension between the Commission\u2019s expressed belief in regional competition, on the one hand, and its willingness, on the other, to allow NSCC to thwart that competition through below-cost pricing. A clearing agency other than NSCC that chose to join in the operation of a branch office would still have to charge its participants enough so that it could pay its \u201cproportionate share of the branches\u2019 operating overhead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. By contrast, NSCC would <em>not </em>have to charge its regional participants enough to cover <em>its </em>share of that overhead because it can recover part of those expenses from the mutualized <em>(i. e., </em>artificially high) price it charges its New York participants. Consequently, GPM still appears to afford regional brokers a great incentive to affiliate with NSCC, and correspondingly \u00e1ppears to dim the supposedly bright prospects for NSCC\u2019s regional competitors (whether or not they participate in NSCC\u2019s branch operations).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that <em>Order I </em>has apparently relied on two benefits of NSCC registration that cannot coexist: <em>either </em>NSCC\u2019s plan and the four conditions will allow and even foster regional competition among clearing agencies, <em>or, </em>through GPM, it will provide local brokers who participate in NSCC with a subsidy that allows them to operate at the same levels of cost and service as New York brokers. We have accordingly resolved to remand the GPM issue to the Commission for a better explanation, if one exists, of how GPM may be utilized without thwarting regional competition. Failing that, the Commission must either condition registra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>tion on NSCC\u2019s abandonment of GPM, or at least convincingly conclude that the loss of regional competition engendered by GPM will not upset the favorable balance of benefits and anticompetitive effects that it originally calculated on the assumption that such competition would exist.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">In its application for registration, NSCC, a subsidiary of NYSE and AMEX as well as NASD, listed SIAC, itself a subsidiary of the two national exchanges, as its facilities manager and data processor. Earlier, NSCC\u2019s parent organizations had rejected petitioner BNCC\u2019s offer to bid against SIAC for that privilege. Petitioners, with the support of the Justice Department, argued before the Commission that NSCC should be forced to put the management-processing contract up for competitive bids. <em>See </em>note 18 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">The Commission chose not to force NSCC to open up the subject contract for competitive bidding \u2014 a decision we do not find inherently unsupportable. The issue is remanded, however, because of the SEC\u2019s reasoning for this particular decision \u2014 that, so long as SIAC\u2019s ability to assure safe, accurate, and efficient clearing services is not in doubt, NSCC\u2019s choice of that facilities manager is not of statutory concern and is a matter for the exercise of NSCC\u2019s \u201cbusiness judgment.\u201d <em>Order I, </em>at 104. Or, as the Commission framed the argument in its brief, the statute regulates clearing agencies, \u201cnot data processors.\u201d Brief of Respondent in No. 77-1199, at 60. The result of such an analysis, of course, is to shield NSCC\u2019s choice of manager-processor from the 1975 Amendments\u2019 concern for competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">The simple answer to the Commission\u2019s argument in this respect is found several pages earlier in <em>Order I </em>itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-9\">In legal structure the clearance and settlement operations of the AMEX, NASD and NYSE are separate wholly-owned subsidiaries,. ASECC, NCC and SCC; each clearing corporation is, however, <em>essentially a shell corporation </em>with relatively limited assets and a small number of administrative employees. The extensive data processing and clerical operations required to accomplish clearance settlement are housed in or furnished by <em>other corporate entities </em>[i. e., SIAC, which operates SCC and ASECC, and BNCC, which operates NCC].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\"><em>Order I, </em>at 40-41. Without the ability to scrutinize NSCC\u2019s choice of manager-processor in the full light of the Act\u2019s objectives and requirements, therefore, the Commission\u2019s \u201cbroad powers [to act in a] bold and effective manner to facilitate the rapid development of a nationwide system for processing securities transactions,\u201d <em>Order I, </em>at 18, <em>quoting </em>S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 55, would amount to nothing more than the ability to regulate \u201cshell corporation[s]\u201d while leaving the \u201cextensive\u201d operations that actually \u201caccomplish clearance\u201d beyond its reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">Actually, the SEC did not totally succumb to the argument that the manager-processor contract is insulated from the requirements of the statute. It conceded that it has the power to condition approval of NSCC\u2019s choice of manager-processor on proof that \u201cthe processor will provide the safeguards and efficiencies required by the Act. ...\u201d <em>Order I, </em>at 105. Yet, the Commission offered no reason, and we can think of none, that explains why NSCC\u2019s manager-processor decision must further two objectives of the Act (safety and efficiency) but not a third objective (competition). It thus is not enough for the SEC to note that \u201c[t]he Act does not compel . . . competitive bidding,\u201d and then thrice to incant \u201cbusiness judgment.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 104-05. The Act does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>not in terms compel NSCC to share its offices and computer programs with competitors or to establish interfaces, nor does it explicitly withdraw such issues from the realm of \u201cbusiness judgment.\u201d And yet in these areas, the Commission, by way of its four conditions, has assumed that there are no barriers to its exercise of regulatory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">The proper test, it seems to us, is whether any exercise of \u201cbusiness judgment\u201d by a clearing agency may affect the realization of the national clearing system envisioned by Congress \u2014 i. e., one that is safe, efficient, <em>and </em>competitive. By the Commission\u2019s own admission, a facilities manager and data processor <em>is, </em>in substance, the clearing agency. Consequently, if one such processor (SIAC) is offered an opportunity by a clearing agency \u201cshell\u201d that is not available to any other processor (whether it be BNCC or one controlled by the regional clearing agencies), the impact on competition and new entry in the industry \u2014 and thus the nexus to statutory authority \u2014 is manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\"><em>Order I </em>does intimate that the SIAC contract serves some of the extra-competitive objectives of the Act such as rapidity of development, safety, efficiency, and encouragement of interclearing agency cooperation (especially on the part of SCCASECC). <em>Order I, </em>at 104, 105-6. We do not question the relevance of these concerns, but only note that, in addition to them, \u201cthe Commission [must] focus with particularity on the competitive implications\u201d of this part of SIAC\u2019s application. S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 14. Accordingly, on remand the SEC should consider whether the SIAC contract has anticompetitive impacts,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and, if so, whether they are justifiable in terms of the overall balance of benefits and anticompetitive impacts that it otherwise has calculated in a salutary manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-12\">In No. 77-1547, petitioners, albeit in the guise of challenging the two rather technical rule changes initiated by NSCC and approved by the Commission in <em>Order II, </em>repeat many of the arguments raised in No. 77-1199. To the extent that we have dealt with those arguments above, we will not treat them here.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>Petitioners do make several fresh arguments that again break down into two basic contentions: first, that the Commission failed to identify the anticompetitive effects of the rule changes and to balance them against the benefits thereof,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and, second, that <em>Order I </em>enjoins the Commission from \u201cpiecemeal\u201d approval of any rule changes by NSCC that expand its services, and instead requires the Commission to disapprove all such changes until NSCC has satisfied the four conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">It is perhaps true that the Commission expended no excess energy in explaining its decision in <em>Order II. </em>That explanation devotes only two paragraphs to petitioners\u2019 complaints about the anticompetitive impact of the rule changes. <em>Order II, supra </em>at 3-4. Nonetheless, in light of the references therein to <em>Order I, </em>which does address at length the general competitive effects and benefits of NSCC\u2019s registration, and in light of the discussion by the Commissioners and SEC staff just preceding the issuance of <em>Order II </em>which help to explain that order, we are satisfied that the Commission undertook the minimal steps necessary to assure that the rule changes do not impose unnecessary or inappropriate burdens on competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">Primary attention, of course, must be focused on <em>Order II, </em>for it is the subject of our review. That order finds that both the Bond Rule and the Special Representative Rule are essentially designed to put Condition 1, the free interface condition, into operation. Together, the rules increase the number of securities (by adding AMEX bonds) and brokers (by adding certain brokers participating in clearing agencies interfaced with SCC through RIO, <em>see </em>note 26 supra) qualified to take part in RIO. Since NSCC plans to use RIO as the foundation for the more complete interface system contemplated by Condition 1, <em>see </em>note 26 <em>supra, </em>which in turn is designed to ameliorate the anticompetitive impacts of NSCC\u2019s registration, the Commission concluded that the rule changes actually \u201callow broker-dealers a wider choice in clearance and settlement\u201d than before, and, accordingly, <em>enhance </em>competition.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-12\">Given, in addition, the extensive discussion in <em>Order I </em>of the proeompetitive effects of expanded interfaces between NSCC and its competitors, <em>Order I, </em>at 69-73, and given the conclusion of SEC staff members expressed to the Commission on the eve of its issuance of <em>Order II </em>that these beneficial effects would accompany the rule changes and would overcome any anticompetitive fallout therefrom,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> we cannot say that the Commission did not undertake the appropriate balance of the statutory concerns before approving the changes. Accordingly, we hold that the Commission\u2019s course of approval of the changes comported with the 1975 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-14\">As petitioners correctly point out, even if <em>Order II </em>is consistent with the 1975 Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>ments, it may be found arbitrary and capricious if it is inconsistent with expectations created by <em>Order I </em>\u2014at least if the departure from those expectations is not explained in a rational fashion. <em>International Union v. NLRB, </em>148 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 317, 459 F.2d 1329, 1341 (1972). In this context, <em>Order I </em>states that during Phase I \u201c[e]ach division [of NSCC, <em>i. e., </em>SCC, ASECC, and NCC] will operate under <em>substantially </em>the same rules, procedures and agreements used by the division\u2019s predecessors,\u201d at least \u201cuntil each of the clearing corporations which must establish links with NSCC in order to [implement Condition 1] has, in the judgment of the Commission . . had an adequate opportunity [to do so].\u201d <em>Order I, </em>at 43, 69-70 (emphasis added). The Commission concedes that Condition 1 was not satisfied at the time it issued <em>Order II </em>\u2022 \u2014 and, in fact, has not yet been implemented. <em>See </em>note 19 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">The question, then, is whether <em>Order I </em>prevents NSCC from changing <em>any </em>one of its division\u2019s rules (at least insofar as those changes improve NSCC\u2019s position) until it is ready to make <em>all </em>of the rule changes and other arrangements necessary to implement fully the four conditions. The upshot of petitioners\u2019 affirmative answer to this question is that NSCC\u2019s move from Phase I to Phase II and its satisfaction of the four conditions must occur virtually instantaneously. The Commission for its part contends that, insofar as these rule changes <em>implement </em>Condition 1, <em>see </em>note 48 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text, they are consistent with <em>Order </em>I; and thus it implicitly rejects the argument that <em>Order I </em>requires the move from Phase I to Phase II to be made in one comprehensive step rather than in several small ones. <em>Order II, </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">We, too, are unable to detect anything in <em>Order I </em>that prevents NSCC from taking interim steps in the direction of implementing the four conditions, insofar as the steps are (1) consistent with the 1975 Amendments\u2019 balancing test and other requirements and (2) do not allow NSCC \u201csubstantially\u201d to change its rules, and thus, to \u201ccement [its] monopoly position in a way that would be inappropriate.\u201d <em>Order I, </em>at 43; JA at 107 (remarks of Comm\u2019r Evans).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Although <em>Order I </em>would not be inconsistent with a one-step transition, it also appears to leave open the possibility of a multi-step approach, as limited above. <em>See Order I, </em>at 43 (contemplating Phase I rule changes that are not \u201csubstantial\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 81 (SEC will monitor <em>\u201ceach step </em>NSCC takes toward implementing Phase II\u201d) (emphasis added). Because the rationale for using such an approach is readily \u201capparent,\u201d <em>see Industrial Union, supra, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. at 344, 499 F.2d at <em>480 </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>to let the necessary changes occur as the result of a relatively undisruptive \u201cevolution,\u201d rather than requiring NSCC to coordinate and implement an instantaneous \u201crevolution\u201d \u2014 the Commission\u2019s choice in <em>Order II </em>between the alternatives left open in <em>Order I </em>is not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">The order at issue in No. 77-1199 is affirmed in all respects excepting its treatment of geographic price mutualization and the facilities management-data processing contract. The case is remanded for further exploration of whether these two aspects of NSCC\u2019s registration application are consistent with the 1975 Amendments\u2019 admonition that anticompetitive impacts not outweigh other regulatory benefits. The order at issue in No. 77-1547 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-10\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1162-11\">. <em>See also </em>Securities and Exchange Commission, Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices of Brokers and Dealers, H.R.Doc.No.231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1971); Subcomm. on Commerce and Finance of the House Comm, on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Securities Industry Study, H.R.Rep.No.1519, 92d Cong., 2d Sess.

When two brokers agree on the floor of an exchange, or over the counter (i. e., usually, over the telephone), to a buy-sell transaction for their clients, the actual transaction has only begun. Thereafter, several steps must be taken to complete the course of dealing. These steps are typically the responsibility of a clearing agency, one of which traditionally has been linked to each of the national and regional exchanges, and one of which has served the over-the-counter market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">The clearing agency has three functions. First, the agency \u201ccompares\u201d submissions of the seller\u2019s broker with those of the buyer\u2019s to make sure that there is a common understanding of the terms of the trade. Following this process, the resulting \u201ccompared trade\u201d is \u201ccleared.\u201d Most simply, this amounts to the clearing agency advising the selling and buying brokers, respectively, of their delivery and payment obligations. The system becomes far more complicated \u2014 although, with the help of computers, also more efficient \u2014 insofar as the clearing agency attempts, for a given period of time, to net all of a broker\u2019s transactions in each security as well as all of his monetary obligations. By this means, and by making all rights and duties run between the broker on either side of the transaction and the clearing agency, rather than between the brokers themselves, each broker is reduced to making or receiving one delivery for each security traded, and one cash payment, per day. In addition to reducing transactions costs, this latter method of clearing, referred to as \u201ccontinuous netting,\u201d eases the risk to each broker and his client that the other party will become insolvent or otherwise fail to complete the transaction. The final, \u201csettlement,\u201d stage in the process involves the delivery of securities certificates to the purchasing broker and the payment of money to the selling broker. Modernization of this task has led to storage of most stock certificates in a depository affiliated with the clearing agency. Thus, \u201cdelivery\u201d amounts to a bookkeeping entry that removes the security from one account and places it in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-13\">The breakdown in these processes during the late 1960\u2019s largely antedated, and supplied the impetus for, the modern computerization and netting trends.

The 1975 Amendments do not in terms require the SEC to examine every registration application in light of the broader national goals in section 17A(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q-l(a). Instead, they only require the application to meet the requirements for registration set forth in section 17A(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q-l(b).

As summarized by the drafters, the goal of the national market system is the \u201ccentraliz[ation of] trading of securities in the interest of both efficiency and investor protection\u201d and the \u201celiminatpon of] all unnecessary or inappropriate burdens on competition,\u201d while the goal of the national clearing system is the \u201ccentraliz[ation of] every facet of the securities handling process\u201d and \u201cthe prompt development\u201d of an efficient \u201cpaper-handling\u201d process.

The national exchanges are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), both of which are located in New York. Each owns its own clearing agency \u2014 the Stock Clearing Corp. (SCC) and the American Stock Exchange Clearing Corp. (ASECC), respectively \u2014 although a separate company, Securities Industry Automation Corp. (SIAC), which is jointly owned by NYSE and AMEX, currently acts as facilities manager and data processor for both SCC and ASECC. Together, SCC and ASECC account for about 73% of the clearing and settling functions performed in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">The major regional exchanges are the Boston Stock Exchange, which owns and operates the Boston Stock Exchange Clearing Corp., the Midwest Stock Exchange, which owns and operates the Midwest Clearing Corporation, the Pacific Stock Exchange, which owns the Pacific Clearing Corp. (operated by petitioner Bradford National Clearing Corp.), and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which owns and operates the Stock Clearing Corp. of Philadelphia. These exchanges and their clearing associates together handle about 15% of the securities transactions nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-13\">The bulk of the remaining share of the securities market \u2014 about 12% \u2014 stems from the OTC trade under the auspices of the NASD and its subsidiary, the National Clearing Corp. (NCC).</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-14\">The rules \u201ctying\u201d exchanges and subsidiary clearing agencies were designed at least in part to serve goals other than market division and preservation of customer pools. <em>See </em>note 21 <em>infra. </em>Nonetheless, those rules also have these latter results. In addition, because most exchange-listed securities, including those on the NYSE and AMEX, may be traded on all of the regional exchanges and over the counter, these rules meant, for example, that a broker outside of New York could initiate NYSE and AMEX transactions locally, but still had to clear them through New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-15\">A more complete discussion of the structure of the clearing industry at the time the 1975 Amendments were enacted and of the industry\u2019s response to those Amendments culminating in this litigation may be found in <em>Order I, </em>at 34-52. The summary herein is largely derived from that source.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1168-16\">. Of particular note in the present context, BNCC underbid SIAC (the facilities manager/data processor owned jointly by NYSE and AMEX, <em>see </em>note 13 supra) for the facilities management contract with NASD\u2019s clearing agency, NCC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">. Although its primary office was located in Manhattan, at the time of the negotiations NCC also operated a series of regional branch offices through which its customers outside of New York had access to its clearing facilities. Thus, when NCC merged with the other two New York clearing agencies it gave the new entity a capacity for dealing locally with brokers and dealers located outside of Manhattan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1169-8\">. As eventually agreed to, users comprised 12 of the 16 members of the board of directors, with the other four seats taken by one representative each of NYSE, AMEX, and NASD, and one by the president of the entity. Nonetheless, the three parent organizations have a qualified veto power with respect to all rules of the entity save those imposed by law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1169-9\">. In its final form, the merger agreement provided essentially that each of the three New York clearing agencies would receive one-third of the new entity\u2019s 30,000 outstanding shares of common stock in return for the transfer of their operating assets. In addition, the three parent organizations, NYSE, AMEX, and NASD, were to receive $.12 for each buy and sell of trades in equity securities executed on their respective markets. Total annual payments, however, were not to exceed $3 million to NYSE, $1 million to AMEX, and $550,000 to NASD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1169-13\">. Under the merger plan finally settled upon, SIAC was given a five-year management contract, albeit one that could be terminated by the clearing entity at any time after two years upon payment of a specified termination fee. SIAC agreed not to charge the clearing entity more than cost for its services. That NYSE and AMEX own SIAC, are part owners of the clearing entity, and control two of the sixteen mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>bers of the board of directors of that entity, <em>see </em>note 15 <em>supra, </em>suggest that SIAC has significant leverage in retaining its contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">. Although NSCC\u2019s application was approved in early 1977, it had not completed Phase I by the time of oral argument in this case, some 16 months later. The SEC is currently investigating the delay. <em>See </em>note 29 <em>infra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1170-8\">. Under the NSCC merger plan, NCC was to exercise a termination option in its contract with BNCC so that SIAC could take over as facilities manager.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1170-9\">. At this stage of technological development, comparison presents the greatest obstacle to the establishment of a simple and efficient national clearing system. Because comparison \u201cinterfaces\u201d between clearing facilities are not yet feasible, it is impossible for the two brokers involved in a transaction to submit their trade data to different clearing facilities and to receive an immediate comparison. The rules linking exchanges to subsidiary clearing facilities alleviated this problem by providing a common facility at which the two parties to a transaction could compare their trade without agreeing in each instance on a mutually satisfactory comparison agency. NSCC\u2019s proposal also had to face this problem, and it did so by restricting its comparison services primarily to NYSE, AMEX, and OTC traders in New York, who are in a position to submit their data directly to NSCC\u2019s facility located in the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-13\">Recently, however, NCC has developed a system of regional branch office comparison, whereby comparison data for OTC trades may be submitted to different facilities around the country and then transferred to a common locus for comparison. NSCC proposed to continue this service so that OTC traders outside of New York could compare their trades through the regional branch or branches nearest them. Furthermore, it proposed in the future to extend the service so that NYSE and AMEX traders could do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-14\">NCC\u2019s regional system also establishes the feasibility of linking <em>ail </em>clearing agencies electronically, so that brokers can submit data to the clearing agency of their choice from whence the data can be transferred to a common site and compared. Moreover, the industry has also experimented with interfaces by which trades compared by one clearing agency may be transferred to another for clearing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>settlement. Together, these innovations allow a broker to use only one clearing agency, wherever located, as his sole agent for comparing, clearing, and settling all trades on any exchange or market with any other broker. Nonetheless, until comparison interface technology is fully developed, that one agent may have to use another clearing agency to perform the comparison function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1171-15\">. Geographic price mutualization achieves the objective of expanding the securities market into a geographically nationalized operation, rather than one dominated by New York. This objective is served by allowing brokers outside New York to \u201ccompete\u201d more effectively with those inside New York. Whether it also enhances competition in the stricter economic <em>sense </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>whether it allocates resources more efficiently \u2014 is a different question. It is conceivable that concentrating the securities market in one city, albeit to the disadvantage of securities operatives located elsewhere, allocates resources most efficiently. Such a situation may well have existed prior to the advent of modern communication and data processing technology, and may even continue today. If so, geographic price mutualization is actually anticompetitive and essentially subsidizes regional brokers at the expense of those located in New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1171-29\">. Release No. 12,489, <em>supra </em>note 5; SEC Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12,274 (March 29, 1976). Petitioners have expressed no doubts about the adequacy of the procedures used by the Commission in approving registration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">. The Commission defined a \u201cfull interface\u201d as \u201cone through which any participant in either of the interfacing clearing corporations can move all its transactions in issues eligible for comparison, clearing and settlement at both clearing corporations.\u201d <em>Order I, </em>at 69 n.121.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">. None of the petitioners herein has the ability independently to compare, clear, and settle securities transactions by way of continuous netting \u2014 a prerequisite to the right to interface with NSCC. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>Hence Order I did not explicitly include any of petitioners in its list of agencies with which NSCC must interface. Nonetheless, petitioner BNCC does operate the clearing agency affiliated with the Pacific Stock Exchange, <em>see </em>note 13 <em>supra, </em>which has the right to interface with NSCC now, and petitioner Bradford Securities Processing Services, Inc. (BSPS) currently has pending before the SEC a proposal to change its rules and fee schedule to allow it to expand its comparison of services as a step in the direction of establishing a continuous netting system. The Commission recognizes the petitioner companies as efficient and innovative competitors in those clearing areas in which they are active. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix in No. 77-1547, at 106, 109 (remarks of Comm\u2019r Evans).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">In its briefs, BSPS has contended that it cannot fully develop a continuous netting capability until its client base expands. And that expansion, it further claims, has been prevented by the \u201ctying\u201d rules through which NYSE and AMEX have traditionally insisted that their traders use their subsidiary clearing operations. As promised, however, <em>see SEC </em>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13,027 (Dec. 7, 1976), the Commission recently forced all of the exchanges and NASD to abandon the assailed \u201ctying\u201d rules, <em>see, e. g., </em>SEC Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 14,299, 14,636 (Dec. 4, 1977 and Apr. 7, 1978), and BSPS presumably is or will soon be free to offer its services even to traders on the NYSE and AMEX, and thus to develop the capability of interfacing with NSCC, as the Commission has invited it to do. <em>Order I, </em>at 90 n.168; <em>accord, </em>SEC Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13,584 (June 1, 1977). These events thus appear to have removed any substance to petitioners\u2019 claims that the SEC should have accorded it an interface despite its inability to offer a continuous netting service, and that the tying rules emasculate the four conditions in other ways. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioners in No. 77-1199, at 41-45; note 46 <em>infra. </em>Accordingly, we will not comment further on these claims. <em>See also </em>note 27 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">. In 1975, several members of the clearing industry, including SCC and some of the regional exchange affiliates, initiated a pilot interface program, called the Regional Interface Organization (RIO). Under this program, the clearing agency affiliated with the exchange in which a transaction is initiated compares the trade, but then routes the compared trade to any other participating clearing agency for clearing and settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">Nonetheless, RIO was originally an experiment and has been limited to trades in selected securities by selected brokers. In addition, although the record\u2019s description of RIO is sparse, it apparently is, at best, only available where both brokers in a transaction are participants in the clearing agency that is to clear and settle the trade. Thus, if two Chicago brokers traded an AMEX security on the Midwest Stock Exchange (MSE), as often occurs, RIO might allow them also to use MSE\u2019s clearing agency (MCC), to clear and settle the transaction after it had been compared through the ASECC division of NSCC \u2014 but only if both brokers are participants of MCC. Finally, some participating clearing agencies, including SCC, have made use of RIO less desirable by imposing fees on transactions that move through interfaces. NSCC apparently plans to use RIO, which is still in operation and will continue to be operated by the SCC division of NSCC during Phase I, as the skeleton of the full interface system contemplated by Condition 1. <em>See </em>notes 27 &amp; 28 and accompanying texts <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1173-8\">. The Commission approved this rule change and petitioners sought review thereof (and filed their briefs) <em>before </em>the Commission abolished the \u201ctying\u201d rules linking NYSE and AMEX to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>the SCC and ASECC divisions of NSCC. <em>See </em>note 25 <em>supra. </em>Hence, the immediate effects of the rule change were (a) to force all brokers trading bonds on the NYSE and AMEX to use the SCC division of NSCC as their clearing facility, and (b) to establish that division as the only one technologically capable of providing a single clearing service for debt traders on the two national exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">Since the SEC has secured the repeal of the \u201ctying\u201d rules, however, presumably any other clearing agency may offer to clear and settle NYSE and AMEX debt securities transactions. Moreover, NSCC has also authorized NYSE and AMEX debt securities to move through the RIO interfaces that have been established since 1975. <em>See </em>note 26 <em>supra. </em>Hence, at this point, competing clearing agencies can offer to clear and settle any transactions by their participants in such debt securities. They will not be able to offer one-step clearing as to such securities, however, until NSCC complies with the comparison-at-cost condition (Condition 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">. <em>Cf. </em>note 26 <em>supra. </em>Under this program, the nonparticipant must secure the aid of a \u201cSpecial Representative.\u201d The SCC division of NSCC may confer that status on any of its members or any registered clearing agency that applies to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">By way of example, in a typical transaction in which a nonparticipant in NSCC (NP) agrees to sell securities to a participant in NSCC the following events would be likely to occur. First, a Special Representative (SR) of NP (SR being a member of SCC) submits NP\u2019s understanding of the trade to SCC for comparison. Presumably, the participant-buyer does the same, and the trade compares. As a result, SCC credits SR with a certificate-delivery obligation and a right to the receipt of a sum of money. (The participant-buyer is credited with the opposite rights and obligations). Next, SR and NP\u2019s clearing agency, say the Pacific Clearing Corp. (PCC), submit a compared trade to SCC showing PCC as the seller and SR as the buyer of the same security for the same price. This results in SCC crediting SR with a certificate-receipt right and with a money payment obligation, and PCC with the opposite. When SR\u2019s obligations and rights from its two \u201ctransactions\u201d are netted out, it shows zero in all columns. Meanwhile, PCC has taken over SR\u2019s certificate-delivery obligation and its money-receipt right \u2014 both of which will be netted with all PCC rights and obligations to SCC, and the appropriate transfers made at the end of the day. PCC will be able to fulfill the delivery obligation because it will have secured the certificate from its participant, NP, and it will have paid NP its money against the funds it will receive from SCC at the end of the day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">. <em>Bradford Nat\u2019l Clearing Corp. v. SEC, </em>Nos. 77-1199, 77-1547 (D.C.Cir. May 10, 1978). In <em>Order I, </em>the Commission repeatedly promised \u201cto monitor closely the effects of the decision\u201d granting NSCC\u2019s registration. Should that monitoring \u201cdisclose . . the need for new or different approaches to the registration of clearing agencies,\u201d or should NSCC fail to satisfy the SEC\u2019s four conditions within a reasonable time, the Commission promised that \u201cif necessary, [it would] substantially modify or reverse [the registration] decision,\u201d or at least \u201cundertake appropriate action,\u201d \u201cto facilitate the prompt establishment of a national clearing and settlement system.\u201d <em>Order I, </em>at 111-12. <em>Accord, id. </em>at 59, 70, 81, 82, 87 n.166, 90, 98. In particular, it stated that NSCC\u2019s switch from Phase I to Phase II would provide at least one appropriate opportunity for it generally \u201cto reconsider\u201d the determinations in <em>Order I. Id. </em>at 59, 61-62, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">The import of these statements by the Commission is that it premised its approval of the registration on its ability to reverse or modify that decision if necessary at a later date. This \u201ctentative\u201d and conditional approach, <em>see </em>Release No. 14,411 <em>supra, </em>on the one hand cautions against reading any disapproval of its former order into its recent decision to hold hearings. On the other hand, this approach also means that any action the Commission takes in the future based on new information about NSCC\u2019s progress in carrying out both its proposal and the Commission\u2019s four conditions, and about the effects thereof on the achievement of a national clearing system consistent with the 1975 Amendments, will be reviewable in light of its expectations about that progress and those effects as expressed in <em>Order I. </em>In other words, should the expectations in <em>Order I </em>prove unfounded and should no other justifications for continued registration appear, the Commission\u2019s continued endorsement of the NSCC plan without modification might then appear untenable. Our duty in reviewing <em>these </em>orders, however, is merely to examine whether the Commission\u2019s expectations <em>at the time they were entered </em>were well founded, and if so, whether they support its decision at that,time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">. <em>Industrial Union Dep\u2019t v.

Thus, these petitions do not raise the question of whether NSCC\u2019s actions would constitute a violation of the antitrust laws or whether those laws are implicitly repealed by the 1975 Amendments with respect to NSCC\u2019s clearing operations. <em>See generally Gordon v. New York Stock Exch., </em>422 U.S. 659, 95 S.Ct. 2598, 45 L.Ed.2d 463 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">. The Justice Department expressed its views to Congress in <em>Hearings on S. 249 Before the Subcomm. on Securities of the Senate Comm. </em>. <em>on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, </em>94th Cong., 1st Sess. 244-52, 257-62 (1975). Apparently in response, the Senate Report, which was generally adopted by the Conference Committee, emphasized that the 1975 Amendments do \u201cnot . requir[e] the Commission to justify that such actions be the least anti-competitive manner of achieving a regulatory objective.\u201d S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">Congress may well have refused to include as stringent a general provision forbidding anti-competitive impacts as the Justice Department desired because of its inclusion of specific restrictions against the anticompetitive practices that it found most undesirable. For example, no clearing agency may be registered if its rules allocate fees inequitably among its participants or fix rates for service provided by those participants. <em>See </em>sections 17A(b)(3)(D)-(E), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q-l(b)(3)(D)-(E). It is worthy of note that the drafters of the House\u2019s predecessor bill to the 1975 Amendments, while expressing grave concern that the SEC\u2019s actions in this area not have anticompetitive effects and in fact that they actively promote greater competition, H.Rep., <em>supra, </em>at 47, 51, did not even include in that bill a general restriction against registering clearing agencies whose rules are unnecessarily, inappropriately, or in any other manner anticompetitive. H.R. 4111, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 17A(d) (1975). Instead, they sought to rely entirely on specific restrictions (i. e., those eventually included in the 1975 Amendments) against particular anticompetitive practices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">. All but one of the references in the Senate Report (on which petitioners primarily rely) to competitive concerns refer to the Commission\u2019s duties with respect to the national <em>market, </em>rather than the national <em>clearing, </em>system. S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 8, 11-14. Because the statutory provision on the national market system includes the enhancement of competition among its <em>objectives, </em>rather than merely as a factor to be taken into account, it arguably makes competition a more important consideration than does the provision on the national clearing system. <em>See </em>note 11 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. Thus, we must be cautious in applying congressional statements on competition that were made in the national market context to the national clearing context.</p>\n<p id=\"Anm\">Nonetheless, this point should not be overemphasized. The two national systems are intimately related. Moreover, the Senate Report does include approval of SEC considerations of clearing agency rules <em>changes, </em>under section 19(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78s(b), <em>see </em>note 8 <em>supra, </em>as among those cases in which competition concerns must be included in the Commission\u2019s balance of relevant considerations. And there appears to be no reason why the mandated approach to <em>changing </em>clearing agency rules should differ from the analogous approach to <em>initiating </em>those rules at the registration stage. Finally, the <em>House </em>Report makes perhaps its strongest statement regarding the importance of maintaining and enhancing competition in a passage devoted to the national <em>clearing </em>system. H.Rep., <em>supra, </em>at 51. <em>But see </em>note 32 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1177-15\">. The drafters formulated the Commission\u2019s duty in this respect variously as the \u201cexplicit obligation to balance, against other regulatory criteria and considerations, the competitive implications of self-regulatory and Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>action,\u201d and the \u201cresponsibility ... to balance the perceived anticompetitive effects of the regulatory policy or decision at issue against the purposes of the Exchange Act that would be advanced thereby and the costs of doing so,\u201d and the weighing of \u201cthe need for and effectiveness of regulatory actions in achieving th[e] purposes [of the Exchange Act] against any detrimental impact on competition.\u201d S.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">Even where the legislative history and statute are not so clear as they are here, the courts have generally concluded that regulatory agencies need only include competitive concerns as one factor among many to be weighed in reaching a proper decision. <em>E. g., Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, </em>185 U.S.App.D.C. 142, 173 n.67, 567 F.2d 9, 40 n.67, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 829, 98 S.Ct. 111, 54 L.Ed.2d 89 (1977); <em>United States v. CAB, </em>167 U.S.App.D.C. 313, 318-20, 511 F.2d 1315, 1320-22 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">. In fact, the Commission\u2019s choice between the two plans seems reasonable. Thus, the NSCC plan had a considerably greater capacity for rapid development, having been in the planning stage for a year prior to SEC approval, and requiring fewer interfaces than Model II. <em>Order I, </em>at 84-85, 107-08. Moreover, by making NCC\u2019s regional branch network, as well as SCC-ASECC\u2019s continuous netting and RIO (interface) systems available to NSCC, rather than requiring SCC-ASECC to develop the former network, and NCC the latter systems, the Commission\u2019s decision further sped up the establishment of a national clearing system and avoided costly and duplicative capital outlays. <em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 85, 108. The Commission also feared that, under Model II, SCC-ASECC might simply forego development of a branch system so that brokers outside of New York would have less access to comparison services for NYSE and AMEX, transactions than under NSCC\u2019s proposal. <em>Id. </em>at 108 &amp; n.197.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">Finally, the Commission noted two other po- \u25a0 tential disadvantages of Model II, that, while not accorded substantial weight, were of incremental import. First, NSCC\u2019s system might cost less to operate than Model II. <em>See </em>note 37 <em>infra. </em>In addition, some commentators, including NCC itself, doubted whether it could turn a profit were it competing with SCC-ASECC without the tying rules that formerly assured it the patronage of all OTC traders. <em>Order I, </em>at 80, 82-83, 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">Thus, while conceding that Model II would \u201chave less of an adverse impact on competition among clearing agencies in New York City than NSCC\u2019s establishment,\u201d the Commission pointed to virtually every other goal of the 1975 Amendments as significantly favoring registration of NSCC. <em>Id. </em>at 107. Accordingly, even if we were charged with the task of reviewing choices made by the SEC beyond its balancing benefits and anticompetitive impacts, we would find its choice of NSCC over Model II supportable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">.' This conclusion appears to be consistent with the actions of the Justice Department in these proceedings. Thus, while the Department vigorously opposed registration of NSCC before the SEC and has recently reiterated its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>concem in the hearings being held by the Commission, <em>see </em>text preceding note 29 <em>supra, </em>it did not participate in this lawsuit and appears to take the position that registration is unwise as a policy matter, rather than illegal under the statute. <em>See </em>Comments of the United States Department of Justice (filed with the SEC, May 17, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">In reviewing the overall merits of registration, we put aside for a moment any consideration of geographic price mutualization and the lack of competitive bidding on NSCC\u2019s facilities management contract. For now, we assume that these specific aspects of NSCC\u2019s plan accomplish the goals assigned to them in <em>Order I. </em>In subsequent sections, we will examine whether each aspect does indeed accomplish those goals, and, if not, whether the Commission\u2019s error is grievous enough to upset the generally satisfactory balance it struck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">. The SEC accepted NSCC\u2019s figures predicting an annual cost savings of $12.4 to $17.4 million, of which about 75% would accrue to participants in relating to the clearing agency. The rest would appear as reductions in operating expenses of the agency itself. <em>Order I, </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">Petitioners do not seriously challenge these figures. Instead, they dispute NSCC\u2019s claims that its plan will save more money than Model II. The SEC, although agreeing that NSCC \u201cwould have a lower <em>operating </em>cost than Model II,\u201d by between 13 and 18%, felt that the difference was not worthy of \u201csubstantial weight\u201d in choosing between NSCC and Model II because both plans probably would reduce participant costs equally. <em>Id. </em>at 67 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-14\">For purposes of reviewing the requisite balance, of course, it is sufficient that the NSCC plan would cut clearing costs substantially. We note in addition, however, that the Commission\u2019s treatment of the NSCC-Model II cost comparison reveals that it chose between the two plans with care. Thus, even if within New York a single entity operation ideally might run most cheaply (i. e., even if there is a natural monopoly situation), the Commission apparently realized that society will have to expend resources making sure that NSCC in fact charges no more than cost. It accordingly refused to credit the operating cost differential between the two plants, because Model II by confronting NSCC with price competition in New York, might have avoided enough of the regulatory costs to offset its higher operating costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">. The Commission premised the cost reduction that NSCC would afford brokers outside of New York mainly on NSCC\u2019s promise to equalize clearing prices for brokers inside and outside of New York. <em>Order I, </em>at 76-77. The. viability of this pricing mechanism, \u201cgeographic price mutualization,\u201d as an enhancer of competition is discussed in note 22 <em>supra, </em>and its viability under the statute is discussed <em>infra. </em>The Commission also suggested that regional competition between NSCC\u2019s branch offices and the regional clearing agencies would continue and even be enhanced by NSCC\u2019s expansion of its network, and thus would contribute to lower costs. <em>Id. </em>at 77. The importance to broker-dealer competition of clearing costs (as opposed to greater access to the New York trading market) was minimized by the Commission, however, because clearing costs are a \u201crelatively small component\u201d of brokers\u2019 commissions. <em>Id. </em>at 78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">. The Commission did not succumb in <em>Order I </em>to the argument, which did appear in its brief in this court, as well as in intervenor NSCC\u2019s brief, that NSCC\u2019s plan as approved had no legally cognizable anticompetitive effects. The basis for this argument is the fact that, prior to NSCC\u2019s registration, tying rules prevented any competition. Accordingly, it is said, NSCC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>provision for <em>some </em>competition, however minimal, enhances competition as required by the statute. From statements in the legislative history, however, it is clear that Congress considered anything less than \u201cfull allowance for the continuance and <em>future entry </em>of\u201d competitive entities to be an anticompetitive impact with which the Commission must contend. H.Rep., <em>supra, </em>at 51 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">. Under the Commission\u2019s approach, it is at least theoretically possible that a competing <em>New York </em>clearing operation will develop in the future. Under <em>Order I, </em>the Commission has committed itself to encouraging any such efforts by a new entrant in the New York market, so long, of course, as such a competitor would not seriously thwart the achievement of a national clearing system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">. <em>Order I, </em>at 81. <em>See </em>note 29 <em>supra. </em>In full, the SEC stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-9\">[T]he Commission will monitor the impact of NSCC\u2019s registration on brokers and dealers and clearing agencies and, pursuant to the conditions to NSCC\u2019s registration contained in this order, will review each step NSCC takes toward implementing Phase II. If Phase II does not come to pass as planned, the Commission will consider revoking NSCC\u2019s registration. Undoing the limiting combination which would be effected during Phase I by NSCC\u2019s registration would not be without difficulty, and would delay briefly the realization of any potential which exists for competition between ASECC-SCC and NCC. However, the requirement that Phase II operations not be initiated until the conditions are satisfied is intended to insure that no irreversible steps are taken before the installation of mechanisms which the Commission believes will prevent Phase II operations from imposing unnecessary or inappropriate burdens on competition. And the Commission\u2019s monitoring will ensure that exploration of possible alternatives such as competition between ASECC-SCC and NCC will not be delayed unduly by an inappropriate prolongation of Phase I.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-15\"><em>Order I </em>at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-16\">This passage reveals, also that the Commission fully accounted in its balance for the regulatory burdens occasioned by registering NSCC. It considered those burdens worth the candle in protecting and increasing competition. We see no reason to disagree. Moreover, as the Commission suggested, any potentially viable alternative to NSCC\u2019s plan would also entail significant regulatory costs, so that undue emphasis on such costs could only mean that <em>no </em>national clearing system would go into operation in the near future. <em>See Order I, </em>at 83, 106-10'.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">. This critique is perhaps more theoretical than real, however, because the New York brokers are virtually unanimous in their support of NSCC\u2019s plan, including GPM.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">. To the extent that GPM did not force NSCC\u2019s regional competitors out of business, it could indicate that NSCC\u2019s branch system was operating less efficiently than its competitors and that even without GPM (assuming full interfaces were in place), regional brokers could obtain complete clearing services at low prices through the local clearing agencies. In that event, it would hardly make sense to increase prices to New York brokers to support an inefficient and unnecessary branch system. It also could indicate that clearing costs are such a small element of a brokers\u2019 overall expenses, <em>see </em>note 38 <em>supra, </em>that variations in those costs would not necessarily induce brokers to leave their regional clearing agency and join NSCC. Were this true, however, it would make no sense for the Commission even to risk an exodus of regional brokers from local clearing agencies simply to equalize the expenses of regional and New York brokers in this, by hypothesis, insignificant area of broker costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">. As noted earlier, the Commission has already undertaken a reexamination of GPM as part of its oversight activities. <em>See </em>Release No. 14,411 <em>supra; </em>note 29 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. We do not mean by our treatment of this issue to interfere with those activities. In fact, we expect that on remand the Commission will make full use of any new data it has gathered on the subject pricing mechanism.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">. In its brief, the Commission argues that since NSCC would ultimately select only one manager-processor from among an array of bidders, bidding \u201cwould not necessarily increase competition. . . . \u201d Brief for Respondents, at 59-60. This argument is unpersuasive. Regularized (e. <em>g., </em>triennial) bidding on public contracts is a recognized means of inducing competition in naturally monopolistic and like economic spheres where day-to-day competition is for some reason undesirable. In terms more specific to this suit, that BNCC can in one context outbid SIAC for a manager-processor contract, <em>see </em>note 14, holds out the possibility that the former could also manage NSCC more efficiently than \u2014 or at least that it could squeeze extra increments of efficiency out of\u2014 SIAC. In addition, the opportunity to bid on such a big contract at set intervals would encourage other clearing agencies to improve and expand their operations and might even spur new entry of the type that Congress credited with \u201cthe most significant [recent] advances\u201d in the clearing industry. H.Rep., <em>supra, </em>at 51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">. Most .particularly, petitioners have reiterated their claim that so long as NSCC\u2019s three divisions \u2014 SCC, ASECC, and NCC \u2014 retain their \u201ctying rules,\u201d NSCC\u2019s competitors are prevented from attracting the clientele necessary to establish themselves as competitors of NSCC. The rule changes, it is said, merely increase NSCC\u2019s hold on that clientele by enabling it to accustom its essentially entrapped participants to more and better services that its competitors are not now able to offer prospective customers. To the degree that these arguments turn on the evils of the now defunct tying rules and on petitioners\u2019 inability because of those rules to develop a continuous netting capacity and thus an interface with NSCC, they are without force. <em>See </em>notes 25 &amp; 27 <em>supra; </em>Brief of Petitioners in No. 77-1547 at 30-31, 31-32, 33, 35, 55-56, 57-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-14\">We also find unpersuasive petitioners\u2019 references to recent and isolated statements of members of Congress to the effect that the SEC\u2019s approach to clearing is misguided.
