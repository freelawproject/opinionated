This matter originally appeared before the Court on an order to show cause why the issues in the case should not be summarily decided.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The pertinent facts are as follows. In 2006, Hexagon entered into a contract with A/Z Corporation to construct a new facility at the Quonset Business Park, located in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. As general contractor, A/Z Corporation subcontracted the roofing installation to McKenna, authorizing McKenna to install a specific roofing system manufactured by defendant Carlisle Syntec Incorporated (Carlisle). Hexagon alleges that, almost immediately, the new roof began to leak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 14, 2015, approximately nine years after first contracting with A/Z Corporation, Hexagon filed a complaint in Washington County Superior Court against Carlisle and McKenna, alleging breach of contract as to both defendants\n   (Count I); breach of express warranty as to Carlisle only (Count II); and breach of the implied warranty to construct in good and workmanlike manner (Count III), misrepresentation (Count IV),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and negligence (Count V), against both defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hexagon alleged that McKenna had improperly installed the roof and sought to recover the cost of replacing it. Hexagon did not assert claims against A/Z Corporation, the general contractor, for reasons Hexagon later described as \"judicial efficiency and not choosing to damage a relationship with somebody that [it] had a positive relationship with * * *.\" McKenna moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and provided the following as the undisputed statement of facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The plaintiff entered into a contract with A/Z Construction [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] to act as a general contractor for the construction of its building located at 250 Circuit Drive, North Kingstown, RI in 2006. * * * Plaintiff alleges that Carlisle supplied a 'Carlisle Golden Seal Total Roofing System' to the building. * * * Plaintiff's Complaint further alleges that Carlisle supplied it with a written warranty concerning the roofing system dated July 15, 2006. * * * McKenna was a subcontractor on the project, and installed the Carlisle roofing system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Plaintiff alleges that the roofing system failed. * * * Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the roof began leaking in 2006. * * * The plaintiff further alleges that the leaks are due to defects in materials and/or installation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its memorandum in support of its motion, McKenna argued that Hexagon did not allege viable claims for breach of contract and breach of implied warranty against McKenna because no contract existed between the parties. McKenna further argued that Hexagon failed to specifically plead that Hexagon was an intended beneficiary of the subcontract between McKenna and A/Z Corporation, as required by Rule 8 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In addition, McKenna argued that the economic loss doctrine barred Hexagon from recovering economic damages on the negligence claim in Count V of its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its opposition to McKenna's motion for summary judgment, Hexagon accepted McKenna's undisputed facts in their entirety, and countered that its claims against McKenna for breach of contract and breach of implied warranty were sustainable because third-party intended beneficiaries can maintain a breach-of-contract claim even in the absence of a contract between a plaintiff and a defendant. Hexagon added that this theory did not need to be specifically pled and that, for summary-judgment purposes, it had provided sufficient proof of this third-party intended beneficiary theory by accepting the undisputed facts offered by McKenna. In this regard, we note that Hexagon failed to submit either the general contract between Hexagon and A/Z Corporation or the subcontract between McKenna and A/Z Corporation in its opposition to the motion. Addressing its negligence claim, Hexagon argued that the economic loss doctrine, which bars recovery for pure economic loss in a negligence action, does not apply to this case because no privity of contract existed between Hexagon and McKenna.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The hearing on McKenna's motion for summary judgment was held on November 21, 2016. The motion justice granted the motion, holding that Hexagon was only an incidental beneficiary, as opposed to an intended beneficiary, of the subcontract between McKenna and A/Z Corporation. The court reasoned that Hexagon had failed to show that it was directly and unequivocally an intended beneficiary. He held that the economic loss doctrine applied, barring Hexagon's claim for pure economic loss, because the parties were engaged in a commercial transaction. An order granting McKenna's motion for summary judgment was entered on December 6, 2016. On December 19, 2016, Hexagon prematurely appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Final judgment was entered on December 27, 2016, in favor of McKenna on all counts of Hexagon's complaint, pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A motion for summary judgment \"is designed to decide in an expeditious fashion cases presenting groundless claims * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallo v.

The thrust of Hexagon's argument is that, armed with McKenna's undisputed statement of facts, a reasonable jury could find\n    that McKenna owed a contractual duty to Hexagon as a third-party beneficiary to the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna. We are therefore called upon to determine whether the owner of a building may survive summary judgment based on a third-party-beneficiary theory where the only evidence presented was that the subcontractor may have had knowledge of the identity of the property owner, who was the ultimate beneficiary of the work that was performed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    We deal first with McKenna's argument that Hexagon's third-party beneficiary assertion is not properly before this Court because it was not specifically pled. Rule 8(a) requires a complaint to contain: \"(1) A short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief; and (2) A demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks.\" A viable complaint must \"give the opposing party fair and adequate notice of the type of claim being asserted[,]\" even if it does not plead the ultimate facts or precise legal theory upon which the claim is based.\n    <em>\n     Berard v.

Here, even though Hexagon did not specifically reference the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna in its complaint, McKenna was on notice that Hexagon was bringing a claim for breach of contract with respect to this same transaction, even though the ultimate facts upon which Hexagon now relies are different from those set out in its complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Further, \"[i]t is well settled that '[w]hen one party for valuable consideration, engages another by contract to do some act for the benefit of a third party, the latter who would enjoy the benefits, may maintain an action for breach of contract.' \"\n    <em>\n     Glassie v.

That is to say, if Hexagon were an intended beneficiary of the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna, Hexagon could maintain a breach-of-contract cause of action against McKenna.

And it is true that no such express contract had been presented to the hearing justice when he passed upon McKenna's motion for summary judgment. Indeed, the majority assigns great weight to the fact that Hexagon did not submit either the general contract between A/Z Corporation and Hexagon or the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna. However, in my opinion, the absence of such an express contract in this case did not make the grant of summary judgment in McKenna's favor inevitable as a legal matter.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The majority opines that Hexagon did not meet its burden to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact since Hexagon instead relied solely on McKenna's explicit and unequivocal statement of undisputed facts, without introducing any evidence of its own. However, there is no legal requirement that Hexagon had to introduce its own evidence in order to survive McKenna's motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Nichola v.

While the statement of undisputed facts is set forth verbatim in the majority's opinion, it bears repeating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    \"The plaintiff entered into a contract with A/Z Construction [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] to act as a general contractor for the construction of its building located at 250 Circuit Drive, North Kingstown, RI in 2006. * * * Plaintiff alleges that Carlisle supplied a 'Carlisle Golden Seal Total Roofing System' to the building. * * * Plaintiff's Complaint further alleges that Carlisle supplied it with a written warranty concerning the roofing system dated July 15, 2006. * * * McKenna was a subcontractor on the project, and installed the Carlisle roofing system.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    \"Plaintiff alleges that the roofing system failed. * * * Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the roof began leaking in 2006. * * * The plaintiff further alleges that the leaks are due to defects in materials and/or installation.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    After reviewing the just-referenced \"appropriate evidence\" that was before the hearing justice, it was completely clear that McKenna installed the roof on Hexagon's building.\n    <em>\n     Estate of Giuliano\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8233197\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/949/386/#p390\">\n     949 A.2d at 391\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    This makes the facts in the instant case radically dissimilar from those summarized in the illustration provided in the Restatement (Second) of\n    <em>\n     Contracts\n    </em>\n    (relied on by the majority) regarding a supplier of materials which was unaware of the final destination of its materials.

The majority opinion even acknowledges that \"according to the Restatement (Second)\n    <em>\n     Contracts\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 302(1)(b), where a subcontractor provides more than mere materials, the owner's status will change from incidental to intended beneficiary of the subcontract, if the circumstances indicate that [the subcontractor] intends to give [the owner] the benefit of the promised performance.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Here, McKenna did much more than merely provide materials because McKenna actually installed the roof directly on the building itself. Accordingly, it is my position that, even without any express contract being in evidence, Hexagon has more than adequately shown that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether or not McKenna intended to benefit Hexagon.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Even if I concede\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that, at this stage of the litigation, it is not unequivocally clear whether Hexagon is a third-party beneficiary, it is nonetheless obvious to me that, in view of the evidence in the record to which Hexagon directed the Court's attention, that issue should not have been resolved by the hearing justice in the context of a motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Industrial National Bank v.

Rather than prematurely terminate this litigation at the summary judgment stage, my understanding of our Rule 56 jurisprudence convinces me that it was requisite for the case to proceed to trial to determine if Hexagon was indeed an intended third-party beneficiary of McKenna's contractual performance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Accordingly, for the above-stated reasons, I respectfully, but most vigorously, record my dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-71\">\n     Although the motion at issue was labeled a \"Motion to Dismiss,\" the fact is that it explicitly invokes Rule 56 as well as Rule 12 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.

Would McKenna in that hypothetical scenario somehow have been\n     <em>\n      ipso facto\n     </em>\n     immunized from potential liability under a third-party beneficiary theory? I think not.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-74\">\n     I feel that it is advisable to reiterate that this Court has expressly \"indicated that [a] hearing justice who passes on a motion for summary judgment must review the pleadings, affidavits, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and other appropriate evidence from a perspective most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\"\n     <em>\n      DeMarco v.
