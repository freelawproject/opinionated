The self-represented defendant, Brian Stein,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals from the judgment of strict foreclosure rendered in favor of the substitute plaintiff, Wilmington Trust, N.A. (Wilmington Trust), as successor trustee to the plaintiff, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), as trustee of the holders of Bear Stearns Alt-A Trust 2006-6, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-6. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Heller, J.\n   </em>\n   , (1) erred by denying his motion to dismiss, (2) abused its discretion by denying his motion to reargue and for reconsideration, (3) abused its discretion by refusing to consider, after the June 2015 trial, documents the defendant considered newly discovered evidence, (4) erred in finding that the mortgagor had defaulted on the note and default notice, and (5) erred under\n   <em>\n    J.E. Robert Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Signature Properties, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20307\">\n    309 Conn. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20492\">\n    71 A.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), in concluding that Citibank had proven its right as a nonholder in possession to bring the foreclosure action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In its memoranda of decision issued on January 7, 2016, and on February 21,\n   2017, the trial court set forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. On July 7, 2006, Laura A. Stein, the defendant's then wife,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   executed and delivered an interest only adjustable rate note to Countrywide Bank, N.A. (Countrywide Bank), in the principal amount of $1,650,000. Countrywide Bank endorsed the note to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.\n   (Home Loans). Home Loans, thereafter, endorsed the note in blank and provided it to Citibank. To secure the note, the defendant and Laura Stein executed in duplicate a mortgage\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the property and delivered it to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for Countrywide Bank. MERS assigned the mortgage to Citibank on November 25, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court also found, pursuant to paragraph 3 (A) of the note, that Laura Stein was to make monthly payments of interest only on the first day of each month, commencing on September 1, 2006. She and the defendant last made a monthly payment on the note on July 16, 2008. On September 16, 2008, Home Loans, which was the servicer of the loan on behalf of the holder of the note at that time, sent a letter to Laura Stein advising her that the loan was in default and of the amount required to cure the default and reinstate\n   the loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Laura Stein and the defendant failed to cure the default. Citibank elected to accelerate the balance due on the note, declare the note due in full, and foreclose the mortgage securing the note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citibank commenced the present foreclosure action by service of process on July 13, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleges, in relevant part, that\n   Citibank, as trustee, is the holder of the note and mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant and Laura Stein filed an answer and special defenses on March 19, 2010. Their special defenses alleged that Citibank lacked standing as a trustee under General Statutes \u00a7 52-106, but that if Citibank had standing, it was required to modify the mortgage pursuant to an agreement between the Connecticut Attorney General and Countrywide Bank. They also alleged that Citibank did not provide the original note, and, therefore, could not commence the action, and that the complaint failed to establish that Citibank was the current holder and owner of the note and mortgage. Citibank pleaded a general denial in response to the special defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 27, 2010, Citibank filed a motion for summary judgment as to liability only. The defendant and Laura Stein objected to the motion for summary judgment on the ground that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether Citibank was the holder of the note and mortgage. The court,\n   <em>\n    Mintz, J.\n   </em>\n   , sustained the defendant's objection to the motion by granting additional time for discovery on the issue of Citibank's standing and ordering that the motion for summary judgment be set down for argument on November 17, 2014. Judge Heller found that Citibank's motion for summary judgment was never argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 10, 2014, Laura Stein filed a motion to dismiss in which she contended, among other things, that Citibank lacked standing to pursue the present action under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-3-301 and 52-106. She withdrew her motion to dismiss, however, on the first day of trial, stipulated to certain facts, and consented to the entry of summary judgment against her as to liability only.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 19, 2015, five days before trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that Citibank lacked standing to pursue the action against him. After hearing from counsel for the parties, Judge Heller determined that she would\n   hear and decide the defendant's motion to dismiss at the same time and, in connection with, the merits of Citibank's foreclosure case. The parties, all represented by counsel, appeared before the court for trial on June 24, 25 and 26, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 7, 2016, after the parties had submitted posttrial briefs, the court issued a memorandum of decision in which it denied the defendant's motion to dismiss and rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of Citibank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 19, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial and on January 27, 2016, filed a motion for reargument and reconsideration of the court's ruling on his motion to dismiss. Citibank objected to both motions. The court granted the motion for reargument, and counsel for Citibank and the defendant appeared for argument before the court on February 16, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court reserved reconsideration of its ruling on the motion to dismiss and determined to open the record and take additional testimony from Citibank's witness,\n   Johnny Nguyen of Nationstar Mortgage LLC (Nationstar), the servicer of the subject mortgage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 29, 2016, Citibank filed a motion to substitute Wilmington Trust as the plaintiff because the mortgage had been assigned to Wilmington Trust after the present action was commenced. On August 30, 2016, the court heard additional testimony from Nguyen. Before commencing the hearing, the court granted Citibank's motion to substitute Wilmington Trust as the plaintiff. On September 19, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for reargument and reconsideration of Citibank's motion to substitute Wilmington Trust as the plaintiff. The court heard argument from counsel on the defendant's motion for reargument and reconsideration on November 28, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 1, 2017, counsel for the defendant filed a memorandum in further support of his motion to reargue the motion to substitute, and the defendant submitted a statement and memorandum of his own. Wilmington Trust filed an objection to the motion to reargue on February 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 21, 2017, the court issued a memorandum of decision on the defendant's three pending motions before it, to wit, his motion for a new trial, filed on January 19, 2016; his motion for reargument on his motion to dismiss, filed on January 27, 2016; and his motion for reargument on Citibank's motion to\n   substitute Wilmington Trust as the plaintiff, filed on September 19, 2016. The court denied all three of the defendant's\n   reargument motions and opened the judgment of strict foreclosure previously entered for the purpose of setting the law days. The defendant timely appealed to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court erred in finding that Citibank had standing to bring this foreclosure action against him and, thus, that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the action. Specifically, he claims that the court (1) erred by denying his motion to dismiss because Citibank lacked standing to commence the action and (2) abused its discretion by failing to grant his motion to reargue and for reconsideration of his motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reject the defendant's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant's claims require us to examine the court's memoranda of decision in detail. The court's decisions set forth the following facts and legal analyses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prior to the start of trial in June, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss claiming that he had a good faith belief that Citibank lacked standing to pursue the action. In its January 7, 2016 memorandum of decision, the trial court found that the defendant had argued that Citibank lacked standing because (i) it was not the owner of the note and the debt at issue and/or it was not the holder of the note and (ii) it was not authorized by the owner of the note and the debt to prosecute the action on behalf of the owner. The defendant also argued that Citibank lacked standing under\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-106. Citibank contended that it had standing as both the holder of the note and as trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court credited the uncontroverted testimony of Nguyen that Citibank was the holder of the note that had been endorsed in blank. The court cited the statutory and common-law definitions of \"holder.\" General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-104 (a) provides, in relevant part, that a holder is \"[t]he person in possession of a negotiable instrument that is payable either to bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession.\" \"The holder is the person or entity in possession of the instrument if the instrument is payable to bearer.... When an instrument is endorsed in blank, it becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone ....\" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Equity One, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shivers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20119\">\n    310 Conn. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20A.3d%201225\">\n    74 A.3d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The court concluded, therefore, that because Citibank was the holder of the note, it had proved that it was the owner because \"the note holder is presumed to be the owner of the debt, and unless the presumption is rebutted, may foreclose the mortgage under [General Statutes] \u00a7 49-17.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=157%20Conn.%20App.%20127\">\n    157 Conn.

The court found that the defendant offered no evidence to contradict Nguyen's testimony, which was predicated on his personal knowledge of Nationstar's business records. It disagreed that Citibank was required to produce its business records to support its claim. \"Appellate courts in this state have held that [the evidentiary] burden is satisfied when the mortgagee includes in its submission to the court a sworn affidavit averring that the mortgagee is the holder of the promissory note in question at the time it commenced the action.\"\n   <em>\n    GMAC Mortgage, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415848\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/144/165/#p176\">\n    144 Conn.

The court found that Citibank had standing to prosecute the present action and that the action was not barred by any of the defendant's remaining special defenses. The court, therefore, denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. After hearing appraisal evidence and the amount of debt, the court found that the debt far exceeded the fair market value of the property. It issued a judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of Citibank and set law days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As previously stated, the defendant filed a motion for reargument and reconsideration of his motion to dismiss. The defendant contended that following the hearing on the motion to dismiss and the foreclosure trial, he discovered new evidence to the effect that Citibank was not the owner of the note and debt at issue and had not been for some time. According to the defendant, Wilmington Trust was the owner. The defendant first raised the argument in his posttrial memorandum filed on August 24, 2015, in which he asked the court to take judicial notice of certain public documents that purportedly demonstrated that Wilmington Trust had succeeded Citibank as trustee for the Holders of Bear Stearns Alt-A Trust 2006-6. The court declined to do so, noting that even if it took judicial notice, as requested, the information would not have afforded a basis for dismissing the action. See footnote 15 of this opinion. The defendant also claimed that Wells Fargo Bank was the servicer of the mortgage, not Nationstar, thus calling into question the veracity of Nguyen's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court granted reargument on February 16, 2016, but reserved decision on reconsideration of the motion to dismiss. On May 26, 2016, the court decided to open the record to take further testimony from Nguyen to determine whether Citibank, Wilmington Trust, or some other entity was the trustee of the trust on June 25, 2015, when Nguyen testified at the foreclosure trial;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   whether Nationstar, Wells Fargo, or some other entity was the mortgage servicer for the defendant's mortgage when Nguyen testified; and if an entity other than Nationstar was the mortgage servicer, whether Nguyen was familiar with the books and records of such mortgage servicer at the time of trial and was authorized to testify on its behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court heard further testimony from Nguyen on August 30, 2016. The court issued its decision in a memorandum of decision on February 21, 2017. The court credited Nguyen's testimony and made the following additional findings of fact. Nationstar has been the primary servicer of the mortgage since the beginning of 2014 and was the servicer on June 25, 2015, when Nguyen testified at the foreclosure trial and it continued to be the mortgage servicer. Citibank was the trustee and the holder of the note at the time the foreclosure complaint was served in 2009 and had authority to commence the action. Wilmington Trust became the trustee in 2012, was the trustee on June 25, 2015, and remained the trustee. It also was the holder of the note in June, 2015. Two assignments of the mortgage were admitted into evidence. Citibank assigned it to Nationstar on May 4, 2016, and Nationstar assigned it to Wilmington Trust on March 30, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With respect to the defendant's motion for reconsideration of his motion to dismiss, the court stated that the ground of the defendant's motion for reconsideration was newly discovered evidence. The court cited the controlling law. \"A party who wishes to reargue a decision or order rendered by the court shall, within twenty days from the issuance of notice of the rendition of the decision or order, file a motion to reargue setting forth the decision or order which is the subject of the motion, the name of the judge who rendered it, and the specific grounds for reargument upon which the party relies.\" Practice Book \u00a7 11-12 (a). \"[T]he purpose of\n   reargument is ... to demonstrate to the court that there is some decision or some principle of law which would have a controlling effect, and which has been overlooked, or that there has been a misapprehension of facts....

The court found that the evidence the defendant offered fell short of this standard. In fact, the court stated, the defendant never sought to open the record to introduce evidence that Wilmington Trust was the successor trustee to Citibank. It was the court that ordered further testimony from Nguyen to respond to the issues raised by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court found that the defendant, in his posttrial brief, had represented that he had learned through a Lexis case search and a search of public records that Wilmington Trust had replaced Citibank as the trustee in late 2012.

If the foreclosing party\n   shows that it is a valid holder of the note and can produce the note, it is presumed that the foreclosing party is the rightful owner of the debt. That presumption may be rebutted by the defending party, but the burden is on the defending party to provide sufficient proof that the holder of the note is not the owner of the debt, for example, by showing that ownership of the debt had passed to another party. It is not sufficient to provide that proof, however, merely by pointing to some documentary lacuna in the chain of title that\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   give rise to the possibility that some other party owns the debt.

Our Supreme Court has explained that once raised, either by a party or by the court itself, the question [of subject matter jurisdiction] must be answered before the court may decide the case....

The court heard from counsel as to the bases of the parties' motions, which included multiple discovery issues regarding the production of documents and the parties' failure to comply with the court's standing orders. Thereafter, the court stated: \"Well, I think we're going to proceed because I think we are starting this hearing, we have the motion to dismiss that is still on the table. We are past the point of conducting discovery. I think that based on Judge Povodator's order, it appears the parties were not in compliance with the standing orders and here we are, so we are going forward.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Although counsel for the defendant agreed to go forward with evidence, he repeated his request for the court to order Citibank to produce certain documents. In reply, the court stated: \"I think you had the trial date and the trial was not continued. It had been continued, previously, but not continued in anticipation of any of the discovery that you are looking for now. The motion for protective order was denied. The motion to dismiss has been filed. There's not been a motion to continue the trial, and as I said when we started we're not going to continue the trial because the evidence in the trial will, you know, the plaintiff has the burden of proof, and if the plaintiff doesn't have standing, then the plaintiff can't go forward. So the evidence is going to address your motion as well.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Following trial, the court issued its memorandum of decision on January 7, 2016. In its decision, the court determined that Citibank had standing to pursue the action, which is the principal issue in the present appeal. Although the defendant is correct that a court, generally, is required to determine whether a party has standing before it considers the merits of a case, under the circumstances of the present matter, the timing of the court's determination does not constitute legal error. The evidence that Citibank would have had to present to prove standing was the same evidence that it was required to present to prove its case-in-chief. In 2015, the case had been pending for six years and the parties had been arguing over the production of documents for an extended period of time. Judge Mintz sustained the defendant's objection to Citibank's motion for summary judgment as to liability in order to permit the defendant to conduct discovery. Judge Mintz ordered that Citibank's motion for summary judgment was to be argued on November 17, 2014, but it was not argued on that date or ever. The discovery issue languished until June, 2015, when the case was set down for trial. The defendant could have secured a ruling on the issue of standing by pursuing discovery and arguing the motion for summary judgment on November 17, 2014. Judge Heller noted that the defendant took no action to compel discovery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    On appeal, the defendant has not demonstrated that he was harmed by Judge Heller's decision to hear the motion to dismiss and the plaintiff's case simultaneously. \"When the jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the merits of the case, the court may in its discretion choose to postpone resolution of the jurisdictional question until the parties complete further discovery or, if necessary, a full trial on the merits has occurred.\"\n    <em>\n     Conboy\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145932\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/642/\">\n     292 Conn. 642\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 653 n.16,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20669\">\n     974 A.2d 669\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The trial court is empowered to manage its own docket.
