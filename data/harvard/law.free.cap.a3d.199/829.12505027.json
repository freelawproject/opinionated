Osiris operated through the securities trading platform of plaintiff Interactive Brokers, LLC (Interactive), and plaintiff Kevin Michael Fisher, as an Interactive employee, assisted Osiris in using Interactive's platform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under a consent order, Zuck was determined to have violated securities laws and defrauded investors, and he was ordered to pay restitution of $7,564,273. Defendant Richard Barry (the Receiver) was appointed as receiver for Osiris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the appointment order, the Receiver was permitted to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   immediately take into possession and take title to all real and personal property of [Osiris] ... including ... causes of action and all such assets obtained in the future, and undertake all actions necessary or appropriate to maintain optimal value of these assets, including liquidation of any such assets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To carry out these duties, the Chancery court granted the Receiver \"full statutory powers ... to perform the receiver's duties, including the powers delineated in N.J.S.A. 49:3-69(c)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and (d)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   those set forth in N.J.S.A. 14A:14-1 [to -27] or so far as the provisions thereof are applicable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2017, the Receiver, as the sole claimant acting on behalf of Osiris, filed a Statement of Claim (Statement) against plaintiffs and initiated Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration proceedings. The Statement listed seven causes of action including: 1) negligence and/or failure to supervise; 2) breach of implied/express contract, implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and industry rules; 3) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; 4) aiding and abetting common law fraud; 5) unsuitability; 6) fraudulent conveyance; and 7) unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Receiver asserted plaintiffs were required to resolve any dispute in arbitration under the FINRA Code and pursuant to the Customer Agreement (Agreement) drafted by Interactive and executed by Interactive and Zuck on behalf of Osiris. Section 33.A of the Agreement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Customer [Osiris] agrees that any controversy, dispute, claim, or grievance between [Interactive], any [Interactive] affiliate or any of their shareholders, officers, directors employees, associates, or agents on the one hand, and Customer, or, if applicable, Customer's shareholders, ... on the other hand, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement, or any account(s) established hereunder in which securities may be traded; any transactions therein; any transactions between [Interactive] and [Osiris]; any provision of the Customer Agreement or any other agreement between [Interactive] and [Osiris]; or any breach of such transactions or agreements, shall be resolved by\n   <em>\n    arbitration, in accordance with\n   </em>\n   the rules then prevailing of any one of the following: (a) The American Arbitration Association; (b) [FINRA]; or (c) any other exchange of which [Interactive] is a member, as the true claimant-in-interest may elect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [ (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The FINRA Code mandates that members submit all disputes to FINRA arbitration upon a customer's request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   FINRA\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   12200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, plaintiffs filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Chancery Division seeking: 1) a declaration that the Receiver \"brought claims against [p]laintiffs in an arbitration commenced before [FINRA] that are beyond\" his powers in the appointment order; and 2) \"injunctive relief to prevent the Receiver from continuing ... the FINRA arbitration.\" Plaintiffs alleged the claims were \"beyond the scope of the Receiver's authority\" because the Receiver grounded his claims on the damages incurred by Osiris's investors, rather than Osiris itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Receiver opposed plaintiffs' action and moved to compel arbitration and dismiss\n   the complaint, contending the Agreement and Federal Arbitration Act required plaintiffs to arbitrate with FINRA. The New Jersey Bureau of Securities (Bureau), as amicus curiae, filed a brief in support of the Receiver.\n   After oral argument, the Chancery judge issued a May 16, 2018 written decision and order, denying plaintiffs' application for a preliminary injunction, granting the Receiver's cross-motion to compel FINRA arbitration, and dismissing the complaint. The judge concluded: 1) \"the claims set forth in the Receiver's Statement of Claim [were] brought on behalf of Osiris Fund itself, not Osiris Fund's investors\"; 2) the Receiver's ability to file the Statement of Claim with FINRA was authorized under the trial court's appointment order, N.J.S.A. 49:3-69(c), and N.J.S.A. 14A:14-1 to -27; 3) the Receiver's claims arose from a dispute between Interactive and Osiris, mandating a resolution in arbitration under the Agreement; and 4) the in pari delicto defense plaintiff asserted was grounded in the merits of Receiver's arbitration claims, and therefore required an arbitrator's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs assert the Chancery judge erred in 1) denying its application for preliminary injunction and finding the Receiver's claims belonged to Osiris rather than its investors, and 2) concluding the Receiver's claims were subject to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin with plaintiffs' first argument, and review a trial court's decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Horizon Health Ctr. v.

The Receiver derived his authority from the statutory powers granted him under N.J.S.A. 49:3-69(c) and (d), and N.J.S.A. 14A:14-1 to -27, including the right to institute actions on behalf of Osiris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties cite to federal court precedent addressing a receiver's capacity to redress injuries to the legal entity in receivership.

The Seventh Circuit opined that the corporations created by the Ponzi scheme's operator were \"robotic tools\" but \"nevertheless[,] in the eyes of the law[,] separate legal entities with rights and duties,\" which were used to improperly pay out funds rather than for legitimate investments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308264,11331745\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/750/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308264,11331745\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/750/\">\n    at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court continued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Now that the corporations created and initially controlled by [the operator] are controlled by a receiver whose only object is to maximize the value of the corporations for the benefits of their investors and any creditors, we cannot see an objection to the receiver's bringing suit to recover corporate assets unlawfully dissipated by [the operator].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308264,11331745\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/750/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308264,11331745\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/750/\">\n    at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has also considered a claim that a receiver was not asserting the rights of a receivership entity, but rather asserting the rights of its investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Wuliger v.

Here, the Statement lists Osiris as its sole claimant. The Statement charges plaintiffs with aiding and abetting Zuck in his fraudulent conduct and details their substantial participation in the wrongdoing. These are claims that belong to Osiris, which was harmed when its funds were removed for unauthorized purposes. It is entitled to the return of the unlawfully transferred monies. The Receiver cannot be deprived of standing to pursue Osiris's legal remedies, even if the defrauded investors become the recipients of the recovered assets. As a result, we are satisfied the Chancery judge did not abuse his discretion in denying plaintiffs' preliminary injunction as they failed to demonstrate a \"reasonable probability of ultimate success on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Crowe v.
