The trial court ruled that the Commonwealth failed to present\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of Appellee's specific intent to kill the victim. The Commonwealth argues that it demonstrated Appellee's specific intent to kill under the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   standard based solely on evidence that Appellee had taken a substantial step toward the commission of a first-degree murder. After careful review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court summarized the pertinent factual and procedural history of this case as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 12, 2015, at or about 12:45 a.m., Alex Marsicano was driving past his ex-girlfriend's residence when he noticed [Appellee]'s vehicle.

A confrontation occurred between [Appellee] and Mr. Marsicano when Cheyenne Eberhart, Mr. Marsicano's ex-girlfriend, broke up the fight. [Appellee] then retrieved a gun from his vehicle. [Appellee] fired 3 shots, two shots struck the back of Mr. Marsicano's calves and the third shot missed. [Appellee] then left the scene in his vehicle. Mr. Marsicano contacted a friend who subsequently took him to the hospital.

Thus, a \"conviction for attempted murder requires the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the specific intent to kill and took a substantial step towards that goal.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Blakeney\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088960\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/596/510/\">\n    596 Pa. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088960,4088729,8382171,8382246\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/946/645/\">\n    946 A.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652 (2008). In sum, attempted murder is composed of two primary elements. The\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of the offense is specific intent to kill, which is identical to the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of murder in the first degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   element of the offense is the commission of one or more acts which collectively constitute a substantial step toward the commission of a killing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Instantly, the crux of the Commonwealth's argument is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, [Appellee] went to his vehicle and retrieved a pistol from the glove box of the vehicle and put a clip in the pistol, cocked it and then pointed it at Alexander Marsicano. [Appellee] then fired three shots at Alexander Marsicano as Alexander Marsicano was attempting to run away, striking him in both legs. Under the substantial step test, and focusing on the acts [Appellee] completed, not on the acts that remain for the actual commission of the crime, the trial court erred by concluding that the Commonwealth failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for the charge of [a]ttempted [h]omicide. Based on the actions [Appellee] took, the fact finder could have reasonably found that [Appellee] took a substantial step toward the intentional[ ] killing of Alexander Marsicano.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court determined that the Commonwealth failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case for the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of the offense: specific intent to kill. TCO at 4 (\"Given these facts, we cannot find that [t]he specific intent to kill has been established.\"). That ruling was a direct response to Appellee's\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   motion, wherein the defense had argued that the Commonwealth failed, under the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   standard, to provide evidence of Appellee's specific intent to kill Marsicano, not that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Appellee had taken a substantial step toward killing him. Appellee's\n   <em>\n    Habeas Corpus\n   </em>\n   Motion, 5/16/16, at 2 \u00b6 5 (unnumbered pages).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this context, it is clear that the Commonwealth's argument conflates the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   elements of attempted murder. Unfortunately, the courts of this Commonwealth may have inadvertently prompted such confusion by occasionally utilizing a short-hand definition of the elements of attempted murder:\n   <em>\n    a substantial step toward an intentional killing\n   </em>\n   . One does not commit the crime of attempted murder by taking a substantial step toward forming or possessing the intent to kill, whatever that would mean. A person commits the crime of attempted murder when,\n   <em>\n    while\n   </em>\n   possessing the intent to kill, he or she takes a substantial step toward killing the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, for the purposes of this appeal, it is undisputed that Appellee took a substantial step toward the commission\n   <em>\n    of a killing\n   </em>\n   . As described by the Commonwealth,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [t]he finder of fact could reasonably find that aiming a gun at the victim initially at chest to face level, the victim having to turn to run away when [Appellee] drew his firearm, [Appellee's] firing three shots at the victim, [and] the victim having been shot twice in the calf, establishes that [Appellee] took a substantial step toward the intentional[ ] killing of Alexander Marsicano.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 18. The problematic portion of the Commonwealth's argument is the placement of the term,\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   , immediately preceding the term\n   <em>\n    killing\n   </em>\n   . Again, the crime of attempted murder occurs when \"the defendant had the specific intent to kill\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   took a substantial step towards that goal.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Blakeney\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088960,4088729,8382171,8382246\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/946/645/\">\n    946 A.2d at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, the Commonwealth only describes its proof of the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   element of attempted murder, and then summarily concludes that the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element naturally follows from the proof of the former. Absent invocation of a relevant presumption of law, as discussed below, or some relevant analysis of the manner in which the circumstantial evidence (including, but not limited to, the acts which satisfy the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   element), this argument is wholly unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Commonwealth cites\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

However, our decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   involved the substantial step test,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of the offense of attempted murder, not the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element, further demonstrating the Commonwealth's conflation of the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   elements of attempted murder in this case, or its misunderstanding of the basis for the trial court's ruling under review.

Here, the facts themselves are not in serious dispute. The core issue is whether the reasonable inferences derived from those facts would permit a jury to conclude that Appellee possessed the specific intent to kill. More specifically, the question is whether the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence produced by the Commonwealth could give rise to a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   inference that Appellee intended to kill Marsicano.

However, the courts of this Commonwealth have established some touchstones to guide us with respect to intent-to-kill jurisprudence. For instance, it is axiomatic that \"[s]pecific intent to kill\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim's body.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

More specifically, the \"use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital organ of another human being justifies a factual presumption that the actor intended death unless the testimony contains additional evidence that would demonstrate a contrary intent.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cross\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the victim escaped grave harm only by an intervening metal car door. Here, the Commonwealth offers no theory regarding why Appellee would shoot Marsicano in the lower leg if he had formed the intent to kill. In the narrow factual circumstances of this case, poor aim is not a reasonable inference.

The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court first rejected the notion that the deadly-weapon/vital-body-part presumption cannot arise unless a vital organ is struck, instead concluding that the \"firing of a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     bullet in the general area in which vital organs are located\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   can in and of itself be sufficient to prove specific intent to kill beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1368 (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

In this regard, the Commonwealth essentially asks this Court to ignore: the victim's unprovoked instigation of a confrontation with the new boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend, the complete lack of any verbal expression of intent to kill by Appellee despite the scuffle that occurred before the shooting, and the near impossibility of Appellee's missing any area near a vital portion of the victim's body from the range at which he fired, but for an intent to scare or harm that fell short of specific intent to kill. To ask a jury to find that Appellee possessed the specific intent to kill in these circumstances is tantamount to asking them to rest a verdict on mere speculation or conjecture that Appellee just happens to be the world's worst shot, or that the victim only escaped more serious injury due to divine intervention.

I agree. The sole issue presented here challenges the trial court's determination that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of Appellee's specific intent to kill. I conclude the Commonwealth presented more than enough\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of specific intent to kill to allow the charge of attempted criminal homicide to proceed to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence adduced during\n   the preliminary hearing and before the trial court established the following. Prior to December 12, 2015, animosity existed between Marsicano and Appellee based upon Marsicano's belief that Appellee had been communicating with Eberhart while Marsicano and she were dating. On December 12, 2015, at or about 12:45 a.m., Marsicano was driving past Eberhart's residence when he noticed Appellee's truck parked outside her apartment. He turned off the highway and stopped his vehicle in the parking lot next to Appellee's truck outside Eberhart's apartment. Appellee was visiting Eberhart at the time. Despite Eberhart complaining about Marsicano harassing her prior to this time and securing a PFA order against him, Marsicano proceeded to call Eberhart while she was in her apartment with Appellee. Given the acrimonious history between Marsicano and Appellee and Appellee's belief that Marsicano was outside Eberhart's apartment, Appellee went to the parking lot outside Eberhart's apartment and found Marsicano in the parking lot next to his truck. A fistfight eventually ensued between Appellee and Marsicano because Appellee believed the victim was trying to harass Eberhart who was then his girlfriend. The two men began quarreling and exchanging shoves and punches. Eberhart arrived and managed to step in between them and break up the fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Instead of ceasing hostilities, Appellee intentionally and purposefully went to his truck to procure a gun with the intent of firing it at Marsicano. Thereafter, Appellee walked over to his truck, opened the door, retrieved a gun from the glove compartment, loaded the gun, cocked it, turned toward Marsicano and pointed the gun at his face to chest to level. According to Marsicano, he was several feet away from Appellee when Appellee pointed his gun at his face and chest before firing three shots at him. At this point, Marsicano stated that he feared for his life. According to Eberhart, Marsicano grabbed Appellee's arms and while the gun was flailing in the air, Appellee warned Marsicano that the gun was loaded. Not taking heed, Marsicano taunted Appellee to go ahead and shoot him. Appellee fired three shots. The first hit the pavement. The second and third hit Marsicano in his left and right calves while he was attempting to run away from Appellee, thus evidencing that the second and third shots were not meant to scare, but to harm the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Unlike the trial court and Majority, I conclude that the Commonwealth submitted ample\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of a specific intent by Appellee to kill Marsicano. The\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of Appellee's specific intent to kill had its origins in the acrimony between Marsicano and Appellee that existed prior to the date in question. This pre-existing acrimony evolved into a fistfight on the night in question. As the evidence indicates, after the fight, Appellee went to his truck to retrieve his gun, loaded and cocked it, and then pointed it at Marsicano's face and chest, sufficiently evidencing a specific intent to kill. Marsicano told trooper Kowalski that he feared for his life when Appellee pointed the gun at him. \"A gun is a lethal weapon; pointing it towards a person, and then discharging it, speaks volumes as to one's intention.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The Majority briefly mentions these acts in its summary of the facts, Majority Op. at 929, but fails to construe them in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Thus, the Commonwealth presented sufficient facts to establish\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of a specific intent to kill by Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In its opinion disposing of Appellee's motion for\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   relief, the trial court concluded that the Commonwealth did not establish a specific intent to kill for the crime of attempted murder. The trial court arrived at this conclusion relying upon case law that \"a specific intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly force upon a vital part of the human body.\" Trial Court Opinion, 12/12/16 at p. 3-4, citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Geathers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , 847 A.2d at 737 (citation omitted in original). From this, the trial court concluded that since the lower legs are not a vital part of the body and Marsicano was shot in his calves below the knee, it could not find any specific intent to kill had been established.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 4. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The statement that a specific intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly force upon a vital part of the human body is merely a presumption of fact that permits a jury to find intent from the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

This presumption arises from the fact that it is common knowledge that such a use is likely to cause death and therefore, entitles a jury to infer that the intent of a person using such a weapon in such a manner was to kill.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Nonetheless, as the Majority correctly recognizes,\n   <em>\n    the absence of the use of a deadly weapon against a vital part of a victim's body does not preclude a finding of intent to kill, it only precludes the use of the presumption\n   </em>\n   .

The trial court committed error by incorrectly concluding that, if a deadly weapon was not used against a vital part of a victim's body, no specific intent to kill for attempted murder may be inferred. The trial court failed to recognize that the intent to kill from use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of a victim's body is merely a factual presumption that does not preclude proving specific intent otherwise. Moreover, the trial court had an obligation to examine the entire\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence offered by the Commonwealth before determining whether a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case had been established for attempted murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Majority faults the Commonwealth for only addressing the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of attempted murder and not the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   , or specific intent, which is the issue in this case. The Majority states that the Commonwealth only describes its proof of the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of attempted murder, and then improperly and summarily concludes, absent invocation of a relevant presumption, that the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   naturally flows from proof of the former. Majority Opinion at 930. Respectfully, I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In its brief, the Commonwealth points to\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence wherein Appellee went to his vehicle, retrieved a pistol from the glove box, put a clip in the pistol, cocked it and then pointed it at Marsicano. Commonwealth's Brief at 16. The Commonwealth notes Appellee then fired three shots at the victim while he was attempting to run away, striking him in both legs.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20398\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   From this, the Commonwealth argues that the factfinder could reasonably find that Appellee took a\n   <em>\n    substantial step toward the intentional killing\n   </em>\n   of Marsicano.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20398\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   While it is true, as the Majority notes, that the juxtaposition of a \"substantial step\" and \"intentional killing\" in the text of the Commonwealth's brief suggests some confusion, it seems clear from the Commonwealth's brief that it is arguing its\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence was sufficient to satisfy both the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of attempted murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In the absence of a presumption, it is necessary to discuss substantial step evidence as that may bear upon proof of a\n   specific intent to kill. An act is a substantial step if it is a major step towards the commission of a crime and strongly corroborates a jury's belief that a person, at the time they did the act, had a firm intent to commit that crime.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Geathers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ; Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Criminal Jury Instructions \u00a7 12.901a.1. Therefore, to connect the specific intent and a substantial step in the crime of attempted murder, by necessity, there must be a showing as to how the substantial step relates to specific intent.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Geathers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (specific intent to kill proven where defendant and victim had a verbal altercation, the situation calmed, defendant left the scene and returned with a gun, defendant shot at victim but missed, victim ran and defendant shot two more times, victim ran down the street and defendant shot again striking left side of victim's head). I, therefore, would not fault the Commonwealth for summarily discussing all of its\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence to establish the required specific intent to kill. As explained in greater detail,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence offered by the Commonwealth in fact was much more than that briefly described above from its brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On the merits of establishing a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of specific intent, the Majority concludes that it is not reasonable to infer that the Commonwealth produced evidence of a specific intent to kill for three reasons. First, the victim, Marsicano, instigated a confrontation with Appellee over his ex-girlfriend, Eberhart. Second, there was a complete lack of any verbal expression of intent to kill by Appellee despite the scuffle that occurred before the shooting. Third, the near impossibility of Appellee missing any area or vital portion of the victim's body from the range at which he fired, but for an intent to scare or harm, fell short of a specific intent to kill. Majority Opinion at 934.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In my opinion, the Majority errs in its analysis both by weighing the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence and by repeatedly interpreting this evidence in a light more favorable to Appellee than, as required, to the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As for its first reason for not finding specific intent to kill, the Majority labels this event \"an unprovoked instigation [by the victim] of a confrontation with [Appellee]\" to argue against specific intent. Majority Opinion, at 934. The Majority blames the victim for causing the fight-and by so doing, lays the foundation for suggesting that the victim brought the shooting on himself. It is simply wrong, however, for the Majority to take this position, given the principle that we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. While a jury might conclude that the victim instigated the fight, we are required at this stage of the proceeding to conclude that Appellee instigated the fight by storming outside Eberhart's residence to confront the victim. The evidence could solidly support this inference. The assertion that the victim instigated the confrontation falls flat when the evidence is construed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Blaming the victim for starting the fight is tantamount to interpreting and weighing the evidence in a light most favorable to Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As for its second reason for not finding specific intent to kill, referencing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Cross\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"816692\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/231/148/\">\n    231 Pa.Super. 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=331%20A.2d%20813\">\n    331 A.2d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), the Majority faults the Commonwealth for not proffering any evidence that Appellee verbally indicated, directly or indirectly, his intent to kill Marsicano. In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cross\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , a bullet penetrated the outer panel of a car door at a height near the stomach of the victim. The evidence demonstrated a long-standing feud between the defendant and the victim's brother. Immediately prior to shooting, the\n   defendant yelled to the victim, \"[t]his is for your brother.\" While the verbalization in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cross\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   may well have supported a specific intent to kill, this Court in no way suggested that an express verbal threat was a prerequisite to establishing a specific intent to kill. The verbalization was merely part of the evidence offered to prove specific intent in that case. The Majority's criticism that the Commonwealth did not offer any other circumstantial evidence to prove a specific intent to kill is simply not in accord with the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence offered by the Commonwealth when viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As for its last reason, the Majority posits that specific intent to kill is absent in this case, because \"the near impossibility of Appellee missing any area or vital portion of the victim's body from the range at which he fired, but for an intent to scare or harm that fell short of a specific intent to kill.\" Once again, the Majority deprives the Commonwealth of its evidence viewed in the best light. A jury must decide whether intent to kill is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This Court does not have that prerogative when reviewing whether a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case has been established. The evidence produced before the trial court suggests that the events here were violent, highly emotional and rapidly unfolding. The victim was attempting to flee at the time the shots were fired, arguably while Appellee did not have complete control over his gun having fired it immediately after the victim grabbed his arms before attempting to flee. A jury could conclude that under these fraught circumstances, the victim escaped death because of Appellee's poor aim at the time, and not because of a lack of intent to kill the victim, especially under circumstances where the victim was taunting Appellee to shoot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Nor do I believe the Majority considers the shooting evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth by viewing the first shot into the ground as merely intending to scare the victim. Here, the evidence can be viewed far differently. Appellee fired a second and a third shot at close range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both struck the victim, thereby evidencing an intent not to scare, but to harm. If it was Appellee's initial intention just to scare, his subsequent shots certainly go far to dispelling that notion, as they were aimed at and hit the victim's body. It is impermissible to infer under these facts that Appellee only wanted to cause fright. A gun is designed to kill.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hall\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Appellee aimed his gun at the victim's body. The question as to whether the discharge of Appellee's gun evidenced a specific intent to kill is a question for the jury, not one for the trial court or this Court upon review of the Commonwealth\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would reverse the order dismissing the charge of attempted murder and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   DISSENTING OPINION BY McLAUGHLIN, J.:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   I respectfully dissent. Although the evidence in this case is conflicting, I believe a reasonable jury could reconcile the conflicts and conclude that the evidence establishes that Steven Predmore committed\n   the crime of attempted murder. I therefore disagree with my learned colleagues in the Majority, and would reverse the trial court's order dismissing the charge of attempted murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Respectfully, I believe the Majority misapprehends the Commonwealth's argument. The majority characterizes the Commonwealth's brief as contending that the Commonwealth made out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of attempted murder \"based solely on evidence that Appellee had taken a substantial step toward the commission of a first-degree murder.\" Majority Opin. at 927. The Majority then explains that mere evidence of a substantial step toward the killing is insufficient; rather, to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of attempted murder, the Commonwealth must also present evidence establishing that the defendant possessed the specific intent to kill.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 929.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As I understand the Commonwealth's argument, it does not omit the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element. Rather, the Commonwealth contends that \"[t]he finder of fact could reasonably find that ... the defendant took a substantial step toward the intentional[ ] killing....\" Com. Substituted Br. at 18. Although perhaps inartfully stated, its point is that it presented a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case because a reasonable jury could find not only that Predmore took a substantial step toward murdering the victim, but also that he possessed the specific intent to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   When I review the evidence, I agree with the Commonwealth that it presented a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case. The Commonwealth maintains that the testimony that Predmore aimed the gun at the victim at chest-to-face level, the victim started to run when he saw the firearm, and Predmore's subsequent shooting of the gun, in combination, all establish not only that Predmore took a substantial step toward the killing, but also that Predmore possessed the specific intent to kill. Com. Substituted Br. at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Majority may be correct that the Commonwealth does not make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of specific intent to kill if the evidence is that the defendant shot the victim in the calf while two-to-three feet away from the victim. Here, however, that is not the extent of the evidence. As the Commonwealth points out, the victim testified that before Predmore shot him, Predmore aimed the gun at him at \"chest to face level\"; the victim also testified that he started to run when he saw the firearm. N.T., 1/8/16, at 13, 24. In addition, eyewitness Cheyenne Eberhart said that Predmore and the victim struggled for the firearm just before the shooting, and that the two men were five feet apart when Predmore fired the weapon.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Although the victim said Predmore was two to three feet away from him when he fired the gun,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 12-13, I believe we must accept the greater distance as being true, for purposes of our review. Certainly, as the majority notes, in the typical case the shorter distance would favor the Commonwealth's attempts at establishing specific intent to kill. In this case, however, I consider the slightly longer distance of five feet to be the appropriate distance for us to consider, as the greater the distance, the more likely it is that the defendant intended to shoot the victim in a vital bodily part but simply missed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The evidence of such a scenario - Predmore's aiming of the gun at vital parts of the victim's body, the struggle for the weapon, the victim's running, and a distance between Predmore and the victim - states a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of attempted murder. Predmore's aiming of the gun at the victim and his firing it at the victim demonstrate the specific intent to kill, while the struggle, flight, and distance would have affected Predmore's accuracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Together, these factors raise an inference that he intended to kill the victim and tried to do so, but simply failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Majority reaches a different conclusion based on three things: \"the victim's unprovoked instigation of a confrontation\"; the \"lack of any verbal expression of intent to kill\"; and \"the near impossibility of Appellee's missing any area near a vital portion of the victim's body from the range at which he fired....\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Respectfully, I believe the Majority's approach is improper because it both holds the Commonwealth to a greater burden than it must carry at this juncture, and involves the weighing of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   At this stage, the Commonwealth must merely \"produce[ ] evidence of each of the material elements of the crime charged and establish[ ] sufficient probable cause to warrant the belief that the accused committed the offense.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

It is not clear which fact adheres to the rule that we must construe the facts in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Generally speaking, the Commonwealth will prefer an accounting of the facts that suggests a shooter fired from the closest possible range when seeking to prove his or her intent to kill, as the Commonwealth will argue that the close proximity itself demonstrates the required intent; yet, if the shot is fired from a greater distance, the Commonwealth seeking to prove the same intent will inevitably argue that the shooter's failure to cause more damage is a result of his poor aim, rather than the absence of his intent to kill. Which fact is more 'favorable' to the Commonwealth is more of a philosophical question than a factual one. Thankfully, we need not tread into that philosophical quagmire in the circumstances of this case, as the difference in distance is negligible as it pertains to our analysis. The notion that Appellee's intent to kill is demonstrated if he fired from 5 feet away, but not from 3 feet away, is not a reasonable one. In either case, it is clear that the evidence cannot sustain the unreasonable inference that Appellee was aiming his weapon with the intent to inflict lethal damage. Moreover, Eberhart testified that Appellee fired the first shot\n    <em>\n     at the pavement\n    </em>\n    , casting further doubt as to which witness's version of events is more favorable to the Commonwealth.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    at 33-35.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    \"Criminal Homicide\" is classified as murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2501(b).
