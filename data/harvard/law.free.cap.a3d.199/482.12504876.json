(Employer) petitions this Court for review of the Workers' Compensation (WC) Appeal Board's (Board) November 14, 2017 order affirming the Workers' Compensation Judge's (WCJ) decision granting Bernice Jeffers' (Claimant) Fatal Claim Petition filed on behalf of her deceased husband Jermon Jeffers (Decedent) and awarding their daughter Janice Jeffers (Janice) dependent benefits. Employer essentially presents one issue for this Court's review: whether the WCJ's finding that Janice had a disability was supported by substantial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After review, we vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 27, 2015, Decedent was fatally injured in a tractor-trailer accident that occurred while he was in the course and scope of his work for Employer. At that time of his death, Decedent was married to Claimant. Their daughter, Janice, who was then 17 years old, suffered from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an incurable, progressive eye disease that substantially impaired her peripheral vision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 7, 2015, Employer filed a Notice of Temporary Compensation Payable (NTCP) and began paying Claimant WC benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 11, 2015, Claimant filed a Fatal Claim Petition (Petition) for death benefits, therein representing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : \"Daughter, Janice [ ], is disabled and dependent, and compensation shall continue.\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 5a.

On December 8, 2016, the WCJ granted the Petition \"with respect to ... Jani[ce's] ... entitlement to dependency benefits\" which \"shall continue beyond the age of 18 until such time as Employer meets its burden of proving that [Janice is] capable of self-support.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 138a (WCJ Dec. at 12).

Thus, as a matter of law, Janice was entitled to dependent death benefits until she turned 18 years of age on March 15, 2016. Thereafter, in order for Janice to be eligible for such benefits, Claimant had to prove either Janice was a full-time student, or dependent because of a disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Employer argues that the WCJ's finding that Janice was disabled by her RP was not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, Employer avers that Claimant \"only proved that [Janice] has a diagnosis[,] but [ ] failed to prove an actual disability\" that would justify continued dependent benefits for Janice after she turned 18, given that her vision remains largely intact and has not resulted in functional deficits.

Claimant described that, over time, the RP has resulted in Janice losing her peripheral vision, and has caused her eyes to be slow to adjust from light to dark and dark to light environments. She related that, because Janice cannot see things around her, Claimant must guide Janice to keep her from bumping into things, falling down steps and getting hurt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Claimant articulated that Janice was a senior at a public high school, and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [s]he's able to get around and everything by herself, but the doctor has been in touch with the school nurse that any of her teachers that have ... the blinds open and things like that [sic] so she can see the board.

Claimant reported that Janice is not involved in any other school activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Claimant recalled that Moore Eye Institute ophthalmologist and vitreoretinal surgeon Ravi D. Patel, M.D. (Dr. Patel) has been treating Janice for approximately one year as of the hearing date. She stated that Dr. Patel tests Janice every six months to determine whether the RP has worsened. Claimant explained that Janice must conduct weekly self-examinations to detect whether bleeding associated with peripheral vision loss (which would lead to permanent scarring) is occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Claimant also presented Dr. Patel's December 29, 2015 deposition testimony that Janice has RP, which is a rare, hereditary genetic disease of the retina that limits peripheral vision. He described that, \"the younger it presents, the more severe it is[,]\" R.R. at 41a, being both aggressive and progressive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 42a, 53a. Dr. Patel expressed that Janice's condition is \"a young presentation.\" R.R. at 41a. He explained that RP progressive \"degeneration ... starts peripherally and works its way centrally,\" R.R. at 41a, and will cause one's visual field to constrict more and more to the point of tunnel vision, \"and [then the] tunnel aperture over time gets smaller and smaller and smaller.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 42a. Dr. Patel reported that total blindness from RP is rare, and that most people are \"able to at least maintain a pinhole.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 42a;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 54a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Patel further detailed that RP affects night vision, or dark adaptation, which is the adjustment between different lighting environments, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   So when you go from a very lighted area to a dark area, even though the patient has that central vision, when the lights are off, essentially [the patient has] no vision because of the rods being destroyed in [RP]. And the peripheral rods that we have in our retina help us with our night vision. If you don't have that, even though you're functional, your central retina is attacked, not having those peripheral rods comp[romises] your night vision and your central vision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   R.R. at 42a-43a. He stated that it is difficult for individuals with this problem \"to drive or to do any kind of really daily function without proper lighting.\" R.R. at 43a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dr. Patel demonstrated that Janice's RP has severely restricted her visual field to the point where she has vision only just beyond the sides of her face, to about her shoulders (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a 20-degree visual field on each side).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 43a;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 68a-69a (Janice's test results). He declared that, although Janice's testing over the past year did not change, a larger time sample is necessary because there is a \"very high, if not certain correlation,\" R.R. at 53a, \"given [Janice's] early presentation, [that] she ... will have deterioration as she gets older[,]\" although \"how likely and how fast it is, [ ] is very difficult to determine.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 49a;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 53a. He asserted that there is no cure for RP, no surgery that can better Janice's RP, and although visual rehabilitation therapy \"can help with magnification for near\n   work, [ ] it will never expand her visual field.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 44a;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 55a. In his October 16, 2015 letter to Claimant's counsel, Dr. Patel classified Janice's long-term prognosis as \"guarded.\" R.R. at 60a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Patel pronounced that Janice cannot legally drive, and she is having difficulty seeing writing on whiteboards and overhead projectors at school if the lights are off.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 50a.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. Because of their constricted vision field, she can't see where she steps when she looks down and especially in a darker environment when her functional central vision is compromised. So even though she has 40 degrees of total field, in a darker environment that diminishes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. So the vision that she does have is compromised by this difficulty in adjusting from light to dark or dark to light, in addition to the fact that she doesn't have a wide visual field?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. So it's not as though her tunneled vision is perfect vision; it's still affected by the difficulties with light, dark and adjustment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Correct. Just because she's 20/30 doesn't mean she's 20/30 all the time. It gets compromised with different lighting environments. Especially, it gets severely compromised when she's in total darkness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. And going from indoors to outdoors, like from bright light to darker light?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Yeah, it takes her time to adjust. It takes her about 90 seconds to 3 minutes to adjust. So that 20/30 acuity, that sharp acuity she may have centrally is always in flux based off of ambient light.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. And when you say takes time to adjust, what is her vision like while it's adjusting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. It's below 20/30. I mean, that is the hard place and difficult to say exactly what it is, but it's not 20/30.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q. And so it's greater compromised?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. Yeah, correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   R.R. at 56a-57a. Dr. Patel concluded to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, based upon Janice's history and his August 14 and 28, 2014 and February 26 and August 17, 2015 examinations and testing, that \"[Janice] is disabled[,]\" and \"she is not able to [ ]support herself\" as a result. R.R. at 44a;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 40a, 57a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Employer offered the April 1, 2016 deposition testimony of ophthalmologist and oculoplastic surgeon Edward H. Bedrossian, Jr., M.D., F.A.C.S.

Dr. Bedrossian acknowledged that RP is rare, and that \"there's no way to predict whether it's going to stop. She can be the way she is now for the rest of her\n   life or it can progress. There's really no way of knowing, so she needs surveillance[,]\" every six months. R.R. at 92a;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 101a. However, he acknowledged that since Janice's RP presented at such a young age, her peripheral vision loss could eventually leave her with only pinpoint vision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 103a-104a, 107a. Like Dr. Patel, in his independent medical report to Employer's counsel, he categorized Janice's prognosis as \"guarded.\" R.R. at 126a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dr. Bedrossian observed Janice move around his examination room without assistive devices, and admitted Janice was \"more comfortable with her mother helping guide her out through the doorways and to the office.\" R.R. at 96a. He stated that Janice could not drive, be on a ladder or safely play sports, but she can read and could do a job that did not require her to drive or use her peripheral vision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 98a. He agreed that peripheral vision loss and night vision problems add to an RP sufferer's difficulty conducting activities of daily living without someone to direct them, but stated that Janice's condition will not prevent her from attending college or working.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 106a, 108a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"A determination of dependency is a question of fact within the province of the [WC] authorities.\"\n   <em>\n    Grimm by Grimm v.
