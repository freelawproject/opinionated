Gagne appeals from an order to enforce payment of restitution entered by the Superior Court (Kennebec County,\n   <em>\n    Stokes, J.\n   </em>\n   ) following a hearing on a motion to enforce payment of a restitution obligation originally imposed as part of a 2003 sentence imposed by the court (\n   <em>\n    Studstrup, J\n   </em>\n   .). Because the motion court erred in imposing the burden on Gagne to prove the current balance of the court-ordered restitution for the victim's uncompensated losses-information more accessible to the State because it relates to or is available from the victim of the crime-we vacate and remand for a further hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. CASE HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] The relevant facts are drawn from the docket entries, the trial court's file and the record of the motion hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] On October 10, 2002, Gagne waived indictment and was charged by information with theft by deception (Class B), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 354(1), (2)(A) (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maine Pulp and Paper Association (MPPA), Gagne's employer, was identified as the victim of the theft. Gagne initially pleaded not guilty, but on October 30, 2002, she changed her plea to guilty of the Class B theft, with the case continued for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] Following her plea, but prior to sentencing, Gagne and her husband, as part of an effort to compensate MPPA for losses occasioned by the theft, granted mortgages to MPPA on properties they owned located in Augusta, Gardiner, and Pittston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] Sentencing occurred on February 6, 2003. On Gagne's plea of guilty to theft by deception (Class B), the court sentenced Gagne to the Department of Corrections for a term of seven years, with all but thirty months suspended, to be followed by probation for a term of four years. As part of the judgment, Gagne was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $400,000. Gagne's conditions of probation separately required that she pay a \"maximum\" amount of restitution of $400,000 for the benefit of MPPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] In March 2009, around the time when Gagne's term of probation would have been scheduled to end, the State filed a motion to revoke Gagne's probation because the ordered restitution had not been paid in full. Following a hearing on December 10, 2009, the court (\n   <em>\n    Mills, J\n   </em>\n   .) denied the motion. The facts related to the 2009 hearing are addressed in the 2017 motion court's findings, stated below. The record does not indicate that Gagne's term of probation was extended beyond its scheduled expiration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b67] In June 2016, the State filed a motion to enforce payment of restitution. In January 2017, Gagne filed a motion to dismiss the motion to enforce. The grounds for the motion to dismiss were (1) res judicata based on the 2009 denial of the motion to revoke probation for nonpayment of restitution and (2) the early 2017 dissolution of MPPA. The motions were\n   heard on April 28, 2017, and decided by an opinion (\n   <em>\n    Stokes, J.\n   </em>\n   ) dated May 4, 2017. In that decision, the court ordered Gagne to pay $200 per month beginning in May and indicated that a further hearing would be scheduled for June to determine the amount of any credit to be given to Gagne for any funds recovered by MPPA from insurance or foreclosure of the three mortgages given by Gagne and her husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b68] Gagne filed an appeal from the May 4, 2017, order. We dismissed that appeal as interlocutory because the order contained a footnote stating that the court had \"scheduled a follow-up hearing\" in case there was a \"need to take additional evidence relevant to the issue of whether the victim has received compensation from a collateral source or has received any proceeds from the mortgaged real estate.\" After remand, however, the motion court indicated that its decision was final and that no further hearing would be scheduled. In April 2018, Gagne filed a timely notice of appeal from the motion court's final order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 2A, 2B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b69] The relevant facts are outlined in the following findings of fact stated by the motion court.

As a condition of her probation, [Gagne] was ordered to pay restitution in the \"maximum\" amount of $400,000 for the benefit of the named victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In his letter to the sentencing court, [MPPA's attorney] requested restitution for his client in the amount of $367,400, which represented the claimed theft of $400,000 minus payments already made by [Gagne] to MPPA of $32,600. The State sought an identical amount of restitution. State's Exhibit 1 admitted at the hearing on April 28, 2017, reflects restitution payments made by [Gagne] while incarcerated and/or on probation totaling $15,317.39.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The court finds that the $400,000 restitution amount made part of [Gagne's] judgment and her probation, was intended to be a maximum amount before application of any cash payments made by [her] to the victim. Accordingly, the court further finds that [Gagne] has made cash payments totaling $47,917.39 ($32,600 + $15,317.39), leaving a balance of $352,082.61 prior to the application of any other credits to which [Gagne] may be entitled as discussed below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In his letter to the sentencing court dated January 29, 2003, [MPPA's attorney] made reference to three (3) properties owned by [Gagne] in the central Maine area as to which [Gagne] (and apparently her husband) granted the victim mortgages. At the hearing on April 28, 2017, [Gagne] offered into evidence Defendant's Exhibits 1, 2 and 3 being recorded mortgage deeds on real estate in Pittston, Augusta and Gardiner, respectively, each dated January 31, 2003. [Gagne] testified that neither she nor her husband had any further ownership interest in these properties, and she had no knowledge or information about the properties at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Gagne] also raised the possibility that MPPA may have received an insurance settlement as a result of [Gagne's] employee theft, but no details of any such payment was provided to the court. During a hearing on the State's Motion to Revoke [Gagne's] Probation held on December 10, 2009 (Mills, J.), [Gagne] presented several letters her counsel had sent to [MPPA's attorney] in 2009 seeking\n   information regarding any insurance payments and/or any proceeds obtained from the foreclosure of the 3 properties that were the subject of the mortgage deeds identified as Defendant's Exhibits 1, 2 and 3.... According to counsel for [Gagne], [MPPA's attorney] did not provide any information regarding insurance payments or any proceeds from the three parcels of real estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ... [Gagne's] obligation to make restitution was part of the sentencing judgment, in addition to being a condition of her probation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1326-A, 1326-F and 1329.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ... [Gagne] argues[ ] there is no longer a victim for whose benefit restitution must be paid. The Maine Criminal Code does not appear to clearly address this issue. Nevertheless, the court concludes that the corporation's entitlement to restitution from [Gagne] is an asset of the corporation and the directors of the corporation, as liquidating trustees, have the authority to dispose of any undistributed property of the corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   13-B M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1111(2) and 1104(1)(D) &amp; (2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ... The court agrees that it is the State's initial burden of proving \"the extent of the victim's loss.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Berube\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12007748\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/698/509/\">\n    1997 ME 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12007748\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/698/509/\">\n    698 A.2d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On that issue, the State has satisfied its burden. In the court's view,\n   <em>\n    it is [Gagne's] burden to present evidence that she should be credited with additional amounts that may have been subsequently paid to the victim from a collateral source or from the sale of the three parcels of mortgaged real estate.\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added.) [After this sentence, the court added a footnote stating that a \"follow-up hearing\" was set for June 30, 2017, \"if there is a need to take additional evidence relevant to the issue of whether [MPPA] has received compensation from a collateral source or has received any proceeds from the mortgaged real estate.\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   During her testimony on April 28, 2017, [Gagne] stated that based on her current income and financial resources she has the ability to pay $200 per month towards restitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the court finds that [Gagne] is in default of her obligation to make restitution and further finds that the default was not inexcusable. IT IS ORDERED, that [Gagne] shall pay restitution for the benefit of the victim as follows: up to the amount of $352,082.61 in payments of $200 per month beginning in May, 2017, to be paid to the Office of the District Attorney ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b610] Gagne contends that the motion court's conclusion that she was in default of her obligation to pay restitution was error for four reasons: (1) the court's 2009 ruling denying the State's motion to revoke Gagne's probation stands as res judicata on the issue of default; (2) 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1326-F (2017) does not apply because it was not in effect when the offense was committed during the years of 1997-2002; (3) the restitution order is not enforceable because MPPA has been dissolved; and (4) the court was not presented with sufficient evidence to conclude that any amount of restitution remained unpaid and, if so, in what amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.

Although there was a final judgment entered in the prior proceeding in this action that involved the same parties, the issue litigated was whether Gagne had violated conditions of probation. The Superior Court's action on the probation revocation motion did not address or otherwise affect the stand-alone restitution provision in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b614] As the legislative history of the probation laws indicates, the denial of the motion to revoke probation did not terminate Gagne's obligation to pay restitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm.

Application of Section 1326-F\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b616] Gagne further contends that the court erred by applying section 1326-F, which provides that \"[a]n offender is responsible for paying any restitution at the time the term of commitment to the Department of Corrections or period of probation is completed,\" and that because section 1326-F had not yet taken effect at the time of Gagne's offense, we should assume that the restitution provision of the judgment terminated upon her discharge from probation or Department of Corrections supervision. We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778174\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/145/1046/\">\n    2016 ME 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778174\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/145/1046/\">\n    145 A.3d 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b617] Section 1326-F did not take effect until 2010-seven years after Gagne's conviction and eight years after the commission of the crime ended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P.L. 2009, ch. 608, \u00a7 14 (effective July 12, 2010). The legislative history of the restitution statutes provides guidance to determine whether section 1326-F could be applied in the present case. The summary accompanying the legislative document from which section 1326-F was drawn states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The bill enacts a new section that comprehensively addresses the situation in which an offender who has completed the term of commitment to the Department of Corrections or the period of probation still has not paid the restitution ordered by the court in full. It provides notice to former Department of Corrections' clients still owing restitution that the duty to pay remains; requires that monetary compensation continue to be paid to the Department of\n   Corrections; and requires that, unless otherwise modified by the court, the time and method of payment determined by the Department of Corrections during the former term of commitment or period of probation continues to control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   L.D. 1789, Summary (124th Legis. 2010). We construe section 1326-F to confirm the then-existing continuing obligation to pay the restitution required by the judgment, to provide clarity to the then-existing practice, and to add the requirement of notice to obligors of their obligations. The adoption of section 1326-F did not operate to terminate obligations to pay restitution imposed prior to its enactment.\n   <em>\n    C.f.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12059051\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/447/797/#p799\">\n    447 A.2d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he power to reduce an offender's sentence on the basis of his post-conviction behavior is not part of the traditional judicial power; rather, it is encompassed within the executive commutation power.\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   C. Effect of Dissolution of MPPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b618] At the hearing, Gagne presented evidence that, in early 2017, MPPA filed Articles of Dissolution with the Maine Secretary of State. Gagne asserts that the restitution order is now unenforceable because there no longer exists a victim to be made whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b619] \"We examine [the restitution statutes] in the context of the entire statutory scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Kendall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12195125\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1230/\">\n    2016 ME 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12195125\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1230/\">\n    148 A.3d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Maine's restitution statutes are silent on the enforceability of an order of restitution owed to a corporate entity that is dissolved after the issuance of the order. As those statutes apply to other kinds of post-judgment changes in circumstances affecting the victim of a crime, however, they are explicit. If a victim who is a natural person dies after the court issues a restitution order, the State must forward restitution payments to the victim's estate. 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1326-C (2017). If the victim's location becomes unascertainable after the restitution order is issued, the restitution payments must be forwarded to the State Treasurer as unclaimed property. 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1326-D (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b620] The combined effect of these statutes indicates a legislative resolve to require criminal offenders to pay restitution and not excuse that obligation because of post-judgment changes in the availability of the victim to receive that compensation. The proper identification of the specific recipient-whether it be the victim's estate or a governmental entity-is a matter to be determined by the State pursuant to the restitution statutes and has no bearing on the defendant's underlying obligation to pay restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b621] There is no reason to treat the dissolution of a corporate victim differently given the Legislature's pronouncement that the purposes of restitution include rehabilitating the offender and \"reinforc[ing] the offender's sense of responsibility for the offense.\" 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1321 (2017). If the identity or location of a victim cannot be determined at the time of sentencing, the court remains authorized to impose a restitution order, after which the State must forward restitution payments to the county where the case is prosecuted. 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1324(2) (2017). This demonstrates that even the initial issuance of an enforceable restitution order is not predicated on the availability of a victim. The dissolution of MPPA as a corporate entity therefore did not render the restitution order unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allocca v. York Ins.

In this case, the motion court found that Gagne had \"made cash payments totaling $47,917.39 ($32,600 + $15,317.39), leaving a balance of $352,082.61\n   <em>\n    prior to the application of any other credits to which [Gagne] may be entitled to\n   </em>\n   as discussed below.\" (Emphasis added.) The court went on to discuss the three properties that Gagne owned to which she and her husband granted MPPA mortgages, as well as a possible insurance settlement received by MPPA. The court found that, although Gagne had sought information in 2009 regarding proceeds from the properties and possible insurance payments from MPPA's counsel, no information had been provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b625] At the time of the order, the court scheduled a follow-up hearing for June 30, 2017, to take additional evidence regarding any compensation received by the victim from the proceeds of real estate sales or collateral sources. This hearing never occurred-after her initial appeal was dismissed as interlocutory, the motion court determined that such a hearing \"is not necessary at this time\" and declared the restitution order final for purposes of the appeal. Thus, the restitution order was made final without evidence of what amount, if any, Gagne should be credited for proceeds from the mortgage foreclosures and real estate sales or other collateral sources-evidence which, the record indicates, would be in the possession of MPPA or its attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b626] While the restitution chapter of the Criminal Code makes clear that the State has the burden to prove the amount of the victim's loss and the amount to be paid in restitution,\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290236\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/994/808/\">\n    2010 ME 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290236\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/994/808/\">\n    994 A.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is silent regarding the burden of proving past restitution payments when a default is alleged. Section 1325, which relates to criteria to be considered in authorizing a restitution order in a criminal judgment, states the following about burdens of proof, addressing only proof of incapacity to make payments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   An offender who asserts a present or future incapacity to pay restitution has the burden of proving the incapacity by a preponderance of the evidence.
