The appeal is a primer of Fourth Amendment law because of the plenitude of issues it raises. On December 14, 2017, the appellant, Curtis Groves, entered conditional guilty pleas to 1) the possession of heroin with intent to distribute and 2) the possession of a firearm in a drug trafficking crime before Judge Mark K. Boyer in the Circuit Court for Washington County. On the two convictions, the appellant was sentenced to an aggregate term of 32 years of incarceration with all but 26 years suspended. The guilty pleas were conditioned upon the appellant's reserving his right to appeal from an adverse ruling at a pre-trial suppression hearing. Maryland Rule of Procedure 4-242(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Our chronology in this case looks backward from that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    The Suppression Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Looking backward to the suppression hearing, the appellant moved pre-trial to suppress various contraband and instrumentalities of crime (to wit, drugs, a quantity of ammunition, and a handgun) seized by the police during a warranted search on January 25, 2017, of 43 Charles Street in Hagerstown, a residence shared by the appellant with his girlfriend, Sidrease\n   Morgan. A hearing was conducted on the motion on November 29, 2017, before Judge Boyer. In an order of December 8, 2017, Judge Boyer denied the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The key issue before the suppression hearing was the constitutionality of the search and seizure warrant for 43 Charles Street issued by Judge Daniel Dwyer on January 25, 2017. There was no question but that the detailed, eight-page warrant application submitted by Agent Tammy Jurado of the Washington County Narcotics Task Force facially furnished abundant probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. The nub of the appellant's contention, however, was that the police had made an earlier entry into 43 Charles Street on that very day, to wit, when they first arrested the appellant, and had at that time made a number of visual observations which, in turn, became the essential core of the warrant application. The warrant application recited:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    In the process of arresting Groves\n   </em>\n   , Corporal Will Blount of the Prince George's County Police Department and assigned to the Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, observed to the right of the basement stairs a long box. Between the box and the basement wall\n   <em>\n    he observed a brick shaped item lying on the dirt floor, which was wrapped in a layer of white paper and then in clear plastic.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The brick shaped item appeared pliable, and\n   <em>\n    based on Agent Jurado's knowledge, training and experience as a police officer, large amounts of controlled dangerous substances are often packaged in a similar manner\n   </em>\n   for concealment, and prior to being broken down into smaller amounts for the purpose of distribution or dispensing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Deputy Chris Carson, also assigned to the Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, observed in the basement an artificial Christmas tree box.\n   <em>\n    Deputy Carson observed what is consistent with the black grip of a firearm protruding from the box.\n   </em>\n   Deputy Carson also told Agent Jurado the basement wall is brick and one of the bricks had been removed and/or was missing.\n   <em>\n    In the space where the brick should have been Deputy Carson observed a box of ammunition.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Deputy Carson further advised that while clearing the residence to ensure there was no one else inside,\n   <em>\n    he observed lying on the bedroom floor of a second floor bedroom what appeared to be a black semi-automatic handgun. This black semi-automatic handgun was lying next to the bed.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The appellant's argument is that the unreasonable extent and duration of that earlier intrusion in the course of which the police made those observations violated the Fourth Amendment. The argument followed that if those unconstitutional observations, as fruit of the poisonous tree, were excised from the warrant application, what then remained would not have been enough to justify the issuance of the warrant. With respect to that conditional quantitative assessment, the appellant is on solid ground. With respect to the constitutionality of the initial intrusion, however,\n   we must look backward to the facts of that earlier event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    The Protective Sweep Incident To Arrest: A Homegrown Product\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. A National Phenomenon With A Local Provenance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before turning to the application of protective sweep law to the specific facts of this case, however, it behooves us to examine protective sweep law in the abstract. It also is gratifying to remember that this now universally recognized constitutional principle grew from strong native roots. It was the 1987 opinion of Judge Theodore Bloom for the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland that found expression in the Supreme Court's first recognition of the protective sweep phenomenon in terms essentially indistinguishable from those first enunciated by Judge Bloom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Buie v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5724765\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/72/562/\">\n    72 Md.

One officer called down basement stairs for everyone in the basement to come up with hands raised. After some discernible delay, Buie came up and was immediately arrested, handcuffed,\n   and searched. As Buie was being led from the house, another officer went down into the basement \"in case there was someone around.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5724765\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/72/562/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5724765\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/72/562/\">\n    at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5724765\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/72/562/\">\n    531 A.2d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Protective Sweep As A \"Prior Valid Intrusion\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   What the officer found was a red jogging suit matching a description of the clothing worn by the armed robber. Pursuant to the Plain View Doctrine, it was seized and admitted into evidence. If the police entrance into the basement to conduct the protective sweep was reasonable, there was no disputing the fact that the warrantless seizure of the red jogging suit was also reasonable. The sweep into the basement was the Plain View Doctrine's \"prior valid intrusion.\" The police had probable cause to believe that the red jogging suit, spotted in plain view, had been worn by the robber and was evidence of crime.\n   <em>\n    Coolidge v.

They simply included these observations in their application for a search warrant.

All three cases serve precisely the same purpose-officer safety. They do so in the respective contexts of 1) a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop on the street, 2) a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop on the open road, and 3) an arrest in a home. That is why, of course, they share precisely the same triggering quantitative authorization-\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   reasonable suspicion. The protective sweep, therefore, does not in any way look for evidence of crime. Its exclusive purpose is to look for potentially armed and dangerous persons, who might harm the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

In May of 2003, the appellant had been convicted in the State of\n   New York, on his guilty plea, of the criminal possession of marijuana in the 5th degree. A month later, in June of 2003, the appellant had been convicted again in New York, on his guilty plea, to the criminal possession of a controlled substance. In October of 2010, the appellant was again convicted in New York of the criminal possession of a loaded firearm. In January of 2017, the Task Force was looking for the appellant to arrest him on an active Violation of Parole warrant issued for him by New York State. The violation of parole leading to the issuance of that retake warrant was a firearms violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In the Fall of 2016, Agent Frank Toston of the Washington County Narcotics Task Force had received information that the appellant was in Hagerstown and was selling and distributing narcotics. The information was that the appellant frequented the area of John Street and North Mulberry Street. The source of information indicated, moreover, that the appellant was \"always in possession of a handgun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The suppression hearing was conducted on November 29, 2017, before Judge Boyer, with five members of the Task Force testifying for the State and no one for the defense. Judge Boyer filed his opinion and his Order of Court, denying the appellant's motion, on December 8, 2017. Judge Boyer made extensive findings of fact, which findings were supported by the testimony of the Task Force officers. Those findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. Indeed, they were not even controverted. We accept them as the unassailable factual bases for assessing the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   At the suppression hearing, the appellant conceded that the New York parole retake warrant for his arrest was valid. The appellant further conceded that the entry of the Fugitive Task Force arrest team into 43 Charles Street on January 25, 2017, was also valid. The only issue in dispute was the justification for the protective sweep into the basement immediately following the appellant's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Based on the testimony of Detective John Anthony Moriarty of the Montgomery\n   County Police Department, assigned to\n   the U.S. Marshal's Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, Judge Boyer made the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   During the hearing Detective Moriarty testified that upon arrival at the residence\n   <em>\n    the arrest team did not receive a response to their knock on the door of 43 Charles.\n   </em>\n   They then made contact with a Ms. Brown at 41 Charles Street, the adjoining side of the duplex, who indicated that her daughter, teenaged granddaughter, and the Defendant (her daughter's boyfriend) resided in 43 Charles. Ms. Brown was able to place a call to her daughter, which resulted in Sidrease Morgan [the girlfriend] coming to the door at 43 Charles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Ms. Morgan confirmed that the Defendant was inside\n   </em>\n   of 43 Charles, but was unsure whether he was upstairs or downstairs. She also indicated that her child was not in school that day and was likewise in the residence. When questioned,\n   <em>\n    Ms. Morgan indicated she had seen the Defendant in possession of a firearm\n   </em>\n   , but not for about a week.\n   <em>\n    She also confirmed the gang-related information that the arrest team already knew, indicating that the Defendant was a \"Blood from Harlem.\"\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The next witness was Deputy Ryan Lee of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office, also assigned to the U.S. Marshal's Task Force. Deputy Lee had been a law enforcement officer for 18 years and had been working with the Task Force for 12 years. Based upon his testimony, Judge Boyer made the following findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Deputy Lee testified that\n   <em>\n    he was the \"shield guy\" and first to enter 43 Charles Street. He initially called out for the Defendant, but when he received no reply\n   </em>\n   he led the team of approximately ten into the residence, entering the living room. He continued through the living room to the\n   kitchen, where he again called out several times with no response.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Deputy Lee located an\n   <em>\n    open stairway off the kitchen which led to the basement. Having received no response, he kicked a bottle down the basement steps in the hope of getting a reaction.\n   </em>\n   At that time,\n   <em>\n    Lee heard fumbling around in the basement and continued to call out, with no response.\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    After about two minutes, the Defendant showed himself at the bottom of the basement steps.\n   </em>\n   The Defendant was then instructed to come up the steps, but\n   <em>\n    he initially just stared.\n   </em>\n   After further commands,\n   <em>\n    the Defendant came part way up the steps, but no further.\n   </em>\n   Members of the arrest team then went down the steps and took him into custody,\n   <em>\n    walking him to the kitchen.\n   </em>\n   At this point\n   <em>\n    Deputy Lee indicated he was still \"holding\" the stairwell in case others may be downstairs.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The next witnesses to testify were Deputy United States Marshal Chris Carson of the Greenbelt Office and Detective William Blount of the Prince George's County Police Department, who had been assigned to\n   the Task Force for the past six years. Based on their combined testimony, Judge Boyer made the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   As the arrest team was entering 43 Charles, contact was made with Ms. Morgan's teenage daughter. Deputy Marshal Carson testified that as the child was passed out of the house by the arrest team, she replied to the officers that she didn't know if anyone else was in the house.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Deputy U.S. Marshal Carson testified that\n   <em>\n    \"just after [the Defendant] was in custody\" the team conducted a protective sweep of the house.\n   </em>\n   Deputy Lee testified that a sweep of the second floor, where noises were heard, took five minutes. Then\n   <em>\n    Carson and Detective Blount entered the basement \"to make sure no one else was down there.\"\n   </em>\n   Carson described the basement as being \"fairly open\" and characterized his actions as making \"quick visual scans\" while \"just looking behind large items.\" There was no testimony that anything was moved or opened during the protective sweep of the basement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   While conducting the protective sweep of the basement, the testimony and exhibits indicate that\n   <em>\n    the basement was somewhat dark and the officers needed to use their flashlights.\n   </em>\n   On one side of the basement Carson observed a black object in plain view sticking out of a Christmas tree box which resembled a handgun, as well as a box of ammunition, clearly visible about chest high in the brick wall where a brick was missing. On the other side of the basement, Blount observed a rectangular package, wrapped in plastic which he believed to be illegal narcotics. This was observed in plain view to the side of yet another Christmas tree box near a wall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    The officers did not seize any of the items observed\n   </em>\n   , but\n   <em>\n    their observations were included in the application for search warrant\n   </em>\n   which was later issued and executed at 43 Charles Street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Based upon his findings of fact, Judge Boyer ruled as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Based upon the totality of the circumstances,\n   <em>\n    the Court finds that it was reasonable for the officers to conduct a protective sweep of the basement\n   </em>\n   and the second floor of 43\n   Charles Street. The sweep, which the officers testified is\n   <em>\n    part of their standard protocol to ensure officer safety\n   </em>\n   , occurred\n   <em>\n    nearly contemporaneously with the arrest while the Defendant was still in the living room. The basement was\n   </em>\n   immediately adjoining the place of the Defendant's arrest and in fact was\n   <em>\n    where he was hiding from the arrest team.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    the sweep was de minimis\n   </em>\n   , not overly intrusive, and\n   <em>\n    limited to confirming that no one else was present\n   </em>\n   in the house\n   <em>\n    who may have posed a danger to the officers.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   The facts known to the arrest team at the time they conducted the protective sweep support its necessity.\n   <em>\n    The Defendant had an active parole retake warrant, was known to be armed in the past, was known to be a gang member, and had secreted himself in a dark basement, initially refusing to respond or submit. These facts\n   </em>\n   , coupled with the uncertainty of knowing who else may be the house\n   <em>\n    warranted the conduct of the protective sweep by the officers.\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   The plain view observations of the officers made during the protective sweep are valid and not violative of the protections afforded by the 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amendment. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    the search warrant issued, based in part upon those observations, is likewise valid especially in light of the Defendant's status as a parolee\n   </em>\n   with an active, outstanding parole retake warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   We affirm that ruling.
