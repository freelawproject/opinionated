BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 2] There are two children at issue in this consolidated child protection matter-the son (the son) of Shirley T. (the mother) and David W. (the father), and Shirley T.'s niece (the niece), for whom Shirley T. has served as legal guardian since 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 21, 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services initiated child protection proceedings as to both children in the District Court (Bridgton) with allegations involving substance abuse, domestic violence, insufficient supervision, mental health issues, the unexplained death of another of the mother's children, verbal and physical aggression toward the children, the father's prior conviction for sexual abuse of a minor, and the father's lack of involvement in the son's life.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court (\n   <em>\n    MG Kennedy, J.\n   </em>\n   ) granted preliminary protection orders that day placing the children in Department custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The mother waived her right to a summary preliminary hearing as to both children and later agreed to the entry of a jeopardy order by the court (\n   <em>\n    Powers, J.\n   </em>\n   ) based on her substance abuse and mental health issues. The father also agreed to the entry of a jeopardy order as to the son on grounds that the father was convicted of sexual abuse of a minor in 2006, resides on the Tribe's reservation in South Dakota, and has not had contact with the son for several years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the jeopardy proceedings, the court also determined that ICWA applies to both matters because the children are, or are eligible to become, registered members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n    25 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In December of 2017, the mother, the father, and the Tribe (as an interested party) requested that the matter be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Tribal Court in South Dakota pursuant to ICWA; the Tribe also filed an order from the Tribal Court accepting jurisdiction as to both children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The court conducted a testimonial hearing on the motions to transfer jurisdiction, at which both children, the niece's counselor, the niece's foster mother, the son's foster father (who is the father of the son's half-siblings), the Department supervisor, the guardian ad litem (GAL), a qualified ICWA expert, and the Tribe's ICWA technician testified. The Department, the GAL, both children, and the ICWA expert\n   opposed the transfer. By order dated April 13, 2018, the court made the following findings of fact, which are supported by competent evidence presented at the motion hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 6] The son was thirteen years old at the time of the hearing and lives with the father of his three half-siblings, who are also Indian children. The son is happy in this household and wishes to stay. The son's biological father has never been active in the son's life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 7] The niece, who was twelve years old at the time of the hearing, was born in South Dakota but moved to Maine at a young age. The niece lived with the mother since at least 2011, but was placed in foster care from 2015 to March of 2016 and again in July of 2016. She and the son go to the same school and interact there; the niece also maintains a close relationship with the rest of her cousins-the son's half-siblings-who live in the area with their father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 8] The niece has been in counseling since 2015, with a short break in 2016. She has disclosed to her counselor a history of various forms of significant abuse, some of which occurred when she was young and living on the reservation in South Dakota. The niece has developed a trusting relationship with her counselor, with whom she should continue working to process her grief from her traumatic history and to decrease her anxiety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Both children are doing well in their current placements, where they are growing up as part of their Indian family in Maine, that is, with strong ties to the son's half-siblings/the niece's cousins. They have also been exposed to Indian culture while living with the mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 10] The children were the subject of prior child protection proceedings initiated in 2014. During those proceedings, the Tribe also moved to transfer jurisdiction to the Tribal Court, but the mother opposed the transfer, and the court (Bridgton,\n   <em>\n    Darvin, J.\n   </em>\n   ) also found good cause to deny the requested transfer. The GAL opined that the mother's support of the motion to transfer in the present matter is premised on her wish to \"circumvent the safety requirements of DHHS in the reunification process by enlisting intervention from the Oglala Sioux Tribal Court.\" The Tribe has no presence in Maine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 11] The Department has been providing services to the children and their family for an extended period of time. The children have extensive connections to Maine, including education services. Thus, the court determined, \"Most of the relevant people with knowledge of the children's lives, including teachers and counselors, are in the local Maine area.\" The niece's mother and the son's father live elsewhere, and they have had almost no interaction with the children. The court concluded, \"The State of Maine courts and Maine [Department] with its consistent history of involvement with this family are in the best position to determine the issues presented for review in this case now and in the near future. All knowledgeable witnesses needed to adjudicate this case further are in southern Maine. It would be a relative hardship to the parties and interven[ors] were these cases moved almost 2,000 miles away despite any possible audio/video accommodations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 12] On this basis, the court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that there was good cause to deny the transfer of jurisdiction to the Tribal Court. The mother and father each appealed as to the son, and the mother also appealed as to her niece.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 13] ICWA was enacted in 1978 to address concerns, among others, \"that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions,\" and \"that the States ... have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201901\">\n    25 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) - (5) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Trever I.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7298524\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/973/752/\">\n    2009 ME 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7298524\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/973/752/\">\n    973 A.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Denice F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7879732\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/658/1070/#p1072\">\n    658 A.2d 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1072 (Me. 1995).

The court also noted that the son's father, who lives in South Dakota, and the niece's mother, who lives in Texas, have played \"virtually no parental role\" in the children's lives-findings that are relevant to the court's determination that there are no witnesses outside Maine who have any significant knowledge of or testimony to offer about the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 20] The court further determined that \"any possible audio/video accommodations\" that would allow the presentation of Maine-based evidence to the Tribal Court in South Dakota did not mitigate the evidentiary burdens created by the 2,000 miles between the Maine court and the Tribal Court. Although the father points to the testimony of the Tribe's ICWA technician-that she is able to \"reach out\" to attorneys, including state attorneys-and of the GAL and the son's foster father-that they would be willing to speak with the Tribal Court by telephone-the court was not required to believe that evidence, even if uncontroverted and even if offered by an expert witness, nor was the court required to place any great weight on it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rice v. Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868015\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/86/\">\n    2015 ME 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868015\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/86/\">\n    115 A.3d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence presented also supports a reasonable inference that it would be impractical, expensive, and burdensome for the witnesses-all of whom are in Maine-to maintain the connection with the Tribal Court that this case demands, particularly when the Tribe's own representative testified that the Tribal Court likely would conduct the required hearings in South Dakota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ma v. Bryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289776\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/997/755/\">\n    2010 ME 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289776\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/997/755/\">\n    997 A.2d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"reasonable inferences\"). The quality of portions of the transcript of the motion hearing held in Maine, which involved the telephonic participation-or the attempted participation-by the Tribe's representative, the son's father, and the niece's mother fully supports the court's holding that audio/visual accommodations simply would not be effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 21] Aside from its supported findings regarding the evidentiary hardships created by a transfer, the court's focus on the question of jurisdiction rather than placement is also demonstrated by a review of the motion hearing transcript itself. The transcript shows that the hearing was complicated by continuing attempts by the Department and the GAL to inject into the proceeding questions about the physical transfer of the children from Maine to South Dakota. Nevertheless, the court properly stressed over and over again that the question it had to address was whether\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   should be transferred to the Tribal Court, not whether the children should be moved to South Dakota. For example, when the Department asked the niece's counselor, \"Assume that [the niece] may be moved to the reservation.... Based on your work with [the niece], what impact would that have on her?\" the court stated, \"I don't think I can go down that road. This is an unusual statute but -- I\n   mean, I think it directly relates to what could happen to her if placement was transferred.\" When the Assistant Attorney General pressed the court, arguing that \"the Court is allowed to consider the impact on [the niece] if she is moved.... That's good cause. That's the basic issue before the Court,\" the court correctly declined to consider that factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 22] The court sustained the objections by the parents' attorneys to evidence regarding the mother's intent to take the children out of the country if the children are moved to the reservation, the niece's progress with her therapist and her future therapy goals, the niece's fears of being moved to South Dakota, whether the niece has had any contact with her proposed placement in South Dakota, whether the niece would suffer \"any trauma related to being back in the process of a courtroom not in the State of Maine,\" the teen suicide rate on the reservation, whether the niece's current foster family is willing to continue with her placement, whether the son's foster father is willing to continue with his placement, whether the son's foster father is willing to continue to allow contact between the son and his half-siblings and the niece, \"what the transition [of jurisdiction] looks like for the children,\" and the Department supervisor's testimony that it is \"in the kids' best interest to remain where they are staying right now.\" The court concluded the hearing by noting, \"Unusual case, as I said. Different law from what we're used to dealing with, a strongly worded law. Obviously [it] has, you know, intent clearly behind it, and you have to apply whatever the law is.\" The trial court thus expressly and correctly recognized, consistent with the 2016 Guidelines, that placement considerations are not a proper basis for determining good cause, and it made repeated rulings designed to maintain the proper focus of the hearing on the jurisdictional issues. 2016 Guidelines \u00a7 F(5) at 50;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2015 Guidelines,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2010%2C146\">\n    80 Fed.

Important considerations are the relative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive. There may also be questions as to the enforceability of a judgment if one is obtained. The court will weigh relative advantages and obstacles to fair trial. It is often said that the plaintiff may not, by choice of an inconvenient forum, \"vex,\" \"harass,\" or \"oppress\" the defendant by inflicting upon him expense or trouble not necessary to his own right to pursue his remedy. But unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff's choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    (Footnote omitted);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Corning v.
