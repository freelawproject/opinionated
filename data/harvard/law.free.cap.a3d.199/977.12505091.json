(Applicant) asks whether the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (trial court) erred in affirming a decision of the City of Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) that refused to approve Applicant's proposed three-family dwelling as a non-conforming use. Applicant primarily argues that the ZBA erred in determining that the Philadelphia Zoning Code (Zoning Code) prohibits Applicant's proposed replacement of its existing, lawful non-conforming use. Upon review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Applicant owns the property located at 451 Green Lane in the City of Philadelphia's (City) Roxborough neighborhood (property). The property is a 3,740 square-foot, mid-block lot located in an RSA-3 Residential Single-Family Detached zoning district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The property is improved with a three-story (35-foot), vacant, detached residential structure. The existing structure is comprised of a three-family dwelling, with one dwelling unit on each floor. Two of the dwelling's units are two-bedroom units; the third unit is a one-bedroom unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2015, Applicant applied to the Philadelphia Department of Licenses and Inspections (L &amp; I) for a zoning/use registration permit for the proposed \"\n   <em>\n    complete demolition of all existing structures\n   </em>\n   and for the erection of a new three unit multi-family dwelling with porch, rear deck, and accessory roof deck(s) with pilot house(s) to enclose stair and landing only as per plans\" on the property. ZBA Op., Finding of Fact (F.F.) No. 1 (emphasis added). L &amp; I determined that the proposed use/construction did not meet the Zoning Code's requirements because: (1) multi-family residences are not permitted in the RSA-3 district; (2) three accessory parking spaces are required, and Applicant proposed no parking spaces; and (3) a minimum side yard width of eight feet is required, and Applicant proposed a five-foot-wide side yard. As a result, L &amp; I\n   issued a notice of refusal. Applicant appealed L &amp; I's refusal to the ZBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its application for appeal, Applicant stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [Applicant] is the owner of a three-story, three-family dwelling [on the property]. The existing structure is affected by substantial structural defects. [Applicant] proposes to replace the existing structure with a Code-compliant building dedicated to the same use, three-family dwelling. Strict application of the Zoning Code imposes a hardship on the [p]roperty. The grant of relief will have no adverse effect on the public health, safety or welfare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   F.F. No. 3. A hearing ensued before the ZBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the hearing, the ZBA voted to deny Applicant's appeal of L &amp; I's notice of refusal. In support, the ZBA made the following findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1981, L &amp; I issued a use registration permit for the property identifying the approved use as a three-family dwelling. Applicant purchased the property in July 2015, at which time it was vacant. Applicant proposes to demolish the existing structure on the property and replace it with a three-story (38-foot) structure, comprised of three side-by-side, three-story, two-bedroom dwelling units, each with a separate entrance and each with a roof deck and pilot house. Each of the proposed dwelling units would be approximately 1,500 square feet for a combined gross floor area of 4,500 square feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before the ZBA, project architect Rustin Ohler (Applicant's Architect) testified that the new structure's footprint would be \"slightly different\" than that of the existing building in that it would have a five-foot side yard as opposed to the existing four-foot side yard, and it would be \"slightly deeper in depth than [the] existing [building].\" F.F. No. 12. Applicant's Architect did not specify how much deeper the proposed structure would be than the existing structure, nor did he indicate the gross floor areas of the existing and proposed structures. Additionally, the exhibits Applicant submitted do not provide this information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, Fred Abrams, Applicant's Owner, testified regarding his understanding of the property's status as a three-family dwelling and his proposed development of the property. Applicant's Owner testified he inspected the property before purchasing it; at that time, it was configured with a three-family dwelling. He described the property as vacant and \"in pretty poor condition\" and stated he was \"not certain when it was last occupied.\" F.F. No. 19. Applicant's Owner testified he initially intended \"to clean up the violations and to renovate the building\" but after \"adding the numbers up, and doing it to the standards that I have for renovation,\n   <em>\n    it made more sense to possibly start from scratch\n   </em>\n   .\" F.F. No. 20 (emphasis added). Applicant's Owner acknowledged that he could not rent the existing building as a three-family dwelling and estimated it would take him 60 days to \"paint it, carpet it, maybe the appliances have to be - some carpentry.\" F.F. No. 21. When asked by the ZBA \"Why don't you just do that[?]\" Applicant's Owner responded: \"I have an existing three unit building that by right I can go in and do work, and keep it as a three unit building.\n   <em>\n    I would like to do something better than that. I'd like to start from scratch\n   </em>\n   .\" F.F. No. 22 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Applicant's Owner further testified that he obtained a certification statement from the City identifying the property's lawful use as a three-family dwelling at the time of purchase, and he subsequently obtained a rental license for three units. F.F. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   23. A certification statement issued to Applicant in July 2015 indicated that L &amp; I records showed the property to be legally registered for use as a three-family dwelling. The certification statement also provided \"IF THIS PROPERTY IS NOT BEING USED AS INDICATED ABOVE, IT IS THE OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO FILE FOR A NEW USE REGISTRATION PERMIT WITH [L &amp; I'S] ZONING UNIT.\" F.F. No. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Applicant's counsel stated that the property's use as a three-family dwelling is \"not out of character with this block.\" F.F. No. 25. He submitted a list of \"19 buildings in the 400 block of Green Lane which are all legal non[-] conforming [multi-family] uses,\" along with photographs and zoning records for each building. F.F. No. 26. Office of Property Assessment records submitted for 15 of those properties show the existing buildings on the properties range from 1,247 to 3,405 square feet. Applicant's counsel did not mention the number of single-family homes on the block, but he stated \"there are fewer single-family homes than non[-]conforming [multi-family dwellings].\" F.F. No. 28. When the ZBA Chairperson asked why the property could not be used for a single-family home, Applicant's counsel responded that Applicant \"does not need to show a hardship\n   <em>\n    to replace a legal non[-]conforming use\n   </em>\n   that is a property right.\" F.F. No. 29 (emphasis added). Applicant's counsel stated: \"[Applicant] [is] here to show hardship on the two remaining refusals, which is the side yard and the parking.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On the non-conforming use issue, Applicant's counsel stated, \"the threshold issue ... is whether or not the use has been abandoned.\" F.F. No. 30. He argued that neither discontinuance of the use for a specified time period nor the \"lapse of a license\" was sufficient to establish abandonment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to appearing before the ZBA, Applicant presented its proposal to the Central Roxborough Civic Association (CRCA), the registered community organization for the area, at a public meeting. A vote taken at the meeting showed 25 attendees in opposition to the project and none in support of it. In a written statement, CRCA President Donald Simon (CRCA President) stated, \"a non-conforming use is abandoned after three years of vacancy and voluntary demolition.\" F.F. No. 32. Describing the area at issue, the CRCA President wrote that although there are \"some rental units, the 400 Block of Green Lane is predominately owner-occupied single family homes.\" F.F. No. 33. The CRCA President and a number of CRCA members also appeared at the ZBA hearing and stated their opposition to the proposed development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Kay Sykora, who resides at 445 Green Lane, described the proposed structure as \"about twice the size of the building that is there.\" F.F. No. 35. She stated: \"I think my opposition is just [to] the sheer scale of this. You are talking the equivalent of three trinities turned sideways. This is very different than the three apartments stacked on top that pre-existed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sykora submitted photographs of recently renovated properties in the immediate area, which showed \"there is a commitment to this area as a single-family residential area.\" F.F. No. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ray Feinsehill, an attorney representing Debra Valenti-Epstein and John Hagarty, who own and reside at 443 Green Lane, read into the record a letter from his clients opposing Applicant's proposal. Valenti-Epstein and Hagarty's grounds for opposition included: Applicant's proposal is for \"three trinity townhouses\" each with \"separate first floor entrances, party walls to separate them, and separate rooftop decks\"; the proposed structure is \"massive\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   and \"more than double the size of the existing house\"; [and] the proposed townhouses \"are not in scale with the surrounding houses and are not the least minimal [sic] required to achieve one three-family dwelling ....\" F.F. No. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition, CRCA Board Member Alexander Fidrych asserted that the existing three-family use of the property will, by virtue of the Zoning Code, \"be extinguished when the structure is demolished.\" F.F. No. 38. CRCA Member Collin Dawson, an architect, who resides at 633 Gate Street, similarly asserted, \"once the property is demolished, the zoning reverts back to the base zoning ... which is residential.\" F.F. No. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Celeste Hardester, who resides at 368 Green Lane, testified that she worked with the group that \"put together the [Central Roxborough/Neighborhood Conservation Overlay (NCO) District] for the area.\" F.F. No. 40. Hardester testified that she opposed the proposed use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition, by letter to the ZBA, Councilman Curtis Jones advised the ZBA that he opposed the proposed development, which he described as \"an overuse for this location\" that is \"vehemently opposed by the neighbors and the [CRCA].\" F.F. No. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The ZBA also received a petition signed by area residents who oppose the proposed development as well as letters and emails expressing opposition to the project. Counsel for the CRCA submitted a letter to the ZBA, which stated, \"Applicant's proposal to build three new townhouses on this undersized lot is an unsupported expansion of any prior use or dimensions at this location.\" F.F. No. 44. Counsel for the CRCA disputed Applicant's counsel's contention that no use variance was required. He argued a non-conforming use cannot be continued if the structure housing it \"has been vacant, is voluntarily destroyed and replaced with a larger, different structure.\" F.F. No. 44. Further, in an email to the ZBA, area resident Robert Spear wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The scale of the proposed development is out of ... proportion with its surroundings. A structure in excess of 4,500 [square feet] is planned to replace an improvement of 2,872 [square feet]. This new structure would thus be more than half again as large as the dwelling house which currently occupies this [property], itself one of the larger structures on the block. In addition, it is designed less as an apartment house and more as a row of trinities, each occupying three stories and planned for individual sale as condominiums. Such density, on [the property], is incompatible with the vision laid out in the Lower Northwest District Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   F.F. No. 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Based on these findings, the ZBA made the following conclusions of law. The proposed three-family dwelling is not a permitted use in the RSA-3 district. Applicant contends no use variance is required because the proposed three-family dwelling is a lawful non-conforming use that may be continued by right, even in a replacement structure. The ZBA concluded the proposed multi-family dwelling was not permitted as a continuation of a non-conforming use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to the non-conforming use issue, the ZBA explained that under Section 14-305(10)(b) of the Zoning Code, titled \"Rights Following Destruction,\" a non-conforming building or use that is \"destroyed or rendered unusable by fire or an act of God or a third party over which the owner has no control\" may be reconstructed or resumed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (a) a replacement structure that does not reduce the non[-]conforming setbacks\n   or exceed the non[-]conforming area or height of the destroyed structure may be constructed, and (b) the non[-]conforming use that existed prior to the destruction may be re-established, and (c) the property need not provide any more off-street parking spaces or loading areas than the property had before the destruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In contrast, Section 14-305(10)(c) of the Zoning Code, titled \"\n   <em>\n    Voluntary Destruction\n   </em>\n   ,\" states (with emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Any non[-]conforming structure\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   , lot, parking area,\n   <em>\n    site improvement\n   </em>\n   or accessory sign\n   <em>\n    destroyed through means other than [by fire or act of God or a third party over which the owner has no control] shall be reconstructed in compliance with the Zoning Code for the zoning district where it is located\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Concl. of Law No. 6 (quoting Section 14-305(10)(c) of the Zoning Code).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The ZBA further explained that Pennsylvania case law addressing a property owner's rights after voluntary destruction of a non-conforming structure or use is consistent with the Zoning Code's language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Korngold v.

Zoning Hearing Board of Haverford Township\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11211785\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/755/732/\">\n    755 A.2d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2000). The ZBA determined that\n   <em>\n    Money\n   </em>\n   was distinguishable because the ordinance at issue in that case contained no specific prohibition on reconstruction of a non-conforming structure or use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, the ZBA determined, relevant case law was consistent and clear. More specifically, Pennsylvania courts hold that, where a structure housing a non-conforming use is voluntarily demolished, a landowner may be prohibited from resuming the use in a replacement structure, provided that the prohibition is specifically stated in the applicable ordinance. Under such circumstances, the ZBA stated, the prior non-conformity is extinguished by operation of law; thus, it is not necessary to show an intent to abandon on the part of the landowner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The ZBA further explained that under Section 14-305(10)(c) of the Zoning Code, a non-conforming \"structure\" or \"use\" that is voluntarily demolished \"shall be reconstructed in compliance with the Zoning Code for the zoning district where it is located.\" The ZBA determined that demolition of the existing structure on the property would result in extinguishment of the prior three-family use, and any subsequent development would be required to comply with the RSA-3 district's standards, which do not permit multi-family dwellings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Applicant appealed the ZBA's decision to the trial court. Without taking additional evidence, the trial court affirmed. This appeal by Applicant followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Applicant argues the objectors also offered an unsupported allegation that, as a result of the property's foreclosure, there was an interruption in the issuance of a housing inspection license. Even if this is true, Applicant asserts, failure to license a non-conforming use cannot be construed as abandonment of the use.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303814\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/78/732/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, Applicant asserts, this Court held that a nine-year gap in multi-family occupancy, together with a five-year gap in licensing, was insufficient to show an intent to abandon a non-conforming use.\n   <em>\n    Wissahickon Interested Citizens Ass'n Inc. v.

Applicant argues the ZBA's reliance on this authority is misplaced. Specifically, Applicant asserts Section 14-305(10)(c) of the Zoning Code pertains to \"Destroyed Structures,\" and the criteria that apply to replacement of a \"Destroyed Structure\" that has a non-conforming element. If the structure is destroyed by an owner's voluntary act, the non-conforming element may not be resumed. Applicant asserts the distinction between this case and\n   <em>\n    Korngold\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Keebler\n   </em>\n   is that no structure was demolished here. Because there is no destroyed structure, Applicant contends, Section 14-305(10) of the Zoning Code does not apply. Unlike the owners in\n   <em>\n    Korngold\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Keebler\n   </em>\n   , Applicant maintains, it did not destroy the structure on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Applicant argues that, with the cosmetic improvements described by its Owner, the property's three-family, non-conforming use can resume. Applicant asserts there is no evidence to suggest that it has, or intends to, abandon the existing three-family use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Applicant maintains Pennsylvania law is clear: municipal ordinances may adopt restrictions on the reconstruction of non-conforming uses.\n   <em>\n    AFSO Builders\n   </em>\n   . In fact, an ordinance may prohibit reconstruction. However, \"[s]uch restrictions ... must be specifically stated; in their absence an owner seeking to continue a valid non-conforming use must be permitted to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Zeiders v.

Applicant argues these cases were cited in\n   <em>\n    Money\n   </em>\n   . In that case, as here, Applicant asserts, no structure was demolished. Instead, the owner sought permission to replace one non-conforming structure with another one.

Section 14-305(10)(c) of the Zoning Code. Applicant's argument that it is entitled to rebuild the structure because it\n   <em>\n    has not yet\n   </em>\n   demolished the existing structure is flawed given that Applicant sought permission from the ZBA to do just that. Based on the rationale expressed in\n   <em>\n    Korngold\n   </em>\n   , Applicant's\n   reliance on cases that involve abandonment of non-conforming uses is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In addition, in\n   <em>\n    Korngold\n   </em>\n   , this Court rejected the applicants' reliance on our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Moon\n   </em>\n   , cited by Applicant here, stating (with underlined emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   The [applicants] argue that\n   <em>\n    Moon\n   </em>\n   holds that the discontinuance of a lawful pre-existing non[-]conforming use is per se confiscatory and violative of Article 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which recognizes the inherent right of citizens to possess and protect property. In\n   <em>\n    Moon\n   </em>\n   , an ordinance was adopted which imposed restrictions on the location of adult bookstores. The ordinance also contained an amortization clause which required pre-existing businesses to comply with the ordinance within 90 days from the date the ordinance became effective. The owner of the bookstore challenged the validity of the ordinance, arguing that it was confiscatory and violative of the constitution. Our Supreme Court agreed, finding that in essence, the ordinance required the plaintiff to relocate his entire business within 90 days. Based upon that finding, our Supreme Court held that\n   <em>\n    amortization\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    discontinuance\n   </em>\n   of a non[-]conforming use was confiscatory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Moon\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court noted that, '[t]he effect of the amortization provision herein is to deprive appellant of the lawful use of its property in that the ordinance forces appellant to cease using its property as an adult book store within 90 days.'\n   <em>\n    Moon\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825922\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/526/186/\">\n    584 A.2d at 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].\n   <em>\n    Because no amortization provision is involved in the present case but only the cessation of a use, the holding in Moon simply has no applicability whatsoever\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Korngold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1431698\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/147/93/\">\n    606 A.2d at 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of December, 2018, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The only residential use permitted by right in the RSA-3 Residential Single-Family Detached zoning district is single-family use.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The ZBA further explained that the proposed development was prohibited on the independent ground that it was an impermissible expansion of the prior three-family use. To that end, the ZBA stated, even where replacement of a non-conforming use or structure is permitted, (in cases of destruction by act of God or a third party), the replacement structure must not \"exceed the non[-]conforming area or height of the destroyed structure.\" Section 14-305(10)(b) of the Zoning Code.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Here, the ZBA determined, Applicant proposes to construct a three-story, 4,500 square-foot building that would be deeper and three feet taller than the existing structure and would include a rear deck, three roof decks, and three pilot houses. The ZBA stated Applicant did not specify how much larger (in terms of depth and square footage) the new structure would be than the existing structure. Further, the objectors to Applicant's proposed development described the proposed development as \"massive\" and \"more than double the size of the existing house.\" ZBA Op., Concl. of Law No. 22. Further, in an email to the ZBA after the hearing (the ZBA held the record open for two weeks after the hearing), area resident Robert Spear stated, \"a structure in excess of 4,500 square feet is planned to replace an improvement of 2,872 square feet.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1431698\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/147/93/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The ZBA stated that Applicant did not dispute the objectors' contention that the proposed structure would be substantially larger than the existing structure. Therefore, the ZBA stated, the record suggested that the proposed development would increase the area and height of the existing non-conforming use. As a result, the ZBA concluded that the proposed three-family use was prohibited on the independent ground that it was as an impermissible expansion of a prior non-conforming use.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Further, the ZBA determined that Applicant did not establish entitlement to the requested variances from the Zoning Code's side yard and accessory parking requirements. To that end, the ZBA concluded Applicant did not establish that denial of the side yard variance would result in unnecessary hardship nor did Applicant satisfy the remaining criteria for the grant of a variance. Additionally, the ZBA determined that the requested variance for parking was not the minimum variance necessary to afford relief, and the grant of the variance would adversely impact public health, safety and welfare by increasing congestion and exacerbating existing parking shortages in the area. For these reasons, the ZBA denied the requested variances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Because the parties presented no additional evidence after the ZBA's decision, our review is limited to determining whether the ZBA committed an abuse of discretion or an error of law.\n    <em>\n     Soc'y Hill Civic Ass'n v.
