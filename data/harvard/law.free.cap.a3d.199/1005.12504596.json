In doing so, the trial court affirmed the final determination of the Office of Open Records (OOR) that the video, which records a confrontation between a student and a parent (of another student), was required to be disclosed under the Right-to-Know Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The School District contends that the trial court erred because disclosure of the video could lead to the District's loss of federal funding and because the video relates to the District's noncriminal investigation. For these reasons, the School District asserts that the Right-to-Know Law exempts the school bus video from disclosure. Discerning no merit to the School District's arguments, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 23, 2016, Valerie Hawkins, on behalf of Fox 43 News (Requester), submitted a written request to the School District that stated, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Fox 43 News is requesting a copy of the video that was captured by a school bus camera system that occurred on Feb. 16, 2016. According to paperwork filed at Magisterial District Judge Lowell Witmer's office, Erica Rawls grabbed the wrist of a 17-year-old girl after the [Central Dauphin] East girls' basketball [team] returned from a District 3 playoff game at Central Dauphin on Feb. 16 (see attached document). Rawls was cited with a summary count of harassment.\n   <em>\n    We would like to obtain a video copy of the incident that was captured by the school bus video system\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Reproduced Record at 5a (R.R. __) (emphasis added). The School District denied the request for the stated reason that disclosure of the video would violate the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g, which could lead to the District's loss of federal funding. This potential loss exempted the video from disclosure under Section 708(b)(1)(i) of the Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(1)(i). Alternatively, the School District asserted that the video was a record \"relating to\" a noncriminal investigation and, thus, exempt under Section 708(b)(17) of the Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Requester appealed to the OOR, stating that it wanted the video in order to view \"the actions of the adult, Erica Rawls, who was charged by police and is the wife of [Central Dauphin] East Principal Jesse Rawls.\" R.R. 7a. In response, the School District submitted a sworn affidavit of Assistant Superintendent Karen McConnell, its open records officer, stating that the video showed students in addition to Mrs. Rawls, and the School District lacked the technology to redact the students' images. McConnell Affidavit \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11; R.R. 26a. The affidavit reiterated the legal bases for the School District's refusal to grant the request,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the risk of a loss of federal funding and the relationship of the video to a noncriminal investigation by the School District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 19, 2016, the OOR issued a final determination granting Requester's appeal. It held that the exemption in Section 708(b)(1)(i) of the Right-to-Know Law did not apply because the school bus video was not an \"education record\" within the meaning of FERPA. It also held that the exemption\n   in Section 708(b)(17) of the Right-to-Know Law did not apply because the video was, at most, incidental to a noncriminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The School District appealed to the trial court, which conducted an evidentiary hearing. The sole witness was McConnell, who, in addition to serving as the School District's open records officer, supervises its finances and administration. Notes of Testimony, 3/30/2017, at 6-7 (N.T. __); R.R. 233a-34a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to McConnell, each school bus is equipped with two cameras. One is mounted over the driver's head \"that faces out to the [front] door[,]\" and another is mounted in the front of the bus and \"faces all the way to the back[.]\" N.T. 7; R.R. 234a. These cameras record individuals getting on and off the bus; their backs as they walk down the center aisle; and their faces while seated. The cameras start recording when the bus engine is turned on and continue until 20 minutes after the engine is turned off. The cameras are programmed to overwrite the recorded content every 10 to 14 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The video footage is reviewed only when \"there is a problem[,]\" such as a disciplinary or safety issue. N.T. 7, 9; R.R. 234a, 236a. In that case, the School District's director of transportation downloads the video and discards it \"once it's no longer needed [by the School District.]\" N.T. 39; R.R. 266a. The School District's security personnel must request school bus videos from the director of transportation, who has sole responsibility for the videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   McConnell testified that the requested video depicts a confrontation between a member of the girls' high school varsity basketball team and Rawls. The incident began in a parking lot outside the school bus and continued onto the bus. Several parents, who witnessed the incident, complained to the School District. In response, the School District downloaded the video to determine \"if there should be student discipline or staff discipline [or] there were any unsafe acts that took place on the bus.\" N.T. 12; R.R. 239a. After investigation, the School District disciplined at least one student and one staff member, but McConnell did not identify either one. McConnell stated that this investigation was \"very lengthy[,]\" and included reviewing the video, interviewing students and staff, and speaking with parents. N.T. 10-11; R.R. 237a-38a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   McConnell testified that the school bus video at issue is not kept in any student's file; instead, she maintains the video in a fireproof safe in her office \"as the open records officer.\" N.T. 13, 38-39; R.R. 240a, 265a-66a. By contrast, student files are maintained in hard copy and electronic format in varying locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On cross-examination, McConnell admitted that she is \"very rarely\" involved in student discipline. N.T. 40; R.R. 267a. Although she participated in the investigation of the incident recorded on the school bus video, she did not make any decisions about the discipline that followed. McConnell acknowledged that the United States Department of Education has never penalized the School District for a violation of FERPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rawls was charged with criminal harassment, a summary offense, for her involvement in the incident. At the hearing before the magisterial district judge, the student involved in the incident testified, and a portion of the school bus video was played.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The hearing resulted in the dismissal\n   of the harassment charge. The hearing was covered in the press, and these accounts identified the name of the student involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After hearing the evidence and oral argument, the trial court affirmed the OOR's final determination. It rejected both of the School District's theories that the video was exempt from disclosure under the Right-to-Know Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court concluded, first, that the school bus video was not an \"education record\" for purposes of FERPA. The video was not \"part of a student's permanent academic record[,]\" but, rather, maintained by the School District's open records officer. Trial Court Op. at 12; R.R. 458a. The trial court explained that under FERPA, an education record must be \"kept in a filing cabinet in a records room at the school or on a permanent secure database, perhaps even after the student is no longer enrolled.\" Trial Court Op. at 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Owasso Independent School District No. I-011 v. Falvo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108292\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/426/#p433\">\n    534 U.S. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108292\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/426/#p433\">\n    122 S.Ct. 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108292\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/426/#p433\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) ); R.R. 457a. The trial court also found the school bus video to be beyond the reach of FERPA because the information on the video was already known to the community as a result of media reports. Concluding that disclosure of the video would not jeopardize the School District's federal funding under FERPA, the trial court held that the School District did not prove that the video was exempt under Section 708(b)(1)(i) of the Right-to-Know Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court also concluded that the school bus video was not exempt under Section 708(b)(17) of the Right-to-Know Law as a record relating to a noncriminal investigation. In so holding, the trial court relied upon\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania State Police v. Grove,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20Pa.%201\">\n    640 Pa. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325657\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/877/\">\n    161 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\n   <em>\n    Grove II\n   </em>\n   ), where our Supreme Court held that police dash-cam videos do not always contain investigative materials and are not automatically exempt from disclosure. Further drawing on\n   <em>\n    Grove II,\n   </em>\n   the trial court explained that the school bus video, by itself, did not \"reveal any progress in or result of an investigation conducted by the District.\" Trial Court Op. at 14; R.R. 460a. Rather, the video \"merely shows an altercation that began outside of the bus, moved onto the bus, and other individuals getting on and off of the bus,\" all in plain view of bystanders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16; R.R. 462a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court discredited McConnell's testimony that the video was investigative because there was no evidence on \"how or why an employee in the finance and operations side of the District would be involved in an investigation regarding staff and student conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15; R.R. 461a. Further, McConnell acknowledged that she was rarely involved in student discipline. The trial court held that the School District did not prove that the school bus video was exempt as a record relating to a noncriminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The School District has appealed the trial court's order to this Court and presents two issues for our consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the School District argues that the trial court erred in holding that disclosure of the school bus video would not result in a loss of federal funding. Second, the School District argues that the trial court erred in holding that the video did not relate to a noncriminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Right-to-Know Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Right-to-Know Law requires state and local government agencies to provide access to public records upon request. Section 102 of the Right-to-Know Law defines a \"public record\" as a\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   record, including a financial record, of a Commonwealth or local agency that: (1) is not exempt under section 708[, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708 ]; (2) is not exempt from being disclosed under any other Federal or State law or regulation or judicial order or decree; or (3) is not protected by a privilege.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   65 P.S. \u00a7 67.102. A \"record\" is further defined under the Right-to-Know Law as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Information, regardless of physical form or characteristics, that documents a transaction or activity of an agency and that is created, received or retained pursuant to law or in connection with a transaction, business or activity of the agency. The term includes a document, paper, letter, map, book, tape, photograph, film or sound recording, information stored or maintained electronically and a data-processed or image-processed document.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Right-to-Know Law provides exceptions to the general rule that every public record must be provided upon request. However, \"the exceptions to disclosure of public records must be narrowly construed.\"\n   <em>\n    Office of the Governor v. Davis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6854263\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/122/1185/6854263/#p1191\">\n    122 A.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1191 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015). The burden of proving that a \"record\" is exempt from public access is placed on the \"local agency receiving a request by a preponderance of the evidence.\" Section 708(a)(1) of the Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(a)(1). This standard of proof requires that \"the existence of a contested fact must be more probable than its nonexistence.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania State Troopers Association v. Scolforo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280980\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/18/435/#p439\">\n    18 A.3d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439 (Pa.

Cmwlth. 2010) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to School District's contention that the requested video is exempt from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Loss of Federal Funding Exemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 708(b)(1)(i) of the Right-to-Know Law exempts from disclosure \"[a] record, the disclosure of\n   <em>\n    which would result in the loss\n   </em>\n   of Federal or State funds by an agency or the Commonwealth[.]\" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(1)(i) (emphasis added). The School District argues that the school bus video is an \"education record\" under FERPA, and its disclosure might cause it to lose federal funding. This risk is not diminished by \"the mere fact that people may know about or gossip about matters occurring at school [and] does not lessen FERPA's protection of confidentiality for school records.\" School District Brief at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   FERPA does two things. First, it ensures that parents can access their child's academic and disciplinary records so that they can correct inaccurate information therein. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g. To that end, the receipt of federal funds is conditioned upon schools giving parents access to their children's education records. Second, FERPA protects the privacy of these records and sanctions school districts that have \"a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records\" without parental consent. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(1). The sanction can include a loss of federal funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With respect to privacy concerns, Section 1232g(b)(1) of FERPA states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   No funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting\n   <em>\n    the release of education records\n   </em>\n   (or\n   <em>\n    personally identifiable information contained therein\n   </em>\n   other than directory information, as defined in paragraph (5) of subsection (a) )\n   <em>\n    of students without the written consent of their parents\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(1) (emphasis added). Section 1232g(a)(4)(A) defines \"education records\" as \"those records, files, documents, and other materials which - (i) contain information directly related to a student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At issue here is not the family's right under FERPA to access an education record held by a school but, rather, the privacy of that record. Simply, the central question is whether the requested school bus video constitutes an \"education record\" for purposes of FERPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The School District argues that because the video contains personally identifiable information about the student involved in the altercation and is maintained by the School District, it satisfies FERPA's definition of an education record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(A). Requester responds that a surveillance video is not an education record merely because it captures images of students; this logic would\n   make videos of football games education records. Rather, an education record must \"directly relate\" to a student and be maintained in accordance with FERPA protocols. Requester points to the trial court's statement that the image of the student or students in the video should be redacted electronically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Easton Area School District v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499872\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/191/75/\">\n    191 A.3d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018), this Court held that a school bus video that recorded a school teacher roughly disciplining a student was not an education record under FERPA. We explained that an \"education record\" has a reach beyond a student's academic transcript. However, the school bus video at issue was not an \"education record\" because it did not directly relate to a student. Rather, it directly related to a teacher's performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In so ruling, we found persuasive two United States District Court decisions,\n   <em>\n    Young v. Pleasant Valley School District\n   </em>\n   (M.D. Pa., No. 3:07-CV-854, filed June 26, 2008),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011336157\">\n    2008 WL 11336157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unreported), and\n   <em>\n    Ellis v.

Ohio 2004). Both courts held that the requested documents, consisting of emails and incident reports, did not constitute education records because they \"directly related\" to the discipline of a teacher and were only \"tangentially related\" to a student.\n   <em>\n    Easton Area School District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499872\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/191/75/\">\n    191 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   82 (citing\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at *7 ;\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9276338\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/1019/\">\n    309 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1022 ). We also considered guidance from the United States Department of Education that states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   In the context of photos and videos, determining if a visual representation of a student is\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   related to a student (rather than just incidentally related to him or her) is often context-specific, and educational agencies and institutions should examine certain types of photos and videos on a case by case basis to determine if they directly relate to any of the students depicted therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Easton Area School District,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499872\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/191/75/\">\n    191 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   82 (citing\n   <em>\n    FAQs on Photos and Videos under FERPA\n   </em>\n   , U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION , https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/faqs-photos-and-videos-under-ferpa (last visited November 8, 2018) ) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, the school bus video records a confrontation between a student and Rawls, a parent, who was criminally charged for her involvement. Requester contends that a record that \"merely mention[s] a student\" does not directly relate to that student. Requester Brief at 14. The subject video captures, \"in large part,\" the conduct of Rawls.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The school bus video reveals nothing about a student-specific file, whether academic or disciplinary in nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not known whether the School District used\n   the video in the discipline of the unnamed student. This is a close case. Ultimately, it was the School District's burden to establish that the video directly related to a student. We agree with the trial court that the School District did not satisfy this first part of the \"education record\" definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In any case, it is not enough that a document \"directly relate\" to a student. It must also be a record that is \"maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(A). The School District contends that the trial court erred on this point because McConnell kept the video recording in her office under lock and key. Requester responds that McConnell's testimony established that the School District does not \"maintain\" any of its surveillance videos in a systematic fashion, which is the hallmark of a true \"education record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In ruling that the school bus video does not satisfy the second part of the \"education\n   record\" definition, the trial court relied upon\n   <em>\n    Owasso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108292\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/426/#p433\">\n    534 U.S. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108292\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/426/#p433\">\n    122 S.Ct. 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, parents initiated litigation to end the school district's practice of having students grade each other's papers and then report the grades aloud to the teacher. The parents contended this practice violated FERPA's requirement that schools keep student records confidential.

On the other hand, the trial court did credit McConnell's testimony that she oversees the School District's fleet of school buses; that the School District's director of transportation downloaded the video for review after receiving complaints about the incident; and that the School District disciplined at least one student and one staff member following its investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Based on these credibility determinations, the trial court held that the School District did not prove that the school bus video related to a noncriminal investigative record.
