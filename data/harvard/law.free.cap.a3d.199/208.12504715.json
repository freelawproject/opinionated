The Board concluded that her disability was not incurred in the \"performance of duty\" (\"POD\") and was therefore compensable\n   under the provision of the statute governing retirement disability for injuries not incurred in the POD, instead of the provision for disabilities incurred during the POD, which provides benefits at a higher annuity rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. McCrea challenges her involuntary retirement on the grounds that the Board's conclusion \"lacks competent, objective, probative and reliable evidence.\" In the alternative, she seeks a reversal of the Board's determination that her disability was not incurred in the POD, claiming that she is entitled to receive retirement benefits at the POD annuity rate. Ms. McCrea claims that her ADAD condition stems from a sexual assault by her co-workers while she was on duty, which she contends constitutes a disability incurred in the POD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We affirm and conclude that substantial evidence in the record supports the Board's decision to involuntarily retire Ms. McCrea for a disability not incurred in the POD.

Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. McCrea began working as a firefighter with the Department on January 3, 2000. Her claim arose from an incident that she contends occurred at around midnight on the evening of May 30, 2013. She asserts that she was sleeping on her stomach at the firehouse, when three male co-workers \"fondl[ed] [her] between [her] legs.\" Following the May 30th incident, Ms. McCrea contends that she experienced \"difficulty concentrating, difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep, headaches, loss of appetite, nausea, upset stomach and diarrhea.\" On June 25, 2013, Ms. McCrea reported the incident to the District of Columbia Police and Fire Clinic (\"Clinic\") and requested that her ensuing mental health injury be classified as a POD injury. After filling out the Clinic's incident report, Ms. McCrea was referred to the Clinic's Behavioral Health Services section where she was interviewed by a psychologist, Mary Kenel, Ph.D., who evaluated her and placed her on sick leave on June 25, 2013. Ms. McCrea remained on sick leave until the Board made its decision to retire her on April 30, 2015, which became effective on May 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2014, the Clinic referred Ms. McCrea to clinical psychologist and neuropsychologist, Dr. Gloria Morote, who specializes in psychological evaluations. Dr. Morote recommended Ms. McCrea for disability retirement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-633\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 5-633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012 Repl.) mandates that uniformed employees who have been on leave for a significant period of time due to injury or illness be recommended for disability retirement. Dr. Morote based her recommendation on the fact that Ms. McCrea had been on sick leave for an extended period of time and her diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, which affected her \"ability to ... express her feelings, work under\n   stress, make judgments, and deal with people in general,\" and prevented her from performing her duties as a firefighter. The Board subsequently held a three-day retirement hearing on November 6, 2014, and January 22 and February 12, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the hearing, Ms. McCrea appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and testified that she did not wish to be retired. She urged the Board to adopt the conclusions of her treating psychologist, Dr. Beverli Mormile, that Ms. McCrea suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (\"PTSD\"), was fit to return to work on a limited-duty status, and should be reinstated. The Board determined that Ms. McCrea suffered from an ADAD, \"which prevents her from performing useful and efficient service with her Department,\" and did not find the record evidence sufficient to support the finding that she suffered from PTSD. The Board subsequently retired Ms. McCrea \"by reason of a disability not incurred in the performance of duty.\" The Board based its decision on Ms. McCrea's demeanor during the three days of hearings, where she was \"visibly and extremely mistrustful and paranoid;\" her refusal to comply with the Clinic's requests for treatment information from her treating psychologist; her failure to submit any documentation, including diagnostic test results or clinical notes that would support Dr. Mormile's diagnosis and treatment recommendations; and the record evidence as a whole. The Board weighed this evidence against the Department's evidence, which included testimony, reports, standardized tests, and the diagnosis of the Clinic's psychologist, Dr. Morote, and found that the Board's interaction with Ms. McCrea \"strongly supports Dr. Morote's opinion that [Ms. McCrea]'s paranoia and distrust is so pervasive that it would prevent [her] from performing the full duties of a firefighter because she could no longer work effectively with a team.\" Further, the Board concluded, Ms. McCrea's inability to work as a team, which is central to the functions of a firefighter, is evidence that she is unable to perform the functions of a firefighter safely in life-or-death situations and she poses a risk to herself and to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Board was unable to assign Dr. Mormile's conclusion and recommendation much weight because Dr. Mormile did not submit any corroborative evidence like testing reports or clinical notes. Further, Dr. Mormile's recommendation was contradictory as she stated that Ms. McCrea could return to full duty and then listed \"a number of limitations which prevented less-than-full duty status.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To be considered a member of the Department performing the member's \"full range of duties,\" the member must have the \"ability\" \"to perform\n   <em>\n    all of the essential functions\n   </em>\n   of police work or\n   <em>\n    fire suppression as determined by the established policies\n   </em>\n   and procedures of the Metropolitan Police Department or the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-701\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 5-701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (19) (2012 Repl.) (emphasis added). According to the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Service Useful and Efficient Service Statement, to be considered a full duty uniformed member, a firefighter must be able to perform an extensive list of \"essential duty functions.\" \"While not exclusive,\" the list includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Perform firefighting tasks ..., rescue operations, and other emergency response actions under stressful conditions ... for prolonged time periods ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Perform in unpredictable emergency requirements for prolonged periods ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Critical, time-sensitive, complex problem solving during physical exertion in stressful, hazardous environments ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Ability to communicate\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    give and comprehend verbal orders\n   </em>\n   ) ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Functioning as an integral component of a team\n   </em>\n   , where sudden incapacitation of a member can result in mission failure or in risk of injury or death to civilians or other team members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that Ms. McCrea is disabled from useful and efficient service as a firefighter.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under the Police and Firefighters' Retirement and Disability Act (\"PFRDA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-701\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to - 724 (2017 Supp.), \"[t]he terms 'disabled' and 'disability' mean disabled for useful and efficient service in the grade or class of position last occupied by the member by reason of disease or injury, not due to ... willful misconduct on his part.\" \u00a7 5-701 (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In its analysis, the Board made the following findings. Dr. Morote opined that Ms. McCrea suffers from ADAD, which makes her paranoid and mistrustful; as a result, her symptoms are so pervasive that they would prevent her \"from performing the full duties of a firefighter because she could no longer work effectively with a team\" and \"follow orders.\" In accepting Dr. Morote's opinion, the Board opined that this point is evidenced by Ms. McCrea's inability to meet the \"essential duty functions\" of a firefighter-namely, to \"communicate (give and comprehend verbal orders)\" with her co-workers and working \"as an integral component of a team, where sudden incapacitation of a member can result in mission failure or in risk of injury or death to civilians or other team members.\" The Board credited Dr. Morote's opinion and concluded that a member who is unable to complete the \"essential duty functions\" of her job is not a member performing her \"full range of duties\" pursuant to the PFRDA, \u00a7 5-701 (19), and is considered \"disabled for useful and efficient service\" in that member's capacity. \u00a7 5-701 (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dr. Mormile did not testify but the Board relied on three of Dr. Mormile's treatment updates. In August 2014, Dr. Mormile noted that \"Ms. McCrea continues to experience severe psychological symptoms that impede her ability to complete many of her job duties.\" She recommended Ms. McCrea could \"return to work in a restricted capacity\" and then \"some time\" thereafter, \"be able to return to full duty.\" In September 2014, Dr. Mormile noted that Ms. McCrea \"still experiences a significant level of distress\" but that nonetheless, Dr. Mormile \"recommended that Ms. McCrea be allowed to return to work\" that month, on a limited duty basis initially, and then within 120 days, be returned to full duty status. In her third and final treatment update dated January 2015, Dr. Mormile recommended that Ms. McCrea be returned to full duty status \"as soon as possible,\" beginning with a part-time work schedule and \"Gradual Exposure Therapy\"-\"sleeping in a secured area; limited/gradual exposure to male co[-]workers in the firehouse where the alleged assault occurred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While the Board acknowledged Dr. Mormile's assessments and recommendation, it noted that Dr. Mormile's assessment that Ms. McCrea could return to duty, with various limitations including to limit Ms. McCrea's anxiety, stress, and interactions with her co-workers, is incompatible with the essential duties of a firefighter who must work safely and effectively with a team. We conclude the Board did not err in concluding that the work limitations recommended by Dr. Mormile contradict her overall recommendation that Ms. McCrea be returned to full duty status. The Board\n   did not err in crediting Dr. Morote's assessment over that of Dr. Mormile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Board did not err in classifying Ms. McCrea's mental illness as non-POD.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The PFRDA, which is recognized as the workers' compensation plan for uniformed members of the District, provides compensation for disabling injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    O'Rourke v.

Ms. McCrea can bring a suit for her injuries under common law tort theories or any other remedy that she may be entitled to. Moreover, the record reflects complaints by Ms. McCrea \"that she had been subject to racial and sexual harassment at the Department in the past.\" Classifying Ms. McCrea's mental illness as an injury not incurred in the POD will also allow her to pursue relief for her discrimination and harassment claims with the appropriate agencies including the D.C.

Sexual harassment can take various forms, many of which may be criminally punishable. There are several examples of behaviors that \"could lead to unlawful sexual harassment if found to be pervasive,\" including \"[a]sking repeatedly for a date\" or \"[w]riting unwanted letters or poems,\" which may constitute stalking; \"[o]ffering threats if sexual favors are not provided,\" which may constitute threatening; and \"[g]rabbing, kissing, or fondling in a forcible manner; and/or [i]nitiating sexual assault and rape,\" which may constitute sexual assault and/or rape. Robert J. Nobile , Guide to Employee Handbooks \u00a7 5:20 (2018). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has also defined harassment as \"[o]ffensive conduct\" including \"physical assaults\" and \"[t]he harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, an agent of the employer, a co-worker, or a non-employee.\" U.S. Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n, Harassment , available at https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-42\">\n   Nebeker, Senior Judge, dissenting:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I am unable to convince my colleagues that the precedents they rely on should not apply to the facts of this case because the assault on petitioner, a criminal offence, is vastly different from what is\n   known as sexual harassment. That difference also lies not only in that, but that she is punished by a reduction in an annuity for the rest of her life, as distinguished from workman's compensation in lieu of a common law remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"For private sector workers, injuries from sexual harassment are not compensable in workers' compensation and the courts remain open to common law claims,\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7868751\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/665/621/\">\n    665 A.2d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and a similar rule applies for most public sector workers,\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

In light of their differing work environment and experiences, could we not make the argument that a different scheme would be appropriate? Many other jobs do not demand the close quarters and long hours where one is expected to eat and sleep on the job on a regular basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While the majority expresses concern that McCrea would be forced to settle for compensation that inadequately addresses her injury, why is the court complacent with McCrea receiving a reduction in an annuity for the remainder of her life because of its characterization of her injury?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, I continue to struggle with the majority's comparison of sexual harassment and sexual assault. While both types of behavior cause harm to the victim, I believe the resulting trauma can be very different. In looking at the D.C. Human Rights Law, Council's intent is specified as follows, \"It is the intent of the Council of the District of Columbia, in enacting this chapter, to secure an end in the District of Columbia to discrimination for any reason other than that of individual merit, including, but not limited to, discrimination by reason of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, personal appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, familial status, family responsibilities, matriculation, political affiliation, genetic information, disability, source of income, status as a victim of an intrafamily offense, and place of residence or business.\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.01\">\n    D.C.

While the Human Rights Law may be equipped to handle sexual harassment that occurs in the workplace, a sexual assault committed in the workplace while an employee is in performance of her duties seems altogether different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   What if we alter the facts slightly: What if McCrea was stabbed with a knife instead of being sexually assaulted. This stabbing would constitute assault with the intent to kill. Where would we require her to seek her relief? I am not saying that a stabbing is related to any work task, but I question what remedy would be available to her in light of this holding.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
