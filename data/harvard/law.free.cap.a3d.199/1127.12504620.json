As to the first claim, we disagree and, accordingly, affirm that aspect of the judgment of the habeas court. As to the second claim, although we agree with the petitioner that the habeas court should not have dismissed that claim as an improper successive petition under Practice Book \u00a7 23-29, we affirm that aspect of the judgment on the alternative ground that it was barred by collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The petitioner currently is serving a sentence of twenty years of incarceration after pleading guilty on October 6, 2009, to the charges of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and to being a persistent dangerous felony offender in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 18, 2011, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution (first petition). Among other things, the first petition specifically alleged that, prior to his election to plead guilty, \"[d]efense counsel failed to inform the petitioner of the applicable [charges] against him,\" including that the petitioner was being charged as a persistent dangerous felony offender. On July 13, 2013, the habeas court\n   issued an oral ruling denying the first petition, and the petitioner did not appeal therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 8, 2016, the petitioner filed two additional habeas petitions. One petition, docketed as TSR-CV-16-4007851-S (second petition), was filed pro se and sought the restoration of good time credits that the petitioner claimed he was eligible for and had been receiving. The habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Oliver, J.\n   </em>\n   , dismissed the second petition for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-24 (a) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner\n   filed a petition for certification to appeal, which was granted by the habeas court. The petitioner's appeal from the dismissal of the second petition was heard alongside this appeal, and the judgment of the habeas court was summarily affirmed by this court in a memorandum decision (AC 39028).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The other petition was docketed as TSR-CV-16-4008315-S (third petition), and it is that petition that underlies the present appeal. In the third petition, the petitioner raised several claims, including an ex post facto challenge to legislative amendments to the risk\n   reduction earned credit statutes and that his guilty plea was not voluntarily made. The risk reduction earned credit statutes provide that certain prisoners convicted of crimes committed after October 1, 1994, \"may be eligible to earn risk reduction credit toward a reduction of such person's sentence, in an amount not to exceed five days per month, at the discretion of the Commissioner of Correction\" for certain positive behaviors while incarcerated. General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e (a). Number 13-3, \u00a7 59, of the 2013 Public Acts, effective July 1, 2013, eliminated statutory language that previously permitted a prisoner's parole eligibility date to be advanced by the application of risk reduction earned credits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Number 15-216, \u00a7 9, of the 2015 Public Acts, effective October 1, 2015, amended General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e to exclude inmates convicted of being a persistent dangerous felony offender from earning risk reduction credits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 7, 2016, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.,\n   </em>\n   sua sponte dismissed the third petition pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-29. With respect to the petitioner's ex post facto claim regarding risk reduction earned credits, the court dismissed that claim for lack of jurisdiction because it concluded that there was no cognizable liberty interest in such credits. See Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Additionally, the habeas court dismissed the petitioner's challenge to the voluntariness of his guilty plea as an improper successive claim. See Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (3). Regarding that claim, the court stated in its judgment of dismissal that \"the instant petition presents the same ground as a prior petition previously denied (TSR-CV-11-4004269-S) and fails to state new facts or\n   proof of new evidence reasonably available at the time of the prior petition.\" The habeas court also concluded that, in a prior habeas proceeding, the habeas court found that the \"petitioner was made aware of his persistent felony offender status and the prosecuting authority's filing of a 'part B' information.\" The court granted certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin by setting forth our standard of review for a challenge to the dismissal of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. \"The conclusions reached by the trial court in its decision to dismiss [a] habeas petition are matters of law, subject to plenary review.... [If] the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and\n   logically correct ... and whether they find support in the facts that appear in the record.... To the extent that factual findings are challenged, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487051\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/145/416/#p301\">\n    168 Conn.

There are two aspects to this claim. The petitioner argues that the court improperly (1) failed to hold a hearing before dismissing the petition, and (2) dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded by the petitioner's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The petitioner first argues that the habeas court improperly dismissed the third petition on its own motion without holding a hearing.

Therefore, in light of binding precedent establishing the habeas court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   we find that the habeas court was not obligated to grant the petitioner a hearing before dismissing the petition and acted properly in dismissing this portion of the third petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The petitioner next argues that the habeas court improperly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction that portion of the third petition alleging an ex post facto violation regarding statutory amendments to the earned risk reduction credit program. Although the petitioner recognizes that ordinarily the habeas court's subject matter jurisdiction is predicated on the deprivation of a recognized liberty interest, the petitioner argues that \"no liberty interest is required for the petitioner to raise a cognizable ex post facto claim,\" and that being excluded from earning risk reduction credits guarantees that the petitioner will be incarcerated longer, violating the ex post facto clause. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. In 2011, while the\n   petitioner was incarcerated, the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e. Section 18-98e authorizes the Commissioner of Correction to award, in his or her discretion, risk reduction earned credits. The risk reduction earned credit program allows an eligible convicted prisoner to earn credit toward a reduction of his or her sentence. In 2015, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 18-98e, rendering persistent dangerous felony offenders, such as the petitioner, ineligible to earn risk reduction credits. See Public Acts 2015, No. 15-216, \u00a7 9 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We turn to our standard of review and applicable legal principles for this claim. \"It is well settled that [a] determination regarding a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law and, therefore, we employ the plenary standard of review and decide whether the court's conclusions are legally and logically correct and supported by the facts in the record.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Petaway\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20727\">\n    160 Conn.

Moreover, the claim fails to implicate the ex post facto clause. The traditional approach in determining whether a colorable ex post facto claim exists requires us to compare the statute that was in effect at the time of the petitioner's offense to the challenged statute. See\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489956\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/597/#p373\">\n    326 Conn. at 378-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489956\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/597/#p373\">\n    163 A.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, the petitioner committed the robbery underlying his conviction in 2009, prior to the enactment of the risk reduction earned credits statutes. Therefore, the statutory amendment excluding persistent dangerous\n   felony offenders for risk reduction earned credit eligibility simply put the petitioner in the same position that he was in when he committed the offense for which he was sentenced. The fact that the claimed liberty interest in the present matter pertains to the petitioner's maximum release date, rather than his date of parole eligibility, is immaterial because the sentence that the petitioner received based on the statutory scheme in effect at the time he committed the offense has not been changed. No ex post facto violation occurred, and no cognizable liberty interest is implicated by the petitioner's loss of risk reduction earned credits. Accordingly, the habeas court properly dismissed this portion of the third petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We next address the petitioner's claim that the habeas court improperly dismissed that portion of the third petition alleging that his guilty plea was not voluntary on the ground that the claim constituted an improper successive petition pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (3). Specifically, the petitioner argues that the third petition presents new grounds that were neither raised in the first petition nor litigated at the habeas trial in that case. According to the petitioner, because the first petition alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, and not a freestanding due process claim challenging the voluntariness of his plea, the claim raised in the third petition was not improperly successive. Although the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction (commissioner), concedes that the habeas court improperly\n   dismissed the third petition for being improperly successive, it contends that the judgment of dismissal nonetheless should be affirmed because the factual basis for the petitioner's claim was fully and fairly litigated and decided adversely to him in the first habeas action. We agree with the commissioner and, therefore, affirm the habeas court's judgment dismissing this count on the\n   alternative ground that the claim is barred by collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We begin our analysis by reviewing the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel in habeas corpus proceedings.

In the first petition, the petitioner set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel premised on an allegation that his counsel failed to inform him of the applicable charges against him. In adjudicating that claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the first habeas court was required to decide whether his defense counsel had failed to inform him of all of the charges, including the persistent dangerous felony offender charge. In the third petition, the petitioner claims that his plea was involuntary because he was not aware that he was pleading guilty to being a persistent dangerous felony offender. Therefore, although the first and third petitions present different claims, they are predicated on the same underlying factual allegation, namely, that the petitioner was not aware of the charges pending against him. The claim presented in the third petition depends on this factual allegation, which was fully and fairly litigated in the previous habeas proceeding and was decided adversely to him in that case by the habeas court.\n   Specifically, in its memorandum of decision denying the first habeas petition, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Newson, J.\n   </em>\n   , found that counsel credibly testified that the petitioner was informed that he was being charged as a persistent dangerous felony offender. The memorandum of decision stated that the court credited defense counsel's testimony that defense counsel had properly discussed and advised the petitioner of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court found that the petitioner had admitted that he understood the fact that he was facing a part B information as a persistent dangerous felony offender and that he was exposed to a sixty year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Further, Judge Newson stated, \"[a]nd so again, the substance and the length of the visits is not necessarily a correlation to the quality or the information that's delivered in those visits and the court credits counsel's testimony that the petitioner was aware. Additionally, there's a plea canvass which the petitioner appears to have made it through without any significant issues, any questions, any lack of understanding, and the law indicates that the court is allowed to rely on those answers and responses as credible and accurate when given. And when an individual is asked if he or she has any questions or lacks any understanding during the plea canvass and can answer that in the negative, then the court is allowed to accept that as accurate and truthful when given and that again presents issues when a petitioner later comes in a habeas and claims that he did not or does not understand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, the court stated, \"[a]nd again, so the record is clear ... I found in general that counsel appeared to be competent and knowledgeable ...\n   <em>\n    I credit her testimony that she provided the petitioner with all of the information necessary for him to make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary guilty plea\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Therefore, whether the petitioner entered his\n   plea knowing that he was pleading guilty to being a persistent dangerous felony offender was a fact that was fairly litigated and actually decided by the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because the habeas court necessarily decided adversely to the petitioner the underlying issue of whether he knew that he was pleading guilty to being a persistent dangerous felony offender in a previous habeas hearing, the petitioner is precluded by collateral estoppel from litigating the same issue in regard to his claim of an involuntary plea.

In conjunction with his petition, the petitioner filed an application for a waiver of fees and payment of costs and a request for the appointment of counsel, which the court clerk granted on August 26, 2016.

That provision, Practice Book (1995) \u00a7 531, provided: \"If the petitioner has filed a previous application, it and the action taken thereon shall be summarily described in the pending application. If a previous application brought on the same grounds was denied, the pending application may be dismissed without hearing, unless it states new facts or proffers new evidence not reasonably available at the previous hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In 1995, the Practice Book provisions regarding habeas corpus were substantially amended. Notably,\n   Practice Book (1995) \u00a7 531 was eliminated, thereby excising from the rules of practice the only explicit circumstance in which a petition for a writ of habeas corpus could be dismissed without an evidentiary hearing on the merits. At the same time, however, three new pertinent sections, Practice Book (1996) \u00a7\u00a7 529C, 529H, and 529S (now \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 23-29, and \u00a7 23-40, respectively), were adopted, which provide the court with alternative vehicles for summary disposition of habeas matters. Understanding the import of these changes is key to resolving the question of whether a petition may be dismissed under \u00a7 23-29 without providing the petitioner notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The 1995 amendments to the Practice Book established two distinct procedural opportunities for the habeas court to summarily dispose of a habeas corpus petition without an evidentiary hearing. Practice Book \u00a7 23-24\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   effectively vests the court with a new gatekeeping function, authorizing the court to dispose of a case before it has been docketed by declining to \"issue the writ\" for certain enumerated grounds. Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 provides for the summary disposition of a petition once the writ has already been issued. Respectfully,\n   I believe this court has blurred the important distinctions between the habeas court's gatekeeping function pursuant to \u00a7 23-24 and its authority to dismiss a pending matter for the reasons enumerated in \u00a7 23-29. Conflation of these two rules by this court has eroded the process rights of petitioners whose writs have been issued and for whom counsel has been appointed.\n   Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-24, when the habeas court exercises its gatekeeping function to decline to issue a writ, the matter is returned to the petitioner with a notation from the court setting forth the basis on which the court has declined to issue the writ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This rule reflects the historical distinction between the issuance of the writ and the adjudication of the petitioner's claims for relief, which this court explained in its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501962\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/857/#p82\">\n    184 Conn.

In my view, these sections, which are still in effect, provide procedurally different bases for the court to summarily dispose of a habeas corpus case. Section 23-24 provides a vehicle for the court to exercise a gatekeeping function to bar entry to the court of those cases in which it is patent that the court lacks jurisdiction over the claim, the petition is wholly frivolous on its face, or the relief requested in the petition is not available. Section 23-29 also provides a basis for the summary disposition of the case, but, in this instance, because \u00a7 23-29 is applicable only once the writ has been\n   issued, the petition may not then be dismissed without affording the petitioner notice and a hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 has been characterized as the successor rule to Practice Book (1995) \u00a7 531, there is a significant distinction between the two regarding a petitioner's right to a hearing. Section 531 expressly authorized the court to dismiss a successive petition \"\n   <em>\n    without hearing\n   </em>\n   unless it states new facts or proffers new evidence not reasonably available at the previous hearing\"; (emphasis added); the successor rule, \u00a7 23-29, however, contains no parallel provision. To be sure, the new rule, \u00a7 23-29, did expand the bases on which a court is authorized to summarily dispose of a petition and now includes those in which (1) the\n   court has no jurisdiction, (2) the petition fails to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted, (3) the petition presents the same ground as a previously denied petition and fails to state new facts or proffer new evidence not reasonably available at the time of the prior petition, (4) the claims asserted in the petition are moot or premature, and (5) any other legally sufficient ground for dismissal of the petition. See Practice Book \u00a7 23-29. Significantly, however, \u00a7 23-29 contains no provision authorizing the court to dismiss a pending petition without affording the petitioner a hearing and an opportunity to be heard on the motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, in my view, the 1995 revision to the Practice Book effectuated two complementary changes. On one hand, it eliminated the one basis on which a writ, once issued, could be dismissed without affording a petitioner notice and the right to be heard, while at the same time creating a vehicle, \u00a7 23-24, through which the court, in the exercise of its gatekeeping function, may turn a petition away from the court-house door by declining to issue the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   My understanding of the interplay between Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 23-24 and 23-29 is buttressed by the simultaneous adoption in 1995 of Practice Book \u00a7 23-40, which\n   newly provided, inter alia, for the right of the petitioner to be present at \"any evidentiary hearing and at any hearing or oral argument on a question of law which may be dispositive of the case ....\" Although I recognize that this rule does not explicitly require the court to conduct a hearing before dismissing a petition pursuant to \u00a7 23-29, its provisions entitling a petitioner to be present at any dispositive hearing would be rendered illusionary if a petitioner had no right to a hearing at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   My view finds support, as well, in the general Practice Book rules regarding civil actions. At the outset, it is well established that \"[h]abeas corpus is a civil proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"514431\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/159/150/#p153\">\n    159 Conn. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=267%20A.2d%20668\">\n    267 A.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970).

As will be made clear in the following paragraph, receipt of adequate notice is essential in order for the nonmoving party to exercise its right under the Practice Book to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Our rules of practice grant the nonmoving party to a motion to dismiss two opportunities to be heard. First,\n   Practice Book \u00a7 11-10 (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides the adverse party to\n   a motion to dismiss (as well as certain other specifically enumerated motions) with the opportunity to file a memorandum of law in opposition to the motion. The rules also provide the nonmovant with the right to present oral argument on the motion to dismiss at the court's short calendar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-18 (a), \"[o]ral argument is at the discretion of the judicial authority\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   as to motions to dismiss\" and certain other motions. (Emphasis added.) \"For those motions, oral argument shall be\n   <em>\n    a matter of right\n   </em>\n   , provided: (1) the motion has been marked ready in accordance with the procedure that appears on the short calendar on which the motion appears, or (2) a nonmoving party files and serves on all parties ... a written notice stating the party's intention to argue the motion or present testimony.\" (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 11-18 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Application of the foregoing rules in the context of a motion to dismiss under Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 is most straightforward when it is the respondent who makes the motion. In such circumstances, it is clear that the respondent must file a written motion and a memorandum of law and serve the same on the petitioner, thus satisfying the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 11-1. The effect of the service of the motion and brief is to provide the petitioner with the notice necessary for the petitioner to be able to (1) exercise his rights to file a memorandum of law in opposition to the motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-10 and (2) claim the matter for oral argument pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thus, where the respondent properly serves the petitioner with notice of its motion and the grounds there-for, and the petitioner simply fails to exercise his right to file a brief or make oral argument, it is clear that the habeas court may properly decide the motion without having heard from the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   I recognize, of course, that Practice Book \u00a7 23-29, unlike its parallel provision, Practice Book \u00a7 10-30,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   contemplates that a court may dismiss a petition sua sponte even where the ground for dismissal does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction. Nowhere in \u00a7 23-29, however, is there a provision for the court to act without providing notice to the petitioner and an opportunity to be heard on the court's sua sponte motion. Thus, I conclude that, because \u00a7 23-29 does not explicitly provide for the court to act sua sponte without providing notice and an opportunity for the petitioner to be heard on the motion, it is\n   unreasonable and contrary to the rules pertaining to civil matters generally for the court to import such a provision into \u00a7 23-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A review of the decisional history of this court regarding Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 reveals our inconsistent treatment of this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5650096\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/93/719/#p725\">\n    93 Conn.

The respondent argues, however, that the hearing should be limited to whether the new claims of prosecutorial impropriety should be dismissed under Practice Book \u00a7 23-29. We agree with the respondent to the extent that the second habeas petition in its current form contains a duplicative claim of ineffective assistance of counsel predicated upon the same facts and evidence as alleged in the first amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We caution, however, that nothing in this opinion should be read as foreclosing the opportunity for the petitioner, or his counsel if one is appointed for him, to amend the current petition to articulate any new facts or evidence he wants to proffer or to state new grounds upon which he believes habeas relief should be granted, including the opportunity to clarify whether his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is founded upon new facts or evidence not reasonable available at the time of his prior petition.\" Id., at 126-27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20A.3d%201123\">\n    115 A.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Notwithstanding the history of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 23-29, and 23-40, the general Practice Book rules regarding civil actions, and this court's strong admonition in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , this court has now issued decisions, including the majority's opinion in the present case, that appear to violate the thrust of\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   and contradict\n   <em>\n    Boyd's\n   </em>\n   admonition that a habeas petitioner is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before\n   his or her petition is dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 23-29.

To the extent the court mindfully fulfills its gatekeeping function pursuant to \u00a7 23-24, it may simply return the writ to the petitioner with a note indicating the basis for its decision to decline to issue the writ. If, however, a writ escapes preliminary review, the court's responsibility is more burdensome. In my view, the resolution of this conundrum does not lie in eroding the process rights of a petitioner whose writ has been issued; rather, it suggests that the court should develop a more mindful process to weed out inappropriate writs as a preliminary matter pursuant to its gatekeeping function. Although this suggestion may entail some administrative changes in the Superior Court regarding the docketing of petitions, I believe that, in the long run, a more fulsome use of the court's authority pursuant to \u00a7 23-24 would maximize judicial efficiency without the unnecessary dilution of the petitioner's process rights that attach once the writ has been issued.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    In coming to this view, I am mindful of this court's contrary conclusion in\n    <em>\n     Holliday\n    </em>\n    : \"[T]he rules of practice were promulgated to create one harmonious and consistent body of law.... If courts can by any fair interpretation find a reasonable field of operation for two [rules of practice] without destroying their evident meaning, it is the duty of the courts to do so, thus reconciling them and according to them concurrent effect.... To give effect to both Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 23-29 and 23-40, the latter section should be read to give a petitioner the right to be present at an evidentiary hearing if one is held, not to give a petitioner the absolute right to an evidentiary hearing itself.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Holliday\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Correction\n    </em>\n    , supra, 184 Conn.

In my view, the clearer route to harmonizing \u00a7 23-29 with \u00a7 23-40 is to conclude that the latter rules entitle a habeas petitioner to notice and an opportunity to be heard before dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 23-29.
