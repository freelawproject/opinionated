We incorporate our decision in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   here by reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Briefly, in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   , Blair S. Mitchell (Plaintiff) was involved in a three-car accident at an inverted \"T\" intersection on June 30, 2002, at approximately 8:15 p.m. on State Road 73 (Skippack Pike) at the road's juncture point with Weber Road, in Worcester Township, Montgomery County. Plaintiff commenced a negligence action against Defendant Milburn, Defendant James V. Lewis, and Defendant Department of Transportation (DOT). (Trial court op. at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One day into the trial, Plaintiff and Defendant Milburn settled on the record and agreed to enter into a pro-rata joint tortfeasor settlement agreement, whereby Defendant Milburn would remain on the verdict sheet for the jury to assess the proportionate share of liability among the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the close of Plaintiff's case-in-chief, the trial court granted the oral motion for a compulsory non-suit made by Defendant Lewis pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 230.1 and dismissed him from the case. On October 7, 2016, the jury returned a verdict, finding that Defendant Milburn (the defendant who settled) was negligent and that Defendant DOT was not negligent. The jury attributed 100% of the negligence to Defendant Milburn and awarded damages in the amount of $2,315,693.00 against her and in favor of Plaintiff. (Trial court op. at 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the trial court denied Plaintiff's motions for post-trial relief on February 21, 2017, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to this Court on March 16, 2017. Subsequently, this Court issued an order on April 26, 2017, directing Plaintiff to reduce the verdict in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   to a judgment on the docket.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 1, 2017, Plaintiff filed a praecipe to enter judgment under Pa.R.C.P. No. 227.4, and judgment was entered against Defendant Milburn in the amount of $2,315,693.00. (Trial court op. at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While Plaintiff's appeal in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   was pending before this Court, Defendant Milburn filed the Petition in the trial court on May 16, 2017. She argued that due to the\n   settlement agreement, it was improper and inequitable for Plaintiff to enter judgment against her and proposed that the trial court enter an order altering the jury's verdict and/or judgment and issue a revised judgment that marks the case settled as to her and enters judgment in favor of Defendants Lewis and DOT. (Trial court op. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 3, 2017, the trial court entered an order denying the Petition. On September 1, 2017, Defendant Milburn filed a notice of appeal to this Court. Both Defendant Milburn and the trial court have complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925. (Trial court op. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion dated October 23, 2017, the trial court reconsidered its ruling denying the Petition and stated that the Petition,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   should have been granted and entry of judgment against [Defendant Milburn] for the full amount of the verdict was inequitable after she executed the joint tortfeasor release. Therefore, the judgment should be opened and a new judgment should be entered consistent with Defendant Milburn's proposed Final Judgment Order.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   The court finds, however, that it is without jurisdiction to now open the current judgment and enter a new judgment since Defendant Milburn filed a notice of appeal and no timely motion for reconsideration was made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Trial court op. at 7.) The trial court, nonetheless, requested that this Court reverse its August 3, 2017 order and remand the case for entry of Defendant Milburn's proposed Final Judgment Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal to this Court, Defendant Milburn contends that her Petition functioned as a timely-filed post-trial motion in the procedural context of\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   because judgment in that case was not officially entered on the docket until May 1, 2017, and the Petition was filed on May 16, 2017. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Contrary to the argument made by Defendant Milburn, the time for filing a post-trial motion does not run from the date that judgment is officially entered on the docket. In fact, judgment cannot be entered until after the trial court rules on post-trial motions, which necessarily means that post-trial motions must precede the entry of a judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.C.P. No. 227.4(b)(2). Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 227.1(c)(1), the time for filing post-trial motions commences when the jury returns its verdict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oak Tree Condominium Association v.

Pa.R.C.P. No. 227.1(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, the jury returned its verdict in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   on October 7, 2016, and Plaintiff filed post-trial motions on October 17, 2016. No other post-trial motions were filed. On February 21, 2017, the trial court denied Plaintiff's post-trial motions. Close to three months later, on May 16, 2017, Defendant Milburn filed the Petition. As a result, the Petition was patently untimely, filed well beyond the time period permitted for filing an appeal in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   , and, therefore, the Petition cannot be construed as being the equivalent of a post-trial motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oak Tree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814284\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/133/113/6814284/#p116\">\n    133 A.3d at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Prior to the 30-day appeal period, a trial court has broad authority to modify or rescind an order, and is within its authority to exercise its discretion to decide even untimely motions where there is no objection ....

This is the general and well-recognized rule, and we conclude that it applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the appeal from\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff requested that this Court award her a new trial with respect to Defendant Lewis and Defendant DOT. As a practical matter, were this Court to deny Plaintiff relief, the judgment and verdict would be affirmed; were we to grant Plaintiff relief, the judgment and verdict would be vacated and a new trial would commence. However, in her Petition, Defendant Milburn requested that the judgment be stricken, opened, or vacated. In Pennsylvania, \"[a]n order of the court striking a judgment annuls the original judgment and the parties are left as if no judgment had been entered.\"\n   <em>\n    Crystal Lake Camps v.

Similarly, a petition to open a judgment, if granted, has the effect of opening the judgment to permit further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Gasbarini v. Medical Center of Beaver County, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1759088\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/487/266/\">\n    487 Pa. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1759088\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/487/266/\">\n    409 A.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 345 (1979). And when a judgment is vacated, the effect is \"[t]o nullify or cancel,\" \"make void,\" or \"invalidate\" the judgment. BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1688 (9th ed. 2009). By its very nature, a petition seeking to either strike, open, or vacate a judgment attacks the underlying judgment itself. Consequently, Defendant Milburn's Petition essentially requested the trial court to set aside or otherwise modify a verdict and judgment that is currently the subject matter and basis of the appeal pending in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   . Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1701(a) and its accompanying case law, Defendant Milburn lacked the legal authority to make such a request, and the trial court lacked the legal authority to rule upon such a request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Moreover, although in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell I\n   </em>\n   , Defendant Milburn remained on the verdict sheet as part of her settlement agreement, a trial court can decide not to include a settling defendant on, or remove a settling defendant from, the verdict sheet. This evidentiary decision, however, is not a mandatory or ministerial act, but instead, involves the exercise of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose v. Annabi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371997\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/934/743/#p747\">\n    934 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747 (Pa. Super. 2007). In the usual practice, a party seeks to mold or amend a verdict via post-trial motions before the verdict is reduced to a judgment. A trial court, though, cannot\n   mold or amend the verdict \"to invade the province of the jury,\" \"to satisfy the supposed equities of the case,\" or make a perceived correction \"where the intention of the jury is not obvious,\" such as \"when the question was never submitted to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    House of Pasta, Inc. v.

If a party desires a court of common pleas to take action in circumstances like these, the most appropriate remedy is to wait until the judgment becomes final and then file a petition to open the judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"196326\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/303/298/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 698-704 &amp; nn.1, 4, which is a proceeding that involves judicial discretion and invokes the trial court's equitable powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Balk v.

There is nothing in the record to sustain the notion that this is not what the jury intended, and its verdict was accurately reduced to a judgment upon\n   <em>\n    praecipe\n   </em>\n   by Plaintiff. (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 48a-49a, 138a-40a.) The entire legal theory supporting the Petition is that the verdict, as reduced to a judgment, is \"unfair\" and \"prejudicial\" to Defendant Milburn. (R.R. at 71a-72a.) Therefore, the Petition seeks relief based upon equitable and discretionary considerations and has no basis in the expressed intent of the jury. The Petition, as such, requests that the judgment be modified or amended in a manner that does not constitute the mere correction of a formal error, as that concept is envisioned and embodied in Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b)(1). The trial court, therefore, was divested of jurisdiction to rule upon the Petition in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant Milburn also argues that the trial court erred in denying the Petition on the merits in its August 3, 2017 order. For support, Defendant Milburn cites case law discussing the purpose and effect of a settlement agreement and the fact that the trial court reconsidered the matter and later found that she was entitled to relief. However, because we have determined that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide the Petition, any discussion of the merits of that Petition is unnecessary and would be advisory in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Where, as here, \"a court takes action beyond the power conferred on it by law (its jurisdiction), its action is a nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    Dover v.
