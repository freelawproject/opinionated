As police had a reasonable basis to conduct a protective sweep of Coughlin's home to confirm that no injuries had occurred following corroborated reports that he had fired an assault rifle multiple times, we conclude that police properly invoked the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment protection against warrantless entry of a home. Accordingly, we reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In August 2015, Philadelphia police responded to a radio call reporting that multiple shots had been fired in the back yard of a residence located in a high-crime neighborhood. Peering into the back yard while perched upon a wall, police observed a white male, later identified as Coughlin,\n   as well as numerous shell casings on the ground. Seeing no firearm-in the back yard or on his person-police secured Coughlin and asked him if anyone else was in the residence. Upon receiving inconsistent answers from Coughlin, police performed what they later described at the suppression hearing as a \"protective sweep\" of the home to insure that no one had been injured. On the second floor, police found and seized an assault rifle.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Notes of Testimony (N.T. Suppression), 10/11/2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Police charged Coughlin with a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act (VUFA), 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6106 ; possessing instruments of crime (PIC), 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 907 ; and recklessly endangering another person (REAP), 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2705. In February 2016, the VUFA charge was quashed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, Coughlin filed an omnibus pretrial motion, seeking suppression of the assault rifle and statements made to police following his arrest.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Omnibus Motion, 02/03/2016; N.T.

Following a hearing, the suppression court granted Coughlin's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Commonwealth timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, the Commonwealth challenged the suppression of the firearm but declined to preserve any claim regarding the suppression of Coughlin's statements. Commonwealth's Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) Statement, 11/08/2016. The court filed a responsive opinion, in which it detailed its findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the testimony of Commonwealth witness Police Officer Paul Sulock, on August 30, 2015 at approximately 9:20 p.m., Officer Sulock together with his partner [ ] responded to a radio call for a possible shooting at 1826 East Madison Street in the City and County of Philadelphia. As Officer Sulock pulled up to [ ] East Madison Street, two white females and a younger white male flagged them down. One of the white females, Jessica Cupps, told Officer Sulock that there was a white male, dressed in all black, by the name of Pat, appearing \"crazy,\" and shooting an assault rifle in the back of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Sulock and Officer Rebstock[ ] went to the back of Ms. Cupps' property at 1828 East Madison Street to obtain access to 1826 East Madison Street where the alleged shooting was reported to have occurred. When Officer Sulock got to the back of Ms. Cupps' property, he observed a seven (7) foot high cement wall separating the back yard[s of the adjoining East Madison Street properties.] While Officer Rebstock gave Officer Sulock protective cover, Officer Sulock straddled the wall, shone a flashlight into the back yard of 1826 East Madison Street, noticed bullet casings, and [Coughlin] came out of the door at a fast pace. Officer Sulock drew his weapon, ordered [Coughlin] to the ground, [Coughlin] immediately complied, and Officer Sulock promptly placed [Coughlin] in handcuffs. Officer Sulock noted that [Coughlin] was \"very\n   compliant\" with all of his commands. Once [Coughlin] was on the ground in handcuffs, Officer Sulock[ ] began to question [him]. Specifically, Officer Sulock asked [whether Coughlin] had a gun on his person and whether anyone else was inside the property. [Coughlin] responded that he did not have a weapon but was inconsistent as to whether others were inside [his residence]. At this point, there were approximately four (4) to five (5) officers on the scene while Officer Sulock stood in the back yard. At no point did Officer Sulock hear or see evidence that anyone else was in [Coughlin's] home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Suppression Court Opinion, filed January 6, 2017, at 1-2 (some formatting modified; internal citations and footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on these facts, the court rejected the Commonwealth's assertion that Coughlin's inconsistent statements aroused a valid concern that other persons-possibly injured-were in Coughlin's residence.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 7. Rather, according to the court, \"Officer's Sulock's desire to locate the gun ... is what motivated this warrantless search.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Finding no other exigencies to justify the warrantless entry, the court concluded that police had violated Coughlin's constitutional rights and that suppression of the gun was appropriate.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before this Court, the Commonwealth renews its argument that the suppression court erred in suppressing the firearm seized during a protective sweep of Coughlin's residence. Commonwealth's Br. at 3. According to the Commonwealth, the relevant inquiry is whether the police had an objectively reasonable basis for their sweep.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 9 (citing in support\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Michigan v.

Based upon the statements from Ms. Cupps, as corroborated by police, the Commonwealth asserts there was probable cause to believe that Coughlin had fired a weapon multiple times. Moreover, his inconsistent statements regarding other persons in the residence made it not only objectively reasonable, but also \"imperative to check if he had hurt anyone on the premises.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 10. The Commonwealth cautions against a \"hindsight evaluation\" of whether an emergency actually existed, suggesting rather that conscientious police officers should err on the side of caution.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In response, Coughlin asserts there was no evidence to support a reasonable belief that anyone was injured or inside his home. Coughlin's Br. at 5. For example, according to Coughlin, police \"did not see blood, hear cries for help, [or] receive reports of an assault.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Moreover, according to Coughlin, the suppression court specifically rejected Officer Sulock's testimony that he entered the house to ensure no one was injured, thus eliminating the sole exigency offered by the Commonwealth.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Our standard and scope of review are well settled.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   When the Commonwealth appeals from a suppression order, this Court follows a clearly defined scope and standard of review. We consider only the evidence from the defendant's witnesses together with the evidence of the prosecution that, when read in the context of the entire record, remains uncontradicted.

The suppression court found no evidence that \"anyone else was in [Coughlin's] home.\" Suppression Ct. Op. at 2. The record does not support this finding. Officer Sulock testified consistently that Coughlin presented conflicting accounts of whether other people were inside the residence.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T. Suppression at 13, 18, 28, 32, 37. Thus, Coughlin's own statements to police provided evidence, albeit inconclusive, that others were inside his home.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , N.T. Suppression at 13 (\"I asked this male if there was anybody else in the property. At first he stated yes[.]\"). Importantly, the court did not reject the credibility of this testimony. Quite the contrary, the suppression court accepted this testimony explicitly when it acknowledged that \"[Coughlin] ... was inconsistent as to whether others were inside.\" Suppression Ct. Op. at 2 n.2;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T. Suppression at 43 (explicitly finding Officer Sulock credible apart from his asserted reason for entering home).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This finding is further undermined by the suppression court's erroneous suggestion that \"Officer Sulock clearly testified that he observed no indication (seeing blood, hearing cries, or otherwise) of another person.\" Suppression Ct. Op. at 7 n.3. We have reviewed Officer Sulock's testimony and conclude that the suppression court's suggestion is misleading. At no time was Officer Sulock asked whether he saw blood or heard cries from another person. Rather, the court itself opined, during argument following testimony, that the absence of such testimony was concerning. N.T. Suppression at 43.

The trial court denied a motion to suppress, and this Court affirmed. Based on the facts presented, and noting the incident occurred in a high-crime area, we concluded that \"the officers reasonably believed that there was an immediate threat of violence.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422882,12422893\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/985/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422882,12422893\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/985/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422882,12422893\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/985/\">\n    at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, the undisputed evidence at the suppression hearing was that Coughlin had fired an assault rifle numerous times in a neighborhood known for gun violence. While the initial report suggested that he was shooting the firearm in his back yard, the report did not foreclose a reasonable possibility that one or more of the shots was fired inside the residence. When Ms. Cupps flagged down the police, she warned Officer Sulock to be careful and described Coughlin as acting \"crazy,\" not unlike the defendant in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While police officers are accustomed to investigating such reports, there can be no doubt that Coughlin's actions had created a particularly dangerous situation, the full extent of which could not be known to Officer Sulock and the other officers when they approached Coughlin's residence. Of course, the gravity of the situation increased further when Officer Sulock observed spent shells in Coughlin's back yard, thus corroborating the initial report. It can hardly be overstated that a credible report of multiple shots fired from an assault rifle in a residential neighborhood presents danger far greater than the brief altercation observed in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brigham City\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   or\n   the initial observations by police in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , where the defendant was merely throwing things around his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We must also consider the interaction between Officer Sulock and Coughlin. Upon securing Coughlin and failing to observe the reported firearm, Officer Sulock inquired whether anyone else was in the home. Clearly, this was a reasonable inquiry. A second person potentially involved in the reported shooting could pose a risk to others if this person was in possession of the firearm. But Coughlin's inconsistent answers raised another reasonable concern-that another person in the house could be a victim, not an accomplice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The suppression court discounted the significance of Coughlin's inconsistent statements. In its view, Coughlin's inconsistency \"was better explained by the possible mental health issue described by eyewitnesses.\" Suppression Ct. Op. at 8. In support of this inference, the court continued, \"It must be specifically noted that the eyewitness in this case was also [Coughlin's] neighbor who clearly was in a greater position of knowledge concerning [Coughlin's] mental health and residential occupancy than the police officers involved.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422882,12422893\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/985/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 8 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We reject, on this record, the court's inference that Coughlin suffered from mental illness.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Champney\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317117\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/265/#p271\">\n    161 A.3d at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The single, evidentiary source for this finding occurred during Officer Sulock's direct testimony. In describing how he gained access to the back yard of Coughlin's property, Officer Sulock testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Ms. Cupps] stated that there was a male in the rear shooting an assault rifle off the back of that property. ... I asked her for a description of the male, and she said it was a white male wearing all black that goes by the name of Pat. I asked [Ms. Cupps] if I could enter her property to get to the rear and she let me through and stated to me be careful,\n   <em>\n    he is crazy shooting a gun\n   </em>\n   . I asked her if he was still out there and she stated she believed so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   N.T. Suppression at 11-12 (emphasis added). In our view, the statement, \"he is crazy shooting a gun,\" is merely colloquial. But whether Ms. Cupps' intention was colloquial or clinical, this passing reference to Coughlin's behavior is inadequate to support the court's analysis. Furthermore, even assuming Coughlin's alleged mental illness were an established fact, it would not, on this record, dispel the officer's reasonable concern that an accomplice or a victim might be in the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The suppression court also stressed that there was no blood found, no cries for help, or other readily apparent evidence that someone had been injured. Suppression Ct. Op. at 8. However, the Supreme Court has rejected analyses that quantify blood evidence found at the scene.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639144\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/45/\">\n    558 U.S. at 48-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639144\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/45/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"mere drops of blood\" sufficient to invoke emergency aid exception);\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brigham City\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275413\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/398/#p403\">\n    547 U.S. at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275413\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/398/#p403\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similarly concluding bloody lip sufficient). Moreover, the Court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   voiced concern for\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   human targets, neither seen nor heard.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639144\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/45/\">\n    558 U.S. at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639144\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/45/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Practically speaking, here, any injuries caused by Coughlin inside the residence would not produce blood in the back yard. Thus, the absence of such evidence is of little consequence. In this regard, the facts are more compelling than those in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ford\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , where no shots were fired and where there was no evidence of injury.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ford\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422882,12422893\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/985/\">\n    175 A.3d at 990-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In our view, Coughlin's interaction with police is reminiscent of the \"ominous circumstances\" recognized by the Supreme Court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Here, too, police confronted a dangerous situation. Coughlin's\n   inconsistent statements exacerbated it. While there was no proof that Coughlin had injured someone, under these circumstances it was reasonable for police to\n   <em>\n    confirm\n   </em>\n   that he had not. As the Supreme Court has instructed, \"[i]t does not met the needs of law enforcement or the demands of public safety to require officers to walk away\" from a potentially life-threatening situation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639144\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/45/\">\n    558 U.S. at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639144\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/45/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we reject a hindsight determination that there was no emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Regarding the scope of the police intrusion into Coughlin's residence, we discern no overly broad conduct by the police. Here, unlike in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wilmer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , no facts established that police entered the home on multiple occasions or that they discovered the firearm upon reentry, after they had confirmed no injured persons were present. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the suppression court voiced concern that police searched both the first and second floor of the home.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T. Suppression at 49 (rejecting search of second floor but suggesting cursory sweep of first floor permissible). This concern is without merit. Coughlin could have injured someone on either floor of his home, and it would defy reason for police to limit their emergency aid to victims located on the first floor alone. Thus, under these circumstances, we conclude that the search by police need not have been limited to the first floor of Coughlin's residence and that their search was strictly circumscribed by the exigencies that justified its initiation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wilmer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501488\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/564/#p567\">\n    194 A.3d at 571-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204537275\">\n    2018 WL 4537275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, it was error for the suppression court to ascribe an ulterior motivation to Officer Sulock's decision to enter Coughlin's residence.

While this multi-factor analysis enables a determination of exigent circumstances where the relevant inquiry is whether police action to preserve evidence of a crime or apprehend a defendant conformed to the protections of the Fourth Amendment, it is of limited utility in a case such as this, where the appropriate inquiry is whether police reasonably believed that someone inside a residence was in need of immediate assistance.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Brigham City\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275413\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/398/#p403\">\n     547 U.S. at 403, 405\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275413\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/398/#p403\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1943\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (describing certain\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Roland\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    factors, including \"imminent destruction of evidence,\" \"hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect,\" and \"gravity of the underlying offense\" as distinct exceptions to warrant requirement).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
