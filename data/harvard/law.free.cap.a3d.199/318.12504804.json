The issue is whether the portion of restricted stock transferred to plaintiff by his employer, which vests after the date of the complaint, is subject to equitable distribution if the vesting is contingent upon plaintiff's post-complaint employment efforts. The trial judge concluded defendant S.M. was entitled to fifty percent of all stock awards made before or near the date of complaint. However, because the judge's decision is contrary to the evidence and his credibility findings, and mistaken as a matter of law, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from the record. The parties were married in May 1998. In 2001, plaintiff became employed as a principal consultant for a large multi-national corporation. Beginning in August 2003, and every August thereafter until 2010, plaintiff received a stock award from his employer. According to plaintiff's testimony and a corresponding summary, the stock awarded would vest in yearly tranches. For example, plaintiff received 490 shares in 2003. Those shares began to vest at a rate of 174 shares per year commencing in 2011. A similar vesting schedule was applied to the subsequent stock transfers, such that the stock awards and the vesting occurred on a rolling basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint for divorce on July 28, 2014. By then, he had been granted eight stock awards. However, only three had fully vested and the remainder were due to vest post-complaint, beginning on August 31, 2014, and every August thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, plaintiff also produced an informational document from his employer entitled \"Overview of Stock Awards,\" which plaintiff, on questioning by the trial judge, confirmed contained the employer's policy. In pertinent part, the document stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Stock-based compensation is a key component of our reward program ... because it provides an ownership stake in the company's success for employees who contribute over the long term. To preserve this core element of our culture, in July 2003, [we] decided to grant employees stock awards, which represent the future right to receive shares of ... stock when a vesting requirement is satisfied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   At [our company] we believe that employees who become shareholders maintain a long-term, vested interest in sustained individual excellence and the overall success of the company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Each eligible employee's annual stock award grant is based on his or her impact, level, and country.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Furthermore, plaintiff testified the stock plan was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   the way [the employer] retain[s] their employees and they want to make sure that you consistently perform better so if the year that it vests, if you don't perform well, it gives them reason to let you go and you don't get those [stocks], so you have to be consistently performing at a better level to be able to take advantage of the stocks that they give you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the judge's questioning, plaintiff's attorney asked plaintiff: \"Now with regard to equitable distribution ... do you acknowledge that some of those stocks should be distributed to [defendant]?\" Plaintiff agreed he would share the stocks \"already vested\" with defendant as equitable distribution. Defendant did not refute any of plaintiff's testimony regarding the stock plan, the awards he received, the\n   conditions for vesting, or the basis on which the employer made the awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the conclusion of the trial, the judge rendered a thirty-nine page written decision addressing custody and parenting time, equitable distribution, alimony, child support, and counsel fees. In the section of his opinion addressing credibility the judge opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The [c]ourt finds [p]laintiff to be credible. After observing him during his testimony, the [c]ourt determined that he was honest and sincere. His description of events was logical and supported by the facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   On the other hand, the [c]ourt does not find [d]efendant credible. Many of her claims were unsupported by facts or reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Regarding plaintiff's restricted stock units, the judge continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") awarded to [p]laintiff as part of his compensation package vest over a five-year vesting schedule. As the stocks vest, they are reflected in [p]laintiff's W-2 for that year. Plaintiff concedes that [d]efendant is entitled to share in the [RSUs] that were vested as of the date of filing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff takes the position that the RSUs awarded on August 31, 2014 are exempt from equitable distribution based upon the post-[complaint] status of their receipt. This is incorrect. The 2014 award, not the vesting of that award, created a marital asset which will vest in five years and whose value is as of yet uncertain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The 2014 award was made in recognition of [p]laintiff's past job performance. Said past performance was during the marriage, making the units subject to equitable distribution. In\n   <em>\n    Pascale v. Pascale\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331449\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/583/\">\n    140 N.J. 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331449\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/583/\">\n    660 A.2d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995),] the Court found that stock options awarded after the marriage has terminated, but obtained as a result of efforts expended during the marriage should be subject to equitable distribution.

In the certification accompanying the motion, plaintiff stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Additionally, I believe the [c]ourt erred and there is a mistake with regard to my stock options. The [c]ourt analyzed my ... stock ... [in its] decision and cited [\n   <em>\n    Pascale\n   </em>\n   ] ... specifically finding that RSUs award[ed] to plaintiff up to and including the August 2014 award are the result of pre-[complaint] marital efforts and thus subject to equitable distribution. I enclose ... literature from ... my employer[ ] regarding options. The information provided ... clearly indicates that the \"awardees's rights in the [stock awards] shall be affected, with regard to both vesting schedule and termination, by leaves of absence, changes in the number of hours worked, partial disability, and other changes in awardee's employment status as provided in the company's current policies for these matters.\" Clearly, [the] stock[s] were\n   performance options and a reward for staying with my employer and a reward for future performance. As such, ... defendant should not share in these options that have not vested as of the date of filing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The document plaintiff referenced in his certification was his employer's stock award agreement pursuant to its stock plan. In addition to the language plaintiff quoted from the document, it also provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2. Vesting Schedule and Conversion of [Stock Awards].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (a) Subject to the terms of this Award Agreement and the Plan\n   <em>\n    and provided that Awardee remains continuously employed\n   </em>\n   through the vesting dates set out below, the [stock awards] shall vest and be converted into an equivalent number of Common Shares as set out below[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Notably, the employer's cover letter enclosing stock plan documents stated: \"We look forward to you making a positive impact on [the company's] future success and sharing in that success as a shareholder in our Company.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The judge denied plaintiff's motion, concluding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A presumption exists that stock awards result from joint, marital efforts and are thus subject to equitable distribution.\n   <em>\n    Pascale v. Pascale\n   </em>\n   [.]... Plaintiff's literature from [his employer] going over the general details of the stock plan fails to overcome this presumption that it was received through spousal efforts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We defer to a trial judge's factfinding \"when supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Cesare v.

The plan documents and literature adduced in evidence at trial, and attached to plaintiff's post-judgment motion, stated vesting would occur dependent upon plaintiff's post-complaint performance. We reject defendant's argument that\n   \"performance\" in this case required plaintiff merely to continue living and go to work. Nothing in the record supports this assertion. Indeed, all of the objective evidence in the record demonstrates much more was required of plaintiff as a high-level corporate employee in a highly competitive industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As we noted, plaintiff's employer described the stock plan as a \"reward program ... because it provides an ownership stake in the company's success for employees who contribute over the long term.\" Company literature explained the stock grants were to \"maintain a long-term, vested interest in sustained individual excellence and the overall success of the company.\" This language does not suggest the stock would vest through mere continued employment without consideration of plaintiff's level of proficiency. Nor does this language suggest the stock awards were for work already performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The company plan documentation, and other literature in the record, was consistent with plaintiff's testimony. Plaintiff explained the purpose of the stock award was to retain him and assure he \"consistently perform[ed] at a better level.\" As plaintiff noted, \"if you don't perform well, it gives them reason to let you go and you don't get those [stocks.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The trial judge misapplied his discretion because in the absence of any evidence or testimony to the contrary, he concluded the stock was earned for work performed during the marriage. The judge's findings were unsupported by the evidence and inconsistent with his own credibility findings. As we noted, the judge found plaintiff's testimony entirely credible, and reached the opposite conclusion regarding defendant. Our review of the record confirms the judge was required to reach a different result regarding the unvested stock awards in existence as of the date of complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Turning now to the mechanics of distribution, at oral argument and in his brief, plaintiff suggests we follow a coverture fraction analysis, or alternatively, consider applying the concept of \"marital momentum\" to address the equitable distribution of the unvested stock awards. The concept of\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"[m]omentum of the marriage\" recognizes the reality that in many instances, one's occupational efforts often start off by yielding small and modest level earnings.

In making such a finding, the judge may look to the employee's stock option plan, testimony from the employee or a representative of the employer, or testimony from an expert witness, if any such evidence is offered.... The judge also may consider any other relevant factors or circumstances surrounding the grant, including whether the options were \"intended to (1) secure optimal tax treatment, (2) induce the employee to accept employment, (3) induce the employee to remain with the employer, (4) induce the employee to leave his or her employment, (5) reward the employee for completing a specific project or attaining a particular goal, [or] (6) be granted on a regular or irregular basis.\" ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   The party challenging the inclusion of the options in the marital estate (presumably, the employee who was given the options) has the burden of proving that the options were given for future services to be performed after dissolution of the marriage. In addition, this party has the burden of establishing that the non-employee spouse did not contribute\n   to the employee spouse's ability to acquire the options at issue and, for that reason, the value of the options either in whole or in part should not be considered part of the marital estate....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   If the party with the burden of proof establishes that the options were given in whole or in part for future services to be performed after dissolution of the marriage, and the judge determines that equity requires that the options be apportioned, the judge must calculate the portion of the options that properly may be included in the marital estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331449\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/583/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331449\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/583/\">\n    at 729-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (citations omitted).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We adopt the rubric suggested in\n   <em>\n    Baccanti\n   </em>\n   , with slight modifications and hold as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (1) Where a stock award has been made during the marriage and vests prior to the date of complaint it is subject to equitable distribution;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (2) Where an award is made during the marriage for work performed during the marriage, but becomes vested after the date of complaint, it too is subject to equitable distribution; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   (3) Where the award is made during the marriage, but vests following the date of complaint, there is a rebuttable presumption the award is subject to equitable distribution unless there is a material dispute of fact regarding whether the stock, either in whole or in part, is for future performance. The party seeking to exclude such assets from equitable distribution on such grounds bears the burden to prove the stock award was made for services performed outside of the marriage. That party must adduce objective evidence to prove the employer intended the stock to vest for future services and not as a form of deferred compensation attributable to the award date. Such objective evidence should include, but is not limited to, the following: testimony from the employed spouse; testimony of the employer's representative; the stock plan; any employer correspondence to the employed spouse regarding the award; and the employed spouse's stock plan statements from commencement of the award and nearest the date of complaint, along with the vesting schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Had the trial judge applied these principles to the evidence before him, plaintiff would, for example, have handily rebutted the presumption the August 31, 2014 award was entirely subject to equitable distribution. Indeed, plaintiff's testimony, the stock plan award correspondence, award and vesting schedules, and the stock plan itself, strongly suggest the unvested awards were either in whole or in part unattributed to the marriage. Thus, to that extent, the stocks would not be subject to equitable distribution. We recognize there was little guidance for the trial judge on this matter. Nor did the parties have the benefit of this opinion in presenting their\n   arguments to the trial court. For these reasons we reach no final conclusion and remand to the judge for further proceedings and to make further findings pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23.1 and the factors discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Reversed and remanded.

However, citing the broad discretion possessed by its family court judges, the court found \"that one formula will not necessarily work in every case\" and declined to adopt the time rule as the exclusive means of dividing the asset.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331449\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/583/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331449\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/583/\">\n     at 731\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
