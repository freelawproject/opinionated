C.S. \u00a7 1547(b) (Implied Consent Law), as a result of Licensee's refusal to submit to chemical testing upon his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance (DUI).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   While traveling northbound in a marked police vehicle on a two-lane road at approximately 9:15 p.m. on the night of November 11, 2016, Upper Merion Township police officer Brian Manion observed Licensee's vehicle cross the road's double yellow center line as it approached in the opposite lane of traffic, requiring Officer Manion to move his vehicle into the emergency lane on his side of the road. Notes of Testimony (N.T.) 11/13/2017 at 3-4, 13, 15. Once Licensee's vehicle passed his patrol car, Officer Manion made a U-turn, caught up to, and followed Licensee's vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 15. After observing Licensee's vehicle cross the center line two more times, Officer Manion engaged his emergency lights and siren and initiated a traffic stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After stopping the vehicle, Officer Manion approached the vehicle on the passenger's side and made contact with Licensee. N.T. 11/13/2017 at 5. Licensee rolled down his window and Officer Manion immediately detected a strong odor of alcohol emanating from Licensee's breath.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 17. Officer Manion also observed Licensee's eyes were glassy and his speech was slurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 21. Licensee told Officer Manion that he was going home, but he was not sure from where he was coming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Officer Manion collected Licensee's license, registration, and insurance information and returned to his patrol vehicle, where he called for backup.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Once the requested backup arrived, Officer Manion asked Licensee to alight from his vehicle and perform three field sobriety tests. N.T. 11/13/2017 at 5, 18. After Officer Manion demonstrated the field sobriety tests, Licensee attempted but failed to satisfactorily perform all three.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Based on Licensee's performance on the field sobriety tests, Officer Manion administered a portable breath test (PBT).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 20. The PBT registered Licensee's blood alcohol content at 0.20%, above the legal limit of 0.08%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Licensee failed the field sobriety tests and the PBT, Officer Manion took him into custody for DUI and placed him in the back seat of his patrol vehicle. N.T. 11/13/2017 at 7. Once Licensee was in the back of the patrol vehicle, Officer Manion read him the entire DOT DL-26B Request for Chemical Testing form (DL-26B form) verbatim and requested that Licensee consent to chemical testing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, 22. Licensee refused to submit to chemical testing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 23-24. Following Licensee's refusal to consent to chemical testing, Officer Manion transported Licensee back\n   to the police station for processing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 14, 2015, following his conviction for DUI, DOT mailed Licensee a letter notifying him that, as a result of his refusal to submit to chemical testing on November 11, 2016, his license would be suspended pursuant to the Implied Consent Law for 12 months, effective January 25, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   License Suspension Hearing Exhibit C-1. Licensee appealed and the trial court conducted a hearing on Licensee's license suspension appeal on November 13, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.T. 11/13/2017. On January 11, 2018, following the hearing and briefing by the parties, the trial court entered its order denying Licensee's appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Court Order dated January 11, 2018.

First, Licensee claims that the trial court's finding that Licensee refused chemical testing was not supported by competent evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Licensee's Brief at 4. Second, Licensee alleges that license suspensions imposed pursuant to Pennsylvania's Implied Consent Law are punitive and not civil in nature and therefore unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v.

In the instant matter, Licensee does not challenge that he was driving the vehicle, that police had probable cause upon which to arrest him and request that he submit to chemical testing, or that the police read him the DOT DL-26B form that warned that refusal would result in a license suspension.

Officer Manion testified Licensee understood what Officer Manion explained, read, and requested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Although he could not recall Licensee's exact response to being asked whether he would consent to chemical testing, Officer Manion repeatedly testified that he understood Licensee's reply to be a refusal to submit to the requested chemical testing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 24, 28. The trial court credited Officer Manion's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Court Opinion at 11. Additionally, DOT submitted, and the trial court accepted, the DL-26B form and other certified documents related to Licensee's suspension into evidence at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DL-26B form included certifications signed by Officer Manion that: (1) he read Licensee the DL-26B warnings\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) Licensee refused to sign\n   the form after being advised of the warnings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit C-1, DL-26B form. The DL-26B form also included an affidavit signed by Officer Manion attesting that: (1) Licensee was placed under arrest for DUI; (2) Officer Manion had requested Licensee submit to blood testing; (3) Officer Manion had read the DL-26B warnings to Licensee; and (4) Licensee had refused to submit to blood testing after having been read the warnings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Licensee offered neither testimony nor documentary evidence to rebut Officer Manion's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on this evidence the trial court determined Licensee refused to consent to the chemical testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Court Opinion at 9-11. The trial court found the testimony of Officer Manion and the DL-26B form submitted into evidence supported a conclusion that Licensee refused to provide unqualified, unequivocal consent to chemical testing when it was requested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the trial court found that Licensee's argument that his response may have been misinterpreted was largely speculative and unsupported by the testimony presented, which the court found credible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the trial court noted that Licensee presented no authority for the proposition that a police officer's failure to record or testify verbatim as to the response a licensee provided in refusing to consent to chemical testing invalidates a refusal-based license suspension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination that Licensee refused to consent to the requested chemical testing. Officer Manion repeatedly stated in his testimony, which the trial court credited, that Licensee refused to consent to chemical testing when requested. That Officer Manion could not recall Licensee's exact words did not serve to negate the officer's repeated, unequivocal testimony that Licensee refused to consent to chemical testing when requested. The DL-26B form entered into evidence corroborated Officer Manion's testimony and further supported the trial court's finding that Licensee failed to consent to chemical testing in an unqualified and unequivocal fashion. Additionally, Licensee offered no evidence to establish that he either was not capable of making a knowing and conscious refusal or was physically unable to take the test. We decline Licensee's invitation to reweigh the evidence presented in this matter and consequently find no merit to Licensee's argument that the trial court erred in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Next, Licensee argues that the license suspensions imposed pursuant to the Implied Consent Law are unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v.

Cmwlth. 2014) (disqualification of a commercial driver's license). Likewise, the second factor,\n   whether the sanction has historically been regarded as punishment, weighs against Licensee because the suspension of an individual's driving privilege has traditionally been considered a civil sanction as opposed to a criminal punishment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914284\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/100/326/6914284/#p331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914284\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/100/326/6914284/#p331\">\n    at 331-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Regarding the fourth factor, while the goal of the Implied Consent Law is to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth by deterring drunk driving, \"[r]etribution ... has not been recognized as a goal of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Abraham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232973\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/619/293/\">\n    619 Pa. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7308212,4232973\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/62/343/\">\n    62 A.3d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352 (2012). The fifth factor asks whether the behavior to which the sanction applies is already a crime. While DUI is a crime, refusing a request for consent to submit to chemical testing is not, and so this factor weighs against Licensee as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Bird\n   </em>\n   , 134 Pa.Cmwlth. 305,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1405019\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/134/305/#p1348\">\n    578 A.2d 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1348 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1990) (\"The implied consent law is not a criminal statute, but a condition precedent to obtaining driving privileges in this [C]ommonwealth.\"). The sixth and seventh factors concern whether the sanction has an alternative, non-punitive purpose and whether it is excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.
