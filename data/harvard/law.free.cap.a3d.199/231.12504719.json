Mitchell, J.\n   </em>\n   ) denying the Tribe's motion to intervene in a child protective action involving nonmember children, following the removal of the children from the custody of their mother, who resided within the Tribe's territory. The Tribe contends that the court erred in determining that the Department of Health and Human Services' removal of the children from its territory was not impermissible state regulation of an internal tribal matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   30 M.R.S. \u00a7 6206(1) (2017). Because we find no error in the court's determination, we affirm the court's denial of the Tribe's motion for intervention of right, filed pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2), and the denial of the Tribe's motion for permissive intervention, filed pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 24(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 2] The following is derived from the court's factual findings, all of which are supported by competent evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grondin v.

Although the mother is a member of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, neither the father nor the children are members, or eligible to become members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time the petition was filed, the children were living with the mother on the Passamaquoddy reservation at Indian Township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In February 2018, the Department requested a preliminary protection order, seeking custody of the children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4034 (2017). The mother waived her right to a summary preliminary hearing except as to the issue of placement. She requested that the children be placed with their maternal grandmother, who is also a member of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and who lives on the reservation. After a hearing, the court denied the mother's request and allowed the Department\n   to seek foster placement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department placed the children in foster care outside of Indian Township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Following the Department's removal of the children from their mother's care, the Tribe filed a motion to intervene, alleging that Maine Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) provided for intervention of right, because the Department's removal of the children from the Tribe's territory constituted impermissible state regulation of an \"internal tribal matter[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   30 M.R.S. \u00a7 6206(1). Alternatively, the Tribe sought permissive intervention, pursuant to Rule 24(b), asserting that the underlying child protective action and its claim of tribal sovereignty have a question of law in common. The court denied the Tribe's motion to intervene, and the Tribe timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Rule 24(a)(2) permits a nonparty to intervene, as a matter of right, if three criteria are met: \"(1) [the nonparty] must claim an interest in the property or transaction that is the subject of the action; (2) it must be so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede its ability to protect its interests; and (3) its interests must not be adequately represented by the existing parties to the action.\"\n   <em>\n    Bangor Publ'g Co. v.

Alternatively, permissive intervention is available when a \"[nonparty's] claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common\" and intervention will not \"unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\" M.R. Civ. P. 24(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Under either path for the Tribe's intervention, the pivotal issue before us is whether the court's order, issued pursuant to Title 22, granting the Department custody of children in jeopardy constitutes an impermissible state intervention into \"internal tribal matters.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   30 M.R.S. \u00a7 6206(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 8] We review the denial of a motion to intervene for error of law or abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Based on this assertion, the Tribe claims a right to intervene in this child protective matter.

This right is specifically memorialized in section 6206(1) of the Implementing Act, which the Tribe has recognized as giving it the \"unquestioned right to determine if and when a person may reside within Indian Territory.\"\n   <em>\n    Indian Twp.

Here, neither\n   the court nor the Department has, or is, attempting to regulate who may or may not reside within an Indian territory. As the court correctly held, a child protective proceeding in no way \"calls into question the right of the Tribe to determine who is able or not able to reside on its reservation or within its territory.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 14] In addition, the Implementing Act specifically acknowledged and retained the existing structure of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.

If the children who are the subject of this action were members of the Tribe, or eligible to become members, then the ICWA would apply and the Passamaquoddy court would be able to assert jurisdiction over these children, or at a minimum, the Tribe would have had the statutory right to intervene in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201911\">\n    25 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LEXIS through Pub.

As the Court recognizes in its opinion\n   <em>\n    In re Children of Shirley T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20ME%201\">\n    2019 ME 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12504718\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/199/221/\">\n    199 A.3d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , also published today, preserving access to tribal culture is important for children with a parent or parents who are members of a tribe.\n   <em>\n    Shirley T\n   </em>\n   . quotes the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, enacted in 1978, which states \"that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions,\" and \"that the States ... have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201901\">\n    25 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) - (5) (LEXIS through Pub. L. No. 115-281).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b6 21] In the matter before us, for the safety of the children, the District Court (Calais,\n   <em>\n    D. Mitchell, J.\n   </em>\n   ) rejected the request to place the children in a kinship placement with their maternal grandmother. Instead, it authorized the Department of Health and Human Services to seek a foster placement for the children off the reservation and with caregivers who are not related to the children and are not members of the Passamaquoddy Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b6 22] With the prospect of the children being removed from their Passamaquoddy relatives and the reservation community, the Passamaquoddy Tribe sought to intervene as a matter of right or, alternatively, with the court's permission. M.R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2), (b). The Tribe argued that, pursuant to 30 M.R.S. \u00a7 6206(1) (2017), the children's right to reside with their relatives on the reservation constituted an \"internal tribal matter\" that \"shall not be subject to regulation by the State.\" Accordingly, the Tribe argued that it had an independent interest and a right to at least be heard regarding proper placement of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 23] The District Court denied the Tribe's motion to intervene, and the Court today affirms. From the Court's affirmance of the denial of the Passamaquoddy Tribe's effort to be heard regarding placement of children of a member of the Passamaquoddy Tribe who have lived on the Passamaquoddy Reservation, we respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b6 24] Although we concur with the Court's determination that the Tribe's concern about removal of the children from the reservation does not constitute an internal tribal matter that would allow the Tribe to intervene as a matter of right, that conclusion does not decide the issue. As the Tribe asserts, their participation in decisions related to the placement and resources available to the children are matters of importance to the court in addressing the needs of the children, whose mother is a member of the Passamaquoddy Tribe. The Tribe's role, distinct from the role of family members, is important in informing the court of options regarding tribal resources and connections\n   to tribal culture. As the Tribe argues, \"[g]iven the well-established, horrific history of forced acculturation and state agencies removing children from their tribal families and forcing them to live off the reservation,\" the Tribe's request to remain a resource for the children and the court is compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b6 25] Although the Tribe's argument that these factors and this history give it a right to participate pursuant to 30 M.R.S. \u00a7 6206(1) is unpersuasive on the facts of this case, these factors and this history demonstrate that, in the proper exercise of its discretion, the District Court should have found a method of involvement for the Tribe that would benefit the children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4005-D(1)(C)-(E) (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   With such involvement, the District Court could properly consider information from the Tribe regarding conditions and resources on the reservation and important cultural factors that may favor the children returning to reside on the reservation or having continued meaningful contact with members and the culture of the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b6 26] In a footnote, the Court does suggest other ways the Tribe might be allowed to participate.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 8. However, those alternatives do not appear to have been considered by the parties, and there is no certainty of any participation on remand. We would vacate the trial court's denial of the Tribe's motion to intervene and remand for the court to consider which type of participation by the Tribe would best allow the Tribe to have meaningful input regarding the children's connection to their Indian heritage.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Because the children are not members, or eligible to become members, of the Tribe, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201901\">\n     25 U.S.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1901\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -1963 (LEXIS through Pub.
