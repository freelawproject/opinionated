The self-represented plaintiff, Lisa Bruno, appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the defendant Heritage Homes Construction Company,\n   LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court (1) improperly concluded that she failed to prove actual damages resulting from the defendant's breach of a residential construction contract and (2) exceeded the scope of the remand order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As this court has previously observed, the present case \"arises from dealings between the parties concerning the construction by [the defendant] of a new home in Ridgefield for [the plaintiff] and her former husband, Stephen Bruno (Bruno).\" Id., at 188-89,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20899\">\n    130 A.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In her operative complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant, as a party \"to a contract with herself and Bruno to build the new home, had breached the contract ... by conspiring with Bruno to launder his money through the project, and thus to deprive her of fair, just and reasonable alimony and division of assets in connection with\n   the impending dissolution of her marriage. On that score, the plaintiff alleged, more particularly, that by December, 2005, when Bruno initiated marital dissolution proceedings against her, construction of the new home was nearly complete for what by then was the total sum of approximately $1,800,000. Thereafter, however, from December, 2005, to January, 2006, and from May, 2006, to July, 2006, Bruno paid [the defendant] additional sums totaling approximately $2,600,000, all purportedly for expenditures on the project that she did not authorize.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruno\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whipple\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779582\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/138/496/#p498\">\n    138 Conn.

More specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant breached the construction contract by failing to provide her with (1) invoices on a biweekly basis and\n   (2) written change orders regarding modifications to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A trial was held in 2013. Following the close of evidence and at the request of the defendant, the court provided the jury with an instruction on the special defense of waiver. The court further instructed the jury to \"separately answer jury interrogatories asking whether it 'f[ou]nd in favor of [the plaintiff] on her claim of breach of contract against [the defendant]' and, if so, whether '[the plaintiff] waived the breach of contract by [the defendant] ....' \"\n   <em>\n    Bruno\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whipple\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%20186\">\n    162 Conn.

The jury subsequently returned a verdict in favor of the defendant on the breach of contract claim. In so doing, the jury \"expressly\" based that verdict \"on its answers to jury interrogatories that (1) [the defendant] had breached its contract with the plaintiff, but (2) the plaintiff had waived that breach.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20899\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The trial court denied the plaintiff's subsequent motion to set aside the verdict. Id., at 196-97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20899\">\n    130 A.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, this court concluded that the trial court improperly denied the motion to set aside the verdict in favor of the defendant on the breach of contract\n   count. As the court stated, the trial court \"abused its discretion by permitting [the defendant] to raise the special defense of waiver for the first time after the close of evidence at trial, as it had not been specially pleaded, the pleadings did not allege any facts supporting an inference of waiver, and the claim that the plaintiff knowingly relinquished her contractual rights was not fully litigated at trial without objection by the plaintiff. Accordingly ... the court should have set aside the jury's verdict as to waiver.\" (Footnote omitted.) Id., at 207,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20899\">\n    130 A.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In light of that conclusion, this court explained that it \"must now address the scope of the remand of this case to the trial court. Specifically, we must determine whether the case should be remanded for a hearing in damages on the plaintiff's breach of contract claim or whether the jury's verdict on her breach of contract claim also must be set aside and remanded for a retrial on that issue.\" Id., at 207-208,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20899\">\n    130 A.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that, \"[i]n finding in favor of the plaintiff on her breach of contract claim, the jury essentially has determined liability in her favor against [the defendant] and the remaining determination is damages resulting from that breach.\" Id., at 208,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20899\">\n    130 A.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, this court concluded that \"because the improper verdict on the special defense of waiver is wholly separable from the verdict in favor of the plaintiff on her breach of contract claim ... limiting the remand to a hearing in damages on the breach of contract verdict does not work injustice in this case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20899\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The court thus ordered the case to be \"remanded for a hearing in damages on the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiff on her breach of contract claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., at 216,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20899\">\n    130 A.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court held a hearing in damages on January 26, 2017, at which the plaintiff submitted testimony from herself and James Bolan, a financial consultant employed by Charles Schwab, as well as certain documentary evidence. In her testimony, the plaintiff confirmed that her breach of contract claim was predicated on the defendant's failure to provide her with invoices on a biweekly basis and written\n   change orders regarding modifications to the contract. The plaintiff maintained that those failures caused a diminution of her marital estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its February 21, 2017 memorandum of decision, the court made a number of factual findings that are not contested in this appeal. The court found that the plaintiff and Bruno entered into the contract at issue on October 28, 2004. The contract did not specify \"a final, fixed price for construction of the residence,\" as the parties had agreed that the defendant would be paid for all services rendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The construction costs were paid in part from the proceeds of a construction mortgage loan; the remaining construction costs were paid with funds from a Charles Schwab financial account (Schwab account).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In December, 2005, Bruno commenced a dissolution action against the plaintiff. As part of that dissolution proceeding, the plaintiff and Bruno on July 10, 2006, entered into a written stipulation to complete the construction of the residence. The residence ultimately was completed and a certificate of occupancy issued on July 28, 2006. The final cost of construction, including land, totaled $7,746,462.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the trial court also found that the plaintiff's marriage to Bruno was dissolved on March 17, 2008. As part of that judgment of dissolution, the dissolution court ordered that the net proceeds of the sale of the newly constructed residence shall be \"divide[d] equally\" between the plaintiff and Bruno. The dissolution court further found that, at the time of dissolution, the residence had a fair market value of $7.9 million. The dissolution court also awarded the plaintiff weekly alimony in the amount of $4000, culminating upon the death of the plaintiff or Bruno, or the remarriage of the plaintiff. With respect to the Schwab account that had been used as a source of funds for the construction of the new residence, the dissolution court found that it had a current balance of $2,451,343.62. As part of its financial orders, the dissolution court awarded the plaintiff $300,000 from that account and ordered that $22,826 be paid from that account to the defendant for an outstanding invoice. The dissolution court then ordered the remainder of the Schwab account \"to be divided equally between\" the plaintiff and Bruno.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In her complaint, the plaintiff alleged in relevant part that the defendant's breach of contract deprived her \"of fair, just and reasonable alimony and division of assets in connection with the dissolution of [her] marriage to Bruno.\" In ruling on the issue of damages, the court thus stated that \"the plaintiff's claim for damages [on the breach of contract count] is measured by the amount that the marital estate was diminished as a direct and proximate result of [the defendant's] failure to provide her with biweekly invoices and change orders.\" The court found, \"after careful review of the evidence introduced at the hearing in damages ... that the plaintiff has not proven (and cannot prove from the evidence presented) that the marital estate was reduced by [the defendant's] breach of contract. The\n   'missing' funds [from the Schwab account] were paid to [the defendant\n   ] to satisfy invoices for services rendered and materials furnished in constructing the [new residence].... The plaintiff introduced no evidence at the hearing in damages to contradict this finding. The [new residence] retained the value of the cash expended in its construction and remained a significant asset of the marital estate available for distribution to the plaintiff.\" (Citation omitted.) The court also rejected the plaintiff's ancillary claim that, but for the alleged diminution of the marital estate due to the defendant's breach of contract, she would have received a larger award of alimony and property distribution. In this regard, the court found that the plaintiff's claim was \"entirely too speculative,\" as it was predicated solely on a \"projection\" of what the court in the dissolution proceeding \"\n   <em>\n    likely would have awarded to her\n   </em>\n   if facts had been different in her dissolution of marriage action.\" (Emphasis in original.) The court therefore concluded that the plaintiff had \"failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to any damages on her breach of contract claims ....\" For that reason, the court stated that \"judgment enters in favor of [the defendant] and against the plaintiff.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   From that judgment, the plaintiff now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the court improperly found that she failed to prove actual damages resulting from the defendant's breach of the construction contract. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is well established that \"[t]he trial court has broad discretion in determining damages.... The determination of damages involves a question of fact that will\n   not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous.... [W]hether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous ... involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court's decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.... In a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony.... On appeal, we will give the evidence the most favorable reasonable construction in support of the verdict to which it is entitled.... A factual finding may be rejected by this court only if it is clearly erroneous.... A finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gianetti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norwalk Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20754\">\n    304 Conn. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20567\">\n    43 A.3d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). In addition, we note that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the extent of the damages suffered in a breach of contract action.\n   <em>\n    Naples\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Keystone Building &amp; Development Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304079\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/214/#p224\">\n    295 Conn. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20326\">\n    990 A.2d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the plaintiff acknowledges in her principal appellate brief, her theory of damages pertains to the dissipation of marital funds in the Schwab account. Following a hearing at which it received both documentary and testimonial evidence, the trial court found that the funds withdrawn\n   from that account all were \"paid to [the defendant] to satisfy invoices\" regarding the construction of the residence. The court further found that \"[t]he\n   plaintiff introduced no evidence ... to contradict this finding.\" On our review of the record, we cannot say that those findings are clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court further found that the newly constructed residence \"retained the value of the cash [from the Schwab account] expended in its construction and remained a significant asset of the marital estate available for distribution to the plaintiff.\" That finding too is substantiated by the evidence in the record before us. In its March 17, 2008 memorandum of decision, which was admitted into evidence as a full exhibit at the hearing in damages, the dissolution court found that the total cost of construction of the residence was $7,746,462.08 and that the fair market value of that property at the time of dissolution was $7,900,000. The plaintiff provided no evidence that the property lost any value between the time that the funds from the Schwab account were expended on construction costs and the date of dissolution. As the dissolution court noted in its memorandum of decision, the plaintiff, at the time of dissolution, averred that \"the value of this property is $7,777,433\"-approximately $31,000\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than the total cost of construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that, if the defendant had not breached the terms of its contract, (1) \"the dissipated funds would have remained safely in the Schwab account earning interest and would ultimately have been required to be distributed in [the] plaintiff's divorce\" and (2) she would have received a larger alimony award due to the existence of those additional funds in the Schwab account. (Emphasis omitted.) Those contentions are entirely speculative.

As the trial court aptly noted in its memorandum of decision, the plaintiff's contentions are little more than conjecture as to what the dissolution court would have awarded her \"if facts had been different\" in her dissolution proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff's claim that the dissolution court would have altered its financial orders had funds from the Schwab account not been expended on construction costs without her approval overlooks the fact that the plaintiff raised that very issue in the dissolution proceeding. The record before us indicates that she filed a \"Motion for Order-Pendente Lite\" on January 17, 2006, in which she alleged in relevant part that \"[s]ince the commencement of this [dissolution] action [Bruno] has continued with the construction of the new [residence], unilaterally expending large sums of marital assets ... without the knowledge and consent of the [plaintiff].\" She therefore requested an order prohibiting Bruno from making any further expenditures without her written consent. Months later, the plaintiff entered into a stipulation with Bruno to complete the construction of the new residence. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for contempt regarding Bruno's alleged noncompliance with the terms of that stipulation. In its decision, the dissolution court specifically found that \"there has been no evidence presented that the amount spent [on construction costs] constituted a dissipation of marital assets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The record also indicates that the plaintiff filed a second motion for contempt with the dissolution court predicated on\n   an alleged violation of the automatic order prohibiting the sale, transfer, or disposal of marital property. See generally Practice Book \u00a7 25-5 (b) (1). In that motion, the plaintiff alleged that Bruno had violated that order since the commencement of the dissolution by refusing \"to keep [her] involved in the\n   construction\" of the new residence and by \"unilaterally [making] decisions to spend huge sums of money which were\n   <em>\n    never previously contemplated, discussed or approved by the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   ].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis in original.) The dissolution court denied that motion for contempt on March 17, 2008-the very same day that it dissolved the marriage and entered its financial orders. The dissolution court, therefore, was well aware of the plaintiff's allegations regarding the payment of construction costs during the pendency of the divorce. Indeed, that court, in fashioning its financial orders, awarded the plaintiff the lump sum of $300,000 from the Schwab account prior to dividing the remainder equally between her and Bruno. That order may well have been issued in response to the plaintiff's repeated claims regarding the unauthorized payment of construction costs from the Schwab account. On the record before us, we cannot conclude, without resort to conjecture, that the dissolution court would have granted the plaintiff a greater property distribution or alimony award had the funds from the Schwab account not been expended on the construction costs in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Furthermore, the plaintiff did not adduce evidence at the hearing in damages that her claimed damages were the foreseeable result of the defendant's failure to provide her with invoices on a biweekly basis and written change orders regarding modifications to the contract. As our Supreme Court has explained, \"[i]n an action founded ... on breach of contract ... the recovery of the plaintiffs [is] limited to those damages the defendant had reason to foresee as the probable result of the breach at the time when the contract was made.\"\n   <em>\n    Neiditz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morton S.

The evidence further indicates that the new residence retained its value throughout the dissolution proceeding and that, following the dissolution of her marriage to Bruno, the plaintiff was awarded an equal share of the net proceeds of the sale of that residence. We therefore conclude that the court's finding that the plaintiff \"has not proven ... that the marital estate was reduced by [the defendant's] breach of contract\" is not clearly erroneous.

As our Supreme Court noted, \"[t]he issue of liability had been previously decided ... and, therefore, the [finder of fact] had before [it] only a hearing in damages.
