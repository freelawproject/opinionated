In 2016, A.A.R. (\"Mother\"), was released from incarceration, after which she relapsed into drug addiction, using opioids (pain pills) and marijuana. Mother subsequently learned that she was pregnant with L.J.B. (\"Child\"). She estimated that she was approximately four months pregnant at that time. Thereafter, she sought treatment for her addiction, first through a methadone maintenance program\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then with subutex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother again relapsed and in mid-January 2017 she tested positive for opiates, benzodiazepines and marijuana, none of which were prescribed for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mother gave birth to Child on January 27, 2017 at Williamsport Hospital. At the time of Child's birth, Mother tested positive for marijuana and subutex. By the third day of life, Child began exhibiting symptoms of NAS, including tremors, excessive suck, increased muscle tone and loose stools, which doctors treated with morphine. Mother reportedly left Child in the hospital and did not consistently check on her or stay with her (despite the availability of a room for her to do so). Hospital personnel communicated all of this information to the Clinton County Children and Youth Social Services Agency (\"CYS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 7, 2017, CYS sought and was granted emergency protective custody of Child. The juvenile court held a shelter hearing on February 10, 2017 and ordered Child to remain in CYS' care. CYS then filed a dependency petition alleging that (1) Child was \"without proper parental care or control ... as required by law\" pursuant to section 6302(1) of the Juvenile Act ( 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6301 - 6375 ), and (2) that Child was a victim of child abuse by a perpetrator as defined by section 6303(b.1)(1) of the CPSL in that Mother \"caus[ed] bodily injury to a child through any recent act or failure to act.\" Dependency Petition, 2/13/2017, at 3, 5. The child abuse allegation was based on Child's hospitalization for nineteen days, during which Child \"suffer[ed] from withdrawal due to substances Mother ingested while Mother was pregnant with her.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207102\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   juvenile court continued the initial dependency hearing because of its concern that Mother and J.W.B. (\"Father\") did not receive proper notice. Prior to the rescheduled hearing, CYS filed another dependency petition containing the same allegations of dependency and child abuse, but adding information concerning visits between the parents and Child and Mother's admitted continued drug use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 15, 2017, by agreement of the parties, the juvenile court adjudicated Child dependent pursuant to section 6302(1) of the Juvenile Act. It deferred to a separate proceeding the question of whether Mother's drug use while pregnant constituted child abuse, and ordered the parties to file memoranda of law for the court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CYS filed its brief in support of a finding of child abuse on March 23, 2017, therein averring that Mother's conduct satisfied subsections (1) and (5) of the definition of \"child abuse\" in that her \"recent act\" caused or created a reasonable likelihood of causing bodily injury to Child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(b.1) (1), (5) ;\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , p. 870. Mother filed a memorandum of law the following day, asserting that the CPSL does not protect a fetus or unborn child, and thus Mother's actions could not be deemed child abuse as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The juvenile court held argument on May 9, 2017. After taking the matter under advisement, it issued an opinion and order, agreeing with Mother that \"the law does not provide for [a] finding of abuse due to actions taken by an individual upon a fetus.\" Juvenile Court Opinion, 5/24/2017, at 4. It thus held that CYS \"cannot establish child abuse in this matter on the actions committed by Mother while [C]hild was a fetus.\" Juvenile Court Order, 5/24/2017, \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   CYS appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed.

He also acknowledged that the majority's holding could easily be extended to other areas of a pregnant woman's decision making (e.g., drinking coffee, traveling, eating sushi, or undergoing cancer treatment).

As we must, we begin by addressing the arguments aimed at the plain language of the statute. Mother contends that pursuant to the clear and unambiguous language of the CPSL, she did not commit \"child abuse\" while she was pregnant because there was no \"child,\" and she therefore was not a \"perpetrator,\" at the time she committed the act in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mother's Brief at 12-21; 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a), (b.1).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ACLU and FMF Amici Brief at 6-8. She observes that section 6386 of the CPSL requires medical personnel to report to CYS when a child is born, inter alia, experiencing withdrawal symptoms because of prenatal drug exposure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   She argues, however, that the CPSL neither requires nor permits a finding of \"child abuse\" on this basis, again pointing to the pertinent definitions of section 6303, as well as failed amendments to the statute that would have made her conduct \"child abuse\" (but did not).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mother's Brief at 21-28; 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6386. According to Mother, a finding of child abuse based on harm caused by a mother's ingestion of narcotics during pregnancy also contradicts the stated purpose of the CPSL because it would do nothing to protect children from \"further abuse,\" as this form of \"abuse\" is not repeatable against the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mother's Brief at 29-30; 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6302 (stating, in pertinent part, that one of the purposes of the CPSL is \"providing protection for children from further abuse\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In response, CYS does not address Mother's assertion that she cannot be a \"perpetrator\" as defined by the CPSL. Instead, it points to section 6386 and its contemplation that the county agency may institute \"child protective services\" following its safety assessment after receiving a report from a healthcare provider that a child was born affected by prenatal drug exposure. Because \"child protective services\" are only instituted in cases of child abuse, CYS reasons that the General Assembly intended for drug use while pregnant to constitute an act that could be deemed child abuse once the child is born affected by his or her prenatal exposure to drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CYS' Brief at 5-9; 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a) (defining \"child protective services\" as \"services and activities provided by the department and each county agency for child abuse cases\"). CYS further contends that a finding of child abuse in this circumstance aligns with the legislative intent provided in section 6302 of the CPSL because Mother \"may well be pregnant again in the future.\" It asserts, without explanation, that a finding that Mother abused Child by using illegal drugs while pregnant would somehow \"protect these children as well.\" CYS' Brief at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As stated hereinabove, a \"perpetrator\" is \"[a] person who has committed child abuse\" under the CPSL. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a). Thus, at the time the individual committed the act that caused or was reasonably likely to have caused bodily injury to a child, he or she must have been a \"perpetrator,\" as defined. The delineation of each individual who is permissibly identified as \"perpetrator\" under the CPSL is based on his or her relationship to a \"child\" - in Mother's case, as \"[a] parent of a child.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278585,12278587,12316973,12316966\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/172/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 6303(a)(1). Reading the clear and unambiguous language of the\n   relevant definitions together, a person cannot have committed child abuse unless he or she was a perpetrator, and a person cannot be a perpetrator unless there is a \"child\" at the time of the act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a), (b.1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the case at bar, however, the act alleged (ingesting opioids) occurred when Mother was pregnant. As the parties agree, and the Superior Court found, the CPSL's definition of a \"child\" does not include a fetus or an unborn child. By its plain language, a \"child\" is a person who is under eighteen years of age.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a). Had the General Assembly intended to include a fetus or unborn child under the protections of the CPSL, it would have done so, just as it has in other statutory schemes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 - 2609 (Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3201 - 3220 (Abortion Control Act). \"We are bound by the unambiguous language of the statute and cannot read language into it that simply does not appear.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

As such, Mother cannot be found to have committed child abuse against Child based on her illegal drug use while pregnant because she was not a \"perpetrator\" at the time of the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Superior Court never considered the definition of \"perpetrator\" when arriving at its conclusion that Mother's actions while pregnant could constitute \"child abuse.\" Instead, it focused, almost exclusively, on the fact that Mother's drug use occurred within two years of Child's birth, which, in its view, constituted a \"recent act\" under the CPSL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re L.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12350253\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/308/#p311\">\n    177 A.3d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By reaching back to consider conduct while Mother was pregnant, the Superior Court failed to account for the fact that at any time prior to the birth of Child, Mother could not be a perpetrator of child abuse because a perpetrator must be \"the parent of a child.\" 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6306(a)(1)(i). The Superior Court thus created a statutory relationship between a pregnant woman and a fetus that the CPSL does not recognize. Language was available to the General Assembly to create a category of child abuse to address this scenario, but it did not, and we must consider this omission as part of the legislative intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kmonk-Sullivan v.

Under such reasoning, an individual need\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   be a perpetrator at the time of the behavior causing or risking an injury to a child in order to later be found a perpetrator of child abuse following the injury. In reversing, the plurality determines an individual must be a perpetrator,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a person having some statutorily defined interaction with a child, at the same time as the commission of behavior causing or risking the injury; thus, prenatal drug use\n   <strong>\n    cannot\n   </strong>\n   be construed as child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As the statutory text provides, child abuse requires \"intentionally, knowingly or recklessly ... (1) [c]ausing bodily injury to a child\n   <strong>\n    through\n   </strong>\n   any recent act or failure to act[,]\" or \"(5) [c]reating a reasonable likelihood of bodily injury to a child\n   <strong>\n    through\n   </strong>\n   any recent act or failure to act.\" 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(b.1)(1), (5) (emphasis added). This statutory definition of child abuse does not contain the word \"perpetrator,\" nor does it reference who may commit child abuse. Indeed, the temporal proximity between a CPSL-defined \"perpetrator\" and a CPSL-defined \"recent act or omission\" described by the plurality, though logical, is not defined or referenced anywhere within the statutory text. Further, the intended use of the word \"through\" within its context here is also unclear: whether \"through any recent act\" is intended to temporally link the commission of the act to the injury as occurring within one block of time, or, instead, \"through\" merely means \"by way of,\" casts further ambiguity upon the language conferring a temporal period the plurality determines is clear from the plain language of the statute. For these reasons, I disagree that the plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In construing ambiguous statutory language, \"we presume to be erroneous any interpretation that leads to an absurd or unreasonable result[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Freedom Med.

Individuals must be able to rely on the law to afford them notice of when, temporally and qualitatively, certain relationships and interactions with children might trigger the consequences of perpetrating child abuse as delineated by the CPSL. Requiring the anticipation of the potentially injurious effects of one's behavior upon a child who does not exist seems, in my view, manifestly unreasonable, and as Judge Strassburger's concurrence below illustrates, the myriad of foreseeable circumstances fitting well within the plain language of the definition of child abuse extends to situations which are patently absurd.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re L.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12350253\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/308/#p311\">\n    177 A.3d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313-14 (Pa.

Thus, in my view, to the extent the CPSL's definition of child abuse encompasses an act or omission which predates\n   the existence of a child (even if, at some later point, there is a child who suffers or is at risk of injury as a result of the act or omission) it is erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nevertheless, I agree with the plurality's assessment of the legislative history and analysis of legislative intent, as well as the statutory construction requiring temporal proximity between the existence of a perpetrator, as the term is defined by the CPSL, and the behavior causing or risking injury to an existing child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISSENTING OPINION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   JUSTICE MUNDY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"The term 'child abuse' shall mean intentionally, knowingly or recklessly ...

The instant facts, however, present a scenario where the act and the injury do not occur simultaneously. The facts in this matter more closely resemble neglect cases where the injury manifests at some point in time after the neglect as in cases of malnourishment from lack of food, or suffering from a severe diaper rash from failure to routinely change diapers. Child abuse by neglect is defined as \"causing serious physical neglect to a child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12350253\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/308/#p311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 6303(b.1)(7). When a malnourished child, or the baby suffering severe diaper rash are reported, the first determination made is whether the child has been abused. The inquiry then proceeds to ascertaining who perpetrated the abuse. The failure to provide food or change a diaper on one isolated occasion is not going to necessarily rise to an act of abuse, but the repeated failure to properly care for the child that causes serious physical neglect, is child abuse by definition.

The same type of policy decision was made by the General Assembly in requiring a parent-child relationship and not a pregnant woman-unborn child relationship in section 6303(a)(1)(i).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The Dissent is of the view that a person need only be a perpetrator at the time the injury to the child manifests, not at the time of the act that causes the injury.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dissenting Op. at 879. Respectfully, this ignores the aforementioned policy decision of the General Assembly as to who is a perpetrator. Modifying the above example, take instead a twelve-year-old boy who intentionally strikes his younger brother in the head with a baseball bat. No injury is initially apparent, but two years later the younger brother develops a massive brain hemorrhage that was caused by his brother's act. Under the Dissent's interpretation, the now-fourteen-year-old is labeled a perpetrator for the act committed when he was twelve. This, respectfully, is an absurd result given the General Assembly's clear definition of the term. The General Assembly made it abundantly clear that fourteen is the age that triggers the designation of \"perpetrator\" under section 6303(a)(1)(v) CPSL. It likewise made clear that a parent of a child, not a woman pregnant with an unborn child, triggers the designation of \"perpetrator\" under the CPSL.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The General Assembly's recent amendment to section 6386 resolves any ambiguity that may have arisen from the language used in the prior version of section 6386 entirely. In July 2018, the General Assembly completely overhauled section 6386, and the amended version took effect on October 2, 2018. The amendment changes the title of the statute to \"Notification to department and development of plan of safe care for children under one year of age.\" It further adds subsection (a.1), which states, \"The notification by a health care provider to the department and any transmittal to the county agency by the department shall not constitute a child abuse report,\" and removes reference to the county agency instituting \"child protective services\" based on notification from hospital personnel that a baby was born affected by prenatal drug exposure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6386(a.1). A large portion of the statute is now dedicated to the \"[d]evelopment of interagency protocols and plan of safe care\" to ensure that the child's needs, as well as those of the child's parents and immediate caregivers, are appropriately met.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787688,6890755\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/111/1164/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 6386(b.1). This provision even contemplates that \"[o]ngoing involvement of the county agency after taking into consideration the individual needs of the child and the child's parents and immediate caregivers may not be required.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787688,6890755\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/111/1164/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 6386(b.1)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Admittedly, these are not completely analogous scenarios because the perpetrator would meet the definition of perpetrator throughout the duration of the neglect. The important component is that in this scenario child abuse is \"causing serious physical neglect.\" The child abuse determination is triggered at the time the serious physical neglect manifests. Likewise, child abuse manifests when a serious physical injury is caused. At the time a serious physical injury occurred, Mother met the statutory definition of perpetrator, and child met the statutory definition of child. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
