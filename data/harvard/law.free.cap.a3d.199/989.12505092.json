Upon review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On May 28, 2013, Licensee was convicted in the trial court of DUI graded as a first-degree misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas Docket No. CP-02-CR-0014534-2012 at 5 &amp; 9. Over 3 years and 3 months later, on August 31, 2016, the Allegheny County Department of Court Records transmitted certification of Licensee's conviction to the Bureau. Eight days after receiving the trial court's certification, on September 8, 2016, the Bureau mailed Licensee notice of the mandatory 18-month license suspension resulting from his DUI conviction, effective October 13, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 3, 2016, Licensee appealed the license suspension, and the trial court conducted a hearing on June 22, 2017. On September 5, 2017, the trial court\n   entered an order sustaining Licensee's appeal. The Bureau timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, the Bureau claims the trial court erred in sustaining Licensee's statutory appeal of his license suspension because the Bureau imposed the suspension by official notice sent only eight days after the Bureau received the certified notice of Licensee's qualifying conviction from the Allegheny County Department of Court Records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bureau's Brief at 4 &amp; 10-21. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 101 - 9805, mandates an 18-month suspension of driving privileges upon a first-degree misdemeanor DUI conviction. 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3804(e). To that end, the Vehicle Code provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Suspension of operating privileges upon conviction.-\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) The department shall suspend the operating privilege of an individual under paragraph (2) upon receiving a certified record of the individual's conviction of or an adjudication of delinquency for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (i) an offense under section 3802;\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) Suspension under paragraph (1) shall be in accordance with the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (ii) 18 months for a misdemeanor of the first degree under this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3804(e). Per the statute, receipt from the trial court of the certified record of a conviction triggers the Department's obligation to suspend a driver's license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Historically, to challenge a license suspension based on unreasonable delay, a licensee bore the burden of establishing: \"(1) that there was an unreasonable delay\n   <em>\n    that was attributable to [the Department];\n   </em>\n   and (2) that the delay caused her to believe that her operating privileges would not be impaired and that she relied on this belief to her detriment.\"\n   <em>\n    Pokoy v.

Cmwlth. 1998) (emphasis in original). As to the unreasonable delay prong, this Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Regarding the first element of this two-step analysis, the law is settled that, where [the Department] is not guilty of administrative delay, any delay caused by the judicial system (e.g., the Clerk of Courts) not notifying [the Department] in a timely manner, will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   invalidate a license suspension that is authorized by the Code and imposed by [the Department]. In determining whether there was an unreasonable delay attributable to [the Department], the relevant time period is that between the point at which [the Department] receives notice of the driver's conviction from the judicial system and the point at which [the Department] notifies the driver that her license has been suspended or revoked. In other words, only an unreasonable delay by [the Department], and not the judicial system, invalidates [the Department's] license suspension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720091\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1162/#p1164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original). Otherwise stated, the general rule was that only a Department delay, not one caused by the judicial system, would suffice to invalidate a Department license\n   suspension. Therefore, if the Department timely suspended the license after receiving notice from the courts of a qualifying conviction, the suspension would stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, this Court recognized a narrow \"extraordinary circumstances\" exception to the general rule in\n   <em>\n    Gingrich v.

Cmwlth. 2016). In\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   , the York County Clerk of Courts did not notify the Department of a licensee's 2004 DUI conviction until October 10, 2014.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n    at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Department then notified the licensee of the one-year license suspension within 14 days of receiving notification of the triggering conviction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Licensee appealed, arguing the 10-year delay between her conviction and the attendant license suspension violated her right to due process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court found the delay was unconscionable, but affirmed the suspension based on the above-referenced general rule because the Department was not responsible for the delay.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n    at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court affirmed the general rule of unreasonable delay, but reversed the suspension, concluding that limited circumstances can exist where a non-Department delay could warrant the vacation of a license suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We explained the extraordinary delay exception as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Where a conviction is not reported for an extraordinarily extended period of time, the licensee has a lack of further violations for a significant number of years before the report is finally sent, and is able to demonstrate prejudice, it may be appropriate for common pleas to grant relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n    134 A.3d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court explained that this exception was to be narrowly construed and was meant to apply only \"where the suspension [imposed long after the fact] loses its public protection rationale and simply becomes an additional punitive measure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, we declined to create a bright-line rule for what period of time would constitute an \"extraordinarily extended period of time,\" noting that the determination must be made on a case-by-case basis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 534 &amp; 535 n.7. Thus, we found that the facts at hand-a 10-year delay in license suspension imposition, no further incidents with the law, and prejudice in that the licensee would have chosen a different school for her children and would likely lose her job if her license was suspended-warranted the application of the extraordinary delay exception because, after 10 years, the license suspension lost its \"underlying public safety purpose\" and became \"a punitive measure sought to be imposed too long after the fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n    at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   , this Court ruled both in favor of and against the application of the extraordinary delay exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capizzi v.

In one case, the Court found that a 2-year, 7-month delay could be considered an extraordinarily extended period of time where the licensee had no subsequent violations and established that he would be prejudiced by a license suspension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gifford v.

Cmwlth. 2017). The Court has also stated, albeit in dicta, that a 3-year delay occasioned by a non-Department entity could potentially be considered an extraordinarily extended period of time, triggering the\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Currie v.

Cmwlth. 2016). On the other hand, in a separate matter, the Court found that the licensee failed to meet the\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   prongs and was not entitled to the application of the extraordinary delay exception where, despite a 2-year delay, the licensee had a subsequent criminal violation shortly after the violation at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Janes v.

Cmwlth. 2018). In\n   <em>\n    Middaugh\n   </em>\n   , the trial court failed to notify the Department of a licensee's DUI conviction until 2 years and 4 months after the conviction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205622635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n    196 A.3d at 1075-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fifteen days after receiving notification from the trial court, the Department notified the licensee that his operating privilege would be suspended for a year per statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n    196 A.3d at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The licensee appealed and, at a hearing before the trial court, testified that he would be prejudiced by the imposition of the suspension years after his conviction because he had undergone numerous changes to his life circumstances since his conviction, specifically: he was no longer married and was no longer working due to a worsening neurological condition for which he had gone on total disability after his DUI conviction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n    196 A.3d at 1076-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The licensee further testified that: he needed to drive himself to medical appointments that were not within either walking or biking distance from his home; he had no family who could help him with rides; due to his fixed income, he could not afford to take taxis or Uber, and his health insurance would not cover transportation costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   factors, the trial court found that the 2-year, 4-month delay in imposing the license suspension was unreasonable, that the licensee had no further violations for a significant number of years, and that the licensee would be prejudiced by the loss of his license.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n    196 A.3d at 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court then refined the first\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   factor by examining further objective criteria that trial courts should consider to determine whether a non-Departmental license suspension imposition delay qualifies as extraordinary: (1) the 10-day trial court-to-Department reporting requirement established by Section 6323(1)(i) of the Vehicle\n   Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) the length of the underlying statutory suspension pursuant to 75 Pa.

However, where the delay exceeds that period, and where the remaining\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   factors are satisfied, a court of common pleas can find that relief is appropriate under\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503175\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1073/\">\n    196 A.3d at 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).

Therefore, provided the other\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   factors were met, the trial court could grant relief under\n   <em>\n    Middaugh\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The record reveals that Licensee has received no additional traffic violations or criminal convictions since his DUI conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notes of Testimony, June 22, 2017 (N.T.) at 7-8. Additionally, the record indicates that Licensee, assuming his license was suspended, unsuccessfully attempted to surrender his license to the Department two times, and then acquired a non-license state identification card and voluntarily ceased driving for 18 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   N.T. at 10-13. Further, Licensee incurred student loans, completed a course of education to become an electrician, and then took a license-dependent salaried job as an electrician, all assuming that his license suspension would have expired by the time he completed his studies and got his job, at which he has succeeded and advanced. N.T. at 17-18; Trial Court Opinion at 3. The trial court also expressly noted that the Allegheny County Department of Court Records failed to transmit certification of Licensee's conviction as required by Section 6323 of the Vehicle Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Court Opinion at 3. Based on the above evidence and findings, the trial court correctly\n   applied the\n   <em>\n    Gingrich\n   </em>\n   factors and sustained Licensee's appeal of his license suspension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the above reasons, the trial court properly sustained Licensee's appeal of his license suspension.\n   <em>\n    See Middaugh\n   </em>\n   .

Because I disagree with the Majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Middaugh\n   </em>\n   , however, I write separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Primarily, I disagree that the passage of three years and three months is an extraordinarily extended period of time as a matter of law, within the analysis of\n   <em>\n    Gingrich v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812406\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/528/6812406/\">\n    134 A.3d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016). Instead, I believe the extraordinary delay evaluation entails a mixed question of law and fact, and that some testimony must be offered by the licensee to establish the very unusual nature of the delay. Within the framework of a delay attributable to a county clerk of court's office, some testimony by a clerk should be offered as to what delay, if any, is usual in processing convictions entailing automatic drivers' license suspensions. Where, as here, such baseline evidence is lacking, no evaluation of extraordinary delay can be made. In such a circumstance, remand to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County for additional evidence is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For these reasons, I concur in the result only.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \"Our standard of review in a license suspension case is to determine whether the factual findings of the trial court are supported by competent evidence and whether the trial court committed an error of law or an abuse of discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     Negovan v.
