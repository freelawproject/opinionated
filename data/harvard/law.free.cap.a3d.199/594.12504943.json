The petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and (2) improperly rejected his claim that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance. We\n   conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal, and, accordingly, dismiss the petitioner's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner's claims. Following a trial, a jury found the petitioner guilty of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and commission of a class B felony with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k. The petitioner then pleaded guilty, in response\n   to a part B information, that the aforementioned offenses were committed while on release in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40b. The petitioner also pleaded guilty to a second part B information charging him with being a persistent felony offender in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (f). The trial court sentenced the petitioner to a total effective term of thirty-four years incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On direct appeal from the petitioner's underlying conviction, this court set forth the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \"At approximately 1 p.m. on July 13, 2009, the [petitioner] entered the New Alliance Bank in Columbia wearing a white tank top and dark sweatpants. Branch manager Penny Ritchie and tellers Maria DePietro and Michelle LaLiberty, who were working at the bank that day, observed the [petitioner] approach the check writer station. The [petitioner] then asked another patron, David Woodward, where the withdrawal slips were located, at which point the [petitioner] took a slip from the station and began to write on it. Photographs from the bank's security cameras introduced into evidence depict the [petitioner] writing on a piece of paper at the check writer station and then approaching the teller station with the piece of paper in his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The [petitioner] approached Ritchie and handed her a deposit slip that read, '[g]ive cash. I have gun.' When\n   Ritchie explained that she was not a teller, the [petitioner] ordered her to '[g]ive me the cash. Give it now.' Ritchie then slid the deposit slip to DePietro, who unlocked her teller drawer. As she did, the [petitioner] demanded, '[h]urry up, hurry up' and reached over the counter. DePietro then handed the [petitioner] $3500 in cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The [petitioner] immediately exited the bank and Woodward followed. As Ritchie locked the bank's doors and DiPietro called 911, LaLiberty closed the bank's drive-through window. As she did, she saw the [petitioner] walking at the rear of the bank to a grassy strip between the drive-through lane and an adjacent firehouse. LaLiberty wrote down a description of the [petitioner] at that time. Approximately six hours later, the Connecticut state police apprehended the [petitioner] in a grassy area near Route 66 in Columbia. The [petitioner] subsequently reviewed and executed a waiver of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights form and agreed to speak with Detective Derek Kasperowski. The [petitioner] then admitted to robbing the bank and stated that he remembered 'smoking crack before going into the bank, going to the bank teller and telling her to give him money.' Although no firearm was found on the [petitioner's] person or the surrounding area, the $3500 in cash was recovered.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769021\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/141/814/#p816\">\n    141 Conn.

After obtaining counsel, he filed an amended petition on April 28, 2016. He alleged in relevant part that his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel\n   was violated, arguing that his \"trial counsel's performance was deficient because he failed to adequately counsel the petitioner about the advisability of accepting the plea offer\" and that there was a \"reasonable probability that-but for trial counsel's deficient performance-the petitioner would have accepted the plea offer and the court\n   would have imposed a more favorable sentence than the petitioner received.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the habeas trial on September 15, 2016, the habeas court heard testimony from Matthew Gedansky, the state's attorney in the petitioner's criminal case, Doug-las Ovian, the petitioner's trial counsel, and the petitioner. In particular, the petitioner testified that he admitted from the beginning that he robbed the bank, but he believed that he was only guilty of robbery in the third degree because he only had handed the bank teller a note and never hurt anyone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was testimony that three plea offers were made to the petitioner: an offer for ten years to serve with five years of special parole; an offer for ten years to serve with two years of special parole; and an offer made at a judicial pretrial conference with\n   <em>\n    Sullivan, J.\n   </em>\n   , offering the petitioner fifteen years to serve if he pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in the first degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ovian testified that his\n   notes indicated that he advised the petitioner to accept the offers and that he would never have told the petitioner to take this case to trial. In addition, Gedansky testified that he recalled Ovian telling him that Ovian had advised the petitioner to take the offer of ten years to serve with two years special parole. The petitioner testified that he rejected these offers because he had faith the state might present him with a more favorable offer, and that he believed he deserved only five years of imprisonment. There also was differing testimony between Ovian and the petitioner with respect to what Ovian advised as to the potential maximum sentence the petitioner faced if he was found guilty of all the charges, and whether he advised the petitioner of the potential maximum sentence he faced if he prevailed on a robbery in the third degree theory at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a memorandum of decision filed January 10, 2017, the habeas court denied the amended petition for a writ\n   of habeas corpus, finding that the petitioner had failed to prove deficient performance or prejudice. In particular, the habeas court found that \"Ovian had many discussions with the petitioner throughout the course of his representation,\" and that Ovian \"went over the state's evidence with [the petitioner] and he advised the petitioner to take each of the deals as they were offered given the circumstances.\" Additionally, the habeas court found that Ovian \"informed the petitioner that he was facing a maximum exposure of forty-eight and one-half years if convicted of robbery in the first degree due to the sentence enhancements the petitioner faced.\" The habeas court concluded that Ovian relayed the offers to the petitioner, properly explained the state's evidence to him, and adequately warned him of the exposure he could face should he choose to go to trial. On January 17, 2017, the petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal, which was later denied by the habeas court. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and procedural hurdles that the petitioner must overcome in order to obtain appellate review of the merits of a habeas court's denial of the habeas petition following denial of certification to appeal. \"In\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"760025\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/178/#p187\">\n    229 Conn. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20601\">\n    640 A.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), [our Supreme Court] concluded that ...

In other words, the petitioner argues that his trial counsel was deficient because he was required, but failed, to adequately address the reasons that the petitioner had for proceeding to trial, rendering him unable to meaningfully weigh his options. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the present case, our review of the record demonstrates that Ovian provided the petitioner with professional advice on the best course of action given the facts of the petitioner's case and also informed him of the potential total sentence to which he was exposed. See\n   <em>\n    Barlow\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 150 Conn. App. at 800. While the petitioner may prefer that we broaden this duty by requiring trial counsel to advise their clients on the total sentence exposure they face for each and every possible defense scenario, we decline to adopt such a rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As the petitioner points out, both parties agree that the evidence against the petitioner was overwhelming\n   and that it was highly unlikely that the petitioner could have prevailed with respect to the charge of robbery in the first degree. To be sure, the evidence at trial included, inter alia, still photographs from the video surveillance of the petitioner entering the bank and writing a note, photographs of him approaching the teller station with the piece of paper in hand, the slip containing the petitioner's written demand for money and reference to a gun, testimony of the bank teller explaining that she had written a description of the petitioner on the back of the slip, and evidence that the petitioner was apprehended with the proceeds of the crime on him. In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court found that Ovian had many discussions with the petitioner throughout the course of his representation and discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the state's evidence with him. On the basis of his assessment of the case, Ovian advised the petitioner to accept each of the plea deals offered to him, informing the petitioner that he was facing a maximum sentence of forty-eight and one-half years if he proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although the petitioner was apprised of the evidence against him and advised to accept each of the plea deals offered, the record demonstrates that he held strong, subjective, and unrealistic beliefs about his case. For example, the habeas court found that the petitioner believed he should be convicted only of robbery in the third degree because he merely gave the bank teller a note and did not hurt anyone; that he believed that five years was a more reasonable sentence for his offense; that the petitioner, at a judicial pretrial conference, stated, \"[s]ir, I apologize, to offend you all but I just want you to know this is not a [r]obbery [first] and I will be going to trial to prove it because I am not copping out to this\"; that he believed that the maximum sentence he could receive for robbery in the third degree was five years; and that he rejected plea offers from the\n   state because he had faith the state\n   might present him with a more favorable offer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite counsel's advice to the petitioner to accept the plea offers, the petitioner chose to proceed to trial where he attempted to prove that his actions constituted only robbery in the third degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The petitioner acknowledges that he was \"fully advised\" about the likelihood of being convicted on the robbery in the first degree charge and the maximum potential sentence that he likely faced, but instead, focuses his argument on trial counsel's lack of specific advice on the maximum sentence he could have faced if he had succeeded on the unlikely strategy of proving that he only had committed robbery in the third degree. In doing so, he argues that he was unable to meaningfully weigh his options on whether to proceed to trial without understanding that the maximum sentence at trial on a theory of robbery in the third degree would be \"at least as severe\" or exceed the sentences of the plea offers initially made to the petitioner. He asserts that his \"decision to proceed to trial was influenced highly by trial counsel's flawed advice\" to him, characterizing his decision to reject the plea offers and proceed to trial as \"irrational and suicidal given the circumstances.\" The petitioner's argument, however, completely ignores the adequate and accurate advice Ovian did provide him. Ovian's conversations with the petitioner fully apprised him of the reality of his case. Moreover, the court found that Ovian had many discussions with the petitioner throughout the course of his\n   representation, where Ovian properly explained the state's evidence to him, relayed the plea offers to him, and informed him that he faced up to forty-eight and a half years incarceration if he proceeded to trial. Given the circumstances, Ovian advised the petitioner that the plea offers from the state were desirable and that he should accept them.

From the beginning, Ovian's advice to him was unequivocal; he made clear that the petitioner should be prepared for a conviction on the charge of robbery in the first degree should he choose to proceed to trial. And, as counsel had warned, the petitioner was in fact convicted of robbery in the first degree and sentenced to thirty-four years incarceration following his trial. Our case law requires that the petitioner be given \"adequate professional assistance, advice, and input\" from his counsel and be advised \"on the best course of action given the facts of [his] case and the potential total sentence exposure.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Barlow\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 150 Conn.

We cannot say that Ovian's failure to inform the petitioner of the potential total\n   sentence exposure he faced if he succeeded on the unlikely theory of proving robbery in the third degree or his decision not to further persuade the petitioner to accept the plea offers constituted deficient performance. It also bears noting that the petitioner has cited no relevant cases to support\n   his claim on appeal and presented no evidence at the habeas trial to demonstrate that the prevailing professional norms in Connecticut made it necessary for Ovian to advise the petitioner in the manner he argues.

Gedansky indicated that the petitioner had a theory that the police had invented the note on which the state relied; Gedansky described this as a \"conspiracy theory.\" Ovian also testified that he recalled contacting a handwriting expert to see if his evaluation of the note could give some support to the petitioner's theory.

Ovian then testified that he could not definitively say that he advised the petitioner on the maximum sentence the petitioner faced if convicted on the lesser included offense of robbery in third degree, but he indicated that he would not have led the petitioner to believe that he would have avoided jail time, especially in light of the conversations they had about the enhancements the petitioner faced.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The petitioner testified that Ovian did not tell him that he may receive a sentence of thirty-four years.

The petitioner indicated that had he known that he was going to receive a thirty-four-year sentence, he would not have gone to trial. Additionally, the petitioner testified that he was asking at trial that he be found guilty of robbery in the third degree and felt that the maximum sentence was five years; he testified that Ovian never told him the maximum potential sentence for robbery in the third degree was twenty years.

We disagree. It is evident from the habeas court's well reasoned decision that it determined that trial counsel's failure to advise the petitioner that a conviction of robbery in the third degree would likely result in a sentence at least as high as the offers by the prosecuting authority did not constitute deficient performance in light of the adequate advice that he did provide the petitioner.
