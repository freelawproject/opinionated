On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court held that the governmental need to monitor convicted sex offenders outweighed the privacy interests of H.R., whose expectation of privacy was already reduced because he was serving parole supervision for life (PSL) for third-degree attempted luring, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6. But, the government's needs did not outweigh the privacy interests of I.R., who had completed his sentence for second-degree endangering the welfare of a child involving depictions of a child engaging in or simulating a prohibited sexual act, N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(5)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   I.R.'s sentence did not include PSL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In H.R.'s appeal from judgment in the Board's favor, and in the Board's appeal from the judgment in I.R.'s favor, the parties dispute whether satellite-based monitoring is a special needs search, and whether the court properly weighed the governmental interest in monitoring and the offenders' interests in privacy.
