The plaintiff maintained that the defendant is liable for those damages because\n   he would not have incurred them if Jeffrey R. Strand, an East Haven police officer who had been dispatched to respond to an incident involving Trnka shortly before he was struck, had directed that Trnka's vehicle be towed in accordance with certain police department tow rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the plaintiff, those rules require the towing of unregistered vehicles like Trnka's. Following a trial, the jury rejected the defendant's claim of governmental immunity,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   finding that Strand had a ministerial duty under those tow rules to have had Trnka's vehicle towed, and awarded the plaintiff $12,200,000 in damages. The trial court thereafter granted in part the defendant's motion for remittitur and reduced the verdict to $6,200,000. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of the trial court on the ground that the defendant was immune from suit because its tow rules did not impose on Strand a clear ministerial duty to tow Trnka's vehicle.

We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court because we agree that the plaintiff's action is foreclosed by governmental immunity.\n   The Appellate Court's opinion sets forth the following procedural history and relevant facts, which the jury reasonably could have found. \"On November 4, 2006, Strand was dispatched to investigate a '[p]ossible domestic' incident occurring inside a '[l]arge white work van in the McDonald's drive-[through]' with an '[i]rate male ... operator.' The person who called 911 described the driver as possibly being 'on drugs' or 'drunk' and 'nodding out.' The caller further described the driver as 'punching the ceiling' and 'not normal.' After arriving at the McDonald's, Strand identified a vehicle in the drive-through lane that he believed might be the white work van described by dispatch. He pulled his cruiser 'face to face' with the white work van, and walked around the van to approach the driver from behind, as he was 'on a ... domestic violence call.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"While approaching the driver, Strand radioed in the license plate number, which dispatch confirmed as 'an '89 FORD cutaway cargo van, white ... out of Townsend Ave. Val Trnka, '07 expiration.' Despite believing that the 'white work van' that dispatch described was the vehicle in front of him, Strand was mistaken in that it was actually a 1997 white [Chevrolet] box truck. He did not ask for registration or proof of insurance, and did not check the emblems on the vehicle to ensure that it was the make and model dispatch had described. Strand then instructed Trnka, the driver, to pull into a parking spot so he could continue his investigation. Victoria Conte, another police officer, arrived on the scene and helped Strand separate and interview Trnka and his girlfriend, Kristen D'Aniello, who was a passenger in the truck. After determining that there was no\n   probable cause for arrest because there was no physical violence between Trnka and D'Aniello during the period\n   of time they were in the drive-through, Strand and Conte further concluded that there was no need to administer a field sobriety test to Trnka.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Strand asked Trnka and D'Aniello for their driver's licenses, but neither could produce one. He subsequently called dispatch to run their names through the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database to check for valid driver's licenses and [the] National Crime Information Center database to check for any outstanding warrants. The dispatcher ... was able to confirm [only] that there were no outstanding warrants for either individual, because the DMV database was malfunctioning. Because Strand could not confirm that Trnka had a valid driver's license, he decided to drive Trnka home and directed Trnka to leave his truck parked in the McDonald's parking lot and keep his keys. Conte drove D'Aniello to her residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Fifty-six minutes later, Trnka retrieved his truck from the McDonald's parking lot and drove it to the intersection of Townsend Avenue and Park Lane in New Haven, less than one mile from Trnka's residence. The plaintiff, an eighteen year old high school student at that time, was entering his vehicle, which was parked on the side of the road. Trnka hit the plaintiff with his vehicle, causing him to suffer severe injuries ....\" (Footnotes added and omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    East Haven\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    170 Conn.

[A]s part of the motor vehicle investigation, [it was also] determined that the license plate affixed to the truck did not match the description of the vehicle to which that plate had\n   been assigned and that Trnka was driving without valid insurance or registration, determinations that were not made by Strand at the time he investigated the report of the domestic violence incident. Trnka was, therefore, further charged with misuse of plates in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-147, operating an unregistered motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-12a, and operating a motor vehicle without insurance in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-213b....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The plaintiff subsequently sought to recover damages for his injuries and commenced the present action against Strand\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the defendant, alleging that Strand negligently violated a ministerial duty imposed on him by the East Haven Police Department Tow Board Rules &amp; Regulations\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (tow rules) by failing to have\n   Trnka's truck towed from the McDonald's parking lot. The plaintiff's operative complaint alleged that Strand\n   'failed to have Trnka's [truck] towed and impounded as\n   required in every case involving misuse of plates, lack of insurance or registration by rules promulgated by and for the East Haven police,' and 'failed to secure Trnka's [truck] so that he could not return and operate it unlawfully in violation of due care and police procedures.' In particular, he alleged that paragraph 7 of the tow rules required that '[a]ll motor vehicle violations are to be towed to include unregistered and misuse of plates. Operators of these vehicles are not allowed to park [the] vehicle or leave [it] in private parking areas.' The complaint further alleged that the defendant was directly liable for Strand's negligence under General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its answer, the defendant raised several special defenses, including that of governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"During the trial, the plaintiff introduced into evidence a copy of the tow rules. This document, effective September 1, 1998, was prefaced by a memorandum issue by then Chief of Police Leonard I. Gallo stating that '[a]ll establishments who tow for the East Haven Police Department [department] must adhere to these Rules &amp; Regulations.' The first paragraph of the tow rules provides that 'any company or person with towing equipment and having their business within the [t]own of East Haven may make application to the\n   [department] to be on the [department] rotating tow list provided they conform to the following rules and regulations.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The defendant moved for a directed verdict after the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief. The court reserved decision on the motion for directed verdict, as permitted under Practice Book \u00a7 16-37, and allowed the defense to proceed. In his closing argument, the [plaintiff's counsel] argued to the jury that the tow rules applied in equal force to police officers and to businesses conducting towing operations at the direction of the police. [Counsel] further argued that Strand was negligent in not towing and impounding, or otherwise securing, Trnka's truck on the basis of the motor vehicle violations that he knew existed at the time of his investigation of the possible domestic violence incident in the McDonald's parking lot, and, because of that knowledge, he did not have the discretion to decline to tow the truck. The defendant argued that Strand did not know of the motor vehicle violations existing at the time of the stop and that, even if he was aware of such violations, the decision to tow was discretionary, and, thus, the defendant was protected by governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Regarding the defendant's special defense of governmental immunity, the court instructed the jury that '[i]n this case, the parties agree and the court instructs you that ... Strand was a municipal employee engaged in a governmental function at the time of the plaintiff's alleged injuries. The parties disagree, however, as to whether ... Strand was free to exercise discretion when acting or failing to act as he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \" 'The question for you ... [to decide] is whether ... Strand was performing a discretionary or ministerial act when the plaintiff was allegedly injured by his conduct. As I stated earlier, the burden is on\n   the defendant,\n   who desires the benefit of governmental immunity, to persuade you by a ... fair preponderance of the evidence, that ... Strand's actions or inactions were the result of the exercise of discretion rather than the failure to comport with a mandatory course of conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \" 'If you find that the defendant has failed to meet the burden of establishing this special defense, then no immunity would protect the defendant from liability if you determine that ... Strand was negligent, and that negligence proximately caused the injuries claimed by the plaintiff, you would therefore find in favor of the plaintiff. If, however, you find that the defendant has satisfied this burden, you would then render a verdict for the defendant.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff and found damages in the amount of $12,200,000, finding, by way of its response to a jury interrogatory, that Strand negligently violated a ministerial duty to tow Trnka's truck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following trial, on January 3, 2014, the defendant filed a renewed motion for a directed verdict and a motion to set aside the verdict. It also filed a motion seeking a remittitur in the amount of $11,000,000 and a collateral source reduction. In a memorandum of decision dated July 10, 2014, the court denied the defendant's renewed motion for a directed verdict and its motion to set aside the verdict, but granted the motion for remittitur in the amount of $6,000,000, thereby reducing the verdict to $6,200,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"In denying the defendant's motions to direct or set aside the verdict, the court found, on the issue of governmental\n   immunity, that '[t]here was sufficient evidence adduced during the plaintiff's case-in-chief on the issue of whether Strand's actions were ministerial or discretionary.... The plain language of [paragraph 7 of the tow rules] falls within the definition of ministerial. There is no exercise of judgment in the language of the regulation.'

Specifically, the defendant argued that the trial court was incorrect in concluding that paragraph 7 of the tow rules imposed a clear ministerial duty on East Haven police officers to tow the vehicles of all drivers who have violated motor vehicle laws because that paragraph, along with the other twenty paragraphs of those rules, is directed at and regulates towing companies doing business with the department and does not apply to police officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    Id., at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    154 A.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant and, in so doing, rejected the plaintiff's contention that whether the tow rules imposed a ministerial duty on Strand presented a question of fact for the jury.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    Id., at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    154 A.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court explained that when, as in the present case, the question of whether an act is ministerial or discretionary turns on the interpretation of a statute, municipal ordinance or other written directive, that\n   issue gives rise to a question of law for the court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    Id., at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    154 A.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Paragraph 6 informs tow truck operators that it is ultimately within police discretion as to whether a motor vehicle will be towed, and who may tow it. Paragraph 7 then clarifies that, once an officer has exercised his discretion to order a motor vehicle towed, the tow company must follow the officer's direction to tow the vehicle.

The court further explained, moreover, that interpreting paragraph 7 to impose on East Haven officers a ministerial duty to tow \"[a]ll motor vehicle violations\" would render paragraph 6 superfluous, in violation of the cardinal principle that such provisions are to be interpreted to avoid such a construction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    Id., at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    154 A.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Appellate Court further observed that the plaintiff's interpretation of paragraph 7 of the tow rules was not only incompatible with the unfettered officer\n   discretion in regard to towing described in paragraph 6, but would lead to a bizarre and unworkable result, namely, that East Haven police officers would be required \"to tow a motor vehicle in every situation in which an officer determined that a violation of the motor vehicle laws had occurred,\" including \"every time a driver is stopped for rolling through a stop sign or for failing to obey a yield sign.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    Id., at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489075\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1020/#p414\">\n    154 A.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiff further contends that the Appellate Court incorrectly construed the tow rules in concluding that Strand had no ministerial duty under those rules to tow Trnka's vehicle.

The plaintiff maintains that, if allowed to stand, the Appellate Court decision \"would turn a traditional factual determination into a legal determination in every instance.\" In support\n   of this contention, the plaintiff cites the following language that has appeared in several of this court's governmental immunity cases: \"Although the determination of whether official acts or omissions are ministerial or discretionary is normally a question of fact for the fact finder ... there are cases [in which] it is apparent from the complaint ... [that the determination of whether an act or omission is discretionary in nature] and, thus, whether governmental immunity may be\n   successfully invoked pursuant to ... \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B), turns on the character of the act or omission complained of in the complaint.... Accordingly, [when] it is apparent from the complaint that the defendants' allegedly negligent acts or omissions necessarily involved the exercise of judgment, and thus ... necessarily were discretionary in nature, summary judgment is proper.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20150\">\n    312 Conn. at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20A.3d%20480\">\n    95 A.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Bonington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Westport\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087498\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/297/#p308\">\n    297 Conn. at 307-308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20700\">\n    999 A.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the basis of this language, the plaintiff argues that it was improper for the Appellate Court to resolve the governmental immunity question as a matter of law because it could not have been apparent from his complaint that Strand's acts or omissions necessarily involved the exercise of judgment. The plaintiff maintains that the only proper course was the one taken by the trial court, namely, to instruct the jury to decide whether the act was discretionary or ministerial. According to the plaintiff, \"[i]f every single written municipal rule is to be subjected to a statutory interpretation analysis conducted solely by the court, it would render meaningless the long-standing precedent that the ministerial-discretionary determination is normally a question of fact for the fact finder.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendant responds that whether a municipal rule or regulation imposes a ministerial duty on a municipal official is a question of law for the court. Likewise,\n   the defendant maintains, whether an act or omission is ministerial or discretionary is also a question of law for resolution by the court. The defendant further asserts that, to the extent that the language relied on by the plaintiff suggests otherwise, we should acknowledge that it is an incorrect statement of the law.

As the Appellate Court explained, however, Emerman testified unequivocally\n   <em>\n    that there was no rule\n   </em>\n   , written or unwritten, dictating the manner in which an East Haven police officer must handle an unregistered vehicle or one with misused plates. Emerman also testified that an officer's decision\n   to tow a vehicle is\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   within the officer's discretion. Indeed, the plaintiff's own expert testified that he was\n   aware of no Connecticut law requiring an officer to tow an unregistered vehicle or a vehicle determined to have misused plates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiff contends, nonetheless, that the jury reasonably could have rejected Emerman's testimony regarding the discretionary nature of the decision to tow as \"self-serving\" and concluded that a ministerial duty existed on the basis of Emerman's testimony that unregistered vehicles are routinely towed in East Haven, that, based on his training and experience, he did not let anybody drive off in an unregistered vehicle following a traffic stop, and that the \" 'general rule' \" among police officers is \" 'to tow and impound' \" such vehicles, albeit with certain exceptions. There are, no doubt, any number of guidelines and practices that police officers adhere to when responding to the myriad situations they confront on a daily basis.

The plaintiff does not explain, however, why the rules would have to be binding on an officer to ensure his or her familiarity with them, or why the location where the rules are kept or the fact that they are stamped with the former police chief's name have any bearing on whether they impose a ministerial duty on East Haven police officers to tow all vehicles that violate the state's motor vehicle laws. Indeed, under the plaintiff's reasoning, every written policy or rule of the department would have to be deemed to impose a ministerial duty on the officers to whom they apply, a proposition for which the plaintiff offers no legal or factual support.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The plaintiff cites\n    <em>\n     Strycharz\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Cady\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n     323 Conn. at 566\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n     148 A.3d 1011\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Wisniewski\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Darien\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779941\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/135/364/#p373\">\n     135 Conn.

Accordingly, if Strand had stopped Trnka for driving erratically but had let him go despite obvious signs of intoxication, and Trnka had subsequently struck the plaintiff with his vehicle, any action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant likely would have been barred by governmental immunity. It would seem incongruous to construe the tow rules in such a manner that the defendant would be liable for Strand's failure to tow Trnka's unregistered vehicle but immune from liability for injuries resulting from Strand's failure to enforce the state's DUI laws. Suffice it to say that we will not lightly impute such an intent to the defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
