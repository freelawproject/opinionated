R.O. challenges DYRS's decision to confine him in a secure residential facility. We vacate and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Except as noted, the following facts appear to be undisputed. In May 2017, R.O.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   was committed to DYRS's custody until his twentieth birthday, based on determinations in two separate juvenile proceedings that he was involved in a robbery and an assault with significant bodily injury. In November 2017, R.O. and DYRS signed a community-placement agreement (CPA) that placed R.O. in a group home. In the CPA, R.O. agreed among other things to \"[o]bey all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the District of Columbia and all its surrounding jurisdictions;\" \"[o]bey all school personnel;\" \"comply with all conditions of the GPS agreement\" if placed on electronic monitoring; and have no new arrests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2018, R.O. was arrested for unlawful entry. R.O. was arrested again in February 2018, this time for armed carjacking. The following day, the Superior Court determined that R.O. had been arrested for carjacking without probable cause. The charges against R.O. in the carjacking case were subsequently dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the carjacking arrest, R.O.'s case manager, Jeffrey Hammond, recommended that R.O. be placed in a secure residential facility. In his recommendation, Mr. Hammond stated among other things that R.O. had been arrested for unlawful entry and carjacking, had been suspended from school, had missed school, and had failed to comply with the terms of his GPS monitoring agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DYRS held a hearing to determine whether R.O.'s community placement should be revoked. The hearing took place before a panel of three DYRS employees. The panel heard evidence from two witnesses, neither of whom was placed under oath. DYRS's sole witness was Mr. Hammond. Mr. Hammond stated that R.O. had been arrested for carjacking, but Mr. Hammond acknowledged that a Superior Court judge had subsequently determined that there was no probable cause for the arrest. Mr. Hammond further acknowledged that, other than a police report alleging that a carjacking took place, DYRS did not have any evidence that R.O. had actually committed carjacking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Hammond stated that R.O. had been arrested for unlawful entry. DYRS also submitted a police report alleging that R.O. had committed unlawful entry. Mr. Hammond stated that R.O. had acknowledged being aware that he had been barred from the area at issue. Mr. Hammond further stated that R.O. had been suspended from school for his involvement in an altercation with another youth. Finally, Mr. Hammond stated that R.O. had failed to keep his GPS device charged and had missed time at school. DYRS submitted records supporting Mr. Hammond's statements on the latter two points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   R.O. presented evidence from a defense investigator that Mr. Hammond had told R.O.'s mother that R.O. was the victim in the alleged altercation and had acted only in self-defense. Mr. Hammond denied making such a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The DYRS panel issued a written decision concluding that R.O. had violated the CPA and placing R.O. in a secure facility. Specifically, the panel found that R.O. had violated the CPA in four ways: by being rearrested, by failing to obey school personnel, by failing to attend school regularly, and by failing to comply with the terms of his GPS agreement. R.O. appealed to the DYRS Director, who affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   R.O. sought review in the Superior Court, by filing a \"Motion for Appeal.\" The Superior Court ordered DYRS to respond, but DYRS did not do so. Shortly thereafter, the Superior Court sua sponte dismissed the case, concluding that R.O. was required to seek review directly in this court rather than in the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   R.O. appealed the trial court's ruling to this court and filed a protective petition for direct review in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the trial court concluded that DYRS's decision was reviewable directly in this court, the parties now agree that in fact relief was appropriately sought in the Superior Court in the first instance.

We see no basis, however, for a conclusion that R.O. was required to file a habeas petition. To the contrary, R.O. was required under well-settled principles to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking relief in habeas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walton v.

Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7347912\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/622/25/#p27\">\n    622 A.2d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27 (D.C. 1993) (by failing to contest issue in court of appeals, party \"effectively conced[ed] it\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   DYRS does argue that this court could appropriately affirm DYRS's decision notwithstanding DYRS's conceded constitutional error in relying upon the unsupported carjacking arrest. We conclude to the contrary. \"Our case law establishes that remand is required if substantial doubt exists whether the agency would have made the same ultimate finding with the error removed.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. District of Columbia Dep't of Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12318868\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/746/#p759\">\n    163 A.3d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759 (D.C. 2017) (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted). \"Unless we can be sure that the [agency] would have based its ruling on a lesser number of bases for revocation than it found to exist, we cannot affirm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12318868\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/746/#p759\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). We have no grounds for assurance that DYRS's ruling would have been the same in the absence of consideration of the unsupported carjacking arrest. Both the initial panel decision and the Director's decision expressly relied on the carjacking arrest in explaining the decision to revoke R.O.'s community placement. In neither decision is there any explicit suggestion that the decision would have been the same in the absence of the carjacking arrest, and in our view neither decision reasonably implies such a conclusion. We therefore vacate the decision revoking R.O.'s community placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At oral argument, DYRS contended that this court lacks the authority to vacate DYRS's order even if that order rests on an unconstitutional consideration. According to DYRS, vacating its order would cause R.O. to be restored to a community placement, and this court lacks authority to make placement decisions for youths committed to DYRS custody. We disagree with DYRS's reasoning for several reasons. First, although courts may not \"specify the treatment provider or facility\" for a youth in DYRS custody, they retain the authority to \"modify a dispositional order\" if a youth is not at the appropriate \"level of placement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016-2323\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 16-2323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) (2012 Repl.). Second, in contested cases this court has explicit statutory authority under the DC APA to \"set aside\" agency action that is \"[c]ontrary to constitutional right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-510\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 2-510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B). As we have already noted, in non-contested cases such as this the courts apply the same standard of review as applies under the DC APA.\n   <em>\n    In re A.T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7283021\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/10/127/#p134\">\n    10 A.3d at 134-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It follows that the courts have the authority to set aside a DYRS decision that rests on a concededly unconstitutional consideration. Third, by vacating DYRS's order in his case, we do not direct R.O. to be placed with any particular treatment provider or in a particular facility. Rather, we remand\n   this matter to the Superior Court, with instructions to remand the matter forthwith to DYRS.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Newell-Brinkley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7262868\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/84/53/#p61\">\n    84 A.3d at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (remanding case to Superior Court with instruction to remand to agency). In turn, DYRS must forthwith either provide R.O. with an appropriate community placement or issue a new order stating proper grounds for revocation of community placement.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kleinbart v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7937730\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/604/861/#p872\">\n    604 A.2d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 872 (D.C. 1992) (vacating pretrial-detention order and remanding for trial court to hold immediate detention hearing at which court considered all relevant factors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We address two remaining issues that are relevant to potential proceedings on remand. First, R.O. argues that the record lacks substantial evidence to support DYRS's conclusion that R.O. violated the CPA provision requiring him to obey school personnel. We agree. There was evidence that R.O. was suspended for being involved in an altercation at school. R.O. presented evidence that he was the victim in the altercation. Involvement in an altercation, whether as an instigator or as a victim, does not by itself imply, much less establish, a failure to obey school personnel. DYRS thus erred in basing its revocation decision in part on a conclusion that R.O. disobeyed school personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, R.O. argues that the three remaining grounds for the revocation order -- the unlawful-entry arrest, the school absences, and the GPS-monitoring violations -- are insufficient to justify revocation. We decline to decide that issue at this juncture. DYRS did not attempt to justify detention based on those three grounds alone, and we thus do not have the benefit of DYRS's analysis of the issue. In the absence of such an analysis, we are not prepared at this time to foreclose the possibility that revocation could reasonably be justified on the three remaining grounds for the revocation order. If DYRS were to enter a new revocation order on those (or any other) grounds, R.O. would be free to seek expedited judicial review of that that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the petition for review; vacate DYRS's decision; and remand the case to the Superior Court with instructions to remand the case to DYRS, for DYRS to forthwith either provide R.O. with an appropriate community placement or issue a new order stating proper grounds for revocation of community placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
