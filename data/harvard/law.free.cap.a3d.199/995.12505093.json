Mitchell (Plaintiff) appeals from the judgment entered on May 1, 2017, in favor of Plaintiff on her negligence claim against Michelle M. Milburn (Defendant Milburn).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The three-car accident occurred at an inverted \"T\" intersection on June 30, 2002, at approximately 8:15 p.m., on State Road 73 (Skippack Pike) at the road's juncture point with Weber Road, in Worcester Township, Montgomery County. The evening was clear and dry and it was still daylight, with sunset occurring around 8:34 p.m. Skippack Pike is a two-lane highway with one lane of travel east and one lane of travel west,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the horizontal part of the \"T.\" Weber Road is a two-lane roadway with one lane of travel north and one lane of travel south,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the vertical part of the \"T.\" (Trial court op. at 1, 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was proceeding eastbound on Skippack Pike preparing to turn left onto Weber Road. No traffic control device governed the intersection of Skippack Pike and Weber Road, and there was no special left-turn lane for eastbound vehicles turning north from Skippack Pike onto Weber Road. Plaintiff came to a stop in the eastbound lane of Skippack Pike and waited with her turn signal on for the westbound traffic to clear. While she was stopped and waiting to turn left, Plaintiff was struck from behind, apparently at a peculiar angle, by a vehicle operated by Defendant Milburn, which was traveling between 50 and 55 miles per hour. The dramatic force of the collision caused Plaintiff's vehicle to flip and roll over and slide on its roof into the westbound lane of Skippack Pike. At the same time, Defendant James V. Lewis was driving his vehicle in the westbound lane of Skippack Pike, approximately 40 to 50 miles per hour and within the posted speed limit, in close proximity to the intersection. Upon seeing Plaintiff's vehicle hurtling toward him in the westbound lane, Defendant Lewis immediately applied his brakes, but was unable to avoid colliding with Plaintiff's vehicle. As a result of the accident, Plaintiff sustained serious personal injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Plaintiff initiated a negligence action against Defendants Milburn, Lewis, and the Department of Transportation (DOT). A trial commenced on October 5, 2016. The next day, Plaintiff and Defendant Milburn settled on the record and agreed to enter into a pro-rata joint tortfeasor settlement agreement, whereby Milburn would remain on the verdict sheet for the jury to assess the proportionate share of liability among the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   trial then proceeded to determine whether Plaintiff could establish liability against the remaining non-settling parties, Defendant Lewis and Defendant DOT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the course of trial, and as part of her negligence claim against Defendant DOT, Plaintiff sought to introduce evidence that discussed and depicted design changes that Defendant DOT made at the intersection after the accident occurred. More specifically, Plaintiff proffered testimony and photographic evidence that showed road markings on Skippack Pike, eight years after the subject accident, that contained a lane specifically dedicated for a left-turn. The Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (trial court) ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a subsequent remedial measure under Pa.R.E. 407. (Trial court op. at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the close of Plaintiff's case-in-chief, Defendant Lewis and Defendant DOT made oral motions for a compulsory non-suit pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 230.1. The trial court granted Defendant Lewis' motion, based on the sudden emergency doctrine, determining that no reasonable jury could find that Defendant Lewis acted in a negligent manner. The trial court denied Defendant DOT's motion. (Trial court op. at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 7, 2016, the jury returned a verdict. On the verdict sheet, the jury found that Defendant Milburn (the defendant who settled) was negligent and that Defendant DOT was not negligent. The jury attributed 100% of the negligence to Defendant Milburn and awarded Plaintiff damages in the amount of $2,315,693.00. (Trial court op. at 2; Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 340a-41a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 17, 2016, Plaintiff filed motions for post-trial relief, contending that the trial court erred in granting Defendant Lewis' motion for a non-suit and sustaining Defendant DOT's objection at trial to Plaintiff's attempt to introduce into evidence the post-accident testimony and photograph mentioned above. On February 21, 2017, the trial court issued an order denying Plaintiff's motions, and Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on March 16, 2017. (Trial court op. at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By order dated April 27, 2017, this Court directed Plaintiff to reduce the verdict to a judgment within 14 days, and Plaintiff filed a praecipe to enter judgment on May 1, 2017, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 227.4. (R.R. at 293a.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal to this Court, Plaintiff raises two issues for review: (1) whether the trial\n   court erred in granting Defendant Lewis a non-suit, and (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that evidence of post-accident changes made to the intersection by Defendant DOT was inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"When reviewing a trial court's denial of a motion for post-trial relief, our scope of review is limited to a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion or committed an error of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Logans' Reserve Homeowners' Association v.

Cmwlth. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In her first issue, Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting Defendant Lewis a non-suit because Defendant Lewis had seen Plaintiff's vehicle with an activated turn signal and waiting to turn left, yet he continued to maintain or increase his speed while arriving at the intersection. According to Plaintiff, the issue of whether or not Defendant Lewis acted reasonably under the circumstances is one that should have been left to the jury to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A motion for compulsory non-suit allows a defendant to test the sufficiency of a plaintiff's evidence and may be entered only in cases where it is clear that the plaintiff has not established a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Kramer v.

As our Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The sudden emergency doctrine is frequently employed in motor vehicle accident cases wherein a driver was confronted with a perilous situation requiring a quick response in order to avoid a collision. The rule provides generally, that an individual will not be held to the 'usual degree of care' or be required to exercise his or her 'best judgment' when confronted with a sudden and unexpected position of peril created in whole or in part by someone other than the person claiming protection under the doctrine. The rule recognizes that a driver who, although driving in a prudent manner, is confronted with a sudden or unexpected\n   event which leaves little or no time to apprehend a situation and act accordingly should not be subject to liability simply because another perhaps more prudent course of action was available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Levey v.

In sum, given the precipitous and startling nature of the events surrounding and comprising the accident, the evidence, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, was insufficient to support a jury finding that Defendant Lewis breached his duty of care. (Trial court op. at 4-20.) For instance, the evidence demonstrated that at the time of the accident, Defendant Lewis was traveling between 40 to 50 miles per hour, which was within the posted speed limit, while traveling slightly downhill on a straight roadway. (Trial court op. at 7.) In her case-in-chief, Plaintiff was unable to describe the manner in which Defendant Lewis operated his vehicle. Likewise, her expert did not offer any testimony regarding the operation of Defendant Lewis' vehicle, and he failed to render an opinion that Defendant Lewis' actions contributed to the accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 10-12. For his defense, Defendant Lewis testified that he was driving down Skippack Pike, \"heard a loud bang,\" and \"simultaneously with the bang,\" saw \"a car on its roof coming right at [him].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. He said, perhaps fittingly: \"It was like out of a movie.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Lewis further stated that Plaintiff's vehicle was propelled into his \"direct path\"; he \"hit the brakes as soon as [Plaintiff's] car starting coming at [him] within a split second\"; and that he \"tried to stop, but [ ] couldn't.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on this record, there are no genuine issues of material fact or conflicts in the evidence for the jury to resolve. Instead, the uncontroverted evidence established the existence of a sudden emergency as a matter of law, and there is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find or infer that Defendant Lewis had sufficient time to stop his vehicle, drove at an unsafe or inappropriate speed, or otherwise acted negligently in operating his vehicle. As such, although the facts of this case are relatively unique, they evince a situation that is analogous to the factual patterns in other cases where the courts have concluded that the driver was confronted with a sudden and unexpected emergency and, therefore, did not breach a legal duty in failing to avoid the accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fleischman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.2d%20429\">\n    130 A.2d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When a driver approaches the crest of a hill ... he can reasonably be assured that no one will be insane enough to approach the crest of the road from the other side of the summit, using the contrary lane of travel.

In its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, the trial court addressed and resolved Plaintiff's evidentiary issue in an apt and able manner, concluding that, pursuant to the plain language of Pa.R.E. 407, Plaintiff's proposed evidence was inadmissible to demonstrate that Defendant DOT acted negligently or that Skippack Road was defective in that it required a traffic control, warning device, or a new design.

However, as noted by the trial court, Defendant DOT conceded control and feasibility at trial. (Trial court op. at 21-22.) Because the issues of control and feasibility were never \"disputed,\" Pa.R.E. 407, or otherwise contested by Defendant DOT, we conclude that the trial court did not err in ruling that Plaintiff could not submit the proffered evidence for these limited purposes. This aspect of the trial court's evidentiary ruling finds strong support in our case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Mendenhall v.

The plaintiffs asserted that they offered this evidence not to prove negligence by DOT, but rather, to establish the availability of an affordable and feasible remedy to improve the safety of the curve consistent with the recommendations of their expert. On appeal, this Court concluded that since DOT \"made no effort to dispute\" the matters, \"there simply was no issue of feasibility or affordability of different signs at the curve\"; consequently, \"the plaintiffs' proffered evidence did not relate to any material fact in issue, and hence was irrelevant\" and inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1369326\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/113/550/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1369326\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/113/550/\">\n    at 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n    <em>\n     Wenger\n    </em>\n    , this Court held that facts contained within a post-accident engineering study performed by the township's engineer was not a remedial measure as \"the whole purpose of [the] investigation was to determine whether remedial measures were warranted.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9178217\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/868/638/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9178217\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/868/638/\">\n     at 644\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As such, we concluded that the facts in the engineering study could be used by the plaintiff's expert to support his opinion that a proposed traffic device was an appropriate measure that the defendant could have employed to prevent the accident. However, in\n    <em>\n     Wenger\n    </em>\n    , the plaintiff did not seek to introduce evidence showing that the defendant did, in fact, install the traffic device after the accident, which would have been evidence of a subsequent remedial measure barred by Pa.R.E. 407.

(Trial court op. at 22-23.) Consequently, notwithstanding the trial court's ruling that evidence reflecting the subsequent remedial measures was inadmissible, Plaintiff was able to introduce other evidence to demonstrate the facts that she sought to submit to the jury, including proof that Defendant DOT had authority and control over Skippack Pike and the intersection, it was practical and viable for Defendant DOT to construct a dedicated left-turn, and Defendant DOT acted negligently in failing to do so.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9178217\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/868/638/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Hence, with the exception of offering evidence that displayed the subsequent remedial measure itself, Plaintiff admitted evidence at trial that was duplicative and cumulative of her proffered but excluded evidence.
