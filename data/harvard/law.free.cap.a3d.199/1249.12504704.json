We affirm the trial court's order, but remand for the imposition of attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2744.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts. In 2002, while insured by State Farm, Wallace was injured in an automobile collision with a vehicle driven by an underinsured motorist. Wallace's State Farm policy contained an arbitration clause (Arbitration Clause). The Arbitration Clause required the parties to submit disputes over coverage to an arbitration panel composed of an arbitrator appointed by State Farm, an arbitrator appointed by Wallace, and a \"competent and impartial third arbitrator\" to be selected by mutual\n   agreement or judicial decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   January 19, 2015 Arbitration Exhibit SF-5. Specifically, the Arbitration Clause empowered the arbitrators to decide whether Wallace was legally entitled to collect compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an underinsured motor vehicle and the amount of damages.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Per the policy, the Pennsylvania Arbitration Act of 1927 governed the arbitration, and the \"written decision of any two arbitrators shall be binding on each party.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, Wallace filed a petition to appoint a neutral arbitrator and to compel arbitration, averring that State Farm failed to pay all the proceeds to which she was entitled under the policy, and the parties could not agree on a third arbitrator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of her claim, Wallace averred that she had already appointed her arbitrator, but she did not name the arbitrator in the petition. Petition to Appoint Third/Neutral Arbitrator and to Compel Arbitration, 9/12/2008, at \u00b6 22. After State Farm filed an answer to Wallace's petition, the trial court appointed Shawn Ward, Esquire, as the neutral arbitrator, and ordered an arbitration hearing to occur within 60 days of its February 20, 2009 order. Order, 2/20/2009, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 19, 2013, State Farm filed a petition requesting that the trial court appoint a different neutral arbitrator in place of Ward, averring that Ward had never responded to the parties' correspondence. State Farm contended that an arbitrator was especially needed to decide a dispute between the parties regarding State Farm's motion to obtain medical records, work records, and an examination of Wallace under oath. In its petition, State Farm provided the name of its arbitrator, and averred that Wallace still had not named her arbitrator. Wallace filed an answer, agreeing that Ward should be replaced. Other than stating that her arbitrator was from Philadelphia, she still did not identify her arbitrator. Via an August 26, 2013 order, the trial court removed Ward as the neutral arbitrator, appointed Marc Rickles, Esquire in his place, and ordered that arbitration commence within 90 days of its order. Order, 8/26/2013, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After continued disputes regarding State Farm's requests,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   January 19, 2015 Arbitration Exhibits A-3-A-5, A-13, SF-1-SF-2, Arbitrator Rickles eventually scheduled an arbitration hearing for November 24, 2014, and requested that Wallace identify her arbitrator. January 19, 2015 Arbitration Exhibit A-6 (September 22, 2014 letter from Arbitrator Rickles to Attorney Tolan and Joseph Hankins, Esquire, State Farm's counsel). On November 13, 2014, Arbitrator Rickles sent a letter to Attorney Tolan, which again reiterated the scheduled date for the hearing, as well as stating that Arbitrator Rickles had not heard from Attorney Tolan or any arbitrator appointed by Wallace. January 19, 2015 Arbitration Exhibit A-7. Attorney Tolan replied to Arbitrator Rickles and requested that the hearing be rescheduled due to a scheduling conflict and his intent to withdraw from Wallace's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   January\n   19, 2015 Arbitration Exhibit A-8. In response, via a November 17, 2014 letter sent to Attorneys Tolan and Hankins, Arbitrator Rickles notified the parties that he was rescheduling the hearing for Monday, January 19, 2015, and provided a deadline for requesting a new date if needed. January 19, 2015 Arbitration Exhibit A-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 16, 2015, the Friday before the scheduled arbitration hearing, Wallace and Allen Feingold\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   a lawsuit against Arbitrator Rickles, State Farm, Attorney Hankins, the law firm of Attorney Hankins, and the attorney and law firm representing the underinsured motorist in Wallace's third party tort action.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   January 19, 2015 Arbitration Exhibit A-10. The complaint raised claims of bad faith, breach of contract, \"negligent misrepresentation,\" \"abuse of process,\" fraud, and civil conspiracy, all of which purport to be related to the defendants' conduct in Wallace's underinsured motorists' arbitration matter and the third-party tort matter.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On Sunday, January 18, 2015, Feingold sent a fax to Arbitrator Rickles and Attorney Hankins.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   January 19, 2015 Arbitration Exhibit A-11. In the fax, Feingold referenced the newly-filed lawsuit, requested that Arbitrator Rickles withdraw from the arbitration matter, and threatened to join State Farm's arbitrator in the lawsuit as a defendant if he participated in the arbitration matter further.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   He also stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [o]ver the years, [he has] seen third arbitrators allow defense counsel to obtain discovery that they should not have be [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] allowed to receive, but in this case, [Arbitrator] Rickles has crossed far beyond the line of fairness or neutrality and allowed the defense to obtain everything and anything they want providing an unfairness to this mater [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] that violates the law, the case law, and shatters the discovery that is allowed in the State Farm policy to prevent the plaintiff, injured party, claimant from\n   receiving a fair hearing, even before it starts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In closing, Feingold stated that he \"lost [his] law license trying to prevent injustice, but now, with no license, [he finds] that in a case where [he has] claims and old clients, [he] can do more to right those wrongs.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the morning of the January 19, 2015 hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wallace, Attorney Tolan, and the arbitrator purportedly appointed by Wallace failed to appear. Arbitrator Rickles attempted to reach out to Attorney Tolan multiple times.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T., 1/19/2015, at 4-5; January 19, 2015 Arbitration Exhibit A-12. After Arbitrator Rickles received no response, the arbitration hearing proceeded without Wallace, Attorney Tolan, or Wallace's arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Arbitrator Rickles and State Farm's arbitrator, William Thomson, Esquire, began by addressing Wallace's newly-filed lawsuit. They both concluded that the lawsuit did not require recusal because each believed he could act impartially. N.T., 1/19/2015, at 41-44. Both declined to consider Feingold's faxed request for recusal because Feingold was neither Wallace's attorney nor a party in the case.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Thus, not only had Wallace failed to move for recusal, the arbitrators agreed that it was her burden \"to produce evidence establishing bias, prejudice[,] or unfairness[,] which raises a substantial doubt as to the ... neutral party's ability to preside impartially.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 40, 43-44. The two arbitrators then entered an award on January 19, 2015, in favor of State Farm and against Wallace, noting that Wallace, Wallace's attorney, and Wallace's arbitrator had failed to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 18, 2015, Wallace, through Attorney Tolan, petitioned the trial court to set aside the arbitration award. Wallace averred that the neutral arbitrator had engaged in \"bad faith antics\" prior to the arbitration and unbeknownst to her, proceeded with a \"sham arbitration hearing,\" years after the August 26, 2013 order authorizing the arbitration, \"with [Wallace's] arbitrator out of the country and half way around the world and without [Wallace] or her counsel, all in spite of ... conflicts of interest\" based upon the lawsuit filed by Wallace the business day before the scheduled arbitration. Petition to Strike Arbitration Award, 2/18/2015, at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court initially granted Wallace's request,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Trial Court Order, 4/6/2015, at 1, but in response to State Farm's timely-filed motion for reconsideration, the trial court vacated the April 6, 2015 order pending reargument. Trial Court Order, 4/13/2015, at 1. Following briefing and a rule-to-show-cause hearing on June 30, 2017, the trial court granted State Farm's motion for reconsideration, vacated its April 6, 2015 order granting Wallace's petition to strike the arbitration award, confirmed the January 19, 2015 arbitration award, and entered judgment in favor of State Farm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial Court Order, 6/30/2017, at 1. Wallace timely filed a notice of appeal. Both Wallace and the trial court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, Wallace sets forth three arguments in support of her contention that the trial court erred in dismissing her petition to strike the arbitration award. First, she baldly asserts that Arbitrator Rickles improperly allowed State Farm to access Wallace's medical and third-party files, permitted State Farm to engage in\n   \"serial, repetitive improper discovery,\" and banished Wallace's arbitrator from participating in the process. Wallace's Brief at 10. As a result, she claims she was denied due process and a \"full and fair hearing.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Second, Wallace claims that Arbitrators Rickles and Thomson banished her arbitrator from participating in the hearing, panel deliberations, and fashioning of the award, and such banishment constitutes an \"irregularity\" that requires the trial court to strike the award.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 11-13. Third, she argues that the award should be set aside based upon Arbitrator Rickles's failure to recuse himself.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As discussed on page 1252, supra, the parties agreed to statutory arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Act of 1927. In 1980, the legislature repealed and replaced the Arbitration Act of 1927 with the Uniform Arbitration Act, 42 Pa. C. S. \u00a7\u00a7 7301 - 7362. However, parties remain free to agree to proceed according to the 1927 Act.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v.

Super. 2002). Under these circumstances, the trial court must adhere to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7302(d)(2) in reviewing the arbitration panel's award.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11425625,312795,11425517\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/804/1209/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11425625,312795,11425517\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/804/1209/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11425625,312795,11425517\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/804/1209/\">\n    at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When the Arbitration Act of 1927 is applicable, we review the affirmance of an arbitration award using the following standard. \"This Court may reverse a trial court's decision to affirm ... an arbitration award arising from an insurance contract only if the trial court abused its discretion or committed an error of law.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pantelis v.

Super. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before we address the merits of Wallace's issues, we must address her failure to comply with our rules of appellate procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wallace's brief does not contain a single citation to the record, in violation of Rules 2117 and 2119.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Pa.R.A.P. 2117(a)(4) (requiring a narrative statement of \"all the facts which are necessary to be known in order to determine the points in controversy, with an appropriate reference in each instance to the place in the record where the evidence substantiating the fact relied on may be found\"); Pa.R.A.P. 2119(c) (requiring the argument in a brief to be accompanied by a reference to the place in the record where the matter referred appears). \"We shall not ... scour the record to find evidence to support an argument; instead, we will deem [the] issue to be waived.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Milby v.

Super. 2018). Wallace also failed to compile a reproduced record that complies with Pa.R.A.P. 2152 - 2154. Compliance with the rules regarding the contents of reproduced records on appeal is mandatory, not directory.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Rosselli v. Rosselli,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11525881\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/750/355/#p357\">\n    750 A.2d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 (Pa. Super. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even after State Farm pointed out Wallace's failure to file a reproduced record or to cite to the record in any fashion, Wallace's response was to file a reply brief with a section entitled \"True History, Facts[,] and Improprieties Committed by [State Farm]\" with 29 divided paragraphs that still failed to comply with our rules of\n   appellate procedure.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Wallace's Reply Brief at 1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Wallace's failure to abide by the rules of appellate procedure is all the more egregious given her broad and sweeping accusations of impropriety by Arbitrators Rickles and Thomson. Wallace's counsel, Attorney Tolan, represented to this Court at oral argument that Wallace has had the same arbitrator throughout the case. However, despite Wallace's argument that the other arbitrators banished Wallace's arbitrator from the proceedings, the record contains no indication that Wallace ever named an arbitrator. In fact, the record is replete with documentation of unsuccessful efforts by the neutral arbitrator and State Farm's attorney to ascertain the name of Wallace's arbitrator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, on appeal, Wallace repeatedly fails to identify where she objected to the participation of Arbitrator Rickles in the arbitration.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Wallace's Brief at 14 (claiming that Wallace requested that Arbitrator Rickles withdraw without citation to the record or any description of where the request was made); Wallace's Reply Brief at 8 (same). This violates our rules of appellate procedure. Pa.R.A.P. 2117(c) (requiring a statement regarding where the party preserved an issue in the trial court); 2119(e) (same). Wallace was similarly vague in her motion to strike regarding her alleged objection to the participation of Arbitrator Rickles.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Motion to Strike, 2/18/2015, at \u00b6 13 (claiming that \"[Wallace's] counsel requested that the alleged neutral arbitrator not proceed with the arbitration...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Indeed, the record belies her repeated assertions that she objected to the participation of Arbitrator Rickles. At hearing on the rule to show cause regarding State Farm's motion for reconsideration, Attorney Tolan admitted to the trial court that he did not ask the trial court to appoint a new arbitrator, request a continuance, or appear at the hearing to place an objection on the record that the hearing was unfair. N.T., 6/30/2017, at 9-10. The record reveals that Wallace never moved or objected to Arbitrator Rickles's continued service as an arbitrator. Feingold's fax demanding Arbitrator Rickles's recusal simply does not constitute an objection by Wallace, as Feingold was neither a party to the arbitration nor counsel for Wallace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Wallace's claim that she objected to Arbitrator Rickles's failure to recuse himself is particularly troubling given the fact that her counsel, Attorney Tolan, also represented the appellant in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State Farm Mutual Auto.
