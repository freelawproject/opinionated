He was convicted and his motion for a new trial was denied. This appeal is from the judgment and the order denying a new trial.  The state of the evidence and the grounds urged for a reversal are the same as upon which a reversal was had in <em>People </em>v. <em>Quarez, </em>196 Cal. 404 [238 Pac. 363],</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">On the authority of that case the judgment and the order are reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
