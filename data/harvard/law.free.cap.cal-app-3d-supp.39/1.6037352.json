Each defendant, one at a time and acting in a completely peaceful manner, placed himself in a position intended to obstruct the operation of the machine employed to remove the trees. Prior to doing so, each defendant was advised by a deputy sheriff of the existence of section 647c and each indicated that he understood that if he were to stand in front of the machine used to remove the trees it would be a violation of law. Defendant Dickerson then placed himself in a position to obstruct the machine. He was requested by the sheriff to remove himself. When he did not, after a lapse of about two minutes, he was arrested. Similar events occurred first with defendant Hixon and then, after the arrest of Dickerson and Hixon, with defendant Man.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Defendants first make a series of arguments concerning the alleged constitutionality of section 647c. The arguments are misplaced. The \u201csymbolic conduct\u201d involved here is not free speech whose exercise is unconstitutionally impeded by the statute. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1965) 379 U.S. 536, 554-555 [13 L.Ed.2d 471, 483-484, 85 S.Ct. 453]; <em>In re Bushman </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 767, 773 [83 Cal.Rptr. 375, 463 P.2d 727]. Further, <em>In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992] indicates that the statute is constitutional. At issue there was a municipal ordinance which by its language made it an offense for persons to remain upon private property and business premises after being notified by the person in charge to remove themselves therefrom. The ordinance had an exception, \u201cWhere its application would result in an interference with or inhibition of any other exercise of a constitutionally protected right of freedom of speech . . . not involving offensive personal conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 210, fn. 2) The Supreme Court stated that it construed the \u201cordinance\u2019s somewhat vague prohibition of \u2018offensive personal conduct\u2019 to coincide exactly with those offenses punishable under Penal Code section 647c (obstruction of street, sidewalk, or other public area) . . .\u201d and that \u201c[t]his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 4\">*Supp. 4</page-number>necessarily narrowing construction preserves the constitutionality of the ordinance . . (3 Cal.3d 205, <em>id. </em>at p. 220, fn. 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Defendants also urge that the county was acting illegally in removing the trees because of an alleged failure to file an environmental impact report required by the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.). It has not been proven that the county was in violation of the Environmental Quality Act and, even if that were the case, the application of the act is not relevant to the inquiry here. Citizens have no right to take the law into their own hands in these circumstances and violate criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The record shows that the People indicated that they did not doubt the \u201cgood intentions\u201d of each of the defendants in interfering with the actions of the machine. Since the statute refers to acts done \u201cwillfully and maliciously,\u201d defendants urge that it was prejudicial error to instruct the jury that the word \u201cmalice\u201d denoted nothing more than a deliberate and intentional obstruction of street or sidewalk. Defendants argue that \u201csomething more than an intention to do the thing afterwards pronounced as wrong is necessary to constitute malice.\u201d Thus, defendants contend that section 647c requires proof of a specific intent. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Penal Code section 7 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\">\u201cThe following words have in this code- the significance attached to them in this section, unless otherwise apparent from the context:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-8\">\u201c1. The word \u2018willfully,\u2019 when applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted, implies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act, or make the omission referred to. It does not require any intent to violate law, or to injure another, or to acquire any advantage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-9\">\u201c4. The words \u2018malice\u2019 and \u2018maliciously\u2019 import a wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">The instructions given by the trial court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> complied with the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>These instructions comported with the use of the words \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cmaliciously\u201d as they appear in section 647c. There is nothing \u201cotherwise apparent from the context\u201d of section 647c to indicate that the words should be defined in a manner other than as provided in section 7 quoted above. Defendants rely on <em>People </em>v. <em>Goodin </em>(1902) 136 Cal. 455 [69 P. 85] and <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 621, 628-629 [83 Cal.Rptr. 747, 752-753]. <em>Goodin </em>held that a defendant charged with maliciously injuring a highway was not guilty if he had a bona fide mistaken belief or ignorance of the law since \u201cit is the criminal mind and purpose going with the act which distinguishes a criminal trespass from a mere civil injury.\u201d What was involved there, in reality, was a mistake of fact as to whether a highway had been abandoned. Properly read, therefore, the defendant in <em>Goodin </em>had a defense under subdivision Four of Penal Code section 26 since he committed the act in question under a \u201cmistake of fact, which disproves <em>any </em>criminal intent.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\"><em>Hoffman </em>indicates that the reason a defendant is present on a sidewalk which he is accused of obstructing, if it is a lawful reason, \u201cmight well constitute a valid defense to the charge of violating section 647c, since [defendant] obviously would lack the required willfulness and malice.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>also states, however, that questions as to the reasons a defendant was present on a sidewalk or street \u201care factual ones\u201d to be raised at the trial and defense of the charge <em>(id. </em>at pp. 628-629).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The reasons for each defendant\u2019s conduct in the instant case were fully explored at trial. It was made crystal clear that each defendant, with full advance warning and notice that his persistence would result in an arrest, nevertheless acted deliberately and with full intent to block the machine. The jury could only find that each of them acted with the required willfulness and malice. The instructions accurately presented the issues to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Holmes, Acting P. J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The statute reads as follows: \u201cEvery person who willfully and maliciously obstructs the free movement of any person on any street, sidewalk, or other public place or on or in any place open to the public is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">\u201cNothing in this section affects the power of a county or a city to regulate conduct upon a street, sidewalk, or other public place or on or in a place open to the public.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-12\">\u201c[To constitute the offense charged against the defendant, there must be a joint operation of act or conduct and criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">\u201cWhen a person intentionally does that which the law declares to be an offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>he is acting with criminal intent, even though he may not know that his conduct is unlawful, or even though he may not intend to violate the law.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">\u201cThe words \u2018malice\u2019 and \u2018maliciously\u2019 mean a wish to vex, annoy or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">\u201cYou Are Instructed That obstruction of street or sidewalk doesn\u2019t require a specific mental state. The word malice as used in this offense denotes nothing more than a deliberate and intentional obstruction of street or sidewalk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b873-9\">MARSHALL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9UJ\">I concur but would emphasize the point that there is a distinction to be drawn between the terms \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cmaliciously.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 6\">*Supp. 6</page-number>One does an act \u201cwillfully\u201d when he intends to do such act; and one does an act \u201cmaliciously\u201d when, inter alia (Pen. Code, \u00a7 7, subd. 4), he intends to do such act and knows that it is a wrongful act, i.e., one banned by law. In this case, the defendants intended to obstruct the machine and knew that such obstruction was a wrongful act. Hence, we must find a violation of section 647c, however laudable the defendants\u2019 motives may be.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
