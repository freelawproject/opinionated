The defendants, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore as well as the Charles Village Community Benefits District Management Authority, conversely, disputed that any of the Board members present at the meeting were ineligible to vote and argued that the Corporations and Associations Article of the Maryland Code (1975, 1999 RepLVol., 2005 Supp.),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> applied so that a quorum of only nine voting members was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants and the Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, affirmed. <em>Floyd v.

[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In 1994, the General Assembly enacted legislation enabling the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore to \u201cestablish, by ordinance, not more than six community benefits district management authorities, including the Charles Village Community Benefits District,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which would \u201cpromote and market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>districts, provide supplemental security and maintenance services, provide amenities in public areas, provide park and recreational programs and functions, and after an authority is established, other services and functions as requested by the authority and approved through an ordinance.\u201d Chapter 732 of the Maryland Laws of 1994.\u00ae The Legislature granted the Charles Village Community Benefits District Authority (the \u201cAuthority\u201d) the power, as provided by ordinance, to \u201cbe a special tax district,\u201d to submit to the Board of Estimates annually the proposed taxes to be imposed on properties in the district, to adopt bylaws, \u201cto establish and elect officers and provide for their terms and duties\u201d and \u201cto do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also empowered the Mayor and City Council to provide, in the establishing ordinance, for the imposition of taxes, subject to the Board of Estimates\u2019 approval, and for the \u201corganization and method of initial appointment of officers and board members of the Authority,\u201d with the limitation that voting board members \u201cbe eligible to vote in the election under subsection ((k)] of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Pursuant to the enabling legislation, the City Council enacted, and then Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke signed, Ordinance No. 94-414, entitled \u201cCharles Village Community Benefits District,\u201d which has been codified since the time in question at Subtitle 6 of Article XIV of the Baltimore City Code.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 6-3 of the Baltimore City Code expressly created the Authority and, like the enabling legislation, sets forth the purpose of the Authority: \u201cto promote and market the District, provide supplemental security and maintenance services, provide amenities in public areas [and] provide park and recreational programs and functions,\u201d while the powers granted to the Authority, appearing in Section 6-4, include:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00a7 6-4. Powers of Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The Authority shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">(1) not be or constitute or be deemed an agency of the City or the State of Maryland;</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">(2) to the greatest extent allowable by law, be deemed a special taxing district, and therefore a governmental body, both politic and corporate, exercising only such powers as are provided for in this subtitle;</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">(3) not exercise any power specifically withheld by the terms of either the Enabling Legislation {Article II, \u00a7 (63) of the City Charter (1996 Edition)}, or if more restrictive, this subtitle. However, the powers of the Authority shall be broadly interpreted in order to allow the Authority to achieve the goals of the Enabling Legislation, including the provision of supplementary security and maintenance services, the promotion and marketing of the District, and the provision of amenities in public areas;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>(4) acquire, hold, and use both real and personal property necessary to achieve its purposes, including the acquisition by purchase, lease, or other means;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">(5) engage the services of an administrator (the \u201cAdministrator\u201d), which may be an individual or an entity, to administer the programs and undertakings of the Authority;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">(6) sue and be sued, provided that the District, the Authority, its Board of Directors, and the Administrator shall benefit, to the fullest extent allowable by law, from any provisions of federal, state, and local law limiting the liability of employees, officers, agents, and officials of governmental bodies;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">^ H<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *!\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">(9) adopt an annual budget and impose, charge, and collect the taxes or charges on benefitted properties within the District authorized by the Enabling Legislation and this subtitle; provided, however, that no taxes shall be levied against properties which are exempt under state law from ordinary property taxes;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">(11) establish and elect such officers of the Board as are not specified in this subtitle and provide for their terms and duties;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">(13) subject to the approval of the Board of Estimates, adopt, amend, and modify bylaws, consistent with the Enabling Legislation and this subtitle;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">(17) do all other things necessary or convenient to carry out its goals, objectives, and powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Consistent with the Authority\u2019s ability to \u201cimpose, charge, and collect the taxes or charges on benefitted properties within the District authorized by the Enabling Legislation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Section 6-8 of the Baltimore City Code dictates that a \u201cSupplemental Tax shall be assessed and collected in conjunction with the property taxes assessed and collected by the City (\u2018Regular Tax\u2019)\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny increase in the rate of the Supplemental Tax must be approved by a majority of the voting Board members.\u201d Even if the Supplemental Tax rate is not increased, however, the Board \u201cshall adopt an annual financial plan ... consisting of at least a proposed schedule of taxes or charges to be imposed throughout the District,\u201d Section 6-7 of the Baltimore City Code, which \u201cshall be subject to the approval of the Board of Estimates.\u201d Section 6-14 of the Baltimore City Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In turn, Section 6\u20146(d) of the Baltimore City Code states that, \u201c[t]he number of members of the full Board must be at least 14, excluding vacancies, and no more than 27,\u201d and that, \u201c[t]he Board may increase or decrease its membership, within these limits.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Voting members of the Board \u201cmust be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>eligible to vote in the election,\u201d Section 6-6(e)(7) of the Baltimore City Code; eligibility is limited to \u201cowners of property within the District which is subject to tax\u201d and \u201cvoters registered to vote within the District.\u201d Section 6-15(b) of the Baltimore City Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In addition to submitting proposed changes to the Supplemental Tax rate to the Board of Estimates, the Board also can \u201cadopt such bylaws, rules, and regulations as it deems necessary in carrying out the powers of the Authority, so long as the same shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this subtitle or of any ordinance amendatory or supplementary hereof or of the Enabling Legislation.\u201d Section 6-6(g) of the Baltimore City Code. All bylaws adopted by the Board must be approved by the Board of Estimates. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The seminal interim Board members of the Authority adopted bylaws on January 11, 1995.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Bylaw 2.12, entitled \u201cQuorum and Voting,\u201d requires \u201c[t]he actual presence of at least 9 voting members\u201d for a quorum at all meetings of the Board and provides that, \u201c[t]he act of a majority of voting members in attendance at a Board of Directors meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the entire Board of Directors.\u201d The language in bylaw 5.03 goes further, however, stating that the Supplemental Tax rate \u201cmust be approved by a majority of all of the voting Board members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Bylaw 2.09, on the other hand, states that, \u201c[i]n the event of resignation, expiration or other departure from the Board of a member not appointed by an elected official or an association, a majority of the remaining directors, whether or not sufficient to constitute a quorum, may fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors.\u201d Board members \u201cnot appointed by an elected official or an association\u201d include the four at-large voting members, each of whom is elected from one of the quadrants of the District under bylaw 2.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In the present case, Joan Floyd and other individuals subject to the Supplemental Tax (\u201cFloyd\u201d) filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the Authority as well as the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the \u201cCity\u201d). Floyd sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as a declaratory judgment, arguing that the adoption of the Supplemental Tax rate at the April 11, 2006 meeting \u201cwas beyond the powers of the Authority as enumerated in the Code and the Baltimore City Charter.\u201d Specifically, the complaint alleged that three voting Board members, Richard Burnham, Eric Friedman and Michael Gervais, were ineligible to vote at the April 11, 2006 meeting at which the Supplemental Tax was approved and that because there were an inadequate number of voting members present on April 11, 2006, the Board of Estimates \u201cviolated the express prohibition in both the Code and the Baltimore City Charter against approval of a Supplemental Tax in excess of what is proposed by the Authority,\u201d when it approved the proposed tax at a May 17, 2006 meeting, thereby rendering the Supplemental Tax null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">After Floyd filed her complaint, the Board held a special meeting on June 21, 2006 in order to \u201cratify some past actions of the [B]oard\u201d and adopted a resolution containing the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">1. That the Board hereby approves the Authority\u2019s budget and the surtax rate for the Charles Village Community Benefits District for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, that were approved by the Board of Estimates of the City of Baltimore on or about May 17, 2006;</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>2. That the Board hereby ratifies and approves the actions of the Board taken at the December 13 meeting, including but not limited to the appointment of Michael Gervais to membership on the Board as a voting member, representing Quad 4;</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">3. That the Board hereby ratifies and approves the actions of the Board taken at the April 11 meeting, including but not limited to the Board\u2019s approval of the proposed budget for the Authority for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, and the Board\u2019s vote to keep the surtax rate of 12 cents per $100 of assessed value unchanged for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007; and</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">4. That these resolutions have retroactive effect to the fullest extent necessary and allowed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The record does not reflect that this resolution was submitted to the Board of Estimates and acted upon or that the Board of Estimates acted to ratify its own acts at its meeting on May 17, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The Circuit Court held a hearing on July 18, 2006, during which each party presented various exhibits, and the City called three witnesses to testify, including the Interim Administrator of the Authority, who testified that corporations that owned property in the District were listed as voters. The Circuit Court Judge, in a Memorandum Opinion, noted that Michael Gervais, one of the challenged Board members, was challenged because \u201che was \u2018appointed\u2019 at a December 13, 2005 meeting of the Authority Board to fill a vacancy occasioned by the resignation of a July elected Board member\u201d and went on to articulate the issues and make various findings, none of which findings has been contested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">[Plaintiffs] primary argument is that the quorum requirement for passage of the FY 2007 budget, financial plan and supplemental tax should be a majority of all voting members of the Board of the Authority and that on the critical dates in question here ... the Board acted without a quorum present and voting, due to its inclusion in that voting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>quorum of three Board members whose eligibility is here challenged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">The meeting minutes of April 11, 2006 (defendants\u2019 Exhibit 5) indicates that there were ten voting and one non-voting members present. The motions to approve the FY 2007 proposed budget, to maintain the same surtax rate of 12d; per $100 of assessed value and to send the approved budget to the Board of Estimates for final approval were all sustained by unanimous votes. Among the voting members were the three individuals whose voting eligibility is challenged by plaintiffs, Richard Burnham, Eric Friedman and Michael Gervais. Thus, in order for an appropriate quorum to be present at this meeting, at least two of the three challenged Board members had to be eligible to vote. Richard Burnham testified that he had been a voting member of the Authority\u2019s Board for a period of five years and presently serves as its treasurer. His capacity to serve as a voting member of the Board arises from his representation of a constituent organization, The Old Goucher Business Alliance, Inc., which is allotted two voting members under Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-6(e)(4). Mr. Burnham further testified that he is the owner of a business, located within the District, known as Graphic Imaging, Inc., a sub-chapter S corporation of which he is the sole owner and president. Consequently, he personally pays the supplemental tax imposed on the property owned by Graphic Imaging, Inc. Plaintiffs challenge Mr. Burham\u2019s eligibility to serve as a voting member of the Board. They point to Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6\u20146(e)(7) which requires that a voting member of the Board be eligible to vote in the election under \u00a7 6-15 of the Code. By its express terms, \u00a7 6-15 limits eligible voters to \u201cowners of property within the District which is subject to tax under \u00a7 6-8; and voters registered to vote within the District.\u201d Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-15(b). Because Mr. Burnham is not technically either an owner of property within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>District or registered to vote there, plaintiffs contend that he may not serve on the Board in a voting capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">Plaintiffs do not dispute that Eric Friedman is the Mayor\u2019s current appointee to serve on the Authority\u2019s Board. Nor do they dispute that the Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6\u20146(e)(1) authorizes the Mayor to appoint one voting member to the Board. Their contention with respect to Mr. Friedman is that he fails to meet the voting eligibility requirements of \u00a7 6-15 because he is neither an owner of property subject to the tax within the District nor a registered voter there. Defendants counter that the Board has never interpreted this provision to require the Mayor\u2019s representative, the only citywide voting representative on the Board, to comply with the technical requirements of \u00a7 6-15 and, alternatively, that the City owns property within the District, although it is exempt from the supplemental tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In denying Floyd relief, the judge concluded that Burnham, although \u201cnot technically an owner of property subject to the tax within the District,\u201d was the sole owner and president of a Subchapter S corporation who paid the Supplemental Tax on the property where his business was located and thus, was an eligible voting member. The judge noted, \u201c[Burnham\u2019s] participation as a voting member of the Board is consistent with the provisions in all the governing documents calling for representatives of the professional and retail and tenant community to serve thereon.\u201d With respect to Friedman, the judge determined that Friedman was eligible, because \u201cthe record is void of any evidence establishing that Eric Friedman either does not own property in the District subject to the tax or that he is not a registered voter in the District.\u201d After the Circuit Court Judge held that nine voting members were necessary to constitute a quorum under the bylaws, he also held that there was a quorum present at the April 11, 2006 meeting, because both Burnham and Friedman were eligible voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>With respect to the appointment of Gervais, the Circuit Court Judge concluded that because both Burnham and Friedman were eligible voting members, it was \u201cunnecessary for the Court to determine whether [Gervais] became an eligible voting member of the Board on December 13, 2005, when he was appointed to fill a vacancy.\u201d The Memorandum Opinion, nonetheless, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">[W]ith the Court\u2019s findings today that a valid quorum was constituted by nine present voting members, and that Mr. Burnham and Mr. Friedman were eligible voting members, it does appear that Mr. Gervais\u2019 appointment was approved by the unanimous vote of the nine voting members present on that date (Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">Mr. Gervais\u2019 status, therefore, hinges on Authority by-law 2.09, which governs the filling of vacancies of Board members not appointed by elected officials or associations. The by-law appears to permit the actions taken on December 13, 2005. The fact that Ms. Mayer\u2019s term had not yet begun points up a difficulty with the existing by-law because it does not contemplate such a situation. Nonetheless, Michael Gervais was selected by a majority of the remaining directors to fill her vacancy and he is entitled to serve until the next annual meeting or a new Board member from Quad 4 is elected and qualified. The Authority would be well advised to reconsider this by-law provision in light of its inconsistent interpretation and limited scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Floyd filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, alleging, in part, that the judge failed to decide whether bylaw 5.03(b) \u201crequired a majority, or 10 out of 19, of all voting members to approve the Supplemental Tax rate,\u201d and that \u201cthe City was the custodian of an official document proving that Eric Friedman was neither a registered voter within the District nor an owner of property subject to the Supplemental Tax.\u201d A hearing was held on the matter on August 22, 2006, during which a financial disclosure statement for Friedman was admitted, after which an Amended Declaratory Judgment was filed, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>[T]he Court does not believe that plaintiffs have met their burden of proof by the introduction of admissible evidence to establish that Eric Friedman was neither an owner of property subject to the supplemental tax in the Benefits District nor a registered voter there. On the other hand, defendants cannot honestly contend that Mr. Friedman meets the voting member eligibility requirements of the Baltimore City Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6\u201415(b). Nor is there any express provision in the Baltimore City Code, exempting the Mayor\u2019s appointed representative from those voting eligibility requirements. Thus, a reasonable interpretation of the Code provisions would be that the Mayor is entitled to appoint a voting member of the Authority\u2019s Board, so long as he chooses someone who otherwise meets the voting eligibility requirements of \u00a7 6\u201415(b). For the purposes of this Amended Declaratory Judgment, therefore, the Court will not predicate its decision upon Eric Friedman\u2019s eligibility to serves as a voting member of the Authority\u2019s Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ana\">The court concluded, nonetheless, that were Friedman\u2019s vote on April 11, 2006 not to be counted, \u201cthere were still nine votes to approve the supplemental tax rate, clearly a majority of the fourteen voting members required by \u00a7 5.03B,\u201d because Burnham was eligible to vote for the reasons stated in the July 26, 2006 Memorandum Opinion and Gervais was duly elected on December 13, 2006 under bylaw 2.09. As to Gervais, the Amended Declaratory Judgment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">In accordance with the by-laws of the Charles Village Community Benefits District and Management Authority \u00a7 2.09, Michael Gervais was duly elected to the Board of the Authority on December 13, 2005 to fill a vacancy occasioned by the departure of the recently elected Quad 4 Board representative, Tammy Mayer. He is entitled to serve on the Board until its next annual meeting or such earlier or later time as his successor is elected and qualifies. Giving full consideration to the concerns expressed in the Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion of July 26, 2006, the Court nevertheless finds that Michael Gervais was a valid, voting member of the Authority\u2019s Board when it approved the FY 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>budget, financial plan and supplemental tax on April 11, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Floyd appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, before which the parties reiterated their arguments previously articulated before the trial court. Subsequently, the Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Floyd v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>179 Md.App. 394, 946 A.2d 15 (2008). In analyzing whether the Board properly set its own quorum \u201cof at least 9 voting members\u201d in bylaw 2.12, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the Board had the authority to set a quorum of less than a majority of the nineteen authorized voting Board members, because it was a corporation subject to the Corporations and Associations Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">We also disagree with appellant\u2019s claim that there was no statutory authority authorizing the Authority to adopt Bylaw 2.12. There are, in fact, several independent sources of this authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">First, the Ordinance creating the Authority granted it the power, \u201csubject to approval of the Board of Estimates,\u201d to \u201cadopt, amend, and modify bylaws, consistent with the Enabling Legislation and this subtitle.\u201d Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-4(13). The Ordinance did not withhold from the Board the power to pass a bylaw setting a quorum of less than a majority, and Bylaw 2.12 is not in conflict with any provisions of the Enabling Law or the Ordinance. Second, the Authority\u2019s power to enact Bylaw 2.12 derives from C.A. \u00a7 2-408(b), which authorizes Maryland corporations to set quorums of less than a majority, and C.A. \u00a7 1-102, which provides that the Article applies to every Maryland corporation, except as otherwise provided by statute. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>regard, the Ordinance clearly states that, to the extent allowed under law, the Authority is a body corporate. Appellant suggests that C.A. \u00a7 2-408(b) does not apply to the Board because it is a \u201cgovernmental body.\u201d But, she cites no relevant authority to support her claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 436-37, 946 A.2d at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The intermediate appellate court also affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s decision that Gervais was properly appointed under bylaw 2.09, which did not contradict the Baltimore City Code or enabling legislation. The court also determined that Burn-ham was eligible to vote on April 11, 2006, because, although \u201che neither lived in nor personally owned property in the District,\u201d he was the owner of a corporation that did and the language of the Baltimore City Code \u201cdoes not show any objective intent to restrict the meaning of the word \u2018owner\u2019 to include only natural persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 452, 946 A.2d at 48, 49. The Court of Special Appeals went on to further note there was testimony presented that \u201ccorporations that owned property subject to the Surtax were eligible voters in the referendum held to approve the establishment of the Authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 946 A.2d at 49. Finally, the court held that, because the Board left the Supplemental Tax rate unchanged and bylaw 5.03(D) only required a majority of the Board to approve the Supplemental Tax rate if it is attempting to change the rate, no Board action was necessary: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">... Bylaw 5.03(D) only requires the Board to approve the supplemental tax rate if it seeks to change the rate. The Board left the rate unchanged, so it did not have to hold a vote on the Supplemental Tax. Consequently, no matter how we construe the meaning of the word \u201cmajority\u201d in Bylaw 5.03(B), which applies to a change in the tax rate, there is no merit to appellant\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s approval of the Surtax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 456, 946 A.2d at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">We disagree with the Court of Special Appeals that the Corporations and Associations Article applies to the Authority, because it is a public corporation, but we will affirm its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>mandate as the actions related to the Supplemental Tax taken at the April 11, 2006 meeting of the Authority were valid, because a quorum was present, as Burnham, Friedman and Gervais were eligible voting members.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Floyd argues that the Board was required to transact business at a meeting according to the requisites of our cases, as opposed to the provisions of the Corporations and Associations Article, which she contends applies only to private corporations. According to Floyd, our case law requires ten voting members, a majority of the fully authorized voting membership of 19, to constitute a quorum. Floyd further asserts that even if the Corporations and Associations Article were to apply, so that a quorum would be constituted by nine voting members, on April 11, 2006, a quorum was not present, because out of the ten voting members present at that meeting, Burnham, who was neither the owner of property subject to the Supplemental Tax nor a registered voter in the District, was ineligible to vote as were Gervais, who was not appointed by a lawful quorum on the December 13, 2005 meeting, and Friedman.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Both the Authority and the City, conversely, assert that the Corporations and Associations Article, which states, in Section 2-408(b), that corporate bylaws may provide for a quorum of less than a majority, applies to the Authority, so that only nine voting members needed to be present at the April 11, 2006 meeting to conduct business. The Authority and City also contend that were our cases to apply, the Board, which may have anywhere from 14 to 27 members, was not a body of definite membership but was a body of indefinite membership, so that only eight voting members were required to be present at the April 11, 2006 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In response to the arguments of the Authority and the City, Floyd asserts that the Board was not an indefinite body ranging from 14 to 27 members, but instead a definite body consisting of 19 authorized voting seats, so that 10 voting members were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Primarily, we note that under Section 2-408(b)(2) of the Corporations and Associations Article<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a corporation\u2019s \u201cbylaws may provide that less than a majority, but not less than one-third of the entire board of directors, may constitute a quorum,\u201d so that the quorum of nine voting members set forth in the Authority\u2019s bylaws would be permissible if the Authority were a private corporation. We have recognized, however, that, \u201c[t]o constitute a corporate assembly at common law, there must always be present a quorum, consisting of at least a majority of the number of all the members, and no valid act can be done without a majority of a quorum,\u201d so that either ten voting members, a majority of those authorized to serve as voting members, or eight voting members, a majority of those who occupied voting seats at the time of the April 11, 2006 meeting, needed to have been present. <em>Murdoch v.

Rather, the dispositive question is whether the Authority is a public corporation subject to the constitutional provisions governing charter home rule counties and, in turn, the common law, or whether the Authority is a corporation subject to the provisions of Section 48 of Article III of the Maryland Constitution and the Corporations and Associations Article, because the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding is premised on the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">This Court, heretofore, has had occasion to distinguish between public and private corporations, in <em>State v. Board of Education of Montgomery County, </em>346 Md. 633, 645, 697 A.2d 1334, 1340 (1997), wherein we defined a public corporation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">[Pjublic corporations [are] created by the Legislature for political purposes, with political powers, to be exercised for purposes connected with the public good, in the administration of civil government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">They are instruments of government subject at all times to the control of the Legislature with respect to their duration, powers, rights and property.

Anne Arundel County, </em>334 Md. 109,113, 638 A.2d 74, 75 (1994), in which real property owners in the Cape St. Claire Community Benefits District sought to invalidate the Anne Arundel County ordinance creating the District, alleging that the tax was \u201cnot for a public purpose.\u201d In validating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>ordinance, we took the opportunity to describe a special assessment, as a \u201c \u2018tax levied ... upon a limited class of persons interested in local improvements, and who are presumed to be benefitted by the improvement,\u2019\u201d which must have a \u201c \u2018public purpose\u2019 \u201d and confer \u201c \u2018a special benefit to the properties to be assessed over and above that accruing to the public\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u201cThe use of such \u2018special assessments\u2019 has a long history in the United States.\u201d O. Reynolds, Jr., Local Government Law \u00a7 99, at 300 (1982) (footnote omitted). In <em>Gould v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>59 Md. 378 (1883), this Court contrasted special assessments with the general property tax, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cThe right to make such assessments is undoubtedly an exercise of the taxing power, but an assessment thus made differs from a general tax levied for State and city purposes. The latter is a tax imposed on all persons within the territorial limits according to the value of their property, in consideration of the protection, which the government affords alike to all. A local assessment, on the other hand, is a tax levied occasionally as may be required upon a limited class of persons interested in local improvement, and who are presumed to be benefitted by the improvement over and above the ordinary benefit which the community in general derive from the expenditure of the money. In the payment of the assessment thus made, the adjacent owner is supposed to be compensated by the enhanced value of his property, arising from the improvement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u201cIn order to justify a special assessment for a local improvement ... there must be both a public purpose and a special benefit to the properties to be assessed over and above that accruing to the public.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v.

One treatise expands on the concept, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u201cIn order to justify a local assessment the improvement must be a public one; that is, it must be one which confers a general benefit upon the public at large, and which, therefore, the public acting through its government may construct without the consent of the particular individuals affected thereby. Local assessment for benefits is a form of taxation and the very nature of taxation implies that it is for a public interest. An improvement which lacks this element is essentially a private improvement, and no matter how useful or advantageous it may be, the public cannot compel its construction, nor can it pay therefor by funds raised by general taxation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">1 W. Page &amp; P. Jones, <em>Taxation by Local and Special Assessments </em>\u00a7 283, at 439 (1909) (footnotes omitted). Although special benefit assessments were first utilized to finance certain capital improvements, typically elements of the infrastructure of local government, special benefit assessments may also be used to finance the operating expenses of local government for services beneficial to property in an area. <em>See Pumphrey v.

This Court then concluded that the tax was properly levied, because the use of tax monies for general property maintenance, pier construction, outdoor lighting, security, sanitary facilities, and the construction of a storage facility, among others, benefitted people in the District and had a public purpose, enhancing the quality of life as well as property values in the assessment area. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 122, 638 A.2d at 78, 80.

The language of Section 63(e) is that of a disclaimer to avoid the application of agency principles, because \u201cspecial taxing district[s]\u201d are explicitly included in the definition of \u201clocal government\u201d entities subject to certain actions in tort under the Local Government Tort Claims Act. <em>See </em>Section 5-301(d) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.). The language of disclaimer, however, does not affect our characterization of the Authority as a public corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The Authority disputes that it is a \u201cpublic\u201d corporation, however, asserting that the provisions of Section 48 of Article III of the Maryland Constitution authorizes its corporate status, and as a \u201cMaryland corporation\u201d it is subject to the Corporations and Associations Article;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the first sentence of Section 48 of Article III of the Maryland Constitution states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANZ\">Section 48. Corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">Corporations may be formed under general laws, but shall not be created by special Act, except for municipal purposes and except in cases where no general laws exist, providing for the creation of corporations of the same general character, as the corporation proposed to be created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Our recognition that the Authority, as a special tax district, has a public purpose undermines the Authority\u2019s premises regarding the applicability of this language, because we have determined the first sentence of Section 48 of Article III is inapplicable to corporations that are public in nature. <em>Atlantic Golf, Ltd. Partnership v. Maryland Economic Dev. Corp., </em>377 Md. 115, 125, 832 A.2d 207, 212-13 (2003). In <em>Atlantic Golf </em>we expressly stated that \u201c[t]he first and second sentences of \u00a7 48, adopted in 1851, suggest that \u00a7 48 is limited in its application to private corporations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We also, in <em>Atlantic Golf, </em>377 Md. at 115, 832 A.2d at 207, had occasion to address the applicability of Acts of the General Assembly to State entities. Although a definitional provision of the Corporations and Associations Article was utilized to define a corporate \u201ccharter,\u201d Judge John C. Eldridge, writing for this Court in <em>Atlantic Golf, </em>emphasized that unless an enactment expressly provides that it applies to a governmental entity, it is generally deemed to not apply, because \u201c \u2018it is a basic and long-standing principle of statutory construction that the State is not deemed to be bound by an enactment of the General Assembly unless the enactment specifically names the State or manifests a clear and indisputable intention that the State is to be bound.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126-27, 832 A.2d at 214, citing <em>Baltimore v. State, </em>281 Md. 217, 223-24, 378 A.2d 1326, 1329-30 (1977). The Corporations and Associations Article does not expressly provide for its provisions to apply to special tax districts, which are considered local government entities, <em>see, e.g., Bennett, </em>359 Md. at 362, 754 A.2d at 370 (noting that special tax districts are included as local government entities for tort purposes), and, accordingly, the Authority, as a local government entity, cannot be bound by the provisions therein. <em>See Atlantic Golf, </em>377 Md. at 126-27, 832 A.2d at 214, citing <em>Baltimore v. State, </em>281 Md. at 223-24, 378 A.2d at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Having concluded that the Authority is a public corporation, not subject to the quorum provisions of the Corporations and Associations Article, we turn now to whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>sufficient number of voting members was present at the Authority\u2019s April 11, 2006 meeting at which the Supplemental Tax was approved. Bylaw 5.03(D) of the Authority\u2019s bylaws provides that changes in the Supplemental Tax rate must be approved by \u201ca majority of all the voting Board members,\u201d but the parties dispute whether a \u201cmajority of all the voting Board members\u201d consists of ten voting members, a majority of the fully authorized voting membership of 19, or eight voting members, a majority of the 14 individuals who occupied voting seats at the time of the meeting. Whether the relevant majority on April 11, 2006 was eight or ten, however, is irrelevant to our analysis, because we shall conclude that ten voting members were present to approve the Supplemental Tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">With respect to Richard Burnham, the Circuit Court found that although he neither individually owned property within the District nor was registered to vote therein, he was the sole shareholder of a Subchapter S corporation that owned property and payed the Supplemental Tax individually. Based on those facts, both the circuit court and Court of Special Appeals concluded that he was an eligible voting member, because he met the eligibility criteria to vote on the establishment of the District. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Burnham\u2019s eligibility hinges upon whether a sole shareholder in a Subchapter S corporation is a \u201cperson[] eligible to vote,\u201d such as he or she may serve as a voting member of the Board. Under the enabling legislation, now codified at Section 63(c)(4) of Article II of the Baltimore City Charter, \u201c[a] voting member of the board must be eligible to vote in the election under subsection [ (k)] of this section,\u201d which, in turn, states that \u201c[t]he ordinance shall provide criteria for the eligibility of voters for purposes of the election required by this subsection.\u201d Section 6-15 of the Baltimore City Code is the ordinance providing the eligibility criteria for voters and governs the maintenance of a list of eligible voters in addition to the eligibility criteria and states, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">(a) <em>List of eligible voters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The Board of Estimates, with the assistance of the interim Board, the Department of Finance, and the Supervisor of the Board of Elections, shall be responsible for compiling a list of those persons eligible to vote on the establishment of the District and on any question relating to its renewal,</p>\n<p id=\"AsF\">(b) <em>Eligibility entena.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The following persons are eligible to vote subject to the limitations that no person may have more than 1 vote:</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">(1) owners of property within the District which is subject to the tax under \u00a7 6-8; and</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">(2) voters registered to vote within the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Burnham is eligible to vote based on the eligibility criteria under Section 6\u201415(b) of the Baltimore City Code. The plain meaning of the word \u201cowner\u201d is \u201c[o]ne who has the right to possess, use, and convey something.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1136 (8th ed.2004). As the sole shareholder of an S corporation Burnham, although not personally the owner of the property, effectively had \u201cthe right to possess, use, and convey\u201d the property. Additionally, the Interim Administrator of the Authority testified that in compiling the list of eligible voters under Section 6-15(a) of the Baltimore City Code, corporations that owned property in the District were included. Clearly, the corporation, as an eligible voter, could vote only through a representative, such as Burnham.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Section 6-6 (e) of the Baltimore City Code, moreover, states that \u201c[a]t least a majority of the Board shall be composed of owners or representatives of property owners subject to the tax imposed by this subtitle\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Board shall endeavor to maintain representatives on the Board from the professionals practicing in the District, the retail merchants within the District, and the tenants of properties in the District.\u201d The inclusion of \u201crepresentatives of property owners\u201d and the \u201cendeavor\u201d to include \u201cprofessionals practicing in the District,\u201d and \u201cretail merchants within the District\u201d on the Board, supports our conclusion that the drafters of the Baltimore City Code intended that representatives of corporations subject to the tax be included as voting Board members.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Eric Friedman\u2019s eligibility to vote when the Supplemental Tax was adopted was also challenged by Floyd; she alleged that he neither owned property subject to the Supplemental Tax nor was registered to vote in the District as required by Section 6\u201415(b) of the Baltimore City Code, but failed to maintain a successful challenge. The Circuit Court Judge in his original Declaratory Judgment and Memorandum Opinion, noted that \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 claim with respect to Mr. Friedman must fail for a want of evidence,\u201d because \u201cthe record is void of any evidence establishing that Eric Friedman either does not own property in the District subject to the tax or that he is not a registered voter in the District.\u201d In his subsequent amendment, the judge determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 failed to \u201cme[et] their burden of proof by the introduction of admissible evidence to establish that Eric Friedman was neither an owner of property subject to the supplemental tax in the Benefits District nor a registered voter there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">With respect to whether Michael Gervais was properly appointed to fill a vacancy on the Board at the December 13, 2005 meeting, the judge found that under bylaw 2.09 \u201cMichael Gervais was duly elected to the Board of the Authority on December 13, 2005 to fill a vacancy occasioned by the departure of the recently elected Quad 4 Board representative.\u201d Floyd, however, argues that when Gervais was appointed at the December 13, 2005 meeting, again, there was not a sufficient quorum to enable Gervais to be a voting member on April 11, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Section 6-6 (c)(3) of the Baltimore City Code provides that: \u201cIn the event of resignation, expiration, or other departure from the Board, or removal in accordance with the bylaws of the Authority, of any member of the Board, successors shall be elected by the remaining members of the Board.\u201d Bylaw 2.09 also states that, \u201c[i]n the event of resignation, expiration or other departure from the Board of a member not appointed by an elected official or an association, a majority of the remaining directors, whether or not sufficient to constitute a quorum, may fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>There were 11 voting members on the Board on December 13, 2005, nine of whom were present and unanimously approved Gervais\u2019s appointment. The nine were sufficient to constitute \u201ca majority of the remaining directors\u201d under bylaw 2.09 rendering Gervais\u2019s appointment proper. Although Floyd argues that the bylaws could not derogate common law quorum requirements, Section 2 of Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution specifically allows the General Assembly to grant express powers to charter home rule jurisdictions. Two of these express powers granted to Baltimore City include the power \u201cto adopt, amend and modify bylaws\u201d and the power \u201cto do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its powers.\u201d Chapter 732 of the Maryland Laws of 1994, now codified as Section 63(d) of Article II of the Baltimore City Charter. Clearly, then, the Authority and City had the power to enact bylaw 2.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the Authority is a public corporation, and not subject to the quorum requirements of the Corporations and Associations Article and that at the April 11, 2006 Board meeting at which the Supplemental Tax was approved for submission to the Board of Estimates, there were ten voting members, a sufficient number to approve the Tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Unlike home rule counties, however, the express powers of which are codified in Section 5-6 of Article 25A of the Maryland Code (1974, 2005 Repl.VoL), the express powers of Baltimore City are codified in Article II of the Baltimore City Charter. <em>Piscatelli v.
