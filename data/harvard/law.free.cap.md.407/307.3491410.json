These statements were made in response to the officer asking her \u201cwhat happened\u201d and \u201cwhere she got the marks[.]\u201d These statements were admitted at the bench trial in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County which resulted in the conviction of Dennis Lamont Lucas, respondent, for second degree assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State appeals from the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversing that conviction on the ground that respondent\u2019s constitutional rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Lucas was alleged to have assaulted his girlfriend during a domestic dispute. Lucas moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the victim\u2019s statements made to police officers who responded to the \u201cdomestic\u201d call, contending that the statements\u2019 admission would violate his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Satisfied that the statements were admissible as an excited utterance and allowable under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Circuit Court denied Lucas\u2019s motion. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, reversed and remanded for a new trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>concluding that the statements were made under official interrogation, an obvious substitute for live testimony, and admitted in violation of Lucas\u2019s right to confront his accuser:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM3\">There was no emergency in progress; [the alleged victim] was in no present danger from [Lucas]; she was being protected by the police; she was actively separated from [Lucas]; she was telling what happened in the past, not the present; and the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We issued a writ of certiorari to review the statements under <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny. We agree with the intermediate appellate court that the statements were testimonial because the primary purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime, and not to enable the officers to meet an ongoing emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">On January 25, 2005, at approximately 11:00 p.m., Anne Arundel County Police Officer Wilbert Fowler received a \u201c[domestic call.\u201d Fowler and Officer Dalton responded to 412 Pamela Road, Apartment B, in Glen Burnie a couple of minutes after receiving the call. Upon their arrival at the residence, Fowler observed Lucas sitting on some steps outside of the apartment. Fowler descended four or five stairs in getting to Apartment B, which was located in the lower level of the apartment building. Dalton stayed with Lucas outside of the apartment. Fowler encountered Emily Mulligan, the alleged victim, at her apartment \u201cthreshold\u201d and observed that she was crying, her face was pretty red, her \u201ceyes were kind of swollen and she had red marks on her neck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Fowler testified that he then questioned Mulligan \u201cabout why [they] were called to the residence and why she was crying.\u201d According to Fowler, Mulligan responded that she and Lucas, her boyfriend, \u201cwere in a verbal argument\u201d about \u201cbreaking up\u201d and \u201cthat it became physical after that.\u201d Fowler testified that she told him she was \u201ckicked in the leg\u201d by Lucas and that \u201che grabbed her around the neck.\u201d She also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>told Fowler she sustained an abrasion or laceration on her back. Fowler did not have Mulligan sit down during the conversation. When asked by counsel \u201c[w]hat if any rights did you advise her of[,]\u201d Fowler responded, \u201cI told her we were there for an investigation.\u201d He estimated that the conversation lasted \u201c[m]aybe three to five minutes.\u201d In describing Mulligan\u2019s demeanor during this period, he said, \u201cShe was visibly upset. She was still crying. Very shaky.\u201d Fowler indicated that he asked Mulligan \u201c[mjaybe one or two\u201d questions and \u201ckind of let her do the talking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On cross-examination, Fowler agreed that his \u201cpurpose in speaking with Ms. Mulligan or knocking on the door and speaking with the occupants was to conduct an investigation\u201d and that he was \u201cthere to gather information.\u201d He indicated that Mulligan filled out a \u201cdomestic violence form\u201d while at the apartment and that he \u201cwent over it\u201d with her. Mulligan was also photographed approximately 15 to 20 minutes after Fowler\u2019s initial conversation at the apartment. On redirect, Fowler stated that his initial questions to Mulligan were \u201cwhy we were there, what happened\u201d and \u201cwhere she got the marks from[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Fowler indicated that Officer Robey arrived on the scene after Mulligan told him about the marks. Fowler relayed to Robey what Mulligan had told him. He then went outside to join Lucas and Officer Dalton while Robey spoke with Mulligan for approximately five minutes. When Robey came out of the apartment and said something to Lucas, Lucas \u201c[s]pun around and ran[,]\u201d and the two officers pursued Lucas on foot. Lucas ran \u201cright around the building, basically right to where the chase started[.]\u201d Robey cornered him and Lucas surrendered, saying, \u201c \u2018you got me. I\u2019m cold and I\u2019m tired.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Defense counsel moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude Mulligan\u2019s out-of-court statements to the police officers. The court denied the motion and immediately proceeded to the trial on the merits. With the consent of counsel for both parties, the court agreed to accept Fowler\u2019s testimony given during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>motion <em>in limine </em>hearing as if it were given during the merits trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Mulligan was not present in court on the day of trial. Fowler testified that he did not know where she was and that the State never asked him to go find her.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Lucas testified in his own defense. Lucas testified that Mulligan was his girlfriend and that they had an argument when she accused him of cheating on her. According to Lucas, Mulligan told him to leave. When he went to get his things, Mulligan ran at him and knocked him down. Lucas then got back up and pushed Mulligan off of him. He denied that he grabbed Mulligan around the neck, but indicated that \u201cwhen [he] pushed her it was the upper part of her chest.\u201d Lucas then \u201cgot [his] stuff and went out in the hallway and [sat] on the steps.\u201d Lucas said that he could not leave because his car keys were in the apartment and that he sat outside \u201ca good 15 to 20 minutes\u201d before the police arrived. He testified that he ran from the police \u201c[bjecause [he] didn\u2019t believe [he] was getting locked up on some, \u2014 bull crap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in reversing Lucas\u2019s conviction and ordering a new trial because the admission of Mulligan\u2019s statements into evidence did not violate his rights under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The Confrontation Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause barred the \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d In holding that the provision barred the admission of \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements, the Supreme Court \u201cfundamentally altered its Confrontation Clause jurisprudence^]\u201d <em>State v. Snowden, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>385 Md. 64, 78, 867 A.2d 314, 322 (2005). It did so upon recognizing that \u201cthe principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50, 124 S.Ct. at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Before <em>Crawford, </em>an out-of-court statement\u2019s admissibility turned on whether the unavailable witness\u2019 statement has \u201cadequate indicia of <em>reliability\u2014ie., </em>falls within a \u2018firmly rooted hearsay exception\u2019 or bears \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 42, 124 S.Ct. at 1359 (citing <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980)). The <em>Crawford </em>Court rejected the <em>Roberts </em>test because it departed from the historical principles underlying the Confrontation Clause in two respects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">First, it is too broad: It applies the same mode of analysis whether or not the hearsay consists of <em>ex parte </em>testimony. This often results in close constitutional scrutiny in cases that are far removed from the core concerns of the Clause. At the same time, however, the test is too narrow: It admits statements that <em>do </em>consist of <em>ex parte </em>testimony upon a mere finding of reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 60,124 S.Ct. at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">In <em>Snowden, </em>we reviewed the <em>Crawford </em>Court\u2019s abrogation of <em>Roberts:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">The Supreme Court found fault with the perceived unpredictability and subjectivity of the \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d test in <em>Roberts. </em>In overruling <em>Roberts, </em>the Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">Admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation. To be sure, the Clause\u2019s ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAU\">385 Md. at 79, 867 A.2d at 322 (quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61,124 S.Ct. at 1370).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The <em>Crawford </em>Court declined to \u201cspell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial[,]\u2019 \u201d leaving that effort \u201cfor another day[.]\u201d 541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. It indicated, however, that the term \u201capplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held, moreover, that the statements at issue in <em>Crawford, </em>recorded and \u201cknowingly given in response to structured police questioning,\u201d qualified as testimonial \u201cunder any conceivable definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53 n. 4, 124 S.Ct. at 1365 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The <em>Crawford </em>Court provided characteristics of a testimonial statement and we reviewed these characteristics in <em>Snow-den:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The <em>[Crawford] </em>Court began by addressing what is \u201ctestimony\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u201cTestimony,\u201d in turn, is typically \u201c[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u201d An accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Rather than articulate a singular standard, the Court offered three proposed formulations to exhibit the \u201ccore class\u201d of what is \u201ctestimonial\u201d for Confrontation Clause purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4U\">\u201c[1] ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent-that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,\u201d [2] \u201cextrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions,\u201d; [3] \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">385 Md. at 80-81, 867 A.2d at 323-24 (quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (citations omitted)). We observed the common nucleus shared by each of the above formulations and the uniting theme underlying the <em>Crawford </em>holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">As the Court noted, these standards share a common nucleus in that each involves a formal or official statement made or elicited with the purpose of being introduced at a criminal trial.... Although these standards focus on the objective quality of the statement made, the uniting theme underlying the <em>Crawford </em>holding is that when a statement is made in the course of a criminal investigation initiated by the government, the Confrontation Clause forbids its introduction unless the defendant has had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 81, 867 A.2d at 324 (citing <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 56 n. 7,124 S.Ct. at 1364,1367 n. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The Supreme Court elaborated on its definition of testimonial in the context of statements made during police interrogations in <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). The Court consolidated two cases, <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>an appeal from the Supreme Court of Washington, and <em>Hammon v. Indiana, </em>an appeal from the Indiana Supreme Court, to \u201cdetermine when statements made to law enforcement personnel during a 911 call or at a crime scene are \u2018testimonial[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817, 819, 821, 126 S.Ct. at 2270, 2271-72, 2273. The Court observed that in <em>Crawford, </em>it set forth \u201c \u2018[v]arious formulations\u2019 of the core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements\u201d and that among these \u201cwere\u2019 [statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273 (citing <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 53,124 S.Ct. at 1354)(internal quotation marks omitted). Acknowledging that it did not define the term \u201c \u2018interrogation!,]\u2019 \u201d the Court recognized that it had to \u201cdetermine more precisely which police interrogations produce testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>formulated the following rubric for classifying statements in response to police interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822,126 S.Ct. at 2273-74 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The Supreme Court applied this rubric to the two consolidated cases on appeal. It began by analyzing the interrogation at issue in the Washington case and concluded that it did not produce testimonial statements. In <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>the defendant, Adrian Davis, was convicted of violating a domestic no-eontact order. The complainant, Michelle McCottry, called a 911 emergency operator, and the operator answered, but the connection terminated before McCottry spoke. The 911 operator reversed the call and McCottry answered. The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">\u201c911 Operator: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">\u201cComplainant: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">\u201c911 Operator: What\u2019s going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">\u201cComplainant: He\u2019s here jumpin\u2019 on me again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">\u201c911 Operator: Okay. Listen to me carefully. Are you in a house or an apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">\u201cComplainant: I\u2019m in a house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\">\u201c911 Operator: Are there any weapons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-15\">\u201cComplainant: No. He\u2019s usin\u2019 his fists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-16\">\u201c911 Operator: Okay.

He\u2019s runnin\u2019 now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 817-18,126 S.Ct. at 2271 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The police arrived within four minutes of the call. McCottry was in a \u201cshaken state,\u201d had \u201c \u2018fresh injuries on her forearm and her face,\u2019 \u201d and was engaging in \u201c \u2018frantic efforts to gather her belongings and her children so that they could leave the residence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, 126 S.Ct. at 2271 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The Court concluded that \u201cthe circumstances of McCottry\u2019s interrogation objectively indicat[ed] its primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 828, 126 S.Ct. at 2277. The Court observed, first, that \u201cthe initial interrogation conducted in connection with a 911 call, is ordinarily not designed primarily to \u2018establish] or prov[e]\u2019 some past fact, but to describe current circumstances requiring police assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827, 126 S.Ct. at 2276. The Court then distinguished McCottry\u2019s interrogation responses from the testimonial statements in <em>Crawford,:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">The difference between the interrogation in <em>Davis </em>and the one in <em>Crawford </em>is apparent on the face of things. In <em>Davis, </em>McCottry was speaking about events <em>as they were actually happening, </em>rather than \u201cdescribing] past events[.]\u201d Sylvia Crawford\u2019s interrogation, on the other hand, took place hours after the events she described had occurred. Moreover, any reasonable listener would recognize that McCottry (unlike Sylvia Crawford) was facing an ongoing emergency. Although one <em>might </em>call 911 to provide a narrative report of a crime absent any imminent danger, McCottry\u2019s call was plainly a call for help against bona fide physical threat. Third, the nature of what was asked and answered in <em>Davis, </em>again viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in <em>Crawford) </em>what had happened in the past. That is true even of the operator\u2019s effort to establish the identity of the assailant, so that the dispatched officers might know whether they would be encountering a violent felon. And finally, the difference in the level of formality between the two interviews is striking. Crawford was responding calmly, at the station house, to a series of questions, with the officer-interrogator taping and making notes of her answers; McCottry\u2019s frantic answers were provided over the phone, in an environment that was not tranquil, or even (as far as any reasonable 911 operator could make out) safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Id., </em>126 S.Ct. at 2276-77 (citations omitted, emphasis in original). McCottry\u2019s statements did not violate Davis\u2019s right of confrontation because \u201c[s]he simply was not acting as a <em>witness; </em>she was not <em>testifying. </em>What she said was not \u2018a weaker substitute for live testimony\u2019 at trial[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828, 126 S.Ct. at 2277 (citation omitted, emphasis in original).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Court then analyzed the statements at issue in the second case, <em>Hammon v. Indiana, </em>and held that they were testimonial. Unlike the Washington case, the task of \u201c[d]etermining the testimonial or nontestimonial character of the statements\u201d in <em>Hammon </em>was much easier because \u201cthey were not much different from the statements [the Court] found to be testimonial in <em>Crawford. </em>\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 829, 126 S.Ct. at 2278. In <em>Hammon, </em>police officers responded late one evening \u201cto a \u2018reported domestic disturbance\u2019 at the home of Herschel and Amy Hammon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819, 126 S.Ct. at 2272 (citation omitted). The Court recounted the facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVY\">[The officers] found Amy alone on the front porch, appearing \u201c \u2018somewhat frightened,\u2019 \u201d but she told them that \u201c \u2018nothing was the matter[.]\u2019 \u201d She gave them permission to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the house, where an officer saw \u201ca gas heating unit in the corner of the living room\u201d that had \u201cflames coming out of the ... partial glass front. There were pieces of glass on the ground in front of it and there was flame emitting from the front of the heating unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">Hershel, meanwhile, was in the kitchen. He told the police \u201cthat he and his wife had \u2018been in an argument\u2019 but \u2018everything was fine now\u2019 and the argument \u2018never became physical.\u2019 \u201d By this point Amy had come back inside. One of the officers remained with Hershel; the other went to the living room to talk with Amy, and \u201cagain asked [her] what had occurred.\u201d Hershel made several attempts to participate in Amy\u2019s conversation with the police, but was rebuffed. The officer later testified that Hershel \u201cbecame angry when I insisted that [he] stay separated from Mrs. Hammon so that we can investigate what had happened.\u201d After hearing Amy\u2019s account, the officer \u201chad her fill out and sign a battery affidavit.\u201d Amy handwrote the following: \u201cBroke our Furnace &amp; shoved me down on the floor into the broken glass. Hit me in the chest and threw me down. Broke our lamps <em>&amp; </em>phone. Tore up my van where I couldn\u2019t leave the house. Attacked my daughter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 819-20, 126 S.Ct. at 2272 (citations omitted). Hershel was charged with domestic battery and violation of his probation. When Amy was subpeonaed to testify at Hershel\u2019s bench trial and failed to appear, the trial court permitted the interviewing officer to testify about Amy\u2019s statements, ruling that the statements were admissible as \u201c \u2018excited utterances\u2019 that \u2018are expressly permitted in these kinds of cases even if the declarant is not available to testify.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 820, 126 S.Ct. at 2272 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The Supreme Court held that Amy Hammon\u2019s statements were testimonial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">It is entirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct\u2014as, indeed, the testifying officer expressly acknowledged. There was no emergency in progress; the interrogating officer testified that he had heard no argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ments or crashing and saw no one throw or break anything. When the officers first arrived, Amy told them that things were fine and there was no immediate threat to her person. When the officer questioned Amy for the second time, and elicited the challenged statements, he was not seeking to determine (as in <em>Davis) </em>\u201cwhat is happening,\u201d but rather \u201cwhat happened.\u201d Objectively viewed, the primary, if not indeed the sole, purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime\u2014which is, of course, precisely what the officer <em>should </em>have done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 829-30,126 S.Ct. at 2278 (citations omitted, emphasis in original). The Court acknowledged that the interrogation in Crawford was more formal: \u201c[i]t followed a Miranda warning, was tape-recorded, and took place at the station house[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 830, 126 S.Ct. at 2278. But Amy\u2019s interrogation was \u201cformal enough\u201d to elicit testimonial statements, because it was conducted in a separate room, away from her husband (who tried to intervene), with the officer receiving her replies for use in his \u201c \u2018investigation].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The Court regarded Amy\u2019s statement as resembling the testimonial statement in <em>Cranford </em>and inherently testimonial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP0\">Both declarants were actively separated from the defendant\u2014officers forcibly prevented Hershel from participating in the interrogation. Both statements deliberately recounted, in response to police questioning, how potentially criminal past events began and progressed. And both took place some time after the events described were over. Such statements under official interrogation are an obvious substitute for live testimony, because they do precisely <em>what a witness does </em>on direct examination; they are inherently testimonial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\"><em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. at 2278 (citation and footnote omitted, emphasis in original). Distinguishing the statements in <em>Hammon </em>from the ones at issue in <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">The statements in <em>Davis </em>were taken when McCottry was alone, not only unprotected by police (as Amy Hammon was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>protected), but apparently in immediate danger from Davis. She was seeking aid, not telling a story about the past. McCottry\u2019s present-tense statements showed immediacy; Amy\u2019s narrative of past events was delivered at some remove in time from the danger she described. And after Amy answered the officer\u2019s questions, he had her execute an affidavit, in order, he testified, \u201c[t]o establish events that have occurred previously.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 831-32, 126 S.Ct. at 2279 (citation omitted).

It did not, however, \u201chold the opposite\u2014that no questions at the scene will yield nontestimonial answers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">We have already observed of domestic disputes that \u201cOfficers called to investigate ... need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim.\u201d Such exigencies may <em>often </em>mean that \u201cinitial inquiries\u201d produce nontestimonial statements. But in cases like this one, where Amy\u2019s statements were neither a cry for help nor the provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation, the fact that they were given at an alleged crime scene and were \u201cinitial inquiries\u201d is immaterial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted, emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The State contends here that Mulligan\u2019s statements made in response to Officer Fowler\u2019s questions at the entrance to her apartment were nontestimonial because the questions\u2019 primary purpose was to enable the police to meet an ongoing emergency and not to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution. The State asserts that this case \u201cis much closer to <em>Davis </em>than it is to <em>Hammon\u201d </em>It argues that the police had not yet taken control of the situation when they first encountered Mulligan at the threshold of her apartment. The State maintains that \u201cthe police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>knew very little when they responded to [the] \u2018domestic\u2019 call at 11:00 p.m., including whether or not the suspect was still inside the apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The State points to Mulligan\u2019s physical appearance at the scene, the timing of the officers\u2019 arrival, and the nature of Fowler\u2019s questioning to distinguish this case from <em>Hammon. </em>Fowler indicated that Mulligan was \u201ccrying[,]\u201d \u201cvisibly up-sett,]\u201d and \u201c[v]ery shaky.\u201d Her face was \u201cpretty red\u201d and she had eyes that were \u201ckind of swollen\u201d and \u201cred marks on her neck.\u201d In contrast, the <em>Hammon </em>victim appeared \u201csomewhat frightened\u201d and told the responding officers that \u201cnothing was the matter[.]\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 819, 126 S.Ct. at 2272 (internal quotation marks omitted). Fowler also stated that they arrived \u201ca couple of minutes\u201d after receiving the domestic call and asked Mulligan \u201cabout why [they] were called to the residence and why she was crying.\u201d In <em>Hammon, </em>however, the victim\u2019s statement \u201cwas delivered at some remove in time from the danger ... described.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 832, 126 S.Ct. at 2279.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The State highlights Fowler\u2019s testimony that he asked \u201c[m]aybe one or two\u201d questions and \u201ckind of let [Mulligan] do the talking\u201d to argue that Fowler\u2019s questions were \u201c[u]nlike the structured questioning in both <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Hammonf] </em>\u201d It asserts that the questioning here is unlike the \u201cformal enough\u201d interrogation in <em>Hammon, </em>because there is no indication that the officers deliberately separated Mulligan and Lucas to obtain incriminating statements. <em>See id. </em>at 830, 126 S.Ct. at 2278. The State asserts, moreover, that Fowler\u2019s questioning is distinct from the <em>Hammon </em>interrogation, because Fowler was not taking notes or filling out a police report during his conversation with Mulligan.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The State acknowledges that Officer Fowler\u2019s questions, \u201cwhat happened\u201d and \u201cwhere she got the marks[,]\u201d were phrased in the past tense. It argues, though, that \u201cthe test to determine whether a response is testimonial cannot be based solely on the grammatical phrasing of the question.\u201d <em>See State v. Ohlson, </em>162 Wash.2d 1, 168 P.3d 1273, 1279 (2007)(re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>jecting a \u201csimple grammatical analysis\u201d of \u201cwhether a statement is \u2018in the past or present tense\u2019 \u201d for determining a statement\u2019s testimonial or nontestimonial nature and concluding that <em>\u201cDavis </em>supports a more nuanced approach\u201d in evaluating \u201cinitial inquires at a crime scene\u201d). <em>See also Long v.

The <em>Davis </em>Court considered a number of factors in analyzing the primary purpose of the interrogations at issue, including (1) the timing of the statements, <em>i.e. </em>whether the declarant was speaking about actually happening or past events; (2) whether the \u201creasonable listener would recognize that [the declarant] ... was facing an ongoing emergency\u201d; (3) the nature of what was asked and answered, <em>i.e. </em>whether the statements were necessary to resolve the present emergency or simply to learn what had happened in the past; and (4) the interview\u2019s level of formality. <em>See id. </em>at 827, 126 S.Ct. at 2276-77. In assessing formality, relevant measures included the interview\u2019s location; whether the declarant was actively separated from the defendant; whether \u201cthe officer receiv[ed] [the declarant\u2019s] replies for use in his \u2018investigat[ion]\u2019 \u201d; and whether the statements \u201cdeliberately recounted, in response to police questioning, how potentially criminal past events .began and progressed.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 830,126 S.Ct. at 2278 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Having considered these factors, we conclude that the circumstances of Fowler\u2019s interrogation objectively indicate a primary purpose to \u201cestablish or prove past events potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>relevant to later criminal prosecution\u201d and not to \u201cenable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273-74. The emergency had ended when Fowler encountered Mulligan at the door of her apartment. When Fowler questioned Mulligan about \u201cwhat happened\u201d and \u201cwhere she got the marks[,]\u201d Mulligan spoke of past events: she and Lucas were in an argument that \u201cbecame physical,]\u201d that she was \u201ckicked in the leg\u201d by Lucas, and that \u201che grabbed her around the neck.\u201d A reasonable listener would recognize that Mulligan\u2019s emergency had ceased. The officers, upon arrival, observed Lucas sitting on some steps outside of the apartment and Dalton stayed with him while Fowler spoke with Mulligan. As in <em>Hammon </em>and unlike <em>Davis, </em>Mulligan was protected by the police and no longer under any apparent imminent danger when she spoke with Fowler.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Fowler observed that Mulligan was crying and visibly upset and had a red face, eyes that were \u201ckind of swollen[,]\u201d and \u201cred marks on her neck.\u201d He did not indicate, however, that he heard arguments or crashing or saw anyone throw or break anything inside the apartment. Thus, Fowler did not observe or detect anything suggesting that there was another potential assailant inside the apartment. Having already encountered Lucas outside of Mulligan\u2019s apartment, Fowler\u2019s initial inquires were not necessary to \u201cknow whom they [were] dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to\u201d Mulligan. <em>See Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 832,126 S.Ct. at 2279.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The circumstances here are distinct from those in which officers encountered victims with apparent severe injuries requiring immediate medical attention and/or where an assailant had not yet been located. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. State, </em>163 P.3d 1000, 1004 (Alaska Ct.App.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1486, 170 L.Ed.2d 306 (2008)(concluding that the primary focus of an officer\u2019s question\u2014\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u2014was to \u201csort out an ongoing emergency situation\u201d after officers encountered the victim lying in a fetal position, shirtless, with bruises on his torso, and when the victim told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the officers that he was hurt and having a hard time breathing; the officer sought the assistance of paramedics after encountering the victim); <em>Lewis v.

The officers proceeded to photograph Mulligan, complete a domestic violence form, and review the form with Mulligan at her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Fowler\u2019s questioning of Mulligan, admittedly, was less formal than the tape-recorded police station interrogation in <em>Crawford. </em>But like the testimonial statement-producing interrogation in <em>Hammon, </em>Fowler\u2019s interrogation was \u201cformal enough\u201d to elicit testimonial statements: Fowler questioned Mulligan while Dalton remained with Lucas; Fowler told Mulligan that they were \u201cthere for an investigation\u201d; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Mulligan recounted, in response to Fowler\u2019s questions, how Lucas kicked her and grabbed her around the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">When Officer Fowler asked Mulligan \u201cwhat happened\u201d and \u201cwhere she got the marks\u201d at the door of her apartment in response to a \u201cdomestic\u201d call, the interrogation\u2019s primary purpose was to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution and not to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. Mulligan\u2019s statements that Lucas had kicked her and grabbed her around the neck were testimonial because she spoke of past events, was protected by the police from Lucas, and no longer under any imminent danger. In asking Mulligan \u201cwhat happened\u201d and \u201cwhere she got the marks[,]\u201d Fowler investigated a possible crime, which is precisely what he should have done. But Mulligan\u2019s statements were an impermissible substitute for live testimony, and their admission through Fowler\u2019s testimony violated Lucas\u2019s confrontation rights under <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversing the conviction and ordering a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The Supreme Court, however, was not asked to determine whether the additional statements above were testimonial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-18\">Davis's jury did not hear the <em>complete </em>911 call, although it may well have heard some testimonial portions. We were asked to classify only McCottry\u2019s early statements identifying Davis as her assailant, and we agree with the Washington Supreme Court that they were not testimonial.
