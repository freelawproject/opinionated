Tucker, invites us to explore the application of our decision in <em>Smith v. State, </em>388 Md. 468, 880 A.2d 288 (2005), to a sentence included in a cross-racial identification jury instruction. In doing so, we do not address whether such an instruction was appropriate in the case at bar, but whether, once given, the instruction was a correct statement of the law. We granted certiorari, <em>Tucker v. State, </em>405 Md. 290, 950 A.2d 828 (2008), with respect to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">Did the trial court err in granting the State\u2019s jury instruction regarding cross-racial identification over Mr. Tucker\u2019s objection, when the State\u2019s instruction misquoted applicable law and directed the jurors to believe that cross-racial identification was not a factor in eyewitness testimony?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We shall hold that the trial judge erred because the instruction, as formulated, was not a correct statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The State\u2019s evidence tended to show the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">On the morning of September 30, 2005, Hilary Auth was in her bathroom when she heard a loud banging noise. She peered out the window, and saw a man in a hooded, \u201clight blue sweatshirt, blue/gray sweatshirt ... [with] a design on it,\u201d dark jeans and heavy boots, attempting to break into her home; she identified the man as black when he looked up for a brief second and she saw part of his eye and face. After attempting to call 911 but getting no dial tone, Auth concealed herself in her bedroom, and peeking through the bedroom door, noticed a different African-American man in a red-hooded sweatshirt, heavy boots, and jeans, with slightly less than shoulder-length braided hair, of slight build, relatively thin and without \u201cbroad shoulder[s],\u201d coming up the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Auth then moved from her bedroom to her livingroom, and once there, called 911 from a cordless phone. While waiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>for the 911 operator, Auth looked <em>from </em>the livingroom to the top of the stairs and saw the red-hooded individual looking back at her, as well as the same blue/gray-hooded individual that she had seen from her bathroom window, standing behind. Auth stated that the red-hooded individual declared \u201cI\u2019m out,\u201d had a dispute with the blue/gray-hooded burglar, and ran out the front door. Auth gave no facial description of the blue/gray-hooded burglar; although she later identified the burglar as Tucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Police officers arrived soon thereafter and found neither burglar in the house. Auth met with Detective Tracy Williams, provided a description of the burglars, and reported that her cell phone, keys and purse had been stolen, as well as credit cards, including a Target Visa card, which was immediately cancelled. Detective Williams had an opportunity to speak with a credit card representative from Target stores, who told him that Auth\u2019s card had been used less than an hour after the burglary at a Target in Bowie, Maryland, and that the card was used again at a Target in Forestville, Maryland; both attempts to use the card were fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Detective Williams obtained a videotape of the Bowie Target and a description from a Target loss prevention officer of a 2005 Chevrolet Impala. On the videotape, a man and three women were shown shopping and then attempting to buy electronics, using the Target Visa. The man specifically was shown pushing a shopping cart, choosing items to purchase, and proceeding to checkout with the three women who accompanied him, one of whom later turned out to be Jasmine Joyner, who actually had the card in her hand. After the card was denied because Joyner\u2019s identification did not match the name on the Target card, the four left in the 2005 Chevrolet Impala.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">On October 4, four days after the burglary, Auth viewed the Target videotape and almost immediately identified two of the individuals in the Target stores as those that she had seen in her home. Ten days later, Detective Williams submitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>two pictures identified by Auth to a local newspaper, in an attempt to solicit pertinent information.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Within five days of the bulletin, on October 19, Tucker reported to the Anne Arundel County Police Department that his 2005 Chevrolet Impala had been stolen sometime between October 14 and October 19. Shortly thereafter, Detective Williams discovered Tucker\u2019s stolen auto report, which precipitated his securing a picture of Tucker, who the Detective then identified as the man on the Target videotape. Investigating further, Detective Williams spoke to Investigator William Kissler, who informed him that a car resembling the Chevrolet Impala had been found, but that because it had been completely burned, it was not possible to identify the car or its owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Detective Williams brought Tucker in for questioning on October 27, and after having been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Tucker spoke to police. He was shown four still photos taken from the Target videotape and was able to identify the three women, as Cheryl, Monique and Jasmine, but declared that the man in the fourth photo was his \u201ctwin brother, Mongo.\u201d After being shown a picture of his older brother Mongo, Tucker admitted it was he in the picture. Tucker further asserted that Jasmine, Monique and Cheryl had come to his home during the morning of September 30, sometime after 10:30 a.m., and asked him to drive them to Target in his Chevrolet Impala. Tucker stated that he initially had believed that they were just going shopping, until Joyner was denied the use of the Target card because her identification did not match the name on the card. Tucker also admitted that the group attempted to make other electronics purchases at the Forestville Target, but again, the card proffered by Joyner was denied; although at a 7-Eleven store, they successfully used the card to purchase gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In a signed statement, Tucker denied being involved in the burglary and declared that Jasmine, a black female about 21 years old with shoulder length braided hair, was involved in a burglary before she came to his house with Cheryl that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>morning. When asked whether Jasmine had had any cuts on her hand that day, Tucker remembered that she had put a bandage on a cut on one of her fingers and that it had continued to bleed. Taylor also, when responding to a question about who had stolen his car, opined, \u201cI think it was Jasmine. My mother told me that there was an article in the Capitol Newspaper that showed my picture and hers. The article was accusing us of committing the burglary. I called Jasmine and told her about it. I think she stole my car and set it on fire to destroy any evidence. I don\u2019t have any proof, but I think Jasmine thought that she was seen in my car leaving Target that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Tucker was arrested and charged with first, third and fourth degree burglary, theft, and stealing another\u2019s credit card; although he subsequently was indicted only for first degree burglary,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> breaking and entering Auth\u2019s home, and for theft over $500,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> more specifically, of a diamond band, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>camera, a nominal amount of currency, car keys and other personal property of the Auth\u2019s. At trial, Auth\u2019s eyewitness identification of Tucker was an important piece of evidence; she testified that she was \u201ca hundred percent certain\u201d that Tucker was the burglar in the blue/gray-hooded sweatshirt outside, and then, inside her home, as well as the man on the Target videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On cross-examination, Tucker questioned Auth about inconsistences in her testimony from earlier statements, including the hue of the sweatshirt and whether she had told Detective Williams earlier that she was unable to make a positive identification because the suspect had had his hood up the entire time; Auth responded that she had no recollection of that statement. Tucker ended his cross-examination by questioning Auth\u2019s confidence in her ability to identify members of another race, and specifically, how many African-Americans lived in her neighborhood.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Stipulations were entered into evidence reflecting that forensic experts had excluded Tucker, both as the source of the fingerprints and as the source of blood DNA found inside and outside the Auth\u2019s home, and Detective Williams testified, in addition to the information regarding his investigation and Tucker\u2019s statement, that Auth almost immediately had recognized Tucker and Joyner as the burglars when she witnessed the Target videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">On cross-examination of Detective Williams, inconsistences from Auth\u2019s testimony to her prior handwritten statement and Detective Williams police report were explored, such as lack of identification of any sweatshirt insignia in the two contemporaneous statements and a failure to provide any facial description. Tucker also attempted to impeach Auth\u2019s testimony that she was \u201ca hundred percent certain\u201d that Tucker was the burglar, by having Detective Williams read page 5 of his police report, where he had written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Mrs. Auth stated that the male wearing the gray hooded sweatshirt appeared to be the other suspect that she first [had] seen trying to break into her basement door. Mrs Auth stated that because the suspect had his hood up the entire time during the incident, she could not make a positive identification of him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">At the end of evidence, Tucker elected not to testify, so the judge entertained discussion about jury instructions, and in particular, arguments regarding a cross-racial identification instruction. Tucker proffered that because a cross-racial identification was central to the state\u2019s case, a cross-racial identification instruction, using the following language from <em>United States v. Telfaire, </em>469 F.2d 552, 561 (D.C.Cir.1972) (Bazelon, C.J., concurring), was appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">In this case the identifying witness is of a different race than the defendant. In the experience of many it is more difficult to identify members of a different race than mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>bers of one\u2019s own. If this is also your own experience, you may consider it in evaluating the witness\u2019s testimony. You must also consider, of course, whether there are other factors present in this case which overcome any such difficulty of identification. For example, you may conclude that the witness has had sufficient contacts with members of the defendant\u2019s race that he would not have greater difficulty in making a reliable identification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The State countered that cross-racial identification was not appropriately raised, so a cross-racial instruction should not be given. The trial judge determined that the issue presented a \u201cclose call,\u201d but explained that he wanted to give the instruction, based upon the discussion presented in <em>Janey v. State, </em>166 Md.App. 645, 665-66, 891 A.2d 355, 367 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 Md. 725, 898 A.2d 1005 (2006), in which the Court of Special Appeals had opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">Conversely, the mere fact that a witness denies any difficulty in making cross-racial identifications should not deter the trial judge from considering giving such an instruction, particularly if, in the language of the <em>[State v.] Cromedy[, </em>158 N.J. 112, 727 A.2d 457 (1999)] court, \u201cidentification is a critical issue in the case, and [the] eyewitness\u2019s cross-racial identification is not corroborated by other evidence giving it independent reliability.\u201d 727 A.2d at 467. Even in the face of a witness\u2019s strenuous denial of personal difficulty in making cross-racial identifications, because the studies cited by the Court of Appeals in <em>Smith and Mack, </em>388 Md. at 478-86, 880 A.2d 288, indicate that there is a \u201cstrong consensus among researchers ... that some witnesses are more likely to misidentify members of other races than their own,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 482, 880 A.2d 288, the trial judge must, upon request, consider whether an instruction is appropriate in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">Accordingly, our holding in this case\u2014that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to give the requested instruction on cross-racial identification\u2014should not be interpreted as holding that it is never appropriate to give such an instruction. Nor should the fact that no instruction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>cross-racial identification appears yet in the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions serve as the basis for an arbitrary refusal to consider granting such an instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The State asked the judge to add one sentence to the instruction, allegedly \u201cpulled straight from the <em>Smith </em>and <em>Mack </em>case, at page 484, 880 A.2d 288,\u201d a case preceding <em>Janey, </em>in which cross-racial identification was in issue. The entire sentence referenced actually read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">Proponents of the studies argue that there is \u201cno particular reason to think that the other-race effect ... does not apply [to] eyewitnesses in actual criminal cases,\u201d whereas others contend that studies on cross-racial identification \u201cbear little resemblance to real-life crimes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Smith&gt; 388 Md. at 484, 880 A.2d at 297 (citations omitted) (alterations in original). The State\u2019s requested sentence, nevertheless, postulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">There is no particular reason to think that cross-racial identification applies to eyewitnesses in actual criminal cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The trial judge included the State\u2019s sentence, and the entire cross-racial instruction, as it was given to the jury, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASt\">In this case the identifying witness is of a different race than the Defendant. In the experience of many, it is more difficult to identify members of a different race than members of their own race. If this is also your experience, you may consider that fact in evaluating the witness\u2019s testimony. You must also consider whether there are other factors present in the case which overcome any such difficulty in identification. For example, you may conclude that the witness had sufficient contacts with members of Defendant\u2019s race that he would not have any greater difficulty in making a reliable identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">There is no particular reason to think that cross-racial identification applies to eyewitnesses in actual criminal cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Tucker was convicted of both first degree burglary and theft over 500 dollars. The theft count was merged with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>burglary count for sentencing, and Tucker received 15 years, all but 10 years suspended. A three-judge panel of the circuit court upheld the sentence, and Tucker noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In the Court of Special Appeals, Tucker argued that the trial judge erred by giving the specific instruction on cross-racial identification, by admitting eyewitness identification evidence obtained by impermissibly suggestive means, by admitting evidence regarding Tucker\u2019s car, by denying his motion for a mistrial, and also by determining that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction, in addition to plain error arising from the State\u2019s closing argument. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the conviction, specifically holding that the cross-racial instruction did not misstate applicable Maryland law, because the sentence \u201cremain[ed] true to the <em>Smith </em>Court\u2019s conclusions regarding the ultimate efficacy of cross-racial identification.\u201d Tucker petitioned for certiorari, asking us to address the formulation of the jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AHo\">A. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The sole issue that is presented in this case is whether the instruction, as given, was a correct statement of law, although the parties at various junctures have suggested that the whole issue of cross-racial identification, including whether the facts of the trial generated the need for a cross-racial identification jury instruction, is before us. We only address whether the jury instruction was a correct statement of the law; Tucker asserts that it was not, while the State asserts that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Jury instructions are governed by Maryland Rule 4-325, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">(a) When Given. The court shall give instructions to the jury at the conclusion of all the evidence and before closing arguments and may supplement them at a later time when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>appropriate. In its discretion the court may also give opening and interim instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">(b) Written Requests. The parties may file written requests for instructions at or before the close of the evidence and shall do so at any time fixed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">(c) How Given. The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">(d) Reference to Evidence. In instructing the jury, the court may refer to or summarize the evidence in order to present clearly the issues to be decided. In that event, the court shall instruct the jury that it is the sole judge of the facts, the weight of the evidence, and the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">(e) Objection. No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">(f) Argument. Nothing in this Rule precludes any party from arguing that the law applicable to the case is different from the law described in the instructions of the court stated not to be binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">We have interpreted Rule 4-325(c) as requiring the trial court to give a requested instruction when: (1) the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law; (2) the requested instruction is applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the requested instruction was not fairly covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>elsewhere in the jury instruction actually given. <em>Dickey v. State, </em>404 Md. 187, 197-98, 946 A.2d 444, 450 (2008); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>393 Md. 291, 302-03, 901 A.2d 208, 214 (2006); <em>Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 683-84, 741 A.2d 1119, 1122 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Here, we are called upon specifically to address one phrase of an instruction, that being, \u201cThere is no particular reason to think that cross-racial identification applies to eyewitnesses in actual criminal cases,\u201d alleged by the State to be a correct statement of the law based upon our opinion in <em>Smith, </em>388 Md. at 484, 880 A.2d at 297. In <em>Smith, </em>we were called upon to address whether the trial judge erred in preventing Smith from making closing remarks in a case in which he and Mack, both African-Americans, were being tried for armed robbery and assault of a white victim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After reviewing commentaries, cases from other jurisdictions, and this State\u2019s history of permitting defendants to \u201c \u2018discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 488, 880 A.2d at 299, quoting <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 230, 596 A.2d 1024, 1037 (1991), we determined that the trial judge erred when she prevented defense counsel from arguing the implications of cross-racial identification, where the victim had testified that she had a heightened ability to identify faces:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">Defense counsel clearly was entitled to challenge [the victim\u2019s] \u201ceducated\u201d identification of the defendants by arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>to the jury that her identification should not be accorded the weight that she credited to her own ability to identify them. At this juncture the extent to which own-race bias affects eyewitness identification is unclear based on the available studies addressing this issue, so that we cannot state with certainty that difficulty in cross-racial identification is an established matter of common knowledge. Here, however, the victim\u2019s identification of the defendants was anchored in her enhanced ability to identify faces. Under these circumstances, defense counsel should have been allowed to argue the difficulties of cross-racial identification in closing argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defense counsel to comment on cross-racial identification in closing argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 880 A.2d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In <em>Smith, </em>when explaining the \u201ccross-race effect,\u201d we had occasion to discuss the dichotomy between laboratory or field studies and \u201creal-world\u201d situations, recognizing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">Another point of contention among researchers and scholars regarding the legitimacy of the cross-race effect is whether the results of both the laboratory and field studies are applicable to \u201creal-world\u201d situations where a victim or witness confronts an assailant and then later must attempt to identify that person. <em>See </em>Gary L. Wells &amp; Elizabeth A. Olson, <em>The Other-Race Effect in Eyewitness Identification: What Do We Do About It?, </em>7 Psychol. Pub. Pol\u2019y &amp; LawW 230, 230 (2001). <em>Proponents of the studies argue that there is \u201cno particular reason to think that the other-race effect ... does not apply [to] eyewitnesses in actual criminal cases,\u201d id., whereas others contend that studies on cross-racial identification \u201cbear little resemblance to real-life crimes.\u201d </em>Bartolomey, Cross-Racial Identification Testimony and What Not To Do About It, 7 Psychol. Pub. Pol\u2019y &amp; Law 247, 249(2001).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 484, 880 A.2d at 296-97 (underlining and italics added). It is the last sentence\u2014suggesting that there are two sides to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the issue of cross-race effect when real crimes, as opposed to laboratory situations, are involved\u2014with which we are concerned. When the State offered the sentence, \u201cThere is no particular reason to think that cross-racial identification applies to eyewitnesses in actual criminal cases,\u201d it was only providing one part, one hypothesis, from the dichotomy of theories that were explained. In so doing, the State mischaracterized what we were suggesting in Smith\u2014that there were commentators who both supported and denied the real-life effect of cross-racial identification\u2014by offering only that portion of the sentence that referred to commentators who denied the cross-race effect in real life situations. The proffer was an inaccurate statement of the law, and, as a result, we hold that it was error for the trial judge to have given the instruction requested by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">B. Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">We now turn to whether the trial judge\u2019s error was harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We recently addressed the application of the harmless error rule in <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 332-33, 941 A.2d 1107, 1121 (2008) (internal citations omitted), when Judge Glenn T. Harrell, writing for the Court, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">In <em>Dorsey v. State[, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)] ... we adopted the test for harmless error announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Chapman v. State </em>[of Cal., 386 U.S. 18, 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)].... As adopted in <em>Dorsey, </em>the harmless error rule is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\">When an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of-whether erroneously admitted or excluded-may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">In performing a harmless error analysis, we are not to find facts or weigh evidence. Instead, \u201cwhat evidence to believe, what weight to be given it, and what facts flow from that evidence are for the jury ... to determine.\u201d \u201c \u2018Once it has been determined that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict.

Based upon the <em>Dorsey </em>standard, we cannot say that the error regarding the cross-racial identification instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because the eyewitness identification by Auth was so central to the conviction and because all other evidence was concededly corroborative of her testimony\u2014testimony now tainted by the discounting of any potentially adverse effect of cross-racial bias in the erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Although we certainly are aware that the exclusive possession of recently stolen goods permits the drawing of an inference of fact strong enough to sustain a conviction that the possessor was the thief, or in the present case, the burglar, we also suggest that the inference can be negated by a satisfactory explanation. <em>Brewer v. Mele, </em>267 Md. 437, 449, 298 A.2d 156, 164 (1972) (\u201cWe have long and consistently held that exclusive possession of recently stolen goods, absent a satisfactory explanation, permits the drawing of an inference of fact strong enough to sustain a conviction____\u201d). In the present case, it may be significant that Joyner, not Tucker, physically possessed the Target credit card and that Tucker suggested in statements given to Detective Williams, and introduced into evidence, that he was a witless participant in the attempted purchase of goods. Whatever occurs during the retrial of this case, nevertheless, we are not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial judge\u2019s error in formulating the instruction was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had held that the invalid instruction was structural error and not subject to harmless error review. <em>Pulido v.

First, to appeal to parties (but primarily the State, I imagine, in most instances) in future criminal trials, where either expert testimony is proffered or a jury instruction is sought on the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>cross-racial identification difficulties, to seek a <em>Frye</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>-Reed</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or in limine hearing (and the judges in those cases to make a determination based on that hearing) regarding the validity and reliance <em>vel non </em>of the scientific underpinning of that subject. Second, in the present case, I would affirm the convictions rendered by the jury in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, based on application of harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">There appear to be three reported Maryland opinions in which a flagship issue was the propriety of jury instructions or closing argument involving reputed cross-racial eyewitness identification difficulties\u2014the present case, <em>Smith v. State, </em>388 Md. 468, 880 A.2d 288 (2005), and <em>Janey v. State, </em>166 Md.App. 645, 891 A.2d 355 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 Md. 725, 898 A.2d 1005 (Table) (2006). In none of these cases was a motion <em>in limine </em>filed or made, or a demand lodged seeking a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, regarding the scientific basis of the theory of cross-racial identification difficulties. Likewise, no judge in any of those cases, on his or her initiative, elected to hold such a hearing. Thus, it has gone largely unexamined and unresolved in Maryland whether the underlying social science, adequate to the purposes of a court of law, (that is, whether the theories and methodologies are generally accepted in the relevant scientific <em>community\u2014see Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co. v. Chesson, </em>399 Md. 314, 332-33, 923 A.2d 939, 949-50 (2007)), supports a relevant instruction or the propriety of such an argument. It is crystal clear that the reputed bases for such an argument or requested instruction is grounded on as yet untested (in Maryland courts) scientific research and conclusions. <em>See Smith, </em>388 Md. at 478-85, 880 A.2d at 294-98.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Because of the procedural posture in which <em>Smith, Janey, </em>and the present case reached our appellate courts (due to the absence of a <em>Frye-Reed </em>or in limine hearing to evaluate the science), conclusive resolution of the validity and reliability of the underlying science has been shielded from necessary judicial scrutiny.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Let us consider the threshold question before proceeding to the consequences, as have been the cases so far. I urge someone to move, in the appropriate circumstances, for a <em>Frye-Reed </em>or in limine hearing and for a trial judge to consider and rule on the scientific validity and reliability of the underlying science. If the science withstands <em>Frye-Reed </em>or in limine scrutiny (in the latter case, applying <em>Frye-Reed </em>principles), a pattern instruction could be devised and included in the standing litany so as to avoid future cases of the kind represented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Whether the instruction sought by Tucker in the present case was generated by the evidence is, for me, problematic. I suppose, for present purposes, that we must assume that it was apparent to the jury, the trial judge, and the parties that Tucker is African-American and Ms. Auth, the victim, is Caucasian-American (whatever the bundle of observable physical attributes those classifications portend). The only record evidence bearing on Ms. Auth\u2019s ability to identify and distinguish between African-Americans (or any other race of persons) came from a hugely unsuccessful fishing expedition by defense counsel during cross-examination of Ms. Auth when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>he tried to establish that she possessed limited substantive exposure to African-Americans in the rural community where she resided at the time of the crime. The defense\u2019s efforts yielded testimony that, to the contrary of what apparently he hoped to establish, Ms. Auth lived on a street where 10 of the 13 homes were occupied by African-American families. Thus, essentially, the sole evidentiary predicate \u201cgenerating\u201d the instruction sought here was that the victim and the defendant presumably had different skin colors. If that is all that it takes to generate an evidentiary basis for the giving of a cross-racial identification jury instruction, much of the mischief I foresaw in my dissent in <em>Smith, </em>388 Md. at 489-500, 880 A.2d at 300-06, will more likely come to pass.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I hope that will not be the case. I believe, on this record, Tucker received more than he was entitled to receive in giving any instruction regarding cross-racial identification difficulties, even with the sentence added by the judge at the behest of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Assuming, however, that Tucker was entitled by the evidence to a cross-racial identification difficulty instruction, that the instruction he sought was an accurate statement of the law (itself a big \u201cif\u2019), and that it was error to engraft onto his proposed instruction what the State asked for, I nonetheless conclude, on this record, such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Whatever the nature of the difficulties of a cross-racial identification, that was not central to Tucker\u2019s trial. The actual eyewitness identification difficulties here were attributed to the acute angles and time available for Ms. Auth\u2019s observations of him while he was breaking into and moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>about her home, and by the hooded shirt that he wore. All of these factors were covered by the general, pattern eyewitness jury instruction given. The cross-racial identification instruction was not important.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Defense counsel freely argued his view of the implication of the cross-racial identification instruction he requested, without reference to the errant sentence tacked on by the judge at the State\u2019s request. The State did not argue what the significance of its added sentence meant to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\"><em>As </em>the State points out in its brief, there was substantial evidence of Tucker\u2019s guilt quite apart from any racial implications. Ms. Auth had two opportunities to observe Tucker in or about her home as the crime unfolded. Her description of his physique and clothing aligned with his image on the videos from the Target stores. In addition, accounting for the explained mis-perception by the victim regarding the sex of Tucker\u2019s co-hort, Joyner, Ms. Auth positively identified Joyner as the other participant in the crime. Tucker\u2019s possession and use of the stolen credit cards in close temporal proximity to the break-in, and the extraordinary circumstances of the loss and destruction of Tucker\u2019s car, and the timing of his police report about that, endorsed the conviction. I am persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the errant sentence included in the cross-racial identification instruction given contributed nothing to the guilty verdict. Thus, I would affirm the judgment of this Anne Arundel County jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Judge MURPHY joins only Part II of this dissent.
