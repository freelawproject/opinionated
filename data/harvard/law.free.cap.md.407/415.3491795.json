Independent Newspapers appealed the denial of the motion, and we granted certiorari, <em>Independent Newspapers v. Brodie, </em>405 Md. 505, 954 A.2d 467 (2008), prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals to address the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">1. May a court breach the constitutional right to speak anonymously and order the identification of Internet speakers who are alleged to have violated the plaintiffs rights without a factual and legal showing that the plaintiff has a supportable claim on the merits?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">2. Did plaintiff Brodie make the required showing in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">We shall conclude that the circuit court judge abused his discretion when ordering the identification of the five anonymous Internet forum participants, because the three participants sued, concededly, did not make the alleged defamatory statements, while the other two anonymous participants, who allegedly made the actionable remarks, were not sued by Brodie. For guidance to the trial courts, we, nevertheless, will discuss the standard that should be applied to balance the First Amendment right to anonymous speech on the Internet with the opportunity on the part of the object of that speech to seek judicial redress for alleged defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">In one of our first opportunities to consider legal issues arising from an Internet communications context, <em>Beyond Systems, Inc. v. Realtime Gaming Holding Company, LLC, </em>388 Md. 1, 20-21, 878 A.2d 567, 579 (2005), we quoted <em>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, </em>521 U.S. 844, 849-50, 117 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>S.Ct. 2329, 2334, 138 L.Ed.2d 874, 884 (1997), in which the Supreme Court defined the Internet as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">[A]n international network of interconnected computers. It is the outgrowth of what began in 1969 as a military program called \u201cARPANET,\u201d [an acronym for the network developed by the Advanced Research Project Agency] which was designed to enable computers operated by the military, defense contractors, and universities conducting defense-related research to communicate with one another by redundant channels even if some portions of the network were damaged in a war.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">While the ARPANET no longer exists, it provided an example for the development of a number of civilian networks that, eventually linking with each other, now enable tens of millions of people to communicate with one another and to access vast amounts of information from around the world.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In <em>Beyond Systems, </em>we also discussed the logistics of the transmission of e-mails on the Internet and the role of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) when transmitting e-mail messages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">Because the Internet is a global network of computers, \u201ceach computer connected to the Internet must have a unique address,\u201d known as an Internet Protocol Address, which \u201ccan be used to identify the source of the connection\u201d to the Internet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">When connected to the Internet, computers communicate with each other through the use of a \u201cprotocol stack,\u201d which is usually the \u201cTCP/IP protocol stack.\u201d For example, when someone is sending an e-mail, the e-mail message enters through the Application Protocols Layer, which corresponds to specific programs such as browsers for using the World Wide Web and e-mail. The message then enters the Transmission Control Protocol (\u201cTCP\u201d), which directs certain information to a specific application or program on a computer using a port. From the TCP layer of the protocol stack, the message then moves into the Internet Protocol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Layer, which directs the message to a specific computer using an IP address. The final step in the process prior to entering the Internet is for the Hardware Layer to convert the message from binary data to network signals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">The message is then transmitted via an Internet Service Provider (\u201cISP\u201d) which examines the IP address of the message and routes the information to the computer with the proper IP address. When the message reaches its intended recipient, the receiving computer reverses the TCP/IP protocol stack and the message is decoded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 878 A.2d at 579-80 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Consistent with the development of communication opportunities on the Internet, we now are presented with a confrontation between defamation law and the use of the World Wide Web,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regarding statements made in an e-mail or an instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>message, as well as on an online \u201cblog,\u201d \u201cchatroom\u201d or \u201cdiscussion forum,\u201d using a username or pseudonym to retain anonymity. A username or a screen name is \u201c[t]he name you use to identify yourself when logging into a computer system or online service. Both a username (user ID) and a password are required. In an Internet e-mail address, the username is the left part before the @ sign.\u201d PC Magazine Online Encyclopedia, PCMag.com, \u201cusername,\u201d http://www.pcmag.com/ encyclopedia/ (last visited Feb. 19, 2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">E-mails and instant messaging form a first category of such communications, where users generally know with whom they are communicating. The word <em>e-mail </em>stands for <em>electronic mail </em>and is the \u201ctransmission of text messages and optional file attachments over a network.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u201ce-mail.\u201d There are two primary ways in which users obtain e-mail service: through an e-mail client and over the World-Wide-Web:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A93U\">The E-Mail Client</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">The use of a mail program (also known as a \u201cmail client\u201d or \u201ce-mail client\u201d) such as Outlook, Eudora or Thunderbird is the traditional approach. The advantage of such programs is that they are rich in features compared with Web-based mail and are preferred by many users. Their disadvantage is that e-mail access is tied to the machine the software is installed in. To retrieve e-mail from another computer, one has to install the mail client in that computer and set up the program all over again with user data and the address of the ISP\u2019s mail server.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">Web-based E-Mail</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">Web-based e-mail has two major advantages. First, messages can be read and sent from any Web browser in the world by accessing the e-mail site and logging in with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>username and password. Even if a client e-mail program is the preferred retrieval method, Web-based e-mail provides a convenient alternate when traveling without the computer. Secondly, a person can keep their Web-based e-mail address no matter how many times they switch ISPs for Internet access. If users do not have Web-based e-mail, they typically use their ISP\u2019s mail server. If they switch to a different ISP, they must notify everyone that me@oldISP. com has been changed to me@newISP.com, because most ISPs do not forward mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>Id., </em>\u201cInternet e-mail service.\u201d \u201cInstant Messaging\u201d (IM) is similar to e-mails, in that it is used for the exchange of text or attachments with a specific individual or individuals, but unlike e-mails, IM offers real-time communication\u2014where the message appears to the other user immediately after the first user presses <em>send:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">[Instant messaging is] [exchanging text messages in real time between two or more people logged into a particular instant messaging (IM) service. Instant messaging is more interactive than e-mail because messages are sent immediately, whereas e-mail messages can be queued up in a mail server for seconds or minutes. However, there are no elaborate page layout options in instant messaging as there are with e-mail. The IM text box is short, and pressing the enter key often sends the text. IM is designed for fast text interaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">Instant messaging services may also provide videophoning, file sharing, PC-to-PC voice calling and PC-to-regular-phone calling. Instant messaging has promoted IP telephony because the IM software makes it easy to switch from \u201ctext chat\u201d to \u201cvoice chat,\u201d providing the user has a headset or microphone and speakers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\"><em>Id., </em>\u201cInstant Messaging.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Blogs, chatrooms and discussion forums constitute a different category of Internet communications, in which users often post statements to the world at large without specification. The word <em>blog, </em>used as a noun, is a contraction of the words <em>Web </em>and <em>Log </em>and generally describes a site that \u201ccontains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>dated text entries in reverse chronological order (most recent first) about a particular topic.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u201cblog.\u201d A blog can serve as an online newsletter or as a personal journal\u2014where an individual can post concerns, ideas, opinions, etc.\u2014and it can contain links to web sites or can use images or video.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>More recently, the noun <em>blog </em>has been used as a verb, <em>to blog, </em>which means to publish an entry on a website that uses the reverse chronological \u201cblog\u201d format. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">A chatroom is another form of real-time communication over the Internet and constitutes a website that is set up to handle a group discussion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Usually, chatroom participants know the other members only by their online username; after participants type, then press send, the statements are posted immediately and can viewed by other chatroom participants. The statements appear in reverse chronological order or \u201cblog\u201d format, and the string of statements forming the chatroom conversation is referred to as a discussion thread.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>An Internet forum is similar to a chatroom, in that many people participate in the same discussion, but the statements are posted to a website that is viewable from the World Wide Web, and responses are made over time rather than immediately in real-time. A common example of an Internet forum can be found on newspaper websites, where readers are invited to respond by \u201cblogging\u201d their responses to an article. Here, the article serves as the conversation topic that begins the discussion thread, and the discussion thread flows therefrom. An Internet forum is the context of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Anonymity on the Internet</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Since the early 1990\u2019s, when Internet communications became available to the American public, anonymity or pseudonymity has been a part of the Internet culture. Generally, first exposure to communications on the Internet was through the use of a dial-up online access providers,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> such as America Online (\u201cAOL\u201d) or Prodigy. These online access providers permitted subscribers to choose \u201cscreen names\u201d to represent their online identities. When users logged-on using their screen names, they reached a home page presenting them with a host of communications services\u2014from e-mail to chat-rooms to instant messaging to forums\u2014all of which were provided by the online access provider and all of which were accessed by using the online access provider\u2019s screen name. Thus, for example, under the AOL regime, an account held by John Smith might have had the screen name/log-in of \u201cJsmithl417,\u201d the e-mail address of \u201cJsmithl417@aol.com,\u201d and any statement posted in a chatroom, during an instant message exchange or in a forum, would be posted under the screen name \u201cJsmithl417.\u201d Under this configuration, subscribers enjoyed a degree of anonymity, because they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>permitted to use a screen name wholly distinct from their real name, but their screen names also were easily traceable, because they were linked to an Internet access account.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Full-service online access providers, like AOL or Prodigy, presently no longer dominate the Internet communications market, and at-home access to the Internet is often achieved through broadband services,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provided by local cable or phone companies. These broadband companies, unlike former online access providers, usually do not require the registration of a screen name and generally provide Internet access without any other services.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Most communications services, moreover, such as those that provide e-mail, instant messaging, chat-rooms or forums, are accomplished through a website hosted by a third-party on the World Wide Web. Thus, today, the hypothetical Internet user John Smith might gain access to the Internet through his local cable company, might obtain the e-mail address JSmithl747 over the World Wide Web through Google\u2019s \u201cgmail,\u201d or a like service, and might participate in an Internet forum regarding a topic of interest under the regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tered username \u201cerazyCOAcommentator.\u201d When registering for this forum, John Smith might even obfuscate his true identity, making it even more difficult to trace his statements to him. In short, unlike former days when a user\u2019s posts were easily traceable through the online access provider\u2019s billing records, today, the World Wide Web host of an e-mail, instant messaging, forum or chatroom service obtains only as much information about an individual as it requires for registration, and even then, there are few checks to ensure the validity and accuracy of that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">First Amendment Protection of Anonymous Internet Speech</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u201cThe command of the first amendment, that \u2018[congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech,\u2019 is directed with equal force, by way of the fourteenth amendment, to state and local governments.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Eanes v.

This \u201c \u2018constitutional right of free expression\u2019 puts \u2018the decision as to what views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us, in the hope that use of such freedom will ultimately produce a more capable citizenry and more perfect polity and in the belief that no other approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our political system rests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 569 A.2d at 608, quoting <em>Cohen v.

The \u201c \u2018freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think\u2019 is a \u2018means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth\u2019 and is essential both to \u2018stable government\u2019 and to \u2018political change.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445-46, 569 A.2d at 608, quoting <em>Whitney v. California, </em>274 U.S. 357, 375-377, 47 S.Ct. 641, 648-649, 71 L.Ed. 1095, 1105-1106 (1927) (Brandeis &amp; Holmes, JJ., concurring), overruled by <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969).

Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 12-1, at 785 (2d ed.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Included within the panoply of protections that the First Amendment provides is the right of an individual to speak anonymously. <em>See Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc. of N.Y., Inc. v. Vill. of Stratton, </em>536 U.S. 150, 166, 122 S.Ct. 2080, 2089, 153 L.Ed.2d 205, 219 (2002); <em>Buckley v. Am.

In <em>McIntyre, </em>514 U.S. at 341-42, 115 S.Ct. at 1516, 131 L.Ed.2d at 436, Justice John Paul Stevens, speaking on behalf of the United States Supreme Court, remarked on the importance of protecting anonymous or pseudonymous speech:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind. Great works of literature have frequently been produced by authors writing under assumed names. Despite readers\u2019 curiosity and the public\u2019s interest in identifying the creator of a work of art, an author generally is free to decide whether or not to disclose his or her true identity. The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one\u2019s privacy as possible. Whatever the motivation may be, at least in the field of literary endeavor, the interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>having anonymous works enter the marketplace of ideas unquestionably outweighs any public interest in requiring disclosure as a condition of entry. Accordingly, an author\u2019s decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">(Citations and footnotes omitted). We also have acknowledged the magnitude of the protection of anonymous speech under the First Amendment. In <em>Lubin v. Agora, Inc., </em>389 Md. 1, 22, 882 A.2d 833, 846 (2005), for example, we denied the enforcement of subpoenas that would have compelled a publisher to disclose the identities of subscribers to their materials, holding, in part, that the subscriber\u2019s anonymity was protected under the First Amendment:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">To the extent that the Commissioner\u2019s subpoenas require Agora, a publisher, to disclose the identities of those who subscribe to or purchase its materials, the subpoenas seek information within the protective umbrella of the First Amendment. Enforcement of the subpoenas would intrude upon the First Amendment rights of Agora\u2019s subscribers and customers because disclosure of their subscriber status and purchase of the Report would destroy the anonymity that the Supreme Court has recognized as important to the unfettered exercise of First Amendment freedoms. If the names of Agora\u2019s readers were disclosed to the government, they might be subjected to questioning from investigators about their reading habits. Agora\u2019s subscribers may be discouraged from reading its materials if they are interviewed by government personnel investigating potential se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>curities violations, even if the readers are told that, individually, they are not under investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The anonymity of speech, however, is not absolute and may be limited by defamation considerations. <em>Beauharnais v. Illinois, </em>343 U.S. 250, 266, 72 S.Ct. 725, 735, 96 L.Ed. 919, 932 (1952) (\u201cLibelous utterances [are] not ... within the area of constitutionally protected speech.... \u201d). <em>See Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed. 1031, 1035 (1942) (recognizing that defamatory and libelous speech \u201care no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">With respect to the Internet, the Supreme Court has noted that there is, \u201cno basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium.\u201d <em>Reno v. ACLU, </em>521 U.S. at 870, 117 S.Ct. at 2344, 138 L.Ed.2d at 897. Courts and commentators alike have emphasized the importance of extending free speech protections to the Internet, recognizing the Internet as capable of \u201cdemocratizing\u201d the very \u201cnature of public discourse,\u201d <em>Doe v. Cahill, </em>884 A.2d 451, 455 (Del.2005), by permitting anyone with a computer to \u201cbecome a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox.\u201d <em>Reno v. ACLU, </em>521 U.S. at 870, 117 S.Ct. at 2344, 138 L.Ed.2d at 897. <em>See also </em>Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky, <em>Silencing John Doe: Defamation &amp; Disclosure in Cyberspace, </em>49 Duke L.J. 855, 894-95 (2000) (\u201cOne of the most significant ways in which the Internet promises to change the nature of public discourse is by allowing more participants to engage in public discussion and debate. The Internet gives citizens inexpensive access to a medium of mass communication and therefore transforms every citizen into a potential \u201cpublisher\u201d of information for First Amendment purposes.\u201d (Footnotes omitted)). Predictably, then, protections under the First Amendment have been extended to the Internet by various federal courts and courts in our sister <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>states. <em>See, e.g., Sony Music Entm\u2019t Inc. v.

In an order dated February 19, 2008, the judge denied Independent Newspapers\u2019 motion and ordered it to comply with the subpoena within 30 days. Independent Newspapers filed a Notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Appeal, and this Court granted certiorari prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We are presented with whether the judge properly denied Independent Newspapers\u2019 motion for a protective order/motion to quash, regarding the subpoena compelling Independent Newspapers to identify \u201cCorsicaRiver,\u201d \u201cBorn &amp; amp; Raised Here,\u201d \u201cchatdusoleil,\u201d \u201cRockyRaccoonMD\u201d and \u201cSuze.\u201d Independent Newspapers argues that Brodie should have.been required to make at least some showing of a viable defamation cause of action before the judge ordered the identification of the anonymous posters. Brodie contends that the judge was correct in ordering the identification of the five posters.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">We shall hold that the circuit court judge abused his discretion when he denied Independent Newspapers\u2019 motion for a protective order, because when he compelled the identification of the five Does, Brodie had not pleaded a valid defamation claim against any of them. Because we did not take this issue just to sort out the record but to give guidance to trial courts addressing similar matters, we shall then discuss what standard to employ, when balancing an individual\u2019s First Amendment right to speak anonymously on the Internet against a plaintiffs right to seek judicial redress for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">We review a discovery order under \u201cthe abuse of discretion standard and will only conclude that the trial court abused its discretion where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court [ ] ... or when the court acts without reference to any guiding principles, and the ruling under consideration is clearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court[ ] ... or when the ruling is violative of fact and logic.\u201d <em>Beyond Systems, </em>388 Md. at 28, 878 A.2d at 583-84 (internal quotations omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>A \u201cdefamatory statement,\u201d is one \u201cwhich tends to expose a person to public scorn, hatred, contempt or ridicule, thereby discouraging others in the community from having a good opinion of, or associating with, that person.\u201d <em>Offen v.

Hillman, </em>285 Md. 161, 172-73, 400 A.2d 1117, 1123 (1979), as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">[T]he only distinction remaining in Maryland between a libel per se and a libel per quod is that to recover the plaintiff must first show that the publication is defamatory. Where the words themselves impute the defamatory character [per se], no innuendo\u2014no allegation or proof of extrinsic facts\u2014 is necessary; but otherwise, it is [per quod]. This is both a pleading rule and an evidentiary requirement. Where extrinsic facts must be shown in order to establish the defamatory character of the words sued upon, the omission to plead them makes the complaint demurrable for failure to state a cause of action. Failure to prove them would justify a directed verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">To establish a prima facie case of defamation, then, the plaintiff must show: \u201c(1) that the defendant made a defamatory statement to a third person, (2) that the statement was false, (3) that the defendant was legally at fault in making the statement, and (4) that the plaintiff thereby suffered harm.\u201d <em>Offen v. Brenner, </em>402 Md. at 198, 935 A.2d 719 at 723-24. In the case of defamation per quod, extrinsic facts must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>alleged in the complaint to establish the defamatory character of the words or conduct. <em>See M &amp;S Furniture Sales Co., Inc. v.

The complaint identified \u201cCorsicaRiver,\u201d \u201cBorn &amp; amp; Raised Here,\u201d and \u201cehatdusoleil\u201d as defendants and alleged two instances of defamation, the first involving comments made on March 14, 2006, regarding the burning of Brodie\u2019s former home by the buyer, and the second involving allegations that Brodie maintained \u201cdirty and unsanitary-looking food-service places\u201d and that he \u201callow[ed] trash from those establishments to \u2018waft\u2019 into the nearby waterway\u201d\u2014 statements that were made on Independent Newspapers\u2019 website between March 17 and 21, 2006. \u201cRoekyRaccoonMD\u201d and \u201cSuze\u201d were not named as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In his final order, the judge dismissed Brodie\u2019s cause of action regarding the burned house, because the alleged defamation did not involve Brodie; hence, the cause of action against \u201cCorsicaRiver,\u201d \u201cBorn &amp; amp; Raised Here\u201d and \u201cehatdusoleil\u201d no longer existed, and their identity could not be compelled. Brodie also had alleged a defamation cause of action with regard to statements involving his \u201cmainten[ance of] \u2018dirty\u2019 and unsanitary-looking food-service places\u201d and that he \u201callow[ed] trash from those establishments to \u2018waft\u2019 into the nearby waterway,\u201d but conceded in correspondence in the trial court proceedings, and later in oral argument before this Court, that the identifiable posters of these statements were \u201cRoekyRaccoonMD\u201d and \u201cSuze.\u201d Enclosed with the written correspondence in the trial court, which identified \u201cRockyRac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>coonMD\u201d and \u201cSuze\u201d as the posters of these statements, was the forum discussion thread from the Newszap.com website. <em>See supra, </em>at 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Brodie, however, did not sue \u201cRockyRaccoonMD\u201d or \u201cSuze\u201d in his complaint, nor did he timely amend it to add the two posters. The cause of action against \u201cRockyRacoonMD\u201d and \u201cSuze\u201d was barred by the statute of limitations at the time the trial court ordered disclosure of their identities; thus, their identities could not be compelled. <em>See Crowe v.

When the judge compelled discovery of the identities of \u201cCorsicaRiver,\u201d \u201cBorn &amp; amp; Raised Here,\u201d \u201cchatdusoleil,\u201d \u201cRockyRaccoonMD\u201d and \u201cSuze,\u201d Brodie did not have a valid cause of action for defamation, so that Independent Newspapers\u2019 motion to quash/motion for a protective order should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">We granted certiorari in this case not merely to sort out the record, but to provide guidance to the trial courts in defamation actions, when the disclosure of the identity of an anonymous Internet communicant is sought. In so doing, we recognize the complexity of the decision to order disclosure regarding pseudonyms or usernames in the context of the First Amendment and a defamation allegation. On the one hand, posters have a First Amendment right to retain their anonymity and not to be subject to frivolous suits for defamation brought solely to unmask their identity. <em>See Cahill, </em>884 A.2d at 457 (The \u201c\u2018sue first, ask questions later\u2019 approach, coupled with a standard only minimally protective of the anonymity of defendants, will discourage debate on important issues of public concern as more and more anonymous posters censor their online statements in response to the likelihood of being unmasked.\u201d); Lidsky, <em>supra, </em>49 Duke L.J. at 855 (\u201c[t]hese suits threaten to suppress legitimate criticism.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>On the other, viable causes of actions for defamation should not be barred in the Internet context.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The only other state supreme court to address, in a civil law context, disclosure of usernames in an Internet forum is Delaware, in <em>Doe v. Cahill, </em>884 A.2d 451 (Del.2005). Cahill was an elected town council member who, with his wife, sued pseudonym/username \u201cProud Citizen\u201d for defamation and invasion of privacy regarding allegedly defamatory posts made on an Internet blog, the \u201cSmyrna/Clayton Issues Blog,\u201d hosted by the Delaware State News. The Cahills subpoenaed Com-cast Corporation to discover the identity of \u201cProud Citizen,\u201d because Comcast, as the Internet Service Provider, allegedly had knowledge of identifying information. Comcast, in compliance with federal statute,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> notified \u201cProud Citizen\u201d of the subpoena, and \u201cProud Citizen\u201d filed an Emergency Motion for Protective Order. The trial judge determined that a \u201cgood faith\u201d standard provided the appropriate threshold and required the Cahills to establish, \u201c(1) that they had a legitimate, good faith basis upon which to bring the underlying claim; (2) that the identifying information sought was directly and materially related to their claim; and (3) that the information could not be obtained from any other source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455. Finding that the Cahills had met these factors, the judge denied the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u201cProud Citizen\u201d appealed the denial of the protective order, arguing a mere \u201cgood faith\u201d assertion of a claim of defamation inadequately protected the First Amendment right to speak anonymously on the Internet. The Delaware Supreme Court agreed, ruling that the appropriate standard was to evaluate the defamation allegations under a summary judgment standard: <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>We conclude that the summary judgment standard is the appropriate test by which to strike the balance between a defamation plaintiffs right to protect his reputation and a defendant\u2019s right to exercise free speech anonymously.

The court also stated that before the plaintiff could obtain identifiable information about the anonymous poster, the plaintiff must notify the poster in a way that provides the poster with a reasonable opportunity to oppose the discovery request.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We retain the notification provision in the <em>Dendrite </em>test.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] Thus, to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, the plaintiff must undertake efforts to notify the anonymous poster that he is the subject of a subpoena or application for order of disclosure. The plaintiff must also withhold action to afford the anonymous defendant a reasonable opportunity to file and serve opposition to the discovery request. Moreover, when a case arises in the internet context, the plaintiff must post a message notifying the anonymous defendant of the plaintiffs discovery request on the same message board where the allegedly defamatory statement was originally posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 460-61 (footnote added). The requirement of notification to the poster, coupled with opportunity to defend, appears to be generally accepted in First Amendment cases; although, the issue of the standard to be utilized to assess the viability of the allegations of defamation differentiate the Delaware decision from many of the other courts that have considered the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">One federal district court ordered disclosure when the claimant could survive a motion to dismiss, having alleged sufficient facts to support a cause of action. In <em>Columbia Insurance Company v. seescandy.com, </em>185 F.R.D. 573 (N.D.Cal.1999), Columbia Insurance Company, who, as the assignee of various trademarks related to the operation of See\u2019s Candy Shops, sought a restraining order and injunctive relief to inhibit the use of the domain name of \u201cSeescandy.com,\u201d arguing that the website infringed upon a registered trademark, although Columbia had not discovered the identity of the registrar of the domain name with third-party Network Solutions, Inc. The court, in an attempt to balance First Amendment anonymity against the infringement claim, developed a four-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">First, the plaintiff should identify the missing party with sufficient specificity such that the Court can determine that defendant is a real person or entity who could be sued in federal court. This requirement is necessary to ensure that federal requirements of jurisdiction and justiciability can be satisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">Second, the party should identify all previous steps taken to locate the elusive defendant. This element is aimed at ensuring that plaintiffs make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of service of process and specifically identifying defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u2756 \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">Third, plaintiff should establish to the Court\u2019s satisfaction that plaintiff\u2019s suit against defendant could withstand a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>motion to dismiss. A conclusory pleading will never be sufficient to satisfy this element. Pre-service discovery is akin to the process used during criminal investigations to obtain warrants. The requirement that the government show probable cause is, in part, a protection against the misuse of <em>ex parte </em>procedures to invade the privacy of one who has done no wrong. A similar requirement is necessary here to prevent abuse of this extraordinary application of the discovery process and to ensure that plaintiff has standing to pursue an action against defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">Lastly, the plaintiff should file a request for discovery with the Court, along with a statement of reasons justifying the specific discovery requested as well as identification of a limited number of persons or entities on whom discovery process might be served and for which there is a reasonable likelihood that the discovery process will lead to identifying information about defendant that would make service of process possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 578-580 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Another standard, perhaps the weakest, requires only that a plaintiff have a \u201cgood faith basis\u201d for asserting a cause of action before permitting discovery of identifying information and has been implemented by a judge of the Circuit Court of Virginia in <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum to America Online, Inc., </em>52 Va. Cir. 26, 37 (2000) (hereinafter <em>\u2018AOL\u201d), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom, America Online, Inc. v. Anonymous Publicly Traded Co., </em>261 Va. 350, 542 S.E.2d 377 (2001). In this case an anonymous entity sued John Doe in Indiana, alleging the publication of defamatory and confidential material in an AOL chatrooom. Because AOL\u2019s principal office was located in Virginia, discovery was moved to a Virginia state court. AOL, in support of its motion to quash discovery and/or for a protective order, argued that it should not have to reveal the names of the Doe defendants without sufficient proof of a prima facie case. After the court ordered the plaintiff to provide the specific comments made in the chat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>room, the judge ultimately denied AOL\u2019s motion for protective order, favoring a \u201cgood faith basis\u201d test over a prima facie one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">Although this Court agrees with AOL that APTC must establish that there is a legitimate basis to believe that it may have <em>bona fide </em>claims against the John Does before compliance with the subpoena duces tecum is ordered, it agrees with APTC that AOL\u2019s proposed test is unduly cumbersome. What is sufficient to plead a prima facie case varies from state to state and, sometimes, from court to court. This Court is unwilling to establish any precedent that would support an argument that judges of one state could be required to determine the sufficiency of pleadings from another state when ruling on matters such as the instant motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">Therefore, in lieu of the test proposed by AOL, this Court holds that, when a subpoena is challenged under a rule akin to Virginia Supreme Court Rule 4:9(c), a court should only order a non-party, Internet service provider to provide information concerning the identity of a subscriber (1) when the court is satisfied by the pleadings or evidence supplied to that court (2) that the party requesting the subpoena has a legitimate, good faith basis to contend that it may be the victim of conduct actionable in the jurisdiction where suit was filed and (3) the subpoenaed identity information is centrally needed to advance that claim. A review of the Indiana pleadings and the subject Internet postings satisfies this Court that all three prongs of the above-stated test have been satisfied as to the identities of the subscribers utilizing the four e-mail addresses in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>AOL, </em>52 Va. Cir. at 36-37 (citations omitted). <em>See also Doe v. 2TheMart.com, </em>140 F.Supp.2d 1088, 1095 (W.D.Wash.2001) (granting plaintiffs motion to quash 2TheMart.com\u2019s subpoena, seeking to identify 23 anonymous Internet speakers, after considering whether \u201c(1) the subpoena seeking the information was issued in good faith and not for any improper purpose, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the information sought relates to a core claim or defense, (3) the identifying information is directly and materially relevant to that claim or defense, and (4) information sufficient to establish or to disprove that claim or defense is unavailable from any other source\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Finally, in <em>Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe, </em>342 N.J.Super. 134, 775 A.2d 756 (App.Div.2001), a three judge panel of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, opined that a plaintiff who seeks the identification of anonymous posters in a defamation action must establish facts sufficient to maintain a prima facie case, because \u201cthe discovery of [the speaker\u2019s] identity largely turns on whether his statements were defamatory or not,\u201d and \u201c[assuming [that the] statements are lawful, they would be afforded Constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 760, 766. In <em>Dendrite, </em>Dendrite International, Inc., sued four Doe defendants for defamation, based, in part, on the posting of statements on a web site forum hosted by Yahoo!, regarding Dendrite\u2019s \u201crevenue recognition policy,\u201d which was said to have inflated their earnings reports, and the \u201cshopping\u201d of the company. <em>Id. </em>at 763. The judge, after issuing an order to the Doe defendants to show cause why their identities should not be revealed and after conducting a hearing on the matter, granted Dendrite\u2019s motion to conduct limited discovery to ascertain the identities of Doe defendants one and two, but denied the motion with respect to defendants three and four. In so doing, the judge balanced individuals\u2019 right \u201c \u2018to anonymously voice their opinions against a plaintiffs right to confront his accusers,\u2019 \u201d and concluded, at least as to Doe three, that \u201c \u2018Dendrite ha[d] not made a prima facie case of defamation against John Doe No. 3, as Dendrite ha[d] failed to demonstrate that it was harmed by any of the posted messages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764. Dendrite immediately appealed the order denying discovery of Doe No. 3\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In affirming, the New Jersey intermediate appellate court recognized that the prima facie standard was more onerous than the motion to dismiss standard, but noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">Here, although Dendrite\u2019s defamation claims would survive a traditional motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>action, we conclude the motion judge appropriately reviewed Dendrite\u2019s claim with a level of scrutiny consistent with the procedures and standards we adopt here today and, therefore, the judge properly found Dendrite should not be permitted to conduct limited discovery aimed at disclosing John Doe No. 3\u2019s identity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 771. The more rigorous standard was regarded as more appropriate in applying a balancing test between the First Amendment right to anonymity and actions for defamation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVC\">We offer the following guidelines to trial courts when faced with an application by a plaintiff for expedited discovery seeking an order compelling an [Internet Service Provider] to honor a subpoena and disclose the identity of anonymous Internet posters who are sued for allegedly violating the rights of individuals, corporations or businesses. The trial court must consider and decide those applications by striking a balance between the well-established First Amendment right to speak anonymously, and the right of the plaintiff to protect its proprietary interests and reputation through the assertion of recognizable claims based on the actionable conduct of the anonymous, fictitiously-named defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 760. The three judge panel also, as have other courts, recognized that a claimant must provide notice to posters and provide them a reasonable opportunity to be heard, and must identify and set forth the exact statements purportedly made by each anonymous poster that constitutes actionable speech:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYJ\">We hold that when such an application is made, the trial court should first require the plaintiff to undertake efforts to notify the anonymous posters that they are the subject of a subpoena or application for an order of disclosure, and withhold action to afford the fictitiously-named defendants a reasonable opportunity to file and serve opposition to the application. These notification efforts should include posting a message of notification of the identity discovery request to the anonymous user on the ISP\u2019s pertinent message board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The court shall also require the plaintiff to identify and set forth the exact statements purportedly made by each anonymous poster that plaintiff alleges constitutes actionable speech.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">The complaint and all information provided to the court should be carefully reviewed to determine whether plaintiff has set forth a prima facie cause of action against the fictitiously-named anonymous defendants. In addition to establishing that its action can withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:6\u20142(f), the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence supporting each element of its cause of action, on a prima facie basis, prior to a court ordering the disclosure of the identity of the unnamed defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Id. </em>Once notice and an opportunity to be heard have been given, and a prima facie case has been shown, the trial judge must engage in a balancing test before granting a discovery order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">[T]he court must balance the defendant\u2019s First Amendment right of anonymous free speech against the strength of the prima facie case presented and the necessity for the disclosure of the anonymous defendant\u2019s identity to allow the plaintiff to properly proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">The application of these procedures and standards must be undertaken and analyzed on a case-by-case basis. The guiding principle is a result based on a meaningful analysis and a proper balancing of the equities and rights at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeD\"><em>Id. </em>at 760-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The application of <em>Dendrite </em>has varied. In <em>Highfields Capital Management L.P. v. Doe, </em>385 F.Supp.2d 969 (N.D.Cal.2005), a hedge fund management firm alleged defamation by a Doe defendant, based upon statements posted on a Yahoo! message board devoted to discussion of Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), a company in which Highfields was the largest shareholder. In ruling that the magistrate judge had properly required the plaintiff to show a \u201creal evidentiary basis\u201d for believing that the defendant had engaged in \u201cwrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ful conduct that has caused real harm,\u201d the district court judge approved of the magistrate judge\u2019s two-part test based on <em>Dendrite:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">[T]he plaintiff must adduce <em>competent </em>evidence\u2014and the evidence plaintiff adduces must address <em>all </em>of the inferences of fact that plaintiff would need to prove in order to prevail under at least one of the causes of action plaintiff asserts. In other words, the evidence that plaintiff adduces must, if unrebutted, tend to support a finding of <em>each </em>fact that is essential to a given cause of action. The court may not enforce the subpoena if, under plaintiffs showing, any <em>essential </em>fact or finding lacks the requisite evidentiary support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">If reached, the second component of the test requires the court to assess and compare the magnitude of the harms that would be caused to the competing interests by a ruling in favor of plaintiff and by a ruling in favor of defendant. If, after such an assessment, the court concludes that enforcing the subpoena would cause relatively little harm to the defendant\u2019s First Amendment and privacy rights and that its issuance is necessary to enable plaintiff to protect against or remedy serious wrongs, the court would deny the motion to quash.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 975-76 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In <em>Mobilisa, Inc. v. Doe, </em>217 Ariz. 103, 170 P.3d 712 (Ct.App.2007), a three judge panel of the Arizona intermediate appellate court implemented a hybrid of the <em>Cahill </em>and <em>Dendrite </em>standards. The dispute in <em>Mobilisa </em>arose when an anonymous e-mail address, literally named \u201ctheanonymousem\u00e1il.com,\u201d (the \u201cemailer\u201d) intercepted an intimate e-mail sent from the CEO of Mobilisa, Nelson Ludlow, to Shara Smith, a woman with whom Ludlow was involved in a personal relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 715. Mobilisa sued the emailer under two federal laws relating to electronic communications, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030 &amp; 2701 (2000), and common law trespass to chattel, and sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>to discover the true identity of the emailer from \u201cThe Suggestion Box, Inc.,\u201d (TSB) an Arizona e-mail service provider. The lower court, using the <em>Cahill </em>test, granted Mobilisa leave to discover the anonymous emailer\u2019s identity from TSB, and TSB appealed. A three judge panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals, after discussing both <em>Dendrite </em>and <em>Cahill, </em>adopted a hybrid of the two, requiring, that the plaintiff give adequate notice to the anonymous speaker and reasonable opportunity to respond to the discovery request; that the plaintiff provide sufficient facts to surpass the summary judgment threshold; and finally, that the trial judge balance \u201cthe strength of the requesting party\u2019s case against the need for disclosure of the anonymous poster\u2019s identity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">In <em>Sony Music Entm\u2019t, Inc. v.

Sony had subpoenaed Cablevision, the Internet Service Provider of the 40 Does, for identifying information. After Cablevision notified the Does that it would comply with the subpoena unless they acted, the Does moved to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The federal district court judge, after ruling that the Does\u2019 conduct was \u201cspeech\u201d on the Internet, applied the following synthesis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">Cases evaluating subpoenas seeking identifying information from ISPs regarding subscribers who are parties to litigation have considered a variety of factors to weigh the need for disclosure against First Amendment interests. These factors include: (1) a concrete showing of a prima facie claim of actionable harm, <em>see seescandy.com, </em>185 F.R.D. at 577, 579-81 (permitting plaintiff to request discovery, based on particular factors, to determine identities of defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>known only by Internet pseudonyms and domain name registration identities); <em>America Online, </em>2000 WL 1210372, at *8, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, America Online, Inc. v.

Ass\u2019n of America, Inc. v. Verizon Internet Servs., Inc., </em>351 F.3d 1229 (D.C.Cir. 2003). As set forth below, each of these factors supports disclosure of defendants\u2019 identities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 564-65. In determining that Sony had made a prima facie claim for copyright infringement, the court, applying the elements of that tort, noted that Sony had provided with their complaint: (1) \u201ca partial list of the sound recordings the rights to which defendants ha[d] allegedly infringed\u201d; (2) \u201ca valid Certificate of Copyright Registration\u201d for each of the recordings; (3) allegations that Sony was granted the \u201cexclusive rights to reproduce and distribute to the public [each of] the copyrighted recordings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">After reviewing the standards employed by many of our sister courts, we believe that a test requiring notice and opportunity to be heard, coupled with a showing of a prima facie case and the application of a balancing test\u2014such as the standard set forth in <em>Dendrite, </em>775 A.2d at 760-61\u2014most appropriately balances a speaker\u2019s constitutional right to anonymous Internet speech with a plaintiffs right to seek judicial redress from defamatory remarks. In determining that a prima facie showing of defamation is the appropriate threshold, we are cognizant that setting too low a threshold would limit free speech on the Internet, while setting too high a threshold could unjustifiably inhibit a plaintiff with a m\u00e9rito<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>rious defamation claim from pursuit of that cause of action. The lower \u201cgood faith basis\u201d or \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d thresholds, articulated by our sister courts in <em>AOL, </em>52 Va. Cir. at 37, and <em>seescandy.com, </em>185 F.R.D. at 579, would inhibit the use of the Internet as a marketplace of ideas, where boundaries for participation in public discourse melt away,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and anyone with access to a computer can speak to an audience \u201clarger and more diverse than any [of] the Framers could have imagined.\u201d <em>ACLU v.

With the Internet, users can bypass commercial publishers and editors \u201cto speak to one another across the boundaries of divergent cultures,\u201d Robert C. Post, <em>The Constitutional Concept of Public Discourse: Outrageous Opinion, Democratic Deliberation, and </em>Hustler <em>Magazine v.

These concepts, not theoretical but practical, promote public discourse and must be guaranteed the protection of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Setting the bar too high, on the other hand, to require plaintiffs to meet a summary judgment standard, \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute of material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> would undermine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>personal accountability and the search for truth, by requiring claimants to essentially prove their case before even knowing who the commentator was.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Thus, when a trial court is confronted with a defamation action in which anonymous speakers or pseudonyms are involved, it should, (1) require the plaintiff to undertake efforts to notify the anonymous posters that they are the subject of a subpoena or application for an order of disclosure, including posting a message of notification of the identity discovery request on the message board; (2) withhold action to afford the anonymous posters a reasonable opportunity to file and serve opposition to the application; (3) require the plaintiff to identify and set forth the exact statements purportedly made by each anonymous poster, alleged to constitute actionable speech; (4) determine whether the complaint has set forth a prima facie defamation per se or per quod action against the anonymous posters; and (5), if all else is satisfied, balance the anonymous poster\u2019s First Amendment right of free speech against the <em>strength </em>of the <em>prima facie </em>case of defamation presented by the plaintiff and the necessity for disclosure of the anonymous defendant\u2019s identity, prior to ordering disclosure. <em>Dendrite, </em>775 A.2d at 760-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR QUEEN ANNE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED.

Horrigan, <em>Home Broadband Adoption 2008, </em>Pew Internet and American Life Project, at 1 (July 2008), <em>available at </em>http://www. pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Broadband_2008.pdf (last visited Feb. 19, 2009). Only 10% of Americans now use dial-up to access the Internet. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The diversity of activities for which Americans use Internet services is also growing. According to the Pew Report, in 2008, 49% of Internet users used an online search engine in a typical day, 13% used the Internet to send instant messages, 11% accessed the Internet to read an online blog and 5% accessed the Internet to create their own online blog. <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">.

I agree with the first three elements of the majority\u2019s standard, which, in short, requires (1) reasonable efforts to notify, (2) withholding action to allow reasonable opportunity to oppose subpoena, and (3) that the plaintiff identify the alleged defamatory speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Further, I agree with the majority\u2019s fourth element, although I would offer slightly more explanation of what is sufficient to \u201cset forth a prima facie defamation\u201d action in the context of filing a complaint. Specifically, the majority is not clear whether or not a plaintiff must make this <em>prima facie </em>showing by an affidavit, deposition, or other statement under oath,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or whether mere allegations of fact are sufficient. While either of these procedures may prove workable, the Bar and the Bench would be better served if the majority would clarify this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">I respectfully disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s inclusion of the fifth element, the balancing test. In reaching my decision, I am mindful of the features of Internet dialogue that increase the potential for damage to persons who are the subject of these communications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">[T]he relative anonymity afforded by the Internet <em>forum </em>promotes a looser, more relaxed communication style. Users are able to engage freely in informal debate and criticism, leading many to substitute gossip for accurate reporting and often to adopt a provocative, even combative tone. As one commentator has observed, online discussions may look more like a vehicle for emotional catharsis than a forum for the rapid exchange of information and ideas:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Gv\">Hyperbole and exaggeration are common, and \u2018venting\u2019 is at least as common as careful and considered argumentation. The fact that many Internet speakers employ online pseudonyms tends to heighten this sense that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u2018anything goes,\u2019 and some commentators have likened cyberspace to a frontier society free from the conventions and constraints that limit discourse in the real world.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><em>Krinsky v. Doe 6, </em>159 Cal.App.4th 1154, 72 Cal.Rptr.3d 231, 237-38 (2008)(quoting Lyrissa B. Lidsky, <em>Silencing John Doe: Defamation and Discourse in Cyberspace, </em>49 Duke L.J. 855, 863 (2000)). This \u201canything goes\u201d mind set, coupled with the virtually unlimited circulation available to bloggers at minimal cost, heightens the danger of injury to the subject of the communication from false or exaggerated statements. I would venture to guess that on the Internet, defamation occurs more frequently and is broadcast to more people than via any other medium, past or present. With this in mind, I am reluctant to set additional barriers to a person seeking to assert a legitimate cause of action to remedy the damage inflicted by a defamatory Internet communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In my view, the balancing test is unnecessary and needlessly complicated. <em>See Doe v. Cahill, </em>884 A.2d 451, 461 (Del. 2005)(\u201cThe summary judgment test is itself the balance. The [balancing test] adds no protection above and beyond that of the summary judgment test and needlessly complicates the analysis.\u201d) Although the Delaware court spoke in terms of the summary judgment test, the point is also applicable in a motion to dismiss context.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">A quick review of the substantive law of defamation bears out this thesis. The common law has a well-developed law of both absolute and qualified privilege and legislative enactments have provided additional categories of privileged communications. The absolute privilege protects certain defendants absolutely from liability for communications made in certain contexts, such as those made in the course of a judicial proceeding, <em>Reichardt v. Flynn, </em>374 Md. 361, 367, 823 A.2d 566, 569 (2003), or communications made by high executive officers that are reasonably related to the officer\u2019s duties, <em>Walker v. D\u2019Alesandro, </em>212 Md. 163, 170, 129 A.2d 148, 151-52 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>There are qualified privileges covering a much broader scope of communications. These include, <em>inter alia, </em>communications made (1) to law enforcement officers regarding alleged criminal activity, <em>Caldor, Inc. v. Bowden, </em>330 Md. 632, 653-54, 625 A.2d 959, 969 (1993); (2) to protect one\u2019s reputation against defamation, <em>McDermott v. Hughley, </em>317 Md. 12, 29, 561 A.2d 1038, 1047 (1989); (3) by or to a credit reporting service, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 h(e) (2006); (4) by an employer in the investigation of suspicious or criminal employee conduct, <em>McDermott, </em>317 Md. at 28-29, 561 A.2d at 1046-47; (5) by an employer or prior employer to a prospective employer concerning an employee\u2019s job performance, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), \u00a7 5-423 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d); (6) to someone who shares a common interest, <em>Gohari v. Darvish, </em>363 Md. 42, 57-58, 767 A.2d 321, 329 (2001); and (7) in the context of professional peer review in the health care field, CJP \u00a7\u00a7 5-637 and 5-638.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Qualified privileges protect the speaker from liability for defamation, but generally are lost when the speaker acts with malice or intent to harm. <em>See, e.g., Di Blasio v. Kolodner, </em>233 Md. 512, 522, 197 A.2d 245, 250 (1964)(\u201cAn absolute privilege is distinguished from a qualified privilege in that the former provides immunity regardless of the purpose or motive of the defendant, or the reasonableness of his conduct, while the latter is conditioned upon the absence of malice and is forfeited if it is abused.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Another important doctrine of defamation law rests on the First Amendment, and requires that any public official who sues for defamation must surmount the more difficult burden of establishing that the defendant acted with what is known as \u201c \u2018Constitutional malice[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Danielczyk, </em>400 Md. 98, 114-15, 928 A.2d 795, 805 (2007)(stating that public officials must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant \u201ceither knew their statements were false or acted with reckless disregard of whether they were true or false\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>These and other doctrines are all substantive rules of defamation that were developed as part of the common law, including application of the First Amendment principles, and legislative enactment. Each of these embraced a judicial balancing of the interests of the defendant and society in free and unfettered communication against the interests of the plaintiff in a good reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The balancing test adopted by the majority accords to a trial court the authority to decide that a plaintiffs cause of action for defamation shall not go forward, even though it meets, on a <em>prima facie </em>basis, all of the common law requirements, because the court has decided that the defendant\u2019s interests are greater, on balance, than the plaintiffs. But the majority grants judges that discretion, without specifying how the interests that trial courts are to balance differ from the interests that are already balanced in developing the substantive law of defamation. I fear that the majority decision invites the lower courts to apply, on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis, a \u201csuperlaw\u201d of Internet defamation that can trump the well-established defamation law. This newly granted balancing authority, ironically, may defeat the balance developed through the judicially developed defamation law when judges refuse to require disclosure of the identity of putative defendants. In doing so, it may become an obstacle to pursuit of legitimate causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Judges MURPHY and BARBERA authorize me to state that they join this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\">. If a statement under oath is required, it should be limited to facts that are accessible to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
