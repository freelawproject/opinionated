Strickland was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, with Judge Richard H. Sothoron, Jr., presiding, from January 5 through January 8, 1998. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charges of robbery with a deadly weapon and use of a handgun in commission of a felony, but it failed to reach a verdict on the murder charge. After discussions among defense counsel, the prosecuting attorney and the trial judge, including discussions in the trial judge\u2019s chambers on March 2, 1998, which were not recorded, Strickland, pursuant to a plea agreement, entered a plea of guilty to first degree felony murder on March 3, 1998. Although the terms of the plea agreement have been and are currently disputed, the record reflects the following colloquy between the trial judge and Strickland prior to acceptance of the guilty plea on March 3rd:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATC\">\u201cThe Court: What I indicated to Mr. Blumenthal [defense counsel] is that if you conduct yourself in a well-mannered posture, that is to say, you refrain from getting into any disciplinary problems to speak of while you are incarcerated, the Court would be inclined to favorably consider [a] motion [for modification of sentence] at some point in time in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">\u201cAnd let\u2019s suppose, hypothetically, that I imposed a sentence today of life in prison, under felony murder, if that were to happen, then the prior convictions the jury has rendered as to robbery with a deadly weapon would merge into the felony murder. The law does not allow a judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>impose a sentence for the robbery with a deadly weapon in addition to the life sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\u201cDo you understand that, Mr. Strickland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. So that means that if the Court, one, did not impose life without parole, and I indicated to Mr. Manico [the prosecutor] and Mr. Blumenthal that in all likelihood I\u2019m not going to do that today, I would be inclined to impose a life sentence, and I would be inclined to favorably consider a motion for reconsideration of sentence if you do what I just indicated that you should do, and that is to conduct yourself as a model inmate, then the Court would be inclined to grant at a point in time in the future, which is yet to be determined, relief by granting your motion for reconsideration of sentence to the extent that I would reconsider your sentence by suspending a portion of your life sentence down to 50 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The trial judge accepted Strickland\u2019s guilty plea, sentenced him to life imprisonment for felony murder, imposed no sentence on the robbery conviction because of merger, and sentenced Strickland to a concurrent 20-year term of imprisonment for the handgun offense. Strickland\u2019s motion for modification of the sentence, pursuant to Rule 4-345(e)(1), was filed two days later, on March 5, 1998. The trial judge held that motion under advisement for several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">A hearing on the modification motion was held on October 14, 2005, and November 17, 2005. At the beginning of the recorded portion of the October hearing, the trial judge referred to the judge and the attorneys \u201chav[ing] just listened at the bench to the court reporter\u2019s reciting,\u201d based upon the transcript of the March 3, 1998, sentencing, \u201cwhat the plea agreement was.\u201d The trial judge also pointed out that the court reporter\u2019s reading of the March 3, 1998, transcript \u201creferenced that I had alluded to a conference in chambers the day before,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>on March 2, 1998. In addition, the trial judge indicated that his understanding, when he accepted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>guilty plea, was that he \u201cwould be inclined to reconsider, down the road, if Mr. Strickland was a model inmate\u201d but that \u201cI didn\u2019t give any promises as to what I would do nor, did I absolutely bind myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Defense counsel, who was the same attorney who had represented Strickland at the trial and sentencing, stated that his understanding of the plea bargain, including the position of the trial judge on March 2 and 3, 1998, was different. The defense attorney represented that his</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">\u201cunderstanding of the nature of the agreement was that, if I may use the word, it was written in stone. We would return here at a later point and, if he was a model prisoner, he would get life, suspend all but 50. By model prisoner, I understood that to mean he was to remain significantly infraction-free, no real infraction, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Defense counsel then requested a continuance to search for any record of the proceeding in the trial judge\u2019s chambers on March 2, 1998, and to contact the original prosecutor in the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial judge, however, had the court reporter put under oath and testify as a witness. The reporter testified that there existed no recording and no notes of what transpired at the proceeding in chambers on March 2, 1998, although the transcript of the March 3rd sentencing clearly referred to the proceeding in the judge\u2019s chambers on March 2nd.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Next, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney representing the State at the October 2005 hearing said that he had spoken with the original prosecutor \u201cthis week\u201d and that the original prosecutor had no \u201cstrong recollection\u201d of the plea agreement and that his recollection \u201cwas unclear.\u201d The trial judge also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>disclosed that he had talked to the original prosecuting attorney and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">\u201cI suggested to him that his input was important from the State\u2019s perspective. That\u2019s all I recall talking to him about it. I didn\u2019t go into specifics at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Defense counsel responded that the testimony or an affidavit from the original prosecuting attorney should be obtained, and that it would be \u201cwise to have alternate counsel who will represent Mr. Strickland, and they may see fit to call me and elicit testimony.\u201d Defense counsel then alluded to the trial judge\u2019s having previously disclosed to counsel for both sides that the judge had on some prior occasions spoken with the father of the homicide victim in the case, and that the father had, in the judge\u2019s words, \u201ctaken an active role on various victims\u2019 rights issues since this case.\u201d In light of the factual dispute over the terms of the plea agreement, the trial judge\u2019s ex parte conversation with the original prosecuting attorney, and the trial judge\u2019s contacts with the decedent\u2019s father, defense counsel made a motion that the trial judge recuse himself and have another judge rule on the motion to modify Strickland\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The Assistant State\u2019s attorney replied that, in his view, there was no reason to elicit the testimony of the original prosecuting attorney because the nature of the plea agreement was set forth in the transcript of the sentencing on March 3,1998. Regarding the trial judge\u2019s conversations with the decedent\u2019s father, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney said that \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to find a judge in the courthouse who does not know [the decedent\u2019s father]. He\u2019s been quite active in many cases in this courthouse.\u201d The prosecuting attorney continued: \u201c[A]s to the recusal, that\u2019s pretty much up to the Court. I don\u2019t know if the State really has an opinion on that....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The trial judge denied the motion for recusal, denied the motion to continue the hearing, stated that he was going to consider \u201c[h]ow has Mr. Strickland fared since he\u2019s been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>detained,\u201d and directed that Strickland take the witness stand and be sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Strickland testified that during his incarceration he had been written up by a prison official in a matter involving \u201c[d]isrespect, [and] a verbal disagreement.\u201d He also testified that the violation was given a category 4 classification, the least serious class of infractions, and that, after five years, the violation should have been removed from his record. Following Strickland\u2019s testimony, the trial judge asked the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney about Strickland\u2019s eligibility for parole under his current sentence and how the requested sentence modification might affect his parole eligibility. After some discussion among the judge and the attorneys concerning this matter, the trial judge decided that he would continue the hearing until a later date in order for the prosecuting attorney and the defense attorney to check into Strickland\u2019s parole status and his disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The hearing was resumed on November 17, 2005. At the beginning of the resumed hearing, the trial judge stated that he had contacted Strickland\u2019s classification officer who informed the judge that Strickland had one disciplinary matter on his record, in March 1998,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201cfor failure to obey a direct order and he had to serve 15 days in lockup. The essence of it was that he used vulgar language. He had been a barber since May of '99, and he had been determined by [the classification officer] and staff members to be trustworthy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The trial judge said that the classification officer told the judge that Strickland \u201cis under protective custody\u201d because \u201chis welfare was in jeopardy because of cooperation in this case.\u201d The trial judge also said that he had discussed with the classification officer Strickland\u2019s parole eligibility. In addition, the trial judge disclosed that, \u201cabout three weeks ago,\u201d the judge spoke with the \u201cChief Attorney\u201d in the Governor\u2019s office about the Governor\u2019s policy regarding the parole of inmates serving life sentences. The trial judge indicated that, in the judge\u2019s view, Strickland would likely serve more time if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the motion for modification of sentence were granted. The trial judge also reiterated his understanding of the plea agreement, namely that \u201cthis matter is in my discretion and I\u2019m not locked into anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Defense counsel indicated disagreement with the judge\u2019s view that Strickland would be better off if the motion for modification of sentence were denied. Counsel represented that Strickland desired \u201ca hard number on his sentence.\u201d Defense counsel went on to emphasize his different understanding of the plea arrangement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201cI do want to clarify something that I said at the last hearing. I indicated at the last hearing that it was my understanding that Your Honor had indicated that if he remained infraction free, Your Honor would suspend the last part of the life sentence. In fact, Your Honor, I misstated that. When Mr. Manico and I and Your Honor had a conversation before the plea was held about what might happen on a reconsideration of sentence, Your Honor indicated that you would reconsider the life [and] suspend all but 50 on a reconsideration. It was at the [March 3, 1998,] hearing, for the first time, when a reference was made to remaining infraction free....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">\u201cBut before the plea, that wasn\u2019t part of what we discussed. I think, Your Honor, with all due respect, that Judge Sothoron was very, very clear that on a reconsideration, there would be a life suspend all but 50.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Defense counsel also pointed out that, because of the disagreement concerning the terms of the plea arrangement, he could no longer serve as the defendant\u2019s attorney. The following colloquy among defense counsel, the trial judge, and the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">\u201cMR. BLUMENTHAL [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My hope was Mr. Strickland would be able to obtain private counsel. I know there were efforts made in that regard. I know he talked to Mr. Bennett. Unfortunately, he\u2019s unable to secure a private attorney. So we request of this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>now to assign a public defender to represent him, and whatever role they see fit to have me play\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: The request is denied, Mr. Blumenthal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201cMR. BLUMENTHAL: I\u2019m not sure the State even opposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cMR. MALONEY [ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: The State agrees that, I think, since he is a witness to this, he ... cannot testify and also be the attorney for Mr. Strickland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t think there is anything to testify to, Mr. Maloney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201cMR. MALONEY: Well, I think that if both sides agree to it, Your Honor, I think it\u2019s in the interest of justice\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: There is no secret deal here. Everything has been placed on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">\u201cMR. MALONEY: Well, that\u2019s for a determination by fact. We have not had to call any witnesses to that matter, Your Honor. So I think we have to have that hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t think so, Mr. Maloney. The transcript speaks for itself. It is clear that if I was going to consider reconsideration of sentence, it was abundantly clear that Mr. Strickland had to keep himself disciplinary free. It\u2019s as simple as that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">\u201cMR. MALONEY: Well, Mr. Strickland\u2019s attorney said you promised him in chambers to give him life suspend all but 50 with no qualifications, Your Honor. If he does not get the reconsideration, he has a very valid right to appeal, and he has a right to have that hearing. If you grant it, the State has a reason to assert its objections, because you\u2019ve made an agreement outside the record to the defendant that he should be getting something. So we have a right to have that hearing. Whether it\u2019s from the defense side or from the State\u2019s side, that hearing has got to be held, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I disagree with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-14\">\u201cMR. MALONEY: Your Honor, if a promise has been made in chambers, and we have a member of the bar saying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>that promise has been made, we have to have that hearing to find out. If another judge says it did happen or it didn\u2019t happen, so be it. But then we can proceed. But at this point, Your Honor, we have to decide if that occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">After further discussion, the trial judge again denied the request for a hearing to determine the nature of the plea arrangement. The judge adhered to the view that the transcript of the sentencing on March 3,1998, clearly disclosed the nature of the plea arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney then pointed out that the trial judge had \u201cbecome a witness in this case.\u201d Consequently, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney requested that the attorneys be given an opportunity to have the Administrative Judge, who was Judge William D. Missouri, decide the matter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney emphasized that a \u201chearing must be held\u201d to determine \u201cwhat happened in chambers [on March 2, 1998], and that\u2019s the critical issue at this point, whether or not an agreement was made in chambers between you and the defendant.\u201d The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney stated that \u201c[y]ou cannot be both the judge and the witness.\u201d The trial judge, however, again disagreed with the position of defense counsel and the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Immediately thereafter, Mr. Ivey, the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, represented to the trial judge that he had spoken with the Administrative Judge as well as the family of the victim, and that everyone agreed that the hearing on the motion for modification should be postponed and that the matter should be heard by another judge. The State\u2019s Attorney informed the trial judge that the Administrative Judge had assigned Circuit Judge Michael P. Whalen to preside over the hearing on the motion to modify the sentence. The trial judge suggested that the attorneys should again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>speak with the Administrative Judge, and the trial judge recessed the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Later on November 17, 2005, the proceeding was resumed, and the trial judge acknowledged that the Administrative Judge had granted a continuance and that the entire matter was no longer before the trial judge. It was also pointed out that the Administrative Judge would determine whether the Public Defender\u2019s Office should represent Strickland. A hearing on the motion for modification of the sentence was scheduled for February 1, 2006, before Judge Michael P. Whalen.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">On December 30, 2005, however, prior to the scheduled hearing before Judge Whalen, the original trial judge (Sothoron, J.) signed and filed the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201cNOW, THEREFORE, it is, this 30th day of December 2005, by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJC\">\u201cORDERED, that Defendant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence be and the same is hereby DENIED, without the need for any further hearing; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7qR\">\u201cDETERMINED, that the Administrative Judge for the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County was without authority to continue the reconsideration of sentence hearing on November 17, 2005, said matter being solely within the discretion of the trial judge and any intervention in this case by the Administrative Judge for Prince George\u2019s County was inappropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">A motion for reconsideration of the above-quoted order was filed and was denied by Judge Sothoron.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Strickland appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, raising several issues. The intermediate appellate court, however, affirmed in an unreported opinion. With regard to the argument that the trial judge erred in denying the motion for modification of sentence after the matter had been assigned to another judge, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">\u201cJudge Sothoron was correct in his conclusion that the motion for reconsideration of sentence was within his sole discretion. <em>See Duffin v. Warden of Md. Penitentiary, </em>235 Md. 685, 686, 202 A.2d 597 (1964) (\u2018\u00bfA] motion for reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>of sentence should be heard or otherwise disposed of by the court which imposed the sentence.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Strickland filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, raising the issues of (1) whether the trial judge erroneously \u201ccircumvented the ruling of the Administrative Judge granting\u201d Strickland a hearing before a different circuit judge, (2) whether the trial judge should have recused himself under the circumstances, and (3) whether the trial judge abused his discretion by refusing to grant the motion for modification of the sentence. This Court granted the petition, <em>Strickland v. State, </em>402 Md. 352, 936 A.2d 850 (2007), and we shall reverse on the first issue presented, namely that the trial judge erred by ruling on the motion for modification of sentence after the Administrative Judge had assigned the matter to another judge. Consequently, we shall not reach the second and third issues raised by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The assignment of Maryland judges is provided for in Article IV, \u00a7 18, of the Maryland Constitution and in Maryland Rules 16-101 through 16-103, 16-201, and 16-202. Article IV, \u00a7 18, of the Constitution, provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals is the administrative head of the State\u2019s Judicial system and that the Chief Judge may \u201cassign any judge except a judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court to sit temporarily in any court except an Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d Article IV, \u00a7 18, also requires that the Court of Appeals \u201cshall adopt rules and regulations concerning the practice and procedure in and the administration of ... the other courts of this State____\u201d In addition, the constitutional provision states that the authority of all courts of the State over practice, procedure, and administration \u201cshall be subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the Court of Appeals----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Maryland Rules 16-101, 16-103, 16-201, and 16-202 were adopted by the Court of Appeals pursuant to the mandate contained in Article IV, \u00a7 18, of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Rule 16-101 reiterates the broad administrative authority of the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, and, with regard to the circuit courts, the Rule confers upon Circuit Administrative Judges and County Administrative Judges extensive supervisory authority.

Rule 16-201(c), relating to hearings on motions, states that the County Administrative Judge \u201cshall provide for assignment of hearing dates,\u201d and Rule 16-202(a), entitled \u201cAssignment of actions for trial,\u201d provides that \u201c[t]he County Administrative Judge in each county shall supervise the assignment of actions for trial....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The above-quoted provisions unambiguously vest in the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, Circuit Administrative Judges, and County Administrative Judges, full authority to assign judges for trials or hearings in the circuit courts of this State. There is no rule or opinion of this Court which vests in a circuit judge of a particular county the authority to override or ignore an assignment by the Administrative Judge of that County or by the Circuit Administrative Judge of the circuit which includes that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Instead of supporting the decisions by Circuit Judge Sothoron and the Court of Special Appeals, the case law in this Court is directly to the contrary. In <em>Whitaker v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>307 Md. 368, 514 A.2d 4 (1986), the Circuit Administrative Judge for the Seventh Judicial Circuit assigned certain cases pending in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to a judge of the Circuit Court for Calvert County. Both Prince George\u2019s County and Calvert County were, and are today, in the Seventh Judicial Circuit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The cases involved an injunction against using particular places as bawdyhouses and alleged contempt of court. The defendants at trial challenged the assignment of a Calvert County Circuit Court Judge to hear Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court cases, and on appeal to this Court, the defendants-appellants reiterated their challenge to the propriety of the judicial assignment. In rejecting the argument by the defendants-appellants, this Court relied upon Rule 1202(b), which was the similarly worded predecessor to current Rule 16-103. The Court\u2019s <em>Whitaker </em>opinion explained as follows (307 Md. at 375-376, 514 A.2d at 8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cMd. Rule 1202(b)(1) was promulgated by this Court in implementation of the constitutional power vested in it under \u00a7 18(a) to make rules governing the administration of the trial courts of the State and expressly grants unto a circuit administrative judge the power of assignment with his <em>judicial circuit. </em>\u2018[T]he Circuit Administrative Judge of each of the ... judicial circuits may assign any judge of his <em>judicial circuit </em>to sit as a judge of the Circuit Court of any county in the judicial circuit, in any specified case or cases or for any specified time.\u2019 (emphasis supplied). Md. Rule 1202(b)(1). As the unambiguous language suggests, the effect of Rule 1202(b)(1) is to provide each circuit administrative judge ..., under the overall aegis of the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, broad powers of assignment. Whether it be by the Court of Appeals directly or the circuit administrative judge as its <em>alter ego </em>in the circuit, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>power and authority encompasses all facets of the internal management of our courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><em>See also Baltimore Radio Show v.

Penitentiary, </em>235 Md. 685, 686, 202 A.2d 597, 597-598 (1964), relied on by both the State and the Court of Special Appeals, does not support the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision. The language from <em>Duffin </em>which is relied upon, <em>i.e., </em>that \u201ca motion for reduction of sentence should be heard or otherwise disposed of by the court which imposed sentence\u201d (emphasis added), refers to the sentencing court and not the sentencing <em>judge. </em>More importantly, <em>Duffin </em>did not involve an administrative order assigning the matter to a judge other than the sentencing judge. <em>Duffin </em>also did not involve any issue under the Maryland Rules relating to the assignment of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">As stated in the <em>Whitaker </em>opinion, 307 Md. at 376, 514 A.2d at 8, the authority of the Administrative Judge \u201cencompasses all facets of the internal management of our courts.\u201d Consequently, Judge Sothoron clearly erred in overruling the assignment by the Administrative Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE ORDERS BY JUDGE SOTHORON ON DECEMBER 30, 2005, AND THEREAFTER, AND TO REMAND CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

I also agree that <em>Duffin </em>does not compel a contrary conclusion. I do not agree, however, that <em>Whitaker v. Prince George\u2019s County </em>supports the proposition that current Rule 16-103 vests an Administrative Judge with the discretionary authority to direct that a Rule 4-345(e) motion be <em>reassigned </em>to a judge other than the judge who imposed the original sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I am persuaded that the reassignment of a Rule 4-345(e) motion requires either (1) the consent of the sentencing judge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or (2) a factual finding that the sentencing judge has become disabled or must be recused.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Maryland Rule 4-361 details the procedure to be followed when it is necessary for another judge to substitute for a judge whose absence is due to \u201ctermination of office, ... or other disability.\u201d In the case at bar, both the prosecutor and petitioner\u2019s counsel (1) agreed that the judge who imposed sentence would be a necessary witness at the motion for modification hearing, and (2) received the sentencing judge\u2019s permission to present their concerns to the Administrative Judge. While with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the Administrative Judge should have held an on-the-record hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ing before ordering that the motion be reassigned to another judge, it is equally clear that the Administrative Judge\u2014as a practical matter\u2014granted a joint motion for recusal following a conference with counsel. This ruling was based upon (1) the non-clearly erroneous finding of (stipulated) fact that the sentencing judge would be an essential witness at the modification hearing, and (2) the correct conclusion of law that, under both Maryland Rule 5-605 and Canon 3D(l)(a) of Maryland Rule 16-813,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the sentencing judge could not be both witness and decision maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The record also shows that the sentencing judge initially acquiesced in the decision of the Administrative Judge. Under these circumstances, the sentencing judge did not have the authority to \u201creassign\u201d the case to himself in order to enter the December 30, 2005 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">As to the further proceedings in the Circuit Court, the record shows that, in petitioner\u2019s MOTION FOR RULING ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF SENTENCE, it is expressly asserted that petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was \u201cbased on previous discussions that contemplated a specific sentence upon reconsideration[,]\u201d and that \u201cspecifically, [the sentencing judge] agreed that [petitioner\u2019s] sentence would be modified to a sentence of life suspend all but fifty years, pursuant to discussions between the [petitioner], the State and the Court.\u201d The record also shows that on March 3, 1998, the following transpired at a bench conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">THE COURT: As [petitioner\u2019s counsel] no doubt has told you, Mr. Strickland, whenever one pleads guilty to felony murder, as I just indicated, it is a first degree charge, and therefore, it carries a life sentence, and judges such as myself cannot give you a numerical number in terms of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>sentence. What I mean by that is we can suspend a portion of the time, but the life sentence still remains in effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">THE COURT: Now, I did tell [petitioner\u2019s counsel] yesterday, in [the prosecutor\u2019s] presence, that assuming [petitioner\u2019s counsel] is going to be filing, as he indicated to me yesterday, after sentencing today, assuming your plea is accepted, assuming we go forward with sentencing today, which is my intent, if that procedure follows, [petitioner\u2019s counsel] will be filing on your behalf what we call a motion for reconsideration of sentence, which has to be filed within 90 days of sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">It doesn\u2019t mean that the judge -will act on that motion within that 90-day window, but to safeguard your rights, that motion must be filed within 90 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">Do you understand, Mr. Strickland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">[THE PETITIONER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">THE COURT: What I indicated to [petitioner\u2019s counsel] is that if you conduct yourself in a well-mannered posture, that is to say, you refrain from getting into any disciplinary problems to speak of while you are incarcerated, the Court would be inclined to favorably consider that motion at some point in time in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">And, let\u2019s suppose, hypothetically, that I imposed a sentence today of life in prison, under felony murder, if that were to happen, then the prior convictions the jury has rendered as to robbery with a deadly weapon would merge into the felony murder____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">So that means if the Court, one, did not impose life without parole, and I indicated to [the prosecutor] and [petitioner\u2019s counsel] that in all likelihood I\u2019m not going to do that today, I would be inclined to impose a life sentence, and I would be inclined to favorably consider a motion for reconsideration of sentence if you do what I just indicated that you should do, and that is to conduct yourself as a model inmate, then the Court would be inclined to grant at anoint in time in the future, which is yet to be determined, relief by granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>your motion for reconsideration of sentence to the extent that I would reconsider your sentence by suspending a portion of your life sentence down to 50 years----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">[T]he sentencing of yourself at this point will be up to myself in this case. Do you understand that, Mr. Strickland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">[THE PETITIONER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">THE COURT: ... [I] have sent a message to you clearly up here at the bench that I\u2019m not inclined at all to impose a life without parole sentence in this case. My theory here, as I told [the prosecutor] and [petitioner\u2019s counsel] yesterday, is that if somebody pleads guilty to the lead count, in this case felony murder, then they should be entitled to some consideration for doing that. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">[THE PETITIONER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">THE COURT: But at the same token, what I am obviously doing is putting the onus, the responsibility, on your shoulders to demonstrate through your actions after sentencing that you are deserving of reconsideration of sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The following transpired after the petitioner and counsel returned to the trial tables:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">THE COURT: [M]r. Strickland ... it\u2019s my understanding ... that there really isn\u2019t any plea bargaining between [the prosecutor], representing the State, and [petitioner\u2019s counsel], representing you, wherein they have agreed to set sentence or to drop certain charges because that\u2019s not being done here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">It\u2019s my understanding that the State is going to make a recommendation. That recommendation may run the gamut of life without parole to life or whatever, but [the prosecutor] is free to tell the Court what he thinks the appropriate sentence is going to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">[Petitioner\u2019s counsel] is free to tell me what he thinks the appropriate sentence would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>As I told you at the bench a few moments ago, whenever one pleads guilty to first degree felony murder ... it carries a life sentence. You understand that, Mr. Strickland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">[THE PETITIONER]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">THE COURT: And to that extent, the Court is bound to impose a life sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">Now, the Court can suspend a portion of that life sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQq\">Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">[THE PETITIONER]: I do, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">THE COURT: And as I did indicate to you, and this is based upon conversations I had off the record with [petitioner\u2019s counsel] and [the prosecutor] yesterday when he entered my chambers, that [petitioner\u2019s counsel] made it clear to me that if the court accepts your plea of guilty today and proceeds to sentencing, and the life sentence is imposed, whether it\u2019s mandatory, whether it\u2019s a straight life, whatever it may be, [petitioner\u2019s counsel] is going to request the Court reconsider your sentence in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">Myself being the sentencing judge ... I would be the one to decide whether or not to grant that motion for reconsideration of sentence. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">[THE PETITIONER]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">THE COURT: I cannot increase your sentence. I could decrease your sentence or keep your sentence as is. In other words, unchanged. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">[THE PETITIONER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">THE COURT: So the record is clear, I told you that if, indeed, I reconsider your case or your sentence, Mr. Strickland, the reason for doing so would be depending upon your conduct while you are incarcerated. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">[THE PETITIONER]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-16\">THE COURT: And the Court could reconsider your sentence to any extent, that is to say, hypothetically, if I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>wanted to go ahead and suspend all but 50 years, I could do that. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">[THE PETITIONER]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The following transpired immediately before the prosecutor recited the statement of facts that constituted the basis for the plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">THE COURT: With that said, is that the full understanding of what you had between what the State is going to recommend, what [petitioner\u2019s trial counsel] may recommend on your behalf, and what the Court may do in the future? [PETITIONER]: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">THE COURT: Nobody has promised you any additional promises, offers of reward, any kind of inducements or any type of statements to you, other than what I stated for the record to get you to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">[PETITIONER]: No, they haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">On the basis of the above quoted colloquy, it is difficult to hypothesize that the sentencing judge agreed that he would ultimately modify petitioner\u2019s sentence even if petitioner attempted to murder a corrections\u2019 officer and/or attempted to escape. It is clear, however, that the sentencing judge (1) did have an \u201coff the record\u201d conversation with the prosecutor and the petitioner\u2019s counsel, and (2) did not request that either the prosecutor or petitioner\u2019s counsel make an \u201con the record\u201d statement as to what \u201cdisciplinary problems\u201d would result in the forfeiture of petitioner\u2019s entitlement to a modification. Under these circumstances, I would expressly require that the following determinations be made on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">The Circuit Court must first determine whether it is persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner\u2019s plea was based upon an agreement that the sentence would actually be imposed in two stages, with the modification being imposed <em>regardless </em>of petitioner\u2019s institutional record. If petitioner can successfully shoulder the burden of persuasion on that issue, the petitioner is entitled to enforcement of the actual agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>If it is not persuaded that the parties agreed to a downstream modification regardless of petitioner\u2019s institutional record, the Circuit Court must determine whether it is persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner has substantially complied with the on-the-record statement of conditions imposed by the sentencing judge on March 3, 1998. If petitioner can successfully shoulder the burden of persuasion on that issue, the petitioner is entitled to the requested modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">If it is not persuaded that petitioner has substantially complied with the conditions imposed by the sentencing judge, the Circuit Court shall exercise its discretion in deciding the issue of whether and/or the extent to which petitioner\u2019s motion for modification should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\">.
