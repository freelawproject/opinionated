We shall hold that the Mooneys\u2019 suit must be dismissed because of their failure to exhaust the available administrative remedies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">In October of 2002, Kevin and Teresa Mooney agreed to lend Chesapeake Cable, LLC (\u201cChesapeake\u201d), the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>$250,000<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in exchange for two promissory notes and a Security Agreement, which assigned Chesapeake\u2019s accounts receivable to the Mooneys in the event that Chesapeake were to default \u201cin connection with the Loan, including but not limited to any principal, interest, penalty, fee, charge, deposit, advancement, escrow or assessment, or taxes or insurance premiums, as provided in the Note, the Agreement, or any other Loan Document.\u201d Kevin Mooney, whose affidavit states he was a \u201cmember\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of Chesapeake, signed the Security Agreement both as a lender and as a borrower.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">In a letter dated April 9, 2003, the Mooneys gave Chesapeake written notice of default under the Security Agreement, for failure to make timely payments on the loan. The letter further advised that the Mooneys intended to take possession of Chesapeake\u2019s accounts receivable and to notify account debtors to make subsequent payments directly to the Mooneys. Two days later, on April 11, 2003, the Mooneys perfected their security interest in Chesapeake\u2019s accounts receivable by filing a financing statement with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Mooneys also alleged in their complaint that they notified the University System of Maryland (the \u201cUniversity\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that, because the University was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>an account debtor for $43,005.00 for cable services rendered by Chesapeake,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the University was to make payment to the Mooneys, although the University disputes receiving that letter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">On April 22, 2003, the University issued a check to Chesapeake Cable for $43,005.00. Thereafter, on June 23, 2003, Kevin Mooney emailed an employee in \u201cAccounts Payable\u201d at the University, requesting a copy of the check to Chesapeake as well as a description of how it was cashed and by whom, because \u201cthe cheek was not deposited into Chesapeake\u2019s bank account and the company has no record for accounting purposes\u201d; a copy of the check was faxed to Mooney on July 31, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">On June 4, 2004, the Mooneys filed a complaint against the University in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, alleging that the University violated Section 9-406(a) of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2002 Repl. Vol.),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cby making the Check payable to Chesapeake Cable only and by mailing the Check to Chesapeake Cable instead of the Mooneys.\u201d Damages were sought in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>$43,005.00 \u201cplus reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, interest, costs of this action, and other expenses incurred by the Mooneys in enforcing their rights under the Loan Documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The University filed a Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum in Support, arguing that the Mooneys\u2019 complaint was barred, because the State \u201chas waived sovereign immunity only as to written contracts\u201d under Section 12-201(a) of the State Government Article, Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the Mooneys did not have a written contract with the University. The University also asserted that if sovereign immunity had been waived, the Mooneys also failed to file a claim with the appropriate authorities within the one year limitations period provided by Sections 12-202 or 12-106(b) of the State Government Article,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which govern contract and tort actions, respectfully. In the Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum in Support, the University also proffered that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>was neither an \u201caccount debtor\u201d nor a \u201cperson,\u201d as defined in Section 9-102(a)(3) of the Commercial Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In their Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, the Mooneys argued that their complaint was not barred by sovereign immunity, because the University waived sovereign immunity when it entered into the contract with Chesapeake, which was thereafter properly assigned, nor was their Compliant barred by the limitations period for contracts, because they filed suit within one year of the termination of the contract between Chesapeake and the University. The Mooneys also argued that although the University received timely notice, it \u201cwillfully disregarded the assignment\u201d by making payment to Chesapeake and that the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code did apply to the University, which was a \u201cperson\u201d under Title 9 of the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The University\u2019s Motion to Dismiss was denied by the circuit court, which ordered that \u201cthe issues raised in the Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss may be re-raised in a Motion for Summary Judgment wherein more factual issues can be discussed and considered.\u201d Soon thereafter, in October of 2004, the University filed an Answer to the Mooney\u2019s complaint, in which it admitted that it received the Mooneys\u2019 April 14, 2003, letter, but asserted as affirmative defenses that the Mooneys\u2019 claims were barred by sovereign immunity and the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Both parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment echoing the arguments made in the Motion to Dismiss and Opposition thereto; both motions for summary judgment were denied. On September 7, 2005, the University filed a Motion for Leave to Amend Answer and an Amended Answer, denying that it received the April 14, 2003, letter; at a motions hearing that day, the circuit court judge granted the Mooneys\u2019 oral motion in limine to strike defendant\u2019s request for leave to amend answer. The circuit court judge, neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>less, granted the University\u2019s Motion to Dismiss,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> concluding that because there was no written contract between the Mooneys and the University, the claim was in essence a tort claim requiring the Mooneys to go through the procedures set forth in the Maryland Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The Mooneys appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the judge erred in determining that their suit was an action in tort. They also argued that they were entitled to sue the University based on the contract between Chesapeake and the University. The University, conversely, argued that the Mooneys\u2019 claim was barred for failure to comply with the Maryland Tort Claims Act and, alternatively, that the Mooneys could not maintain a contract action against the University because the University had no contract with the Mooneys. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court concluded that, because the suit was not an action in tort, but instead \u201ca suit brought under Maryland\u2019s UCC to enforce the Mooneys\u2019 alleged security interest in the monies due Chesapeake under its contract with [the University],\u201d the judgment of the circuit court, based on the theory that the suit was an action in tort, could not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">On remand, the University filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or in the Alternative for Summary Judgment In Response to the Ruling of Court of Special Appeals,\u201d and the Mooneys filed a \u201cRenewed Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d The University argued that, because the \u201cGeneral Assembly of Maryland has not waived the sovereign immunity of the State and its units[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>1 under Title 9 of the [Commercial Law Article],\u201d the Mooneys could not sue the University under that Article, while the Mooneys reasserted that the University violated Section 9-406(a) of the Commercial Law Article when it sent the check to Chesapeake, even though they had been properly assigned Chesapeake\u2019s accounts receivable rights. After another hearing on the motions, the circuit court judge granted the University\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, concluding that \u201cthere is no express waiver of Sovereign Immunity under Title 9 of the [Commercial Law Article].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The Mooneys again appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in a reported opinion, stated that the appropriate question was not whether the University had waived sovereign immunity under the Commercial Law Article, but whether the Mooneys, as secured parties whose debtor was in default, could enforce the debtor\u2019s contractual rights against the University, and whether the University had waived sovereign immunity with respect to the debtor\u2019s contractual rights. <em>Mooney v. University System of Maryland, </em>178 Md.App. 637, 641, 943 A.2d 108, 110 (2008). The intermediate appellate court then concluded that the University had waived sovereign immunity and that the Mooneys could enforce Chesapeake\u2019s contractual rights. The opinion also noted that the waiver of sovereign immunity existed for only one year under Section 12-202 of the State Government Article and further that the Mooneys \u201cneeded to file the suit within one year of the termination of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646, 943 A.2d at 113. In order to determine when the contract was terminated, as well as whether the Mooneys gave proper notice to the University of the assignment, the court vacated the judgment of the circuit court and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 647, 943 A.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The University petitioned for certiorari, which we granted, <em>University Systems v. Mooney, </em>405 Md. 290, 950 A.2d 828 (2008). We shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that the Mooneys, as assignees of accounts receivable due under a contract with the University, were required to exhaust the available administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief, and because they failed to do so, they cannot pursue the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The University asserts that even if the Mooneys could pursue a claim, they were first required to exhaust their administrative remedies by submitting a contract claim to the procurement officer and protesting the denial to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (\u201cAppeals Board\u201d) before seeking judicial review, which they failed to do. The Mooneys, conversely, argue that we should not consider the issue of whether they were required to first exhaust their administrative remedies because the issue was raised for the first time in the Petition for Certiorari. The Mooneys also allege that they are not a \u201ccontractor\u201d or \u201ca person who has been awarded a procurement contract\u201d under the State Finance and Procurement Article, so that they are not required to proceed administratively before pursuing judicial remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">With respect to the fact that exhaustion of administrative remedies was raised seminally before us, we ordinarily will not consider an issue in this Court \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d Maryland Rule 8-131(a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; <em>see also Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 216, 946 A.2d 456, 461 (2008); <em>Burch v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>United Cable, </em>391 Md. 687, 695, 895 A.2d 980, 984 (2006); <em>Fitzgerald v. State, </em>384 Md. 484, 505, 864 A.2d 1006, 1018 (2004). The purpose of the Rule is \u201cto require counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings\u201d and \u201cto prevent the trial of cases in a piecemeal fashion, thus accelerating the termination of litigation.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>404 Md. at 216-17, 946 A.2d at 461; <em>Fitzgerald, </em>384 Md. at 505, 864 A.2d at 1018; <em>County Council v. Offen, </em>334 Md. 499, 509, 639 A.2d 1070, 1075 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Although we usually will not consider an issue that has not been raised below, there is \u201ca limited category of issues, in addition to jurisdiction, which an appellate court ordinarily will address even though they were not raised by a party.\u201d <em>Moats v. City of Hagerstown, </em>324 Md. 519, 525, 597 A.2d 972, 975 (1991). One of these issues is the exhaustion of administrative remedies, which we will address when raised for the first time before us, or on our own initiative. <em>See Furnitureland South, Inc. v. Comptroller of Treasury of State, </em>364 Md. 126,132, 771 A.2d 1061, 1065 (2001); <em>Montgomery County v. Broadcast Equities, Inc., </em>360 Md. 438, 450-451 &amp; n. 7, 452, 758 A.2d 995, 1002 &amp; n. 7, 1003 (2000); <em>Maryland Reclamation Associates, Inc. v. Harford County, </em>342 Md. 476, 490 n. 10, 677 A.2d 567, 574 n. 10 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The determination of whether we will address exhaustion of administrative remedies, when raised for the first time in this Court or on our own initiative, is in part dependent on whether the statutory scheme in which the administrative remedy is included is deemed to be exclusive, primary or concurrent. <em>See Zappone v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., </em>349 Md. 45, 60-61, 706 A.2d 1060, 1067-68 (1998). We have articulated that where the administrative remedy is deemed primary, the issue can be raised by this Court sua sponte; in <em>Board of Education for Dorchester County v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 786-87, 506 A.2d 625, 631 (1986), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Where ... the administrative remedy is deemed to be primary, this Court has generally held that it must be pursued and exhausted before a court exercises jurisdiction to decide the controversy. <em>Wash. Sub. San. Comm\u2019n v. Mitchell &amp; Best, supra, </em>303 Md. [544] at 553-554, 495 A.2d [30 (1985) ]; <em>Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Rel. v. B.G. &amp; E. Co., </em>296 Md. 46, 50, 459 A.2d 205, 208 (1983); <em>Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Rel. v. Beth. Steel, </em>295 Md. 586, 592, 457 A.2d 1146, 1149 (1983), and cases there cited. As explained in <em>Sec., Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Wilson, supra, </em>286 Md. [639] at 645, 409 A.2d 713 [1979],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">\u201cwhen the Legislature enacts a comprehensive remedial scheme in which a claim is to be determined by an administrative agency and reviewed in an administrative appeal before judicial review is available, it establishes, as public policy, that such a procedure produces the most efficient and effective results. In order to effectuate this public policy, trial courts generally should not act until there has been compliance with the statutory comprehensive remedial scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">While the failure to invoke and exhaust an administrative remedy does not ordinarily result in a trial court\u2019s being deprived of fundamental jurisdiction, nevertheless, because of the public policy involved, the matter is for some purposes treated <em>like </em>a jurisdictional question. Consequently, issues of primary jurisdiction and exhaustion of administrative remedies will be addressed by this Court sua sponte even though not raised by any party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">(Emphasis in original).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The notion of primary, in this context, is juxtaposed against the concepts of \u201cexclusive\u201d adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>trative remedies, under which the sole remedy is administrative, and concurrent administrative remedies, by which a claimant may pursue judicial remedies without first having to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Bell Atlantic of Maryland, Inc. v. Intercom Systems Corp., </em>366 Md. 1, 11-12, 782 A.2d 791, 797 (2001). In one of our more recent cases, in which we had occasion to explore the exhaustion of administrative remedies, <em>Bell Atlantic of Maryland, Inc. v. Intercom Sys. Corp., </em>366 Md. 1, 11, 782 A.2d 791, 796-97 (2001), we were asked to decide whether an internet service provider, Intercom, which alleged tortious interference with contractual relations, negligence and breach of contract against its telecommunications provider, Bell Atlantic, appropriately filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Because there were administrative remedies available to address many of Intercom\u2019s claims, we were tasked with determining whether those remedies were exclusive, primary or concurrent. In our analysis, we extensively relied on the language in <em>Zappone v. Liberty Life Insurance Company, </em>in which Judge John C. Eldridge, writing for this Court, succinctly articulated the distinction between exclusive, primary and concurrent administrative remedies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\"><em>First, </em>the administrative remedy may be exclusive, thus precluding any resort to an alternative remedy. Under this scenario, there simply is no alternative cause of action for matters covered by the statutory administrative remedy. <em>Second, </em>the administrative remedy may be primary but not exclusive. In this situation, a claimant must invoke and exhaust the administrative remedy, and seek judicial review of an adverse administrative decision, before a court can properly adjudicate the merits of the alternative judicial remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\"><em>Third, </em>the administrative remedy and the alternative judicial remedy may be fully concurrent, with neither remedy being primary, and the plaintiff at his or her option may pursue the judicial remedy without the necessity of invoking and exhausting the administrative remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><em>Bell Atlantic, </em>366 Md. at 11-12, 782 A.2d at 797, quoting <em>Zappone, </em>349 Md. at 60-61, 706 A.2d at 1067-68 (1998) (emphasis in original). We then went on to summarize the Zappone analysis, which provides a general framework for determining whether an administrative remedy is exclusive, primary, or concurrent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">We emphasized that \u201cwhere neither the statutory language nor the legislative history disclose an intent that the administrative remedy is to be exclusive, and where there is an alternative judicial remedy under another statute or under common law or equitable principles, there is no presumption that the administrative remedy was intended to be exclusive.\u201d <em>Zappone, </em>349 Md. at 63, 706 A.2d at 1069. Instead, we found a rebuttable presumption that in the absence of specific statutory language indicating otherwise, an administrative remedy was intended to be primary. <em>See id. </em>at 63-64, 706 A.2d at 1069. In evaluating this presumption, we are encouraged to consider numerous factors, including the \u201ccomprehensiveness of the administrative remedy,\u201d the agency\u2019s view of the scope of its jurisdiction, and the \u201cnature of the alternative judicial cause of action pursued by the plaintiff\u2019 in refuting the presumption that the legislature intended the administrative remedy to be primary. <em>See id. </em>at 64-65, 706 A.2d at 1070.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\"><em>Bell Atlantic, </em>366 Md. at 12, 782 A.2d at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">We then applied the <em>Zappone </em>analysis to the statutory scheme at issue in <em>Bell Atlantic, </em>which in Section 3-102(a) of the Public Utilities Article, Maryland Code (1998), stated that \u201c[a]ny person may file a complaint with the Commission.\u201d We concluded that the statutory scheme was not intended to be the exclusive remedy for consumers with complaints against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>public services companies, because the scheme was not \u201cexplicit in its language requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic, </em>366 Md. at 25-26, 782 A.2d at 805-06. We then recognized, nonetheless, that because the Public Utilities Article was not intended to be exclusive, it was presumably primary. We further noted that although \u201cother cognizable claims sounding in tort for compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the service contracts with Bell Atlantic cannot be resolved by the [Public Service Commission],\u201d because the action was primary, the consumer could first file a claim with the Commission and thereafter file an independent judicial action, which would be stayed until the administrative proceedings were resolved. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28, 782 A.2d at 806-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">At the outset of our analysis of the statutory framework in the present case, we note that the University System generally is not governed by Division II of the State Finance and Procurement Article because Section ll-203(e) of that Article provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">(e) <em>University System of </em>Maryland.\u2014(l)(i) In this subsection the following words have the meanings indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">(ii) \u201cBoard of Regents\u201d means the board of Regents of the University System of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">(iii) \u201cUniversity\u201d means the University System of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, this <em>Division II does not apply to the University System of Maryland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">(3) (i) A procurement by a University shall comply with the policies and procedures developed by the University and approved by the Board of Public Works and the Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review Committee of the General Assembly in accordance with \u00a7 12-112 of the Education Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">(Emphasis added).

The Procurement Policies and Procedures also include an extensive scheme governing protests involving the award of contracts, but subject the University to the dispute resolution procedures in the State Finance and Procurement Article when contract claims are involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">All claims shall be handled in accordance with Title 15, Subtitle 2 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, Annotated Code of Maryland and Code of Maryland Regulations, Title 21, Subtitle 10\u2014Administrative and Civil Remedies, Chapters 04, 05, and 06 as may be amended from time to time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\"><em>Id. </em>at X(c).

The statutory scheme for resolution of disputes occupies an entire subtitle in the State Finance and Procurement Article and is, indeed, comprehensive, encompassing the Mooneys\u2019 cause of action sounding in breach of contract. Additionally, the agency certainly views its jurisdiction as primary, having posited that \u201cthe Appeals Board shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide all disputes arising under a contract with any State agency, or as a result of a breach of a contract with any State agency....\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> COMAR 21.02.02.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In deciding that the statutory scheme under consideration is primary, we obviously reject that it could be concurrent; we do so because under the statute, more specifically Section 15-211 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, the agency is given authority to entertain \u201call appeals arising from the final action of a unit\u201d on a claim for the breach, performance, termination or modification of a contract. This recognition that the statutory scheme embodies a primary administrative remedy is undergirded by our decision in <em>SEFAC Lift &amp; Equip. Corp. v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>367 Md. 374, 788 A.2d 192 (2002), in which we had occasion to consider the same statutory framework in issue and deemed it \u201ceither primary or exclusive.\u201d In <em>SEFAC, </em>Judge Alan M. Wilner, then writing for this Court, remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">Title 15, subtitle 2 (\u00a7\u00a7 15-201 through 15-223) of the State Finance and Procurement Article of the Maryland Code sets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>forth a comprehensive framework for the resolution of procurement contract disputes between State agencies and their contractors. The heart of that statutory framework is [the Appeals Board], created by \u00a7 15-205. With an exception not relevant here, \u00a7 15-211 gives that agency jurisdiction to hear and decide \u201call appeals\u201d arising from the final action of a State agency on \u201ca contract claim\u201d concerning the breach, performance, modification, or termination of a procurement contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">We have long held, and have recently confirmed, that \u201c[w]here an administrative agency has primary or exclusive jurisdiction over a controversy, the parties to the controversy must ordinarily await a final administrative decision before resorting to the courts for resolution of the controversy.\u201d <em>State v.

Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007) (internal quotations omitted). A \u201cperson\u201d in Section 15-217 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the State Finance and Procurement Article, is defined in Section 11-101 of the same Article as \u201can individual, receiver, trustee, guardian, personal representative, fiduciary, or representative of any kind and any partnership, firm, association, corporation, or other entity.\u201d Clearly, the language of \u201creceiver, trustee, guardian, personal representative, fiduciary, or representative of any kind\u201d does not include only the person awarded the procurement contract, but third parties representing the interests of the contracting party. A \u201creceiver,\u201d furthermore, is defined as a \u201cdisinterested person appointed by a court, or by a corporation or other person, for the protection or collection of property that is the subject of diverse claims,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1296 (8th ed.2004). Obviously, then, a third-party who serves some of the same functions of a receiver, by collecting property due to another, must also be accommodated by the statutory definition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>A unit or a person who has been awarded a procurement contract may submit a contract claim to the procurement officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>We recognized that the rights of an assignee are concomitant to those of an assignor in <em>James v. Goldberg, </em>256 Md. 520, 527, 261 A.2d 753, 757 (1970), wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">An unqualified assignment generally operates to transfer to the assignee all of the right, title and interest of the assignor in the subject of the assignment and does not confer upon the assignee any greater right than the right possessed by the assignor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">More recently, in <em>Jones v. Hyatt Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>356 Md. 639, 653 n. 8, 741 A.2d 1099, 1106 n. 8 (1999), we also recognized that assignees are \u201cbound to the same limitations period as their assignor.\u201d Our conclusion, furthermore, that a \u201cperson who has been awarded a procurement contract\u201d or \u201ccontractor\u201d includes the assignees of contractual rights, is buttressed by Section 9-404(a) of the Commercial Law Article, which provides that \u201cthe rights of an assignee are subject to\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">(1) <em>All </em>terms of the agreement between the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising from the transaction that gave rise to the contract; and</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">(2) Any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ceives a notification of the assignment authenticated by the assignor or the assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">If an assignee is subject to all terms of the agreement between the assignor and the account debtor, including the burden of complying with the same limitations period as the assignor, they surely also must be subject to any condition precedent to the invocation of judicial remedies to which the assignor would be subject. Exhaustion of administrative remedies, in the present case, is such a condition precedent, and without satisfying such a condition \u201cthe action itself is fatally flawed.\u201d <em>Rios v. Montgomery County, </em>386 Md. 104, 127, 872 A.2d 1, 14 (2005). To hold otherwise would provide the Mooneys with greater rights than Chesapeake, which we will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The Mooneys, nevertheless, also point to <em>University of Maryland v. MFE Incorporated / NCP Architects, Inc., </em>345 Md. 86, 691 A.2d 676 (1997), to support their assertion that only the primary contractor is required to comply with the administrative remedy governing procurement contract disputes. To the contrary, in that case, we held only that the State did not have the opportunity to utilize the administrative remedies under Section 15-217 of the State Finance and Procurement Article by appealing a unit decision against the Board of Appeals. We noted that \u201cthe omission to authorize contract claims by a State unit is significant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 345 Md. at 93, 691 A.2d at 679, and since that time the Legislature has responded by amending Section 15-217(a)(2) of the State Finance and Procurement Article to allow a State unit to submit a contract claim to the procurement officer. <em>See </em>2004 Maryland Laws, Chapter 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Where, as here, an administrative remedy is primary, so that exhaustion of administrative remedies must occur prior to seeking judicial relief, we have suggested that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">[A disputant] first must file a complaint with [the administrative agency] and then may decide to file an independent judicial action. Thereafter, the trial court must stay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>independent judicial action upon the request of either party until after final resolution of the administrative proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZSI\"><em>Bell Atlantic, </em>366 Md. at 27, 782 A.2d at 806-07. <em>See also Arroyo v.

If there was any doubt about whether to proceed administratively or through the courts, the Mooneys could have filed their claim administratively and judicially; the circuit court action then could have been stayed pending the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In their complaint, the Mooneys alleged that the University was in breach under 9-405 of the State Finance and Procurement Article when it issued the check to Chesapeake on April 22, 2003. The Mooneys could have protested this denial of their claim to the Appeals Board within 30 days after April 22, 2003, within the meaning of Section 15-220 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, but chose not to do so, instead attempting to invoke judicial remedies. Because we have recognized that the exhaustion of administrative remedies is a condition precedent to the right to sue, we affirm the dismissal of the Mooneys complaint in the Circuit Court, rather than remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\">.

While I agree with the majority that \u201c[a] \u2018person\u2019 in Section 15-217 of the State Finance and Procurement Article ... does not include only the person awarded the procurement contract, but third parties representing the interests of the contracting party[,]\u201d I do not agree that Respondents should be included in the definition of \u201cperson\u201d on the ground that they are involved in the process of \u201ccollecting property due to another[.]\u201d Because Respondents are not \u201crepresenting the interests of the contracting party,\u201d and are not attempting to collect funds that Petitioner had withheld from Chesapeake, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and order that this case be returned to the Circuit Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the March 3, 2008 opinion of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
