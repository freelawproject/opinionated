DeLeon contends that his trial was prejudiced by the admission of evidence that he was associated with the \u201cBloods\u201d gang. He asserts that \u201c[ejvidence of gang membership and activity was not relevant to the facts of [DeLeonj\u2019s case, was highly prejudicial, and was admitted without sufficient factual basis or nexus to the crimes as alleged.\u201d This prejudice, he argues, arises from the risk that jury members will be influenced to convict him because gangs invoke images of violent criminal activity. We agree with the State\u2019s contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>DeLeon failed to argue relevance or prejudice at trial about the evidence he now challenges and, accordingly, we will not consider those issues. DeLeon\u2019s remaining arguments for disallowing gang evidence are limited in scope, and do not reveal trial court error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">This case arises from a violent prison brawl that broke out at the Jessup Pre-Release Unit (\u201cJPRU\u201d) of the Maryland DOC on June 30, 2006. The animosities giving rise to this altercation began a few months earlier at the Brockbridge Correctional Facility where Yusef Payne and victim Troy Fennel were both serving prison terms. Fennel testified that a dispute over a pair of tennis shoes led Payne to stab him in the head and assault him with a chair in the winter of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">This incident prompted Fennel\u2019s transfer to the Central Laundry prison facility. On June 30, 2006, Central Laundry inmate and alleged \u201cBloods\u201d gang member Maurice Brown threatened Fennel because he \u201ctold on one of [Brown\u2019s] friends.\u201d This resulted in Fennel\u2019s same-day transfer to the JPRU where, in a stroke of ill luck, Payne was also incarcerated. Within ten minutes after Fennel arrived at his dormitory, petitioner Ayinde DeLeon approached him, asked why he \u201ctold on\u201d his friends, and punched him in the face. Also present was Payne, who attempted to stab Fennel before he ran away in search of help.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Fennel was unable to find someone to come to his aid and less than 45 minutes later, he was approached in his dormitory by yet another knife-brandishing inmate, Clister King. Fennel retreated from King and was then assaulted by DeLeon and Payne as he attempted to jump over the wall to safety. DeLeon stabbed Fennel in the back of his head and all three inmates worked in tandem, stabbing him all over his body. Payne stabbed Fennel in the eye, told the other two to get out of the way, and repeated the words \u201ckill him, kill him, kill him.\u201d Correctional Officer Qwan Finch heard someone calling from Fennel\u2019s dorm, entered, and saw two individuals assault<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ing Fennel. Officer E. Davis came to Fennel\u2019s aid and DeLeon, who had run away, was soon placed in handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">DeLeon was charged with attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and conspiracy to commit first degree murder. His trial commenced November 20, 2007 in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The State\u2019s trial theme was that the close organizational ties between DeLeon, King, and Payne served as the motive for a revenge killing. The jury heard testimony that identified DeLeon, King, and Payne as prison comrades who frequently donned red clothing and accouterments, a color associated with the \u201cBloods\u201d gang. Responding Officer E. Davis testified that when she discovered Fennel in a pool of blood, Fennel said that the \u201cBloods did it to me. DeLeon, Payne, and King.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">After a four-day trial, the jury delivered a verdict of guilty of first-degree assault and conspiracy to commit first degree murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DeLeon timely appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari on our own initiative before the intermediate appellate court decided the appeal to consider the following question: \u201cDid the lower court err in allowing the admission of evidence of gang membership, association, and activity against [DeLeon]?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">\n<em>Standard Of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The determination of whether evidence is relevant is a matter of law, to be reviewed <em>de novo </em>by an appellate court. <em>See J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning, </em>368 Md. 71, 92, 792 A.2d 288, 300 (2002)(\u201c[W]hen the trial judge\u2019s ruling [on the admissibility of evidence] involves a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>legal question, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>When evidence is relevant, this Court grants wide latitude to trial judges\u2019 decisions on its admissibility. <em>See Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404-05, 697 A.2d 432, 439 (1997)(\u201cOnce a finding of relevancy has been made, we are generally loath to reverse a trial court unless the evidence is plainly inadmissible under a specific rule or principle of law or there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d). A ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling. <em>Evans v. State, </em>396 Md. 256, 277, 914 A.2d 25, 37 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 65, 169 L.Ed.2d 53 (2007). To constitute an abuse of discretion, the decision \u201chas to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Preservation Of DeLeon\u2019s Relevancy And Prejudice Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u201c[A]n appellate court ordinarily will not consider any point or question \u2018unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 216, 946 A.2d 456, 461 (2008) (citations omitted). In <em>Fitzgerald v. State, </em>we explained that the primary purpose of the rule is two-fold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">(a) to require counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings, and (b) to prevent the trial of cases in a piecemeal fashion, thus accelerating the termination of litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">384 Md. 484, 505, 864 A.2d 1006, 1018 (2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In discussing the preservation issue, we shall address each of the contested pieces of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>gang-related evidence presented at trial and examine the objections made by DeLeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>The Bloods Did It To Me</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The first piece of gang evidence was offered when the State asked Prison Officer E. Davis about what the victim told her when she found him. DeLeon immediately offered the following objections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">[Defense Counsel]: What the State is trying to get at is I guess an excited utterance with reference to this. I have a couple of objections. One, the victim is going to be testifying\u2014testify [sic] what he said or didn\u2019t say at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">Secondly, there is some reference to gangs which\u2014carefully. \u2014tip-toe around to it. And I don\u2019t know if he is going to be saying something about the Bloods did this to me, which has been provided\u2014I would be objecting to his reference to that. And thirdly, I don\u2019t think you can set a foundation for excited utterance by other hearsay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">This objection led to a colloquy in which defense counsel furnished additional grounds for his objection<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the prosecutor defended her line of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG\">[Prosecutor]: Well that is not true. An excited utterance shows that the person doesn\u2019t have time to reflect, that they are saying things in the throes of the emotional environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">He is upset. He thinks he is dying. He is asking for help---- [I]t\u2019s something that the courts have found is reliable because a person doesn\u2019t have time to sit back and make something up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">Also he is going to tell who has assaulted him. And the gang evidence in the case that I have <em>[Ayala v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 647, 923 A.2d 952, <em>cert. denied, </em>401 Md. 173, 931 A.2d 1095 (2007) ] says that gang evidence is admissible, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>to show that someone is a bad person, but to show motive for the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">The reason why an otherwise unthinkable crime has occurred is because the gang evidence says you can use it to show why people are acting together. Why they were acting to attack somebody. In this case we are saying between four to five people attacked this man simply because they were a member of a gang.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">[Defense Counsel]: If you are going to get into gangs you have to show in that case a basis of knowledge. You can\u2019t just say that it is a gang, you have to say why he would know that it is a gang. That is why it would be\u2014through her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">It may be that they can set the foundation through the victim as to how he knows Mr. DeLeon. But to get to bring it in through her, then you avoid the basis of that case and that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">[Prosecutor]: But the reason I am bringing in what he says is not to prove that this person is a member of a gang. I haven\u2019t gotten there yet. I am bringing in the excited utterance that the victim was saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">[Court]: ____It could be an excited utterance. \u2014certainly to have been stabbed multiple times\u2014I mean how much more excited can you get.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">[Defense Counsel]: Well I think once they lay that foundation that probably is an excited utterance. What she was laying a foundation was saying what did he say. And you can\u2019t say what did he say to clear the excited utterance about something like that. You can\u2019t use the hearsay to create the exception to the hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Now secondly, it is the gang point that I object to because that is the reliability and basis of knowledge. We have no understanding\u2014we have no basis of why he is saying it\u2019s the Bloods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">I think she probably could\u2014if he tells her who the people are when she sets the foundation of the excited utterance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">[Court]: I don\u2019t think it is necessarily being offered for the purpose of even showing that the Bloods are a gang. It is an identification issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">[Defense Counsel]: I will raise the objection without interrupting[.][<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The State then offered testimony to support its contention that Fennel made a spontaneous excited utterance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">[Prosecutor]: Was he calm as he said this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">[Davis]: No, he was like yelling at us. Help, help, help, I\u2019m in pain, I\u2019m in pain. My eye, my eye. Help, help, somebody help.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Officer Davis\u2019s most damning testimony followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahm\">[Prosecutor]: What did he say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-13\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection for reasons at the Bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-14\">[Court]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-15\">[Davis]: He said I\u2019m going to tell you all who did it because if I die, I want you all to know who did this to me. And he was like the Bloods did it to me. DeLeon, Payne and King. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-16\">The parties disagree about the nature of DeLeon\u2019s objection expressed during this colloquy. Under Maryland Rule 4-323(a), \u201cThe grounds for the objection need not be stated unless the court, at the request of a party or on its own initiative, so directs.\u201d Thus, a party basing an appeal on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201cgeneral\u201d objection to admission of certain evidence, may argue <em>any </em>ground against its inadmissibility. <em>Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 475-76, 924 A.2d 1112, 1122-23 (2007). DeLeon contends that his objection to Officer Davis\u2019 testimony qualifies as a \u201cgeneral\u201d one, and thus preserves his appellate arguments that the gang membership evidence was not relevant, and was highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The flaw in DeLeon\u2019s theory is revealed by examination of his trial objections, which went too far to be a general objection and not far enough to preserve his arguments on appeal. An objection loses its status as a \u201cgeneral\u201d one \u201cwhere a rule requires the ground to be stated, where the trial court requests that the ground be stated, and <em>\u2018where the objector, although not requested by the court, voluntarily offers specific reasons for objecting to certain evidence </em>[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476, 924 A.2d at 1123 (citations omitted, emphasis added). As demonstrated by the transcript passage above, counsel chose a more forceful approach than merely offering a general objection and instead advanced several reasons to support DeLeon\u2019s objection to Davis\u2019 recounting of the victim\u2019s incriminating declaration. Thus, the objection was not a \u201cgeneral objection\u201d under the rule stated in <em>Boyd </em>and, accordingly, DeLeon is limited to the grounds explicitly raised in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">DeLeon asserts that his relevancy objection <em>was </em>raised below; not by him, but by the State, when the prosecutor offered <em>Ayala v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 647, 923 A.2d 952, <em>cert. denied, </em>401 Md. 173, 931 A.2d 1095 (2007) as a case supporting admission. After DeLeon made a foundation objection to the State\u2019s question about DeLeon belonging to the Bloods, the prosecutor cited <em>Ayala </em>to rebut the objection, saying, \u201c[T]he case I have says that gang evidence is admissible, not to show that someone is a bad person, but to show the motive for the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In <em>Ayala, </em>the Court of Special Appeals considered whether testimony of gang involvement was prohibited because it was introduced to show bad character or prior bad acts in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of Maryland Rule 5-404(b). The court concluded that evidence of Ayala\u2019s gang membership was highly probative as to his motive to kill the victim, who was a member of a rival gang, and was not unduly prejudicial. <em>Ayala, </em>174 Md.App. at 664, 923 A.2d at 962. We do not consider the State\u2019s mention of <em>Ayala </em>sufficient to preserve DeLeon\u2019s appellate objection that the gang evidence was prejudicial and not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The colloquy between the court and counsel set forth above reveals that the thrust of DeLeon\u2019s objection was that the State needed to submit evidence that he was a gang member, before they introduced the victim\u2019s statement that \u201cthe Bloods did it to me.\u201d He even characterized it as a \u201cfoundation\u201d objection. He did not argue, as he does here, that <em>any </em>gang evidence was prejudicial because it conjured up criminal violence in the jury\u2019s mind. The trial court was necessarily focused on the grounds for DeLeon\u2019s objection, and not on whether mention of the Bloods was \u201cbad character\u201d evidence or whether the jury would be unduly influenced to convict because they have negative associations with the Bloods or gangs in general. The essence of the preservation rule is that the trial court must have an opportunity to consider the issue, and rule on it first, in the context of the trial. It cannot be expected to do so just because the State cites a case that would support opposition to an objection never made.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Accordingly, DeLeon\u2019s arguments in this appeal against admissibility of the victim\u2019s incriminating declaration are limited to those stated in the trial court: reliability and basis of knowledge. We turn to these arguments now.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Reliability And Basis Of Knowledge Challenge To \u201cThe Bloods did it to me\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">DeLeon argues that there was an insufficient foundation for the question that elicited Officer Davis\u2019 statement \u201cthe Bloods did it to me.\u201d In the words of his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">Even if this Court theoretically assumes that gang evidence was relevant to the State\u2019s case, the evidence none<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>theless lacked a proper foundation or factual basis, and should have been excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration. The only evidence produced by the State was lay opinion testimony from various prison guards that the wearing of red indicates \u201cBlood\u201d membership, and that [DeLeon] had been seen wearing red in the past. In <em>Ayala, </em>the State\u2019s evidence began primarily with the admission by the Defendant that he was a member of MS-13. This admission was corroborated by testimony that police officers had seized photographs of the Defendant showing gang signs, wearing gang colors, and possessing gang tattoos. This evidence was then interpreted by expert testimony from a member of the police department trained and experienced in gang recognition. In the instant case, [DeLeon] denied membership in any gang. No witnesses were called who could positively identify [DeLeon] as a gang member. No witness identified any of [DeLeon]\u2019s associates as gang members. The State introduced no evidence of gang tattoos, seized clothing or photographs relating to [DeLeon]----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">Absent any such factual basis, the trial judge erred in allowing the State to continuously question witnesses and introduce testimony regarding the alleged gang membership of [DeLeon]. (Emphasis added, citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">As this argument is somewhat murky, Judge Battaglia sought clarification during oral argument. Defense counsel answered with an evolving explanation of how a better foundation could have been laid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">[Judge Battaglia]: Take us through that. You have the excited utterance that \u201cThe Bloods did it to me.\u201d What would be the foundation that would have to be laid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">[Defense Counsel]: They would have to go into his basis of knowledge of how he knows this person is a Blood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">[Judge Battaglia]: Okay ... It\u2019s a hearsay situation. [I]t\u2019s entered through ... the corrections officer. What would be the next question that would lay the foundation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">[Defense Counsel]: I think prior to that they would have to establish that this individual is a Blood for it to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>relevant to this individual\u2019s case: \u201cThe Bloods did this to me.\u201d He\u2019s charged with the crime. The officer can certainly identify somebody as a member of the Bloods, like they did in <em>Ayala, </em>with evidence that he\u2019s a member of a gang. The officer can do it. The victim can do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">[Judge Battaglia]: So ... before the officer would testify then of the excited utterance by the victim, he would have to testify that he knew the defendant was a member of the Bloods ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">[Defense Counsel]: Or contemporaneous with it. If they\u2019re unable to do it subsequent thereto, then it should be stricken out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">[Judge Battaglia]: The officer would have to do that before he could testify about the excited utterance of the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Well, I think you can allow it subject to later proper foundation. I don\u2019t think it has to be that contemporaneous. Maybe the victim testifies later and it comes in through the victim that he is able to say he\u2019s a Blood. Maybe they\u2019re able to. establish the gang through an officer, but there was no establishment whatsoever in this .case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">[Judge Battaglia]: So ... they ask about the excited utterance. What happens next? And ... Mr. Fennel says \u201cthe Bloods did it to me.\u201d What happens next? Is it admitted? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">[Defense Counsel]: Admitted conditionally. It could be admitted subject to\u2014the proper objections are raised\u2014it could have been admitted subject to proper foundation being laid. Subject to this becoming relevant. If the state says\u2014and they argued <em>Ayala </em>right off the bat\u2014this is relevant to motive ... in this case. <em>Ayala </em>says we can do it. If the state says that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, then they have to be able to do it. But he didn\u2019t\u2014the judge just let it in. He just said \u201cwell, you know\u201d he spoke about gangs being secretive, and he just allowed the admission of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>[Judge Battaglia]: As an excited utterance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">[Defense Counsel]: As an excited utterance, yes. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We glean from counsel\u2019s written and oral arguments that DeLeon seeks to superimpose upon the excited utterance exception a foundational requirement that simply does not exist. Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(2) defines the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule as \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d We have held that \u201c[t]he proponent of a statement purporting to fall within the excited utterance exception must establish the foundation for admissibility, namely personal knowledge and spontaneity.\u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>365 Md. 299, 313, 778 A.2d 1096, 1104 (2001)(emphasis added). The State readily met this standard when Officer Davis testified that he observed a man screaming in pain after being stabbed in the eye. We see no abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion in allowing this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Perhaps DeLeon seeks to weave an unpreserved prejudice argument (e.g. evidence that \u201cthe Bloods did it\u201d is unduly prejudicial unless it is established that DeLeon is a Blood) into the lack of foundation objection that he articulated at trial. This is not permissible because his basis for objection was simply not made sufficiently clear for the trial court to understand and rule on it. We glean from the trial court\u2019s response to DeLeon\u2019s objection\u2014\u201chow much more excited can you get\u201d\u2014that the trial court perceived the objection to be that insufficient foundation was laid to introduce an \u201cexcited utterance.\u201d This was a reasonable interpretation of defense counsel\u2019s objection, and the court\u2019s ruling did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Additionally, the court said that it did not \u201cthink it is necessarily being offered for the purpose of even showing that the Bloods are a gang. It is an identification issue.\u201d This response suggests that the court was still focusing on defense counsel\u2019s argument that the State had to show DeLeon was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Blood as a foundation to admitting the victim\u2019s statement. The court was saying, in essence, that there was no need to show DeLeon was a Blood, when the victim\u2019s statement was introduced merely to show identification of the men who assaulted the victim. Although reference to the \u201cBloods\u201d may not have been necessary in order to identify them because the victim named his three assaulters, clearly the trial court was focused on DeLeon\u2019s argument that a better foundation must be laid, not on whether mention of the Bloods was either relevant or unduly prejudicial, as DeLeon seeks to argue here. These latter two arguments were not raised by DeLeon, or ruled upon by the court, and are waived for purposes of appeal. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a)(\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>Other Gang Evidence Introduced By The State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">DeLeon also argues irrelevancy and prejudice arising from other gang evidence introduced by the State at trial. In the words of his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">The State repeatedly argued at trial that the gang association helped to show commonality between [DeLeon] and his co-defendants, Mr. Payne and Mr. King. Even if such commonality was relevant to an issue in the case, the State could have easily demonstrated it without mentioning gangs. Multiple witnesses testified for the State that [DeLeon] and Mr. Payne and King were always together. [DeLeon] himself admitted that he was friends with both individuals, played basketball on the same team, and was often associating with them in public. The additional information that all three wore red and were suspected gang members provided no additional probative value to the issue of commonality. The admission of such evidence merely served to prejudice the jury due to the violent reputation of gangs in general and of \u201cthe Bloods\u201d in particular.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Again, though, DeLeon failed to make timely objections to this testimony. As the State points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>DeLeon raised no objection to Correctional Officer Davis\u2019s testimony that she saw DeLeon together with Yusef Payne and Clister King on a daily basis, in the cafeteria and out in the yard. There was no objection to Officer Davis\u2019s testimony that the group wore red clothing or bandanas every day and that, based on her personal experience, wearing red in prison signified membership in the Bloods gang. Likewise, there was no objection to Lieutenant Perez\u2019s testimony that the Bloods operated within the Maryland prison system, that the Bloods\u2019 signature color was red, and that inmates generally were allowed to wear their \u201ccolors\u201d in the yard so that the staff would know \u201cwho they are and where they\u2019re at.\u201d Nor was there any objection to Lieutenant Perez\u2019s testimony that he had seen DeLeon, Payne and King wearing red at JPRU, thereby \u201cshowing their colors.\u201d (Record citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We agree with the State\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[b]ecause DeLeon lodged no objection to this evidence at trial, any appellate complaint about the admission of the evidence has been waived.\u201d Objections are waived if, at another point during the trial, evidence on the same point is admitted without objection. <em>Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 145-46, 202 A.2d 585, 590 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 1001, 85 S.Ct. 721, 13 L.Ed.2d 702 (1965). DeLeon made no objection when Officer Davis testified that:</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u2022 DeLeon associated with King and Payne;</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u2022 DeLeon, King, and Payne wore red; and</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u2022 DeLeon, King, and Payne wore red, sat together in the cafeteria, and congregated in the yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">DeLeon also remained silent when Officer Perez testified that:</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">\u2022 There are gangs at the Maryland DOC;</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">\u2022 He was familiar with gang signs and clothing;</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">\u2022 The Bloods wore red and red clothing, which assisted prison officials in identifying gangs; and</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u2022 He saw DeLeon and other men in his group wearing red colors at JPU.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">DeLeon\u2019s counsel did not object when, on cross-examination, DeLeon was asked about, and denied:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u2022 Wearing red bandanas and articles of clothing;</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u2022 Seeing anyone wear a red hat, though acknowledging seeing people wear bandanas; and</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u2022 Being in a gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">DeLeon also testified, without objection, that there were Bloods in the Maryland DOC and that red was one of their colors. The admission of all of this evidence without objection disallows DeLeon\u2019s challenges to any evidence of his association with Kang and Payne, DeLeon\u2019s use of the color red, and the implications of the color red.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">When Davis testified that DeLeon\u2019s prison associates were members of the Bloods, DeLeon asserted the highly prejudicial nature of being labeled as a member of a gang and his objection was sustained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">[Prosecutor]: The men that you have described, other than Mr. DeLeon, did they have a reputation in the prison of being members of the Bloods?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-12\">[Officer Davis]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-13\">[Defense Counsel]: I would object to that. Reputation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">H* H\u00bb \u00abS\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-15\">[Defense Counsel]: Being labeled as a Blood member of a gang is highly prejudicial. So it is only going to be able to come in under\u2014circumstances [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-16\">Counsel is arguing that is the motive behind this that she may or may not be able to get out from the victim. But to have this witness testify based upon her expertise and\u2014 therefore he is a member of the Bloods would be so prejudicial that, in my opinion, it could cause a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-17\">As a result of this objection, the court limited Davis to her observations that may \u201csuggest\u201d gang membership. This led to further discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>[Defense Counsel]: If she was coming forward with a card that says I\u2019m a member of the Bloods or that he made an acknowledgment that he is in the Bloods, I would have no legitimate objection. Other than that I think I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">[Prosecutor]: But these are secretive groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">[Court]: \u2014their cards are worn around their head and the bands [sic]. And I think that you are free\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">[Prosecutor]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">[Court]: I mean based on\u2014 [inaudible] so far.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">[Prosecutor]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">[Court]: You are free to\u2014 [inaudible] facts that suggest that she has made observations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">[Prosecutor]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">[Court]: Or heard things from him or there are other ways that she can\u2014that might tend to get to where you want to go in terms of membership. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5S\">DeLeon did not argue at trial that the ensuing testimony\u2014 limited by the trial court to personal observations\u2014was inadmissible. Because this testimony was admitted without objection, it is unpreserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED.
