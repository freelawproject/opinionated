(\u201c120 West Fayette\u201d), seeking a declaratory judgment, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore et al. (\u201cthe City\u201d). The complaint alleged that the City violated its Charter and laws by entering into an illegal Land Disposition Agreement (\u201cLDA\u201d) with an entity seeking to purchase and develop an area in Baltimore\u2019s west-side, known as the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d The City made a motion to dismiss the complaint and the Circuit Court granted that motion. We shall hold that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that 120 West Fayette lacked standing and erred in failing to render a declaratory judgment. We shall also hold that the Circuit Court did not comply with Maryland Rule 2-322 in treating the City\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court did not provide all parties a reasonable opportunity to present material pertinent to the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">In 1999, the Baltimore City Council enacted an urban renewal plan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the westside of downtown Baltimore. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>renewal plan, known as the \u201cMarket Center Urban Renewal Plan,\u201d has been advertised as Baltimore\u2019s largest urban renewal plan since the plan to revitalize the city\u2019s Inner Harbor. To implement the plan, the Baltimore Board of Estimates (\u201cBOE\u201d) delegated \u201cministerial and administrative\u201d functions to a nonprofit corporation known as the Baltimore Development Corporation, Inc. (\u201cBDC\u201d). The City asserts that it instructed the BDC to \u201cwork with developers and interested groups regarding the development of the westside, prepare and issue requests for development proposals, arrange and attend meetings between developers and business owners, and coordinate financial assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">On October 27, 2003, the BDC issued a Request for Proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d) that invited developers to submit proposals for developing the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d The \u201cSuperblock\u201d encompasses five blocks and is bound by Fayette Street, Howard Street, Lexington Street, Clay Street, and Park Avenue. The RFP provided for use of an Exclusive Negotiating Privilege (\u201cENP\u201d) that would aid the City to \u201c[set] out specific requirements and deadlines for fulfilling said requirements of [the] RFP.\u201d Four entities, including Next Generation Chera, LLC (\u201cNext Generation\u201d), responded to the RFP and on June 24, 2005, the BDC offered an ENP to an affiliate of Next Generation, known as Lexington Square Partners, LLC (\u201cLexington Square\u201d). Ultimately, the City and Lexington Square entered into a LDA, that provided for the sale and subsequent development of the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">120 West Fayette is an entity that pays taxes in Baltimore City. It is located adjacent to the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d As a taxpayer and neighboring landowner, 120 West Fayette filed a declaratory judgment action against the City to challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>validity of the LDA on the basis that it is illegal and ultra vires. The gist of 120 West Fayette\u2019s complaint was that the City, and its agent, the BDC, unlawfully violated and manipulated the RFP process, in violation of the City\u2019s Charter and laws, to award the LDA to a favored developer. As previously noted, the City made a motion to dismiss 120 West Fayette\u2019s complaint, and the Circuit Court granted the City\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In a \u201cMemorandum and Opinion accompanying its Order Granting [the City\u2019s] Motion to Dismiss (\u201cMemorandum and Opinion\u201d),\u201d the Circuit Court concluded that it was appropriate to dismiss the complaint because, 120 West Fayette \u201cfailed to establish standing as a taxpayer plaintiff and failed to establish an actual or potential pecuniary loss, increase of taxes, special damages, the City\u2019s illegal expenditure of public funds or ultra vires acts in the selection of a developer for the Superblock.\u201d The Circuit Court also made the following conclusions based upon the pleadings and facts presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj0\">1) There is no expenditure of public funds in connection with the development of the Superblock, 2) the Defendant City acted according to the City\u2019s Code in authorizing the BDC to act on its behalf, 3) the Superblock is not a public work subject to the competitive bidding process outlined in the City\u2019s Charter, and 4) the Defendant City did not engage in any illegal or ultra vires acts in the LDA or ENP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4K\">120 West Fayette filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, but before that court could consider the case, we issued a writ of certiorari, <em>120 West Fayette v. Baltimore, </em>405 Md. 290, 950 A.2d 828 (2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated herein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">As a preliminary matter, we shall consider whether the Circuit Court treated the City\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. 120 West Fayette contends that the Circuit Court relied on facts outside of the pleadings to arrive at the conclusions set forth in its Memorandum and Opinion accompanying the order granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss. 120 West Fayette asserts that, in relying on matters outside of the pleadings, the Circuit Court converted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. 120 West Fayette further asserts that the court violated Maryland Rule 2-322 because the court failed to provide 120 West Fayette the opportunity it was entitled to under Maryland Rule 2-501. The City counters that all of the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusions were supported by 120 West Fayette\u2019s complaint and attached exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">When considering a motion to dismiss, a trial court is required to assume the truth of all of the well-pled facts in the complaint and attached exhibits, and the \u201creasonable inferences drawn from them, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Converge v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 475, 860 A.2d 871, 878 (2004). Maryland Rule 2-322(c) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">If, on a motion to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 2-501, and all parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 2-501.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The record reveals that the Circuit Court did rely on matters outside of the pleadings when granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss. In its Memorandum and Opinion, the Circuit Court concluded that the City had made \u201cno expenditure of public funds in connection with the development of the Superblock.\u201d The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">Upon reviewing the pleadings and facts, this Court finds that the property subject to the LDA is not a public work and was a disposition of property that did not require competitive bidding as a result of the expansion of the project. Competitive bidding is not necessary because there is no expenditure of public funds (See Plaintiffs Affidavit 4B, Paul Rashke), and the Superblock is not a public work that requires competitive bidding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In the above statement, the Circuit Court cites the affidavit of 120 West Fayette\u2019s Attorney, Paul Rashke, to support its conclusion that the City had made no expenditure of public funds. Mr. Rashke\u2019s affidavit, however, was not a part of the pleadings and yet, was considered by the court when granting the order of dismissal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Converge, </em>383 Md. at 475, 860 A.2d at 879 (noting that \u201cthe universe of facts\u201d pertinent to a motion to dismiss \u201care limited generally to the four corners of the complaint and its incorporated exhibits, if any\u201d); <em>Green v. H &amp; R Block, </em>355 Md. 488, 501, 735 A.2d 1039, 1046 (1999) (\u201cThe granting of a motion to dismiss ... depends solely on the adequacy of plaintiffs complaint.\u201d); <em>see also Young v. Medlantic Lab., </em>125 Md.App. 299, 303, 725 A.2d 572, 574 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>(1999) (\u201cIt is clearly inappropriate in the context of a motion to dismiss for the judge to make a finding of fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">By relying on material outside of the pleadings when granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Circuit Court, in effect, converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Converge, </em>383 Md. at 476, 860 A.2d at 879 (\u201cBecause the Circuit Court ... did not state, in its order of dismissal or otherwise, that, in granting the [Defendant\u2019s] motion to dismiss, it did not consider the factual allegations and exhibits beyond those in [Plaintiffs] complaint, the default provision established by the pertinent Rules and our cases interpreting them dictate that we review the action as the grant of summary judgment.\u201d); <em>Dual v. Lockheed Martin, </em>383 Md. 151, 161, 857 A.2d 1095, 1100 (2004) (holding that a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss amounted to a motion for summary judgment when the record revealed that the trial court \u201cconsidered factual matters, placed before it by the parties, beyond those alleged in the complaint or amended complaint\u201d). Although such conversion is permissible under Maryland Rule 2-322, the court failed to abide by that Rule\u2019s requirement that the court provide all parties \u201creasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent\u201d to a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Antigua v. Melba Investors, </em>307 Md. 700, 719, 517 A.2d 75, 85 (1986) (noting that when a court considers matters outside of the pleadings and thus converts a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, the court must \u201cgive [plaintiffs a reasonable opportunity to present, in a form suitable for consideration on summary judgment, <em>additional </em>pertinent material\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">120 West Fayette maintains that the facts necessary to oppose the City\u2019s motion were unavailable absent the opportunity to engage in discovery, largely due to the nonpublic procedures engaged in by the City and the BDC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 120 West Fayette urges that in order to present additional perti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>nent material below, it needed, but was denied, an opportunity to engage in discovery regarding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">(1) the nature of the BDC\u2019s authority, (2) the basis for [the City\u2019s] assertion that plans for the development \u2018always envisioned a site for parking,\u2019(3) the precise financial commitments undertaken by the City, (4) any and all efforts to include or exclude the public and adjoining property owners from the process, (5) any legal justification for the use of the ... ENP, (6) the BDC-City connections including all contracts between BDC and the City, and all City appropriations to BDC, and (7) the BDC-City connections including the evolution of entities favored for the development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ART\">Because the Circuit Court failed to provide 120 West Fayette an opportunity to present material pertinent to a ruling on a summary judgment motion, the court erred as a matter of law. <em>Cf. Johnson v. RAC Corp., </em>491 F.2d 510, 514 (4th Cir.1974) (observing that when a motions court relies on matters outside of the pleadings to convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, the court must provide the plaintiff the opportunity \u201cto employ discovery, in order to counter ... facts in the defendant\u2019s affidavit or to establish a factual basis for his action against the defendant\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, it appears that the only way the Circuit Court could determine that the City made no improper expenditure of public money in this case was to draw inferences in favor of the City. To do so was inappropriate. It is settled that summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hill v. Cross Country, </em>402 Md. 281, 294, 936 A.2d 343, 350-51 (2007). As to our appellate review, we consider the same material as the Circuit Court and view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, not the moving party. <em>See, e.g., Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 203, 892 A.2d 520, 529 (2006) (noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>when reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Maryland Rule 2-501, \u201c[w]e review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">120 West Fayette also contends that the Circuit Court nonetheless erred by dismissing its complaint for other reasons not implicated by our analysis in Part II of this decision. 120 West Fayette posits that it enjoys standing both as a taxpayer and as an owner of property that is situated in proximity to the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d In support of its contention that it has taxpayer standing, 120 West Fayette asserts that its complaint satisfied the standards established by Maryland precedent. Particularly, 120 West Fayette maintains that to establish standing under Maryland law, a taxpayer need only assert that a municipality or public official engaged in illegal or ultra vires acts and that such acts pose potential pecuniary damage or a tax increase to the taxpayer. 120 West Fayette urges that it alleged facts sufficient to satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">By contrast, the City contends that the Circuit Court correctly granted its motion to dismiss. The City alleges that 120 West Fayette lacks standing to challenge its LDA agreement because 120 West Fayette failed to allege an unlawful expenditure by the City that may reasonably result in a pecuniary loss or tax increase to 120 West Fayette. The City argues that while Maryland law provides for broad taxpayer standing, \u201ccourts have not hesitated to dismiss suits for lack of standing where, as here, the plaintiffs fail to allege any special interest or loss, different in kind from that of the general public, or where the allegations of the complaint indicate that the challenged action will not result in any increase to the plaintiffs taxes.\u201d Additionally, the City alleges that it has done nothing illegal and will make money by selling the properties that comprise the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d The City reasons that if it is making money by conveying the properties that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>comprise the \u201cSuperblock,\u201d its actions will decrease rather than increase taxpayer burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Maryland law liberally permits taxpayers to bring claims challenging alleged illegal or ultra vires acts of government officials. <em>Boitnott v. Baltimore, </em>356 Md. 226, 234, 738 A.2d 881, 885 (1999); <em>see also State v. Burning Tree Club, Inc., </em>315 Md. 254, 291, 554 A.2d 366, 385 (1989) (\u201cUnder Maryland law, the doctrine of taxpayer standing is not as narrowly limited as it is under the law of some jurisdictions.\u201d); <em>Citizens P &amp; H Ass\u2019n v. County Exec., </em>273 Md. 333, 338, 329 A.2d 681, 684 (1974) (\u201cIn this State, the courts have always maintained with jealous vigilance the restraints and limitations imposed by law upon the exercise of power by municipal and</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">other corporations____\u201d) (quoting <em>Baltimore v. Gill, </em>31 Md. 375, 394-95 (1869)); <em>Baltimore County v. Churchill, Ltd., </em>271 Md. 1, 5, 313 A.2d 829, 832 (1974)(\u201c[W]here the issues presented are of great public interest and concern, the interest necessary to sustain standing need only be slight.\u201d) (citations omitted). There remain, however, essential requirements that a taxpayer\u2019s claim must satisfy in order to establish standing. In <em>Inlet Associates v. Assateague House, </em>313 Md. 413, 440-41, 545 A.2d 1296, 1310 (1988), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">The law of Maryland on standing to sue is well articulated ---- [A] taxpayer may invoke the aid of a court of equity to restrain the action of a public official, which is illegal or ultra vires and may injuriously affect the taxpayer\u2019s rights and property. The taxpayer will be allowed such relief, however, only when some special damage is alleged and proved, or a special interest is shown distinct from that of the general public. This, ... \u201crequires a showing that the action being challenged results in a pecuniary loss or an increase in taxes.\u201d We have recognized, however, that the extent to which a taxpayer is capable of detailing the damage anticipated from an illegal and ultra vires act may be rather limited at the time the suit is initially filed. Thus, we [have] held that the taxpayer plaintiff is not required to allege facts which <em>necessarily </em>lead to the conclusion that taxes will be increased; rather, the test is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>taxpayer \u201creasonably <em>may </em>sustain a pecuniary loss or a tax increase\u201d\u2014\u201cwhether there has been a showing of <em>potential </em>pecuniary damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">It is thus clear that in order to establish taxpayer standing in Maryland, a taxpayer must allege two things: 1) an action by a municipal corporation or public official that is illegal or ultra vires, and 2) that the action may injuriously affect the taxpayer\u2019s property, meaning that it reasonably may result in a pecuniary loss to the taxpayer or an increase in taxes. <em>Id.; see also Medical Waste v. Maryland, Waste, </em>327 Md. 596, 613, 612 A.2d 241, 250 n. 10 (1992) (\u201c[A] person\u2019s or an organization\u2019s status as a taxpayer entitles it to standing when the challenged statute, regulation, or government action increases or threatens to increase the taxpayer\u2019s tax burden.\u201d). Our case law illustrates how standing is achieved when these requisite allegations are made. For example, in <em>Boitnott v. Baltimore, </em>356 Md. at 226, 738 A.2d at 885, we determined that Baltimore taxpayers had standing to challenge an ordinance that amended the urban renewal plan pertaining to Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor East based upon the taxpayers\u2019 allegations that the ordinance violated the City\u2019s Charter and that the City had spent 20 million dollars in developing the Inner Harbor East area prior to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Our holding in <em>Citizens P &amp; H Ass\u2019n, </em>273 Md. at 335, 329 A.2d at 682, is also illustrative. In that case, taxpayers and property owners in Baltimore County alleged that the County sought to illegally reorganize the County Office of Planning and Zoning (\u201cthe Office\u201d). The taxpayers then asserted that the proposed reorganization could injure their property rights to the extent that, if the endeavor failed, the Office would operate inefficiently and the inefficiency could thereby result in a tax increase or cause their property to decrease in value. <em>Citizens P &amp; H Ass\u2019n, </em>273 Md. at 335-36, 329 A.2d at 683. The trial court granted the County\u2019s motion to dismiss the taxpayers\u2019 complaint for lack of standing, concluding that the taxpayers\u2019 allegations of injury were \u201cmere conclusions, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>on conjecture and speculation, without any supporting factual foundation.\u201d <em>Citizens P &amp; H Ass\u2019n, </em>273 Md. at 336, 329 A.2d at 683. This Court reversed, holding that although the taxpayers could have particularized their allegations in more detail, the allegations remained sufficient to demonstrate that the taxpayers reasonably might sustain a pecuniary loss or tax increase as a result of the County\u2019s allegedly illegal actions. <em>Citizens P &amp; H Ass\u2019n, </em>273 Md. at 344-45, 329 A.2d at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In our view, the allegations contained in 120 West Fayette\u2019s complaint are also sufficient to establish taxpayer standing as a matter of law. Like the taxpayers in <em>Boitnott </em>and <em>Citizens P &amp; H Ass\u2019n, </em>120 West Fayette pled that a municipality had engaged in illegal and ultra vires acts that could potentially cause 120 West Fayette pecuniary harm or an increase in taxes. 120 West Fayette\u2019s complaint specifically alleges that the LDA agreement is \u201cin derogation of the Charter and laws of the City.\u201d To support this contention, the complaint includes several assertions, such as: the LDA is a public works project that was illegally \u201cmassaged outside the requisite bidding process\u201d provided in Art. YI \u00a7 11 of the Baltimore City Charter; that the LDA \u201cdiffer[s] markedly\u201d and illegally from the RFP in that it \u201calter[s] and enlarge[s] the [area subject to the LDA] significantly beyond what the RFP specifically identified\u201d and grants rights to a party who did not respond to the RFP or execute the ENP; and that use of the ENP is illegal and \u201ca concept foreign to the City Charter or City Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The complaint also alleges that the City\u2019s illegal or ultra vires actions may injure 120 West Fayette as a taxpayer. Specifically, it states: \u201c[The] BDC receives more than $2 million from the City annually and the putative LDA calls for the City\u2019s taxpayers to foot more than $21 million for acquisition of properties for disposition and additional millions to bankroll relocation and the proposed undefined mixed uses to be developed.\u201d Further, it alleges that the City offered to deduct up to $10 million from the sale price of the \u201cSuper-block\u201d if Lexington Square agreed to improve the \u201cSuper-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>block\u201d properties by performing public works on or near them. The complaint indicates that this potential deduction can amount to a $10 million expenditure of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Because 120 West Fayette\u2019s complaint alleged that the City engaged in illegal and ultra vires acts and that such acts may potentially cause 120 West Fayette pecuniary harm or an increase in taxes, we hold that the allegations were sufficient to establish taxpayer standing as a matter of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore hold that the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">120 West Fayette also asserts that it has standing to bring its claim against the City because its property is located adjacent to the Superblock. It argues that the redevelopment of the properties that comprise the Superblock will cause 120 West Fayette to \u201cendure demolition and interminable chaos at its doorsteps.\u201d 120 West Fayette points out that the City\u2019s redevelopment plan indicates that 120 West Fayette will be linked to the Superblock, and that it will be directly impacted by the \u201cunspecified redevelopment\u201d and the City\u2019s \u201cfoot-drag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ging.\u201d Further, 120 West Fayette directs this Court\u2019s attention to case law, which, according to 120 West Fayette, instructs that a neighboring property owner has standing to challenge the validity of zoning ordinances that impact property located nearby that of the property owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The City rejects 120 West Fayette\u2019s assertions and posits that 120 West Fayette cannot bring suit based upon its status as an adjacent property owner. The City contends that 120 West Fayette has failed to allege that its property will be harmed or damaged by the LDA. Moreover, the City asserts than any allegation that 120 West Fayette could potentially make regarding future damage that it may endure due to the proposed conveyance is purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Alternatively, we hold that 120 West Fayette\u2019s allegations that it owned property affected by the redevelopment and located in close proximity to the Superblock constitutes sufficient standing to maintain this action in court. As to standing, the question is \u201cwhether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is <em>arguably </em>within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\u201d <em>News American v. State, </em>294 Md. 30, 40, 447 A.2d 1264, 1269 (1982) (quoting <em>Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Service Org., Inc. v.

Generally, one is deemed \u201caggrieved\u201d if he, she, or it can demonstrate that the land use decision will adversely affect his, her, or its interest, and that such interest is personal or specific, and not shared by the general public. <em>Bryniarski v.

Such property owners are granted prima facie aggrieved status due to the sheer proximity of their property to the area that is the subject of the complaint. <em>See Sugarloaf, </em>344 Md. at 298-99, 686 A.2d at 618-19 (holding that owners of a farm adjacent to the tract containing a solid waste incinerator were entitled to prima facie aggrieved status by virtue of their proximity to the incinerator and thus, had standing to bring an action for judicial review challenging the issuance of permits); <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap.

Balto. City, </em>235 Md. 74, 92, 200 A.2d 652, 661 (1964), w\u00e9 conclude that the principles that confer standing upon an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner to seek judicial review of land use decisions, logically extend to an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner that is challenging a municipalities\u2019 allegedly illegal avoidance of urban renewal and procurement ordinances. <em>Cf. Schweig v. City of St. Louis, </em>569 S.W.2d 215 (Mo.App.1978) (reasoning that since nearby property owners have standing to challenge zoning ordinances, nearby property owners also had standing to challenge the legality of a municipal redevelopment project since the owners could have suffered harm if the project was mismanaged or not completed). 120 West Fayette\u2019s property is located in close proximity to the urban renewal area and is adjacent to the properties that comprise the Superblock. By virtue of its location, 120 West Fayette will be linked to such properties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Because, 120 West Fayette has alleged that it will be able to both see and hear the allegedly illegal redevelopment of these properties from its doorsteps, it follows that 120 West Fayette will be directly impacted by and has a direct interest in the redevelopment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The City provided no persuasive evidence or argument indicating that 120 West would not be impacted. Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court also erred in its determination that 120 West Fayette lacked property owner standing. The facts alleged by 120 West Fayette support its standing to bring its claim by virtue of its status as a property owner adjacent to the Superblock.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Because the Circuit Court erred in granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis that 120 West Fayette lacked standing, we conclude that it also erred in failing to provide a declaratory judgment pursuant to 120 West Fayette\u2019s request. This Court has consistently reiterated that, \u201c[w]hen a declaratory judgment action is brought, and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, the trial court must render a declaratory judgment.\u201d <em>Union United Methodist v. Burton, </em>404 Md. 542, 550, 948 A.2d 1, 6 (2008) (quoting <em>Harford Mutual v. Woodfin, </em>344 Md. 399, 414-15, 687 A.2d 652, 659 (1997)). We have explained that \u201cwhether a declaratory action is decided for or against the plaintiff, there should be a declaration in the judgment or decree defining the rights of the parties under the issues made.\u201d <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 608, 937 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>A.2d 242, 254 (2007) (quoting <em>Case v. Comptroller, </em>219 Md. 282, 288, 149 A.2d 6, 9 (1959)). The matter before us was appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment. <em>See Secure Financial v. Popular Leasing, </em>391 Md. 274, 280-81, 892 A.2d 571, 575 (2006) (noting that a justiciable controversy is a pre-requisite to a declaratory judgment).

CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">HARRELL, J. joins in the judgment and parts I, II, III and V only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\">. The Baltimore City Code defines an \"urban renewal plan\u201d as a plan \"for the elimination, correction, or the prevention of the development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>or the spread of slums, blight, or deterioration in an entire Renewal Area or a portion thereof.\u201d Art. 13 (\"Housing and Urban Renewal\u201d), \u00a7 2.5(b)(1). A \"Renewal Area\u201d is defined as an \"area within the boundary lines of the City of Baltimore which may be benefitted through the exercise of functions and powers vested in the Department of Housing and Community Development____\u201d Baltimore City Code, Art. 13, \u00a7 2.4(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\">. The certiorari petition presents the following questions for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">1. Does Petitioner [120 West Fayette], a taxpayer located across the street from a vast, costly renewal project, have standing to challenge the legality of the project?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">2. When the renewal project was wholly negotiated behind closed doors over a 38 month period by Baltimore Development Corporation so that a RFP for redevelopment of the so-called Superblock was transformed by materially changing the area for renewal by a development entity different from the original bidder, did the City violate the City Charter provisions dealing with procurement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>public works, and skirt legislatively prescribed provisions for urban renewal, so that the disposition was illegal and ultra vires?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">3. Just how far can Defendants [the City] range beyond the Complaint's well-pled facts when they merely file jointly a Motion to Dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">. Moreover, the affidavit does not stand for the proposition for which the court cites it. The affidavit simply asserts that \"[t]hough styled as a Motion to Dismiss, [the City\u2019s] motion adverts to numerous factual matters for which [120 West Fayette] will need discovery to fully respond\u201d and that the City\u2019s assertion that \"it is not spending money related to the Westside Development and LDA\" is \"peculiarly within [the City\u2019s] knowledge.\u201d The affidavit in no way alleges that the City\u2019s assertions are undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">. For background on the relationship between BDC and the City, <em>see Baltimore Development v. Carmel Realty, </em>395 Md. 299, 308-14, 910 A.2d 406, 411-15 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-5\">. Maryland\u2019s summary judgment rule is similar to its federal counterpart and this Court has held that interpretations of the federal rule are persuasive when interpreting Maryland\u2019s rule. <em>Metropolitan Mtg. Fd. v. Basiliko, </em>288 Md. 25, 27, 415 A.2d 582, 583 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. The City presents no authority which leads us to a converse conclusion. The City relies primarily on <em>Kerpelman v. Bd. of Public Works, </em>261 Md. 436, 276 A.2d 56 (1971); <em>Stovall v. Secretary of State, </em>252 Md. 258, 250 A.2d 107 (1969); and <em>Carroll Pk. v. Board, Frederick Co., </em>50 Md.App. 319, 437 A.2d 689 (Md.App. 1981). These cases merely echo the aforementioned requirement that, to establish standing, a taxpayer must allege an unlawful or illegal action that may reasonably result in a pecuniary loss or a tax increase. In <em>Kerpelman, </em>the Court held that a taxpayer lacked standing because the taxpayer\u2019s complaint did not allege any pecuniary injury or potential increase in taxes. 261 Md. at 443, 276 A.2d at 60. Similarly, in <em>Stovall, </em>we determined that taxpayers\u2019 claim failed for lack of standing because the taxpayers did not attempt to allege an \"illegal expenditure of tax-derived funds resulting in either pecuniary loss to them or an increase in their taxes.\u201d 252 Md. at 262, 250 A.2d at 109. <em>Carroll Park </em>stands for the same proposition. In that case, the intermediate appellate court concluded that taxpayers lacked standing because their complaint included only allegations that demonstrated concern for the poor and did not allege that the taxpayers may sustain a pecuniary loss or tax increase. <em>Carroll Park, </em>50 Md.App. at 325, 437 A.2d at 693.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b301-5\">. Zoning and land use provisions are not completely \u201csynonymous and co-terminous,\u201d but they are closely related, as \u201czoning is a form of land use regulation.\u201d <em>Master Royalties v. Balto. City, </em>235 Md. 74, 92, 200 A.2d 652, 661 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">.

It states: \"If the past is a prologue, [120 West Fayette] will be subjected to yet more delay while the redevelopment originally promised by the City in 2000 fails to materialize.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
