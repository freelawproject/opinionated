We shall hold that the Court of Special Appeals did not err in declaring that Christopher Carl Sullivan did not have a general privilege to drive a motor vehicle in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. Sullivan was driving on a highway in Montgomery County on the evening of August 31, 2006. Along the way, Sullivan was stopped by Montgomery County Police Officer, Darrell Furdock. Officer Furdock approached the vehicle that Sullivan was driving and requested that Sullivan produce his driver\u2019s license and registration. Sullivan responded that he had no license or registration and thus, could not produce the items. After a series of impertinent exchanges and events, Officer Furdock issued Sullivan multiple citations and had the car that he was driving towed. One of the citations that Sullivan received was for driving while his license or privilege to drive was revoked in violation of Md.Code (1977, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-303(d) of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Sullivan is not licensed to drive in Maryland and there is no evidence that Sullivan has ever been licensed to drive here or in any other state. Moreover, there is no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Sullivan is authorized to drive pursuant to a statutory exemption from the license requirement, as set forth in Md.Code (1977, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-102 of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Sullivan does not have a Maryland driver\u2019s license, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>he has received several traffic citations. Additionally, the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) has a record for Sullivan which associates Sullivan with an \u201cOLN\u201d number.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under this \u201cOLN\u201d number, Sullivan\u2019s \u201clicense status\u201d is \u201crevoked &amp; suspended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">At his trial, Sullivan argued that he was wrongfully charged under \u00a7 16-303 of the Transportation Article. He contended that he could not be charged with driving while his license or privilege to drive was revoked, because he never had a license or privilege to drive. Sullivan maintained that rather than being charged for driving with a revoked license -or privilege pursuant to \u00a7 16-303, he should have been charged with driving without a license in violation of Md.Code (1977, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 16-101 of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The Circuit Court for Montgomery County rejected Sullivan\u2019s arguments, concluding that Sullivan was guilty of driving while his privilege to drive in Maryland was revoked. The court reasoned that a privilege is different from a license in that it is \u201cpresumptive.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">[T]he right to drive, it\u2019s a privilege, it\u2019s a privilege to drive, it\u2019s not a card you carry in your pocket.... I think, in a lot of these statutes and lot of the cases they distinguish between the privilege to drive and the license to drive ... and it seems to me that ... the privilege is a sort of automatic thing, as opposed to a license which you have to apply for until such a time that, [the] privilege gets taken away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Thereafter, the court sentenced Sullivan to one year imprisonment for driving while revoked \"with all but 30 days suspended and placed him on two years probation. Sullivan noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court and vacated Sullivan\u2019s conviction. <em>Sullivan v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 35, 948 A.2d 121 (2008). Noting that \u201cneither the Transportation Article, nor Maryland case law defines \u2018privilege to drive\u2019 \u201d or provides an explanation of how \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d differs from a \u201clicense,\u201d the intermediate appellate court interpreted \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d to refer to an exemption from the driver\u2019s license requirement as provided in \u00a7 16-102 of the Transportation Article. <em>Sullivan, </em>180 Md.App. at 47, 948 A.2d at 128. The court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>[N]either section 16-303, nor any other section of the Transportation Article, defines \u201cprivilege to drive.\u201d Section 16-101 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">(a) An individual may not drive or attempt to drive a motor vehicle on any highway in this State unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">(1) The individual holds a driver\u2019s license issued under this title;</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">(2) The individual is expressly exempt from the licensing requirement of this title; or</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u25a0 (3) The individual otherwise is specifically authorized by this title to drive vehicles of the class the individual is driving or attempting to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Although section 16-102 does not explicitly define \u201cprivilege to drive,\u201d it does explicitly exclude certain drivers from the section 16-101 requirement that a license be obtained. In that sense, it implicitly defines who has the \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d on Maryland roads without obtaining a license from the State. The exclusions include, for example, nonresidents licensed in other states, members of the military or Congress, licensed foreign nationals, and emergency personnel. None of these exclusions apply to Sullivan.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">We conclude, based on our examination of Title 16 (Vehicle Laws-Drivers\u2019 License) of the Transportation Article, especially the section 16-101(a) prohibition against driving without a license or express exemption, that an un-licensed individual does not have a \u201cprivilege\u201d to drive in Maryland unless the individual falls within the exemptions set forth in section 16-102. Because Sullivan does not qualify for any of these statutory exemptions, he did not have a \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d that the MVA could \u201crevoke\u201d as section 16-303(d) contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\"><em>Sullivan, </em>180 Md.App. at 47-48, 948 A.2d at 128-129.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">We granted the State\u2019s petition for certiorari, to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-12\">Where Sullivan\u2019s Motor Vehicle Administration records showed that he had been \u201crevoked\u201d and \u201csuspended\u201d and he had accumulated 15 points, did the Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>err in holding that Sullivan could not be convicted of driving after revocation of his driving privilege under section 16-303(d) of the Transportation Article?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><em>State v. Sullivan, </em>405 Md. 506, 954 A.2d 467 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">To resolve the issue presented in this case, we must determine the meaning of the term \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 16-303 of the Transportation Article. Sullivan argues that the Court of Special Appeals correctly interpreted the term \u201cprivilege to drive.\u201d Sullivan also renews his argument that one cannot be charged or convicted of driving while one\u2019s privilege to drive is revoked when such person never enjoyed the privilege to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The State maintains that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the term \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d is erroneous. Although it concedes that the Transportation Article does not explicitly define the term \u201cprivilege to drive,\u201d it contends that the term is meant to be understood within the \u201cconfines of the definition of the term license.\u201d The State directs our attention to Md.Code (1977, 2006 RepLVol.), Title 11 of the Transportation Article, which provides \u201cDefinitions and General Provisions\u201d relating to Maryland\u2019s Vehicle Laws. Section 11-128(2)(iv) of this Title defines a \u201clicense\u201d to include \u201cthe privilege of any individual to drive a motor vehicle, whether or not that individual is formally licensed in this or any other jurisdiction.\u201d The State posits that this definition of the term \u201clicense\u201d establishes that it includes both a driver\u2019s license as well as the general privilege that individuals have to drive within this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The State argues that legislative history supports its contention. It points out that when the definition of \u201cdrivers license\u201d was added to the Transportation Article in 1977, the Revisor\u2019s Note that accompanied the term stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">This Section is new language patterned after the like definition appearing in the Uniform Vehicle Code. It is added to clarify the references in the Maryland Vehicle Law to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u201cdriver\u2019s license\u201d\u2014i.e., a license issued by the Administration under Title 16 of this article\u2014as compared to the broader references to any other \u201clicense\u201d to drive a motor vehicle, which\u2014as defined in section 11-128 of this subtitle\u2014includes a \u201cnonresident\u2019s privilege to drive,\u201d as well as the general \u201cprivilege\u201d of individuals to drive motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Md.Code (1977), \u00a7 11-116 of the Transportation Article. The State asserts that this Revisor\u2019s Note reveals that there is a general privilege to drive in Maryland and that this privilege is not contingent upon a driver\u2019s license or a statutory exemption from the driver\u2019s license requirement. Accordingly, the State maintains that the Circuit Court correctly concluded that a person who \u201cnever obtained a license, yet received suspensions and revocations from the MVA, may be convicted of driving after revocation\u201d of his or her privilege to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We disagree with the State and hold that one is not automatically and presumptively privileged to drive in Maryland. To adopt the State\u2019s contention would require us to conclude that the \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d equates to a \u201cright\u201d to drive. Such a conclusion does not comport with the overall meaning and purpose of Title 16 or to existing case law. <em>See Department of Health v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 420, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007) (explaining that when interpreting an ambiguous statute, the Court examines how the ordinary meaning of the language at issue relates to the \u201coverall meaning, setting, and purpose of the act----\u201d) (quoting <em>Oakland v. Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 316, 896 A.2d 1036, 1045 (2006)). Although there is a well established and fundamental right to interstate travel, <em>Saenz v. Roe, </em>526 U.S. 489, 498-99, 119 S.Ct. 1518, 1524, 143 L.Ed.2d 689 (1999), there is no corresponding right to operate a motor vehicle. <em>See Tederick v. State, </em>125 Md. App. 37, 41, 723 A.2d 917 (1999) (\u201c[TJhere is no right to drive an automobile on the roads and highways of the State of Maryland.\u201d); <em>accord </em>Scoll, Jeffrey, Comment, <em>Should California Prohibit Juvenile Driving: The Constitutional and Practical Considerations, </em>26 J. Juv. L. 49, 50 (2006) (\u201cThe courts have unanimously agreed that an individual does not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>fundamental right to operate a motor vehicle.\u201d). Maryland entitles or \u201cprivileges\u201d a person to operate a motor vehicle in this State when such person complies with requisite statutory and administrative regulations. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 561, 572, 622 A.2d 199, 205 (1993) (\u201cDriving on the roads of this State is also not a right, but a privilege.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Accordingly, one is \u201cprivileged to drive\u201d in Maryland if he or she is authorized to do so by law. <em>See Benbow v. State, </em>322 Md. 394, 402-03, 587 A.2d 1110, 1115 (1991) (indicating that the \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d is not automatic, but rather \u201cdependent\u201d on some form of legal entitlement, such as a valid out of state driver\u2019s license); <em>see also </em>Md.Code (1977, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 16-703 V(2) of the Transportation Article (indicating that the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways is something that must be granted). As the Court of Special Appeals noted, \u00a7 16-101 of the Transportation Article expressly provides how one may become privileged to drive in Maryland. <em>Sullivan, </em>180 Md.App. at 47-48, 948 A.2d at 129. This provision states:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">16.101. Drivers must be licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014An individual may not drive or attempt to drive a motor vehicle on any highway in this State unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">(1) The individual hold\u2019s a driver\u2019s license issued under this title;</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">(2) The individual is expressly exempt from the licensing requirements of this title;</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">(3) The individual is otherwise specifically authorized by this title to drive vehicles of the class that the individual is driving or attempting to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\u00a7 16.101 of the Transportation Article. Thus, under the plain language of section 16-101, a person may drive in Maryland, and is indeed \u201cprivileged to drive\u201d in this State, if he or she holds a valid Maryland driver\u2019s license, is exempt from the driver\u2019s license requirement, or is otherwise authorized by law to drive in this State. The statute establishes unambiguously that a person may not even <em>attempt </em>to drive otherwise. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Legislative history cited by the State does not support the conclusion that the term \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d is a general privilege that exists beyond the purview of \u00a7 16-101. The State relies primarily on an isolated Revisor\u2019s Note that accompanied the definition of the term \u201cdriver\u2019s license\u201d added in 1977. As recited above, this Note indicates that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At0\">a \u201cdriver\u2019s license\u201d\u2014i.e., a license issued by the Administration under Title 16 of this article\u2014[is to be distinguished from] ... the broader references to any other \u201clicense\u201d to drive a motor vehicle, which -as defined in section 11-128 of this subtitle\u2014includes a \u201cnonresident\u2019s privilege to drive,\u201d as well as the general \u201cprivilege\u201d of individuals to drive motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Md.Code Ann., (1977), \u00a7 11-116 of the Transportation Article. This reference does not persuade us that there is an automatic privilege to drive a motor vehicle in Maryland that is not granted by legislative enactment. If we accept the State\u2019s contention that this Note reveals that the term \u201clicense (to drive)\u201d encompasses a general and automatic privilege to drive, then, as the Court of Special Appeals correctly observed, the term \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d becomes \u201csurplusage\u201d within the text of \u00a7 16-303(d) of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consistent with the canons of statutory construction, we strive not to construe statutes so as to render any \u201cword, clause, sentence or phrase\u201d as \u201csurplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>State Central Collection v. Jordan, </em>405 Md. 420, 425, 952 A.2d 266, 269-70 (2008) (quoting <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">We thus hold that it is more reasonable, and consistent with the statutory scheme of Title 16, to interpret the phrase \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d as found in \u00a7 16-303(d) to apply to a person who is authorized to drive in this State pursuant to a valid Maryland driver\u2019s license or an exemption from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Maryland driver\u2019s license requirement, as set forth in \u00a7 16-102 of the Transportation Article. Accordingly, Sullivan\u2019s conviction for driving while his license or privilege to drive was revoked was improper because Sullivan was not privileged to drive in Maryland.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Pursuant to Md.Code (1977, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-402(a)(14) of the Transportation Article, a misdemeanor conviction for \u201cdriving while not licensed\u201d results in an assessment of five points and a fine of up to $500. <em>See also </em>Md.Code (1977, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 27-101(b) of the Transportation Article (\"Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person convicted of a misdemeanor for the violation of any provisions of the Maryland Vehicle Law is subject to a fine of not more than $500.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">.
