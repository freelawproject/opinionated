B.D.\u2019s version of events was presented through the testimony of the boy\u2019s father and a detective; others testified, although their testimony is not relevant here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During cross-examination of the father and Detective Deana Mackie, Taylor\u2019s counsel sought to impeach B.D.\u2019s version of events, by eliciting from the father and detective that the story B.D. told about his encounter with Taylor was inconsistent, as well as that B.D. had lied about his prior sexual experience. The trial judge sustained the State\u2019s objections, determining that Rule 5-608(b) would be violated because of the rule\u2019s prohibition of extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the conviction in an unreported opinion, holding that the trial court did not err in curtailing B.D.\u2019s impeachment, and, nevertheless, that if error had occurred, it was harmless. The court also declined to address a contention by Taylor that his probation order included an inappropriate condition, because the issue was not preserved for appeal. We granted certiorari, <em>Taylor v. State, </em>404 Md. 152, 945 A.2d 1270 (2008), to consider two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">1.

Did the trial court impose an overbroad condition of probation ordering Petitioner \u201cto have no contact with any minors?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We shall hold the trial judge improperly applied the extrinsic evidence limitation in Rule 5\u2014608(b), in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine the father and detective, when he prevented Taylor from impeaching the veracity of the hearsay declarant and his version of events regarding the sexual encounter in issue. We shall affirm the conviction, however, because the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">This case arises out of a sexual encounter between Taylor and B.D., a 15 year-old boy. On September 22, 2004, B.D.\u2019s father, who was estranged from B.D.\u2019s mother, arrived at the family home to take his son to a back-to-school event at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>high school. Shortly after the father and son left the house, B.D.\u2019s mother received a phone call from an individual who said that B.D.\u2019s school planner had been found at the Silver Spring Metro Station, where B.D. did not frequent. After the mother and father questioned B.D. about why he was at the Metro Station and B.D. initially obfuscated, B.D. then admitted to a sexual encounter with a man, later identified as Todd Tyrone Taylor, in Taylor\u2019s apartment in Silver Spring that day, after B.D. had contact with Taylor on a chat line. After interviewing with Detective Maekie at the police station, B.D. was then referred to a hospital for a sexual assault examination, where he told a forensic nurse, Heidi Bresee, that he had had anal intercourse, and that he had engaged in fellatio; although there had not been any force, threats or weapons. Upon examination, Nurse Bresee observed an acute half-inch, exterior anal tear that she testified was consistent with anal intercourse. A DNA sample, taken by oral and anal swabbing and analyzed by a forensic scientist, matched that of Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Taylor was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of sexual offense in the third degree for engaging in anal penetration and fellatio,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and one count of sexual offense in the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>degree, which was nolle prossed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At trial, the State did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>call B.D. to testify, instead relying on the testimony from the boy\u2019s father and that of Detective Mackie to present B.D.\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">B.D.\u2019s father testified that B.D. related to him that he had met Taylor over the Internet in a chat room on the day in question, that B.D. had traveled to Silver Spring where he had gone to Taylor\u2019s apartment, and that once there, B.D. and Taylor had engaged in anal intercourse. The father also testified that when he had heard this, he had become enraged, grabbed B.D. by the throat and demanded that B.D. take him to Taylor\u2019s apartment, where he attempted to enter, but, was deterred by a security guard and later by a police officer, who instructed him to go to the police station and meet with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>detective there. The father then testified that he had taken B.D. to the police station where both he and B.D. were interviewed by Detective Mackie, followed by a forensic examination of B.D. by Nurse Bresee at Shady Grove Hospital. The father also testified that B.D. was crying and visibly shaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">During cross-examination of the father, Taylor attempted to impeach B.D.\u2019s version of events, on the basis of B.D.\u2019s alleged fear of physical harm at the father\u2019s hand, and because B.D. allegedly had lied to his father about B.D.\u2019s previous sexual experience. After eliciting that B.D. lied to the father about why his planner was in the Silver Spring Metro Station, the State objected to Taylor\u2019s questions eliciting whether B.D. had been forthcoming with his father about his prior sexual experience; the trial judge sustained these objections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, what did he tell you when he started to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">[FATHER]: He told us exactly where he had been, how he got there and what had happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So when he told you that, did you believe him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection, Your Honor. May we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">THE COURT: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">(Bench conference follows:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: (unintelligible) can\u2019t give an opinion as to whether or not he believed (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m asking him about his experience as a father. He knows his son better than anyone else here and if his son has a history of lying, and he\u2019s able to say that, I think that\u2019s probative to the jury to consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgV\">[PROSECUTOR]: (unintelligible) and I think this witness can\u2019t give an open opinion as to (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>THE COURT: (unintelligible) and you are objecting to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: (unintelligible) I just don\u2019t know the rules on that, (unintelligible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">THE COURT: Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you feel like you know your son very well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">[FATHER]: I feel I know him to a point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. To a certain point, you don\u2019t know him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-12\">[FATHER]: Well, you know, just like any other child, you know, I can\u2019t stand here and say that I know what my child is doing at all the time. But I know there are some things that, you know, he will do and he won\u2019t do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">Taylor also sought to elicit additional testimony about whether B.D. previously had been candid with his father about his sex life:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. So, tell me this. [D]o you think your son would be completely honest with you in discussion [sic] his sex life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-15\">[FATHER]: Since this incident, yes. He has been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMN\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. So since this incident, you believe he\u2019s been completely honest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-16\">[FATHER]: Yes. I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But before this incident, you believe he hadn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-18\">[FATHER]: I think he was very vague about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-19\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, did you ever discuss his sex life with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-20\">[FATHER]: Yes. We did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-21\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And what did he say (unintelligible)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, tell me this. Why do you think that he\u2019s telling you the truth since this incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5A\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Because we\u2019ve had very serious conversations and I\u2019ve explained to him, you know, the downfalls and the pits of lying to your parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. And you think that from that conversation that now persuades him to be completely honest with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">[FATHER]: Well, not just the conversation but the fact that what all he\u2019s going through.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Cross-examination continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you know if [B.D.] has a history of lying about his sexual past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, may we approach? THE COURT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Other than this incident, have you ever known [B.D.] to lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-16\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-17\">After the completion of the father\u2019s testimony, there was a discussion at the bench concerning whether Taylor\u2019s counsel would be permitted to question Detective Mackie about B.D.\u2019s general tendency to lie about his prior sexual activity and about specific statements that tended to show that B.D. had not been truthful with Mackie about his encounter with Taylor: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>he lies about. He lies about his age. He lies about what he has done. And I believe that\u2019s probative for the jury to know about someone who\u2019s claiming, I mean the second charge is based solely on what he\u2019s claiming. And if we cannot show that when it comes to sexual matters, that this witness will lie, that I think the jury won\u2019t have the full picture.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I wanted to revisit this matter regarding the testimony that I\u2019m trying to elicit regarding his previous sexual experience. It is our intent to show that [B.D.], when asked about his sexual activities, that he will lie about that. And that\u2019s one of the things that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>THE COURT: What\u2019s your proffer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I want to ask him about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">THE COURT: Who? Ask who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Detective Mackie. I wanted to ask the father about it but he\u2019s gone. I guess I could call him back in during our case now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">THE COURT: What do you want to ask him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I want to ask, did [B.D.] ever lie about his previous sexual activity? Did he lie about what he did? Did he lie to that person? To show that this person when it comes to his sexual history, his sexual activity, he will lie about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">THE COURT: [Prosecutor?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I think that\u2019s specifically under the rape shield law were designed to protect. There\u2019s no allegations in this case that anyone else other than defendant was the source of semen, was the source of injury. There\u2019s an allegation that this child had a similar sexual encounter with someone that he met over this chat line during the month of July and he went to that individual\u2019s home in Prince George\u2019s County and identified that person by name. There\u2019s no specifics that he lied about it. And Detective Mackie\u2019s questioning of the defendant where we have this tape. We\u2019ve had a transcript made of it, it appears that he gets confused when he\u2019s asked about it. Have you ever done this before? No. Then he comes back and says, yes I did. I meet [sic] this guy Tony, but we didn\u2019t engage in sex. And he knew how to get there, there was some discussion about it, but he tells Detective Mackie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>exactly what happened. But it\u2019s specifically what the rape shield laws (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">THE COURT: We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get to it. We haven\u2019t gotten to it and if he\u2019s, his credibility is at issue based upon the prior consistent statements, then he\u2019d be cross-examined on them. But we\u2019re not just going to have open-ended [\u201c]have [sic] he ever lied in the past[\u201d] kinds of questions asked. This is not going to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand that. Also, Your Honor, (unintelligible) understand I asked him if [B.D.] ever told him that he used a condom (unintelligible) I believe, well according to the prior statement, he said he had. However, later on he told the police that a condom was not used. I wanted to elicit that. I was overruled by Your Honor when the objection was made by the State. But I need to show this jury that when it comes to sexual matters, that this complaining witness lies. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">THE COURT: There\u2019s got to be evidence to support that as opposed to a theory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, exactly. And I was trying to get that evidence by saying that he told, that [B.D.] told his father one thing, he told the police something else. Evidence of lying about sexual activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: And, Your Honor, [B.D.] can be questioned about that and the father can be brought back in, if we get to it. It\u2019s [going] to have to be on a witness by witness basis. Not, the dad can\u2019t be questioned about what [B.D.] told him and then for it later to be found out to be a lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The State called Detective Mackie to the stand, who testified that she interviewed B.D. and his father after they arrived at the police station, that she investigated telephone records and checked license plate numbers to identify Taylor as the suspect, and that she had accompanied the boy and the father to Shady Grove for the forensic examination. Specifically, with respect to what B.D. had told her about the encounter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Detective Mackie relayed to the jury that B.D. said that Taylor was the assailant, that the encounter took place in Taylor\u2019s apartment, and that it occurred on September 22, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">During cross-examination, Taylor tried to show that B.D. had told inconsistent stories to Detective Mackie about his encounter with Taylor and that B.D. had a history of lying about prior sexual activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Now, did you, when you were interviewing [B.D.] and his father, did you, you assumed that what they told you about the incident with Mr. Taylor was the truth, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">[DETECTIVE MACKIE]: Well, I had no reason to doubt , that until we do an investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. All right. So when [B.D.] told you about the incident that night, you didn\u2019t have an reason to question whether that really happened did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANx\">[DETECTIVE MACKIE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did he tell you the truth throughout the whole interview that you had with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3Z\">[DETECTIVE MACKIE]: I believe he told me the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you catch him in any lies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">[DETECTIVE MACKIE]: I don\u2019t recall catching him in any lies. It doesn\u2019t stand out to me that he lied to me in any manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May we approach, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQu\">THE COURT: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-13\">(Bench conference follows:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I have on the tape when she interviewed him that she asked him why do you feel bad about this. She said do you feel bad about this incident. He said yes. He said because this is my first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>time. Now she said, anal sex then? He said yes. [L]ater on in that interview he admits that he had anal sex with someone else previously to this. It shows that he lied about this incident, about his sexual activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">THE COURT: That\u2019s all (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: (unintelligible) [B.D.] takes the stand and denies having made the statement. That\u2019s not proper impeachment to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">THE COURT: (unintelligible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: (unintelligible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">(Bench conference concluded)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: (unintelligible) Detective Mackie, that you don\u2019t know exactly what went on between Mr. Taylor and [B.D.] in Mr. Taylor\u2019s apartment, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2m\">[DETECTIVE MACKIE]: Just what I was told. I wasn\u2019t there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right. So you just believed what [B.D.] told you, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">[DETECTIVE MACKIE]:Yes. I suppose, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. And you couldn\u2019t testify today whether that was the truth or a lie, could you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-14\">[DETECTIVE MACKIE]: Well, no. Because I wasn\u2019t the one gathering evidence and I wasn\u2019t there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You weren\u2019t there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A26\">[DETECTIVE MACKIE]: Correct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">After Detective Mackie testified, the State called Nurse Bresee, a pediatric nurse and forensic specialist, to testify about B.D.\u2019s physical injuries and her professional opinion based on her observations. She testified that she observed B.D.\u2019s injuries within 10 hours of the incident; that B.D. had an acute half-inch tear in the external surface of his anus consistent with penile but not necessarily digital penetration; and that she used a physical evidence recovery kit to take DNA samples. On cross-examination, Taylor elicited from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Nurse Bresee, without objection from the State, that, when she was filling out an earlier part of the intake form, B.D. informed her that Taylor had ejaculated in his mouth, and that he had been uncertain whether Taylor had ejaculated into his anus, but that B.D. had reversed the areas when he was questioned further.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The State called several other witnesses, including a DNA expert who testified that the DNA recovered from the anal swabs matched that of Taylor\u2019s. The State rested, and Taylor took the stand, denying that he engaged in anal penetration or fellatio, but admitting to having left a message on an adult gay hotline. According to Taylor, B.D. had misrepresented himself as a 21 year-old college student during their telephone conversation. Taylor also asserted that after arranging to meet, he realized that B.D. had lied about his description; Taylor also testified that he had told B.D. to leave, but B.D. had refused, insisting on a sexual encounter. Based on B.D.\u2019s persistence, Taylor explained that he had succumbed to B.D. and had agreed to watch pornography and to masturbate with him. Taylor also explained that B.D. had taken semen from Taylor\u2019s body and put it into his own buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The jury convicted Taylor of one count of sexual offense in the third degree for engaging in anal intercourse, but acquitted him of the count involving fellatio. The trial judge then sentenced Taylor to five years in prison, suspending all but 10 days, and to 18 months of probation, during which Taylor was required to register on the sex offender list and to submit to mandatory blood testing, and was prohibited from contacting any minors, B.D. or his family. Taylor did not file a motion to alter or amend his sentence or to challenge the sentence as illegal under Maryland Rule 4-345(a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and noted his appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In the Court of Special Appeals, Taylor argued that the trial judge erred when he curtailed the cross-examination of B.D.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>father and Detective Mackie, that the probation conditions were \u201coverbroad,\u201d and that the trial judge should not have required him to register as a sex offender. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Taylor\u2019s conviction in an unreported opinion, holding that the trial judge did not err, but even if he erred, the error was harmless, that the probation conditions were not illegal nor preserved for appeal, and that the trial judge properly required Taylor to register as a sex offender. We granted certiorari and shall affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Abj\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The primary issue is whether the trial judge erred when he curtailed Taylor\u2019s attempted questioning of two State\u2019s witnesses to impeach the non-testifying declarant\u2019s version of events and character for truthfulness. Taylor asserts that he should have been permitted to question the father and Detective Mackie regarding B.D.\u2019s history of lying about his prior sexual experiences, because the questions had impeachment value bearing on B.D.\u2019s veracity and therefore are not affected by the extrinsic evidence limitation of Rule 5-608(b) or by the fact that B.D. did not testify. Essentially, Taylor argues that Rule 5-806 treats non-testifying declarants and those that testify alike, for to do otherwise would allow the State to insulate key statements from prior act impeachment by presenting those statements through other witnesses rather than by calling the declarant to the stand. The State asserts that the trial court properly curtailed Taylor\u2019s questioning, because Taylor\u2019s questions constituted the introduction of extrinsic evidence in contravention of Rule 5-608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Although we have not had occasion previously to address the confluence of Rules 5-806 and 5-608(b), because Rule 5-806 allows for the impeachment of a hearsay declarant \u201cby any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness,\u201d we necessarily must begin our analysis with the critical question: <em>if B.D. had testified, </em>would and should Taylor have been permitted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Rule 5\u2014608(b) to impeach him with the use of similar questions asked of B.D.\u2019s father and Detective Mackie?</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We had occasion to explore the origins of Rule 5-608(b) in the case of <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 468 A.2d 319 (1983). There, Cox was convicted of rape in the first degree, sexual assault in the first degree and common law assault in a trial in which the victim\u2019s identification of Cox was the only direct evidence linking Cox to the crime. During cross-examination of the victim, Cox sought to establish that the victim was lying by asking her about a prior accusation of criminal assault that she had recanted, but the trial judge sustained the State\u2019s objection. In determining that the trial judge erred, we discussed impeachment using prior acts and explained the extrinsic evidence limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">This Court has recognized as a general rule that a witness may be cross-examined \u201con such matters and facts as are likely to affect his credibility, test his memory or knowledge, show his relation to the parties or cause, his bias, or the like.\u201d The exception to this rule is that cross-examination will not be permitted on matters that are immaterial or irrelevant to the issue being tried. In this regard, the trial judge plays a significant role; for he must balance the probative value of an inquiry against the unfair prejudice that might inure to the witness. Otherwise, the inquiry can reduce itself to a discussion of collateral matters which will obscure the issue and lead to the fact finder\u2019s confusion. To assist the trial judge, our courts have recognized and enforced certain principles. We have permitted extrinsic evidence of a prior conviction of a character witness or the defendant himself to be introduced to question the veracity and credibility of the witness or the defendant. However, we have insisted that the prior conviction should be relevant to the inquiry. We have indicated that \u201cinfamous crimes, felonies, crimes involving moral turpitude, deceit, or dishonesty are ... admissible for purposes of impeachment____\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">But generally, we have reposed the responsibility for determining the relevance of prior convictions used for impeachment in the discretion of the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>We have also permitted a witness to be cross-examined about prior bad acts which are relevant to an assessment of the witness\u2019 credibility. We have allowed such inquiry to be conducted when the trial judge is satisfied that there is a reasonable basis for the question, that the primary purpose of the inquiry is not to harass or embarrass the witness, and that there is little likelihood of obscuring the issue on trial. We recognize that in cases regarding prior misconduct, the cross-examiner is bound by the witness\u2019 answer and, upon the witness\u2019 denial, may not introduce extrinsic evidence to contradict the witness or prove the discrediting act. The witness is not disadvantaged because there is nothing for him to rebut. Thus, the inquiry virtually stops with the question and answer, except to the extent that the trial judge may allow further cross-examination to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">We have also been steadfast in holding that mere accusations of crime or misconduct may not be used to impeach. The rationale for this viewpoint is obvious. First of all, accusations of misconduct are still clothed with the presumption of innocence and receiving mere accusations for this purpose would be tantamount to accepting someone else\u2019s assertion of the witness\u2019 guilt and pure hearsay. In the instant case, defense counsel was not inquiring into prior convictions or an accusation of misconduct but seeking to determine the fact of prior misconduct. Under such circumstances, it is the responsibility of the trial judge to determine the relevance and materiality of the alleged prior misconduct, for it is purely collateral to the issue on trial and should only be admitted if probative of a lack of credibility. The trial judge must constantly be alert to make certain that the probative value of the inquiry outweighs its potential prejudice to the witness and that the inquiry does not stem primarily from a desire to harass or embarrass the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">v w H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">The issue we must resolve is rather straightforward: to what extent may the testimony of a prosecuting witness in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>rape case be impeached on cross-examination? We have already stated the general rule that any witness may be cross-examined on matters and facts affecting his credibility, so long as such facts are not immaterial or irrelevant to the issue being tried.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 178-81, 468 A.2d at 321-22 (internal citations omitted). In language probative of the resolution of the conflict between the now-codified Rule 5-608(b) and Rule 806, Judge Harry A. Cole, speaking for the Court, determined that the trial judge had erred by limiting defense counsel\u2019s inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s inquiry focused on the fact of prior misconduct when the witness had actually lied under oath in a similar situation. Counsel\u2019s proffer indicated a proper line of cross-examination since the information to be extracted from the witness would relate to her character for veracity and thereby allow the fact finder to assess her credibility. Of course, if the witness denied the prior misconduct, the examiner would be bound by her answer, in that, he could not introduce extrinsic evidence to prove the discrediting acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">While the right to cross-examine is not absolute and may be restricted by the trial judge, such restriction should be manifested by the exercise of sound discretion. As Chief Judge Murphy (then Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals) said in <em>DeLilly v. State[, </em>11 Md.App. 676, 276 A.2d 417 (1971)]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">We are, of course, mindful of the general rule so frequently cited that the allowance or disallowance of questions on cross-examination is normally left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. But where the limitations imposed by the court upon cross-examination are such as plainly inhibit the ability of the accused to obtain a fair trial, the general rule is manifestly inapplicable. The real object of cross-examination is \u201cto elicit all the facts of any observation or transaction which has not been fully explained.\u201d That a witness may be cross-examined on such matters and facts as are likely to affect his credibility, test his memory or knowledge or the like, is a fundamental con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>cept in our system of jurisprudence. And cross-examination to impeach, diminish, or impair the credit of a witness is not confined to matters brought out on direct examination; it may include collateral matters not embraced in the direct examination to test credibility and veracity, it being proper to allow any question which reasonably tends to explain, contradict, or discredit any testimony given by the witness in chief, or which tends to test his accuracy, memory, veracity, character, or credibility. Of course, the right to cross-examine effectively necessarily includes the right to place the testimony of a witness in its proper setting to fairly enable the jury to judge its credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">Here the inquiry had substantial probative force and there was no indication that defense counsel was harassing the witness by asking an unfounded question or seeking primarily to embarrass the witness. Indeed, the proffered question would have gone to the very heart of the witness\u2019 credibility. The evidence of the crime was extremely damaging and Cox\u2019s defense necessarily rested on the fact finder not believing the prosecutrix\u2019s statement that he was her assailant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 183-184, 468 A.2d at 323-24 (internal citations omitted). Thereby, in <em>Cox, </em>we presaged our adoption of Rule 5-608(b), permitting the witness to be questioned regarding lies about prior misconduct, with the limitation that proof of the conduct itself, or extrinsic evidence, could not be introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Subsequently, in <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 697 A.2d 432 (1997), we had occasion to explore Rule 5-608(b), when we were confronted by the issue of whether a third party could testify that a victim, who had already testified, previously had reported another act of abuse by one other than Merzbacher, to prove the victim\u2019s tendency to make such complaints. In that case, where the victim had not been questioned about whether she had falsely accused another, we were clear that Merzbacher could have questioned the victim about false accusations that may have been probative of lack of credibility, but could not have proven the prior misconduct extrinsically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Although Merzbacher believes his attempt to show Murphy\u2019s propensity to falsely accuse others of sexual misconduct is supported by our holding in <em>State v. Cox, </em>we disagree. In <em>Cox, </em>this Court reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction of rape and related offenses because the trial court erroneously precluded his defense counsel from asking the prosecutrix about an incident where <em>that </em>witness had allegedly lied under oath. Because the testimony of the witness was pivotal to the State\u2019s case, we concluded that it was error to preclude the defense from questioning her about that specific instance of past misconduct which was highly relevant to her credibility. We also noted, however, that had that witness denied the prior misconduct, the examiner would have been bound by the answer and precluded from introducing extrinsic testimony to prove the discrediting acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">In the instant case, Murphy was not questioned about whether or not she made false accusations against another person. Rather, Merzbacher attempted to impeach her credibility through the introduction of highly speculative and unproven extrinsic testimony suggestive of her tendency to make such accusations. Merzbacher failed to produce evidence of a complaint made by Murphy other than that made against Merzbacher, much less one that was false. This is precisely the issue our predecessors explored in <em>Rau v. State[, </em>133 Md. 613, 105 A. 867 (1919)]. Rau, charged with having carnal knowledge of a women child under the age of fourteen years, asked the following question of the child\u2019s father at trial:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">I want to ask you, Mr. Lohmeyer [the victim\u2019s father], if your daughter Martha, the prosecutrix in this case, didn\u2019t tell you that a man by the name of Hutton, a neighbor across the road where you lived about a year ago, that about that time, that this Mr. Hutton had sexual intercourse with her, and if she didn\u2019t thereafter tell you that it was not so and that she had told a lie on Hutton ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq4\">The State\u2019s objection to the question was sustained. In response, Rau asserted that \u201cthe question was proper be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>cause [it] ... would have [had] a tendency to impeach her character,\u201d\u2014an assertion, we note, identical to Merzbacher\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">In rejecting Rau\u2019s argument, the Court noted that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A64\">the prosecuting witness was not asked on cross-examination whether she had told a lie concerning the alleged intercourse with Hutton, ... but whether or not she had told her mother a year ago that a man by the name of Horton, a neighbor of hers, had sexual intercourse with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">The Court thus concluded that because \u201cit is almost universally held that proof of particular facts is inadmissible in impeaching a witness ... there was no error in the [trial] [c]ourt in refusing to permit the question to be asked and answered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">We noted in <em>Cox </em>that although <em>Ran </em>would have been well within his rights to ask the prosecutrix questions concerning her credibility on cross-examination, he was not permitted \u201cto broach the subject through extrinsic testimony.\u201d Nothing has changed since <em>Ran. </em>Indeed, Maryland Rule 5-608(b) codifies the rule applied in <em>Cox </em>and <em>Rau\\_.\\</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\n<em>Assuming that he had a reasonable basis to do so, Merzbacher could have questioned Murphy about prior instances of her falsely accusing another individual of sexual misconduct. Although we agree that any such false accusation would have had a significant bearing on Murphy\u2019s credibility, Merzbacher was not entitled to introduce extrinsic testimony to support his attempted exploration of Murphy\u2019s character through prior bad acts evidence. The trial court did not err or otherwise abuse its discretion by excluding this line of questioning.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 417-20, 697 A.2d at 445-46 (internal citations omitted) (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). In stating that \u201cMerzbacher could have questioned Murphy about prior instances of her falsely accusing another individual of sexual misconduct,\u201d but could not have introduced proof of the complaints, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>acknowledged that the purpose of the extrinsic evidence limitation in Rule 5-608(b) is to prevent a mini-trial regarding a collateral matter while permitting questions to impeach with prior false accusations. <em>Id.; see also </em>6 Lynn McClain, Maryland Practice: Maryland Evidence State and Federal \u00a7 608:l(c) (2d ed. 2001, 2008 Supp.) (\u201cBecause the bad acts evidence is not central to the trial, the consumption of time and the distraction of the jury which would result from a mini-trial about whether the bad act took place dictate inadmissibility of extrinsic proof.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">As a result, the resolution of the issue presented necessarily entails a determination of whether, under Rule 5-608(b), Taylor could have impeached B.D. with the same questions proffered to B.D.\u2019s father and Detective Mackie, a prerequisite to any consideration of Rule 5-806. Here, Taylor attempted to question B.D.\u2019s father about whether B.D. had a history of lying about his sex life, but the trial judge sustained the State\u2019s objection before the father answered. As in <em>Merzbacher, </em>where we stated that Merzbacher could have asked Murphy whether she previously had made false accusations because the question implicated her credibility under Rule 5-608(b), had B.D. testified, Taylor would have had the opportunity to question B.D. about whether B.D. previously had lied about his sexual encounters. Similarly, under the extrinsic evidence limitation, if B.D. had answered \u201cno,\u201d Taylor could not have proven the misconduct itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Taylor also had proffered that he would have asked Detective Mackie whether B.D. ever had lied about prior sexual activity and whether B.D. had lied regarding the fact that his sexual encounter with Taylor was his first, although, on the tape of the interview, B.D. had been inconsistent about the encounter\u2019s primacy. Again, had B.D. testified, Taylor could have asked B.D. whether he had lied about his sexual encounters or about this incident, because those questions would have borne directly on B.D.\u2019s character for truthfulness\u2014and again, if B.D. had answered \u201cno,\u201d Taylor would have been bound by that answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>B.D. did not testify, however, and Taylor was not afforded the opportunity to impeach B.D. under Rule 5-608(b), because the State introduced B.D.\u2019s version of events through the father and Detective Mackie. In essence, we are concerned here with whether the State can successfully avoid the impeachment of B.D.\u2019s veracity by never calling him to the stand. The answer is no, under the dictates of Rule 5-806, which allows the impeachment of a declarant \u201cby any evidence which would be admissible ... if the declarant had testified as a witness.\u201d For us, this is a question of first impression, although not so in a number of federal courts, which have had occasion to explore the scope of Rule 806 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which is similar in important respects to Maryland Rule 5-806.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In each of the cases, the courts have indicated that Federal Rule 806 would permit impeachment of a non-testifying declarant, but not proof of prior misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><em>United States v. White, </em>325 U.S.App.D.C. 282, 116 F.3d 903 (D.C.Cir.1997), involved a complicated multi-defendant, multicount murder and conspiracy case, in which a key government witness, Williams, was allegedly killed by Hughes and White to prevent Williams\u2019 cooperation with the police. Because Williams was killed, the trial judge permitted Williams\u2019 police contact, Sergeant Sutherland, to testify as to drug transactions involving Williams and regarding what Williams had told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the officer about the \u201cFirst Street Crew\u201d drug organization, which consisted of co-conspirators White, Hicks, Hughes, Hutchinson, and Ballard, among others. Defense counsel attempted to impeach Williams\u2019 version of events, using Federal Rule 806, by asking Sergeant Sutherland about Williams\u2019 drug use, drug dealing and prior convictions, as well as about whether Williams had lied on an employment application or violated any court orders. The trial judge permitted questioning about drug use, drug dealing and prior convictions, but did not allow the introduction of the employment application or court order, and White appealed. In affirming the conviction, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit acknowledged that proof of prior acts was different than questioning a witness regarding whether Williams, the non-testifying declarant, had lied previously; the Court noted that Federal Rule 806 would have permitted the latter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANX\">Although Fed.R.Evid. 806 provides that the credibility of a hearsay declarant \u201cmay be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness,\u201d counsel attacked Williams\u2019s credibility using specific examples of misconduct, which, under Fed.R.Evid. 608(b), cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence. Accordingly, Hughes counsel could have asked Sergeant Sutherland only if Williams had ever lied on an employment form or violated any court orders, and could not have made reference to any extrinsic proof of those acts. Having known Williams for less than two months before his death, Sutherland may or may not have been able to answer those questions. In light of the damage already done to Williams\u2019s credibility through Sutherland\u2019s testimony about Williams\u2019s drug use, drug dealing, and prior convictions, the district court was within its discretion to conclude that the questions were of little utility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 920 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In <em>United States v. Saada, </em>212 F.3d 210, 221 (3rd Cir.2000), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit also had occasion to address the application of Federal Rule 806, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>when a non-testifying declarant\u2019s version of events is attacked. <em>Saada </em>involved a false insurance claim made by warehouse owners after of one of them allegedly broke a sprinkler-head to create a flood. The warehouse owners claimed that the flood was an accident and introduced, over the government\u2019s objection, the utterances of a former New Jersey state court judge, who was in the warehouse at the time of the flood, and who had stated, \u201coh my God, Neil did something stupid ... now he\u2019s got a mess ... I can\u2019t believe it. He is so stupid. He threw it. He is stupid, he is dumb.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218. The judge had died, and the government sought to impeach by asking the trial judge to take judicial notice of two New Jersey Supreme Court orders disbarring and removing the state judge from the bench for unethical conduct. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial judge took judicial notice of the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">On appeal, Saada argued that the judicially noticed orders constituted proof of the judge\u2019s misconduct, which was barred under the extrinsic evidence limitation of Federal Rule 608(b). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, relying on <em>White, </em>held that the orders were extrinsic evidence, and therefore, should not have been admitted; although the judge\u2019s version of events and veracity could have been impeached by more specific questioning regarding veracity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">[T]he unavailability of the declarant will not always foreclose using prior misconduct as an impeachment tool because the witness testifying to the hearsay statement may be questioned about the declarant\u2019s misconduct\u2014without reference to extrinsic evidence thereof\u2014on cross-examination concerning knowledge of the declarant\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 221. <em>See also United States v. Friedman, </em>854 F.2d 535, 570 n. 8 (2d Cir.1988) (noting the tension between the extrinsic evidence limitation in Federal Rule 608(b) and Federal Rule 806 when the declarant does not testify).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Within this framework, based upon our determination that Taylor could have asked BJD. under Rule 5-608(b) whether he had lied about sexual matters on previous occasions, we hold that Rule 5-806 would permit the same questions to be addressed to B.D.\u2019s father and the detective. To hold otherwise, would be to permit the State to insulate a non-testifying declarant from impeachment, by presenting his statements through other witnesses, instead of by calling the declarant to the stand; this we will not permit under Rule 5-806.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Having concluded that the trial judge erred, we now turn to whether the trial judge\u2019s error was harmless. We recently addressed the application of the harmless error rule in <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 332-33, 941 A.2d 1107, 1121 (2008) (internal citations omitted), when Judge Glenn T. Harrell, Jr., writing for the Court, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">In <em>Dorsey v.

As adopted in <em>Dorsey, </em>the harmless error rule is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">When an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of-whether erroneously admitted or excluded-may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">In performing a harmless error analysis, we are not to find facts or weigh evidence. Instead, \u201cwhat evidence to believe, what weight to be given it, and what facts flow from that evidence are for the jury ... to determine.\u201d \u201c \u2018Once it has been determined that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict. The reviewing court must exclude that possibility beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018To say that an error did not contribute to the verdict is, rather, to find that error unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed by the record.\u2019 \u201d The \u201charmless error rule ... has been and should be carefully circumscribed.\u201d Harmless error review is the standard of review most favorable to the defendant short of an automatic reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Application of these tenets to the present case, leads us to the conclusion that the trial judge\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Taylor was acquitted of the fellatio count and convicted of the anal intercourse count. To split the verdict and to acquit Taylor of the fellatio count, the jury must have disbelieved B.D. regarding the fellatio count. It is noteworthy that Taylor\u2019s counsel, when explaining to the trial judge why he should have been allowed to probe into prior occasions in which B.D. had lied, stated, \u201cI mean the [fellatio] charge is based solely on what [B.D. is] claiming. And if we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>show that when it. comes to sexual matters, that this witness will lie, that [sic] I think the jury won\u2019t have the full picture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AN7\">Taylor\u2019s counsel clearly had ample opportunity to impeach B.D.\u2019s version of events and his character for truthfulness. During cross-examination of B.D.\u2019s father, Taylor elicited that B.D. lied about his whereabouts after his school planner had been discovered in a Silver Spring Metro Station. Taylor also questioned the father about whether B.D. had been honest with him in the past about his sexual experiences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. So, tell me this. [D]o you think your son would be completely honest with you in discussion [sic] his sex life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">[FATHER]: Since this incident, yes. He has been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7q\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. So since this incident, you believe he\u2019s been completely honest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">[FATHER]: Yes. I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But before this incident, you believe he hadn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">[FATHER]: I think he was very vague about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">When cross-examining B.D.\u2019s mother, Taylor was permitted to ask her whether she believed that B.D. told her everything that night, to which she answered that she did not believe that B.D. had told her everything. Taylor intimated throughout the cross-examination of both the mother and father and in closing, that B.D. had fabricated or changed his version of events for fear of physical confrontation with his father. Moreover, during the cross-examination of Detective Mackie, Taylor questioned her about whether B.D. had \u201ctold her the truth throughout the whole interview with him.\u201d Taylor also had the opportunity to impeach B.D.\u2019s version of events when cross-examining Nurse Bresee, by eliciting B.D.\u2019s inconsistent version of events regarding oral or anal ejaculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">In convicting on the anal intercourse count, the jury not only had B.D.\u2019s statements about anal intercourse, but also had evidence of Nurse Bresee\u2019s physical examination, in which she observed a half-inch tear on the exterior of B.D.\u2019s anus, along with Taylor\u2019s DNA, recovered from the swabs of B.D.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>anus. The substantial physical evidence on the anal intercourse count distinguished that count from the fellatio count and led the jury to convict on the anal intercourse count.

We granted certiorari, even though the State countered in its Answer to the Petition for Certiorari that the probation question was not only moot, but also not appropriately challenged by Taylor in his Petition. We need not address either of the State\u2019s contentions, because it is clear that Taylor\u2019s assertions about his probation conditions, were they to be construed as a motion to correct an illegal sentence, which under Rule 4-345(a) can be raised at any time, do not constitute an illegal sentence. Historically, to challenge an illegal sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345, a criminal defendant files a motion to correct an illegal sentence, and that motion \"was entertained only where the alleged illegality was in the sentence itself or the sentence never should have been imposed.\u201d <em>Baker v. State, </em>389 Md. 127, 133, 883 A.2d 916, 919 (2005). <em>See also Montgomery v. State, </em>405 Md. 67, 81, 950 A.2d 77, 86 (2008) (holding that a sentence was illegal after defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence). Thus, where the sentence or sanction was itself lawful, a Rule 4-345(a) motion is not an appropriate vehicle to challenge the legality of a sentence. <em>Baker, </em>389 Md. at 134, 883 A.2d at 920; <em>Evans v.

The trial judge prevented Martisko from proving the prior act either by recalling police witnesses to question them about it or by introducing the report of the incidents. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held that the evidence should have been permitted under West Virginia Rule 806, because to apply the extrinsic evidence limitation under the circumstances would be to impinge upon Martisko\u2019s right to cross-examine his accuser and to receive a fair trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agk\">We are uncomfortable with a conviction based entirely upon hearsay evidence where the defendant has had no opportunity to impeach his chief accuser.

At trial, the State chose not to call B.D. to the stand to prove its case. Instead, it called witnesses to whom B.D. had related his story and used scientific and other circumstantial evidence for that purpose. Taylor sought to impeach B.D., a non-testifying hearsay declarant, by presenting the jury with evidence, through some of the witnesses the State called, that B.D. frequently lied when discussing his sexual history. By presenting this evidence, Taylor hoped to undermine the scientific evidence, which was dependent substantially on B.D.\u2019s credibility. His strategy was to demonstrate to the jury that the conclusions reached by the State\u2019s expert witnesses were not reliable because they were premised on the statements of a declarant who was not credible. The trial court ruled that Taylor\u2019s attempt to impeach B.D. by cross-examining State\u2019s witnesses was not permitted under Md. Rule 5-608^).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>I agree with the majority\u2019s holding that, pursuant to Md. Rule 5-806,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Taylor should have been permitted to impeach B.D. through the State\u2019s witnesses that were called. Specifically, I agree that Md. Rule 5-608(b) does not pose a bar to the impeachment of a non-testifying hearsay declarant\u2019s veracity when the State chooses not to call the declarant, because Md. Rule 5-806 permits the impeachment of a non-testifying declarant through testifying witnesses, which is the exact method of impeachment Taylor was erroneously prevented from using at trial. Majority slip op. at 38. As the majority correctly points out, \u201c[t]o hold otherwise, would be to permit the State to insulate a non-testifying declarant from impeachment, by presenting his statements through other witnesses, instead of by calling the declarant to the stand.\u201d Majority slip op. at 28-29. I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s error in refusing to allow the impeachment attempted in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The jury reached a split verdict at Taylor\u2019s trial, finding him guilty of the anal intercourse count but not guilty of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>fellatio count. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Taylor\u2019s conviction in an unreported opinion. It is undisputed that on September 22, 2004, B.D. visited Taylor\u2019s apartment. The issue for the jury to determine, however, was whether Taylor and B.D. had illegal sexual contact with each other in Taylor\u2019s apartment, as B.D., through the witnesses that the State called, maintained, or, whether, as the petitioner claimed, Taylor and B.D. merely masturbated individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">B.D.\u2019s version of the facts was presented as indicated, through several witnesses. Bicie Walker, his mother, testified that B.D. admitted going to Silver Spring, Maryland and having a sexual encounter with another man. Marvin D., B.D.\u2019s father and Ms. Walker\u2019s ex-husband, testified that he demanded to be, and was taken, by B.D. to the apartment where the sexual encounter occurred, where they met law enforcement officials, who directed them to give statements to Detective Deana Mackie, an officer in the Family Crimes Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Detective Mackie confirmed that B.D. maintained that he had sex with the petitioner in his apartment. Heidi Bresee, a Forensic Nurse Examiner, conducted a sexual assault examination of B.D. That examination revealed an acute half-inch tear in B.D.\u2019s anal verge that was consistent with a penile penetration at the time in which B.D. claimed to have had anal sex with Taylor. Bresee also collected swabs of possible forensic evidence from the inside of B.D.\u2019s mouth, rectum and perianal buttocks as part of B.D.\u2019s rape kit, also known as a physical evidence recovery kit (\u201cPERK\u201d). She also testified to what B.D. told her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cHe stated to me, I met this guy Tony in a telephone chat room. We agreed to meet and have sex. I told him I was 17 so he knew I was a minor. I went to his place after school. I performed oral sex on him first. His penis tasted weird, nasty. I spit after I did that. I can\u2019t describe but it tasted gross. Maybe like he\u2019d had sex with someone else before I got there. Then he had anal sex with me. He put his finger and his penis in my butt. He didn\u2019t wear a condom. I don\u2019t think he put anything on his penis. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>hurt a little but not bad. When my mom found out, she called the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Finally, Bresee indicated that B.D. told her that he had a bowel movement after his \u201cencounter\u201d with Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Karolyn Tontarski, a Forensic Scientist, analyzed the swabs collected by Bresee, finding that the \u201cperianal\u201d and \u201crectal swabs\u201d contained Taylor\u2019s DNA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The amount of sperm cells found on B.D.\u2019s perianal and rectal swabs was consistent, Tontarski stated, with an internal ejaculation. That conclusion assumed that the bowel movement that B.D. testified he had, after his sexual encounter, had been a large bowel movement. She conceded, on cross-examination, in that regard, that had B.D. had only a light bowel movement, it might be possible, although she thought highly unlikely, for the semen to have been deposited by an inanimate object.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Taylor testified in his own defense and vehemently denied B.D.\u2019s version of events.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While agreeing that B.D. came to his house in response to a message he left on an adult gay hotline that was for adults only, he disputed that he had sex with him. According to Taylor, he agreed only to watching a pornographic tape on his bed while he and B.D., individually and separately, masturbated. Nothing more occurred, he maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">When he ejaculated on his chest and stomach, Taylor stated, B.D., who was lying next to him, reached over and wiped the semen off of Taylor\u2019s chest and stomach with his right hand, after which Taylor testified that he noticed B.D. putting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>right hand in between his buttocks and using his left hand to masturbate himself. Although he admitted that he did not see B.D. use his fingers to penetrate his rectum, Taylor stated emphatically and, therefore, was absolutely certain, that the half-inch tear in B.D.\u2019s anal verge was not caused by his penis because he never penetrated B.D. Taylor testified that, while B.D.\u2019s behavior was \u201cfreaky,\u201d he did not find it \u201cweird.\u201d Gay men, he explained, occasionally engage in this type of conduct for sexual pleasure and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">I. Harmless Error Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976), this Court outlined the test for harmless error in criminal cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201cWe conclude that when an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed harmless and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Prior to <em>Dorsey, </em>this Court cautioned that the harmless error rule \u201cshould be carefully circumscribed\u201d to discourage prosecutors from testing the bounds of our evidentiary rules in hopes of a reviewing court simply finding the error harmless in light of the substantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. 233, 248, 322 A.2d 211, 219 (1974)(quoting <em>People v. Jablonski, </em>38 Mich.App. 33, 38-39, 195 N.W.2d 777, 780 (1972)). The majority\u2019s perfunctory harmless error analysis takes this Court one step closer to the reality of which these cases warned and, while doing so, usurps the role of the trier of fact by simply and independently reweighing the evidence. Judges do not weigh evidence or find facts in a jury trial. \u201c[WJhat evidence to believe, what weight to be given it, and what facts flow from that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>are for the jury, not the judge to determine.\u201d <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 224, 571 A.2d 1251, 1260 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">For an appellate court to find harmless error, it must be \u201cable to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. The harmless error rule is not an open invitation for the appellate court to substitute its judgment as to whether there was sufficient evidence to convict the defendant. Instead, in a jury trial, the jury or trier of fact, is the entity that the Constitution entrusts with making that determination, in the first instance. U.S. Const, amend. VI; Md. Constitution, Declaration of Rights, Article 23.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court\u2019s role, as articulated in <em>Dorsey, </em>is to determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the \u201cerror in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the facts presented here, it is impossible for the majority, or anyone else, to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury\u2019s verdict would not have been influenced had it been presented with the erroneously excluded evidence that B.D. frequently lied about his sexual past.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The trial court made two significant erroneous evidentiary rulings. The first significant error made by the trial judge was in preventing Taylor from cross-examining B.D.\u2019s father, one of the State\u2019s main witnesses, on whether B.D. had previously lied about his sexual past. The second erroneous ruling was in preventing Taylor from playing a tape of B.D.\u2019s interview with Detective Mackie. He proffered that the tape would have shown the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u201cMr. Chappie: Your Honor, I have on the tape when she [Detective Mackie] interviewed him [B.D.J that she asked him, \u201cWhy do you feel bad about this?\u201d Because she said, \u201cDo you feel bad about this incident?\u201d He [B.D.] said yes. He said, \u201cBecause this is my first time.\u201d And she said, \u201cAnal sex, then?\u201d He said yes. Later in that interview, he admits that he had anal sex with someone else previously to this. It shows that he lied about this incident and about his sexual activities[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">These two significant evidentiary rulings bear on, and, indeed, are critical to the assessment of the most important issue in the case, B.D.\u2019s credibility. Their importance is accentuated by the fact that B.D. did not take the stand to testify about the alleged sexual acts that he engaged in with Taylor and so the petitioner was not able to confront him directly. Thus, the only insight the jury had, or could get, into the trustworthiness of B.D.\u2019s testimony was through the testimony of those State\u2019s witnesses to whom past discrepancies had been revealed or who, through experiences, were aware of the victim\u2019s tendency to prevaricate. It is pertinent, in this regard, to note that those witnesses did not view the alleged sexual act and, therefore, were relating, and, so, relying on what they were told, the most critical being that related by B.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">II. Application of Harmless Error Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The holding that the trial judge\u2019s error was harmless is premised on the majority\u2019s interpretation of the split verdict returned by the jury. It reasons that the jury had to conclude that B.D. lied when discussing his sexual past in order to reach the split verdict. Thus, according to the majority, the jury had already concluded that B.D. lacked credibility when discussing his sexual history. Necessarily, therefore, it asserts that the verdict was not impacted by the trial judge\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Its protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, all the majority has done is weigh the evidence itself and conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to convict Taylor. This approach, however, impinges on the province of the jury, which has the sole responsibility of \u201c[wjeighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflicts.\u201d <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323, 331 (1998). The majority\u2019s approach pays mere lip service to the harmless error standard outlined in <em>Dorsey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The jury\u2019s split verdict does not mean, necessarily or even logically, that it concluded that B.D. lacked credibility when discussing his previous sexual encounters. There are other possible reasons for the jury\u2019s split verdict. For example, the jury could have been persuaded by the absence of scientific evidence relating to the fellatio count, when compared with the seeming plethora of scientific evidence that explained and confirmed the anal intercourse count. The jury also could simply have reached a compromise verdict. \u201cHow, or why, a jury may decide to resolve credibility or fact issues in a particular manner is a matter only it knows.\u201d <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 593, 602 A.2d 677, 697 (1992) (Bell, J., dissenting). One thing, however, is certain: it is impossible for the majority, or anyone else, to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt how the jury would have used the erroneously excluded evidence and resolved the credibility determinations that would have flowed from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We are not concerned here with whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. It undoubtedly is. In fact, the evidence against Taylor is fairly strong. The <em>Dorsey </em>harmless error rule, however, requires that, in order for harmless error to be found, the majority must be able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury\u2019s verdict would not have been influenced by the erroneously excluded evidence. Thus, simply determining whether there was sufficient evidence to convict Taylor and weighing the evidence in that process is not the proper role for an appellate court. Instead, the reviewing court must be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014-whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014may have contributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the rendition of the guilty verdict. <em>See Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 592, 602 A.2d 677, 696 (1992) (Bell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In addition to relying on an interpretation of the jury\u2019s split verdict, which it is not at all clear that the jury used, the majority leans too heavily on the expert testimony of Nurse Bresee and Karolyn Tontarski. This Court has recognized that an expert\u2019s opinion \u201cderives its probative force from the facts on which it is predicated,\u201d <em>State Dep\u2019t of Health v. Walker, </em>238 Md. 512, 520, 209 A.2d 555, 559 (1965), and is no stronger. <em>Jones v. State, </em>343 Md. 448, 461, 464, 682 A.2d 248, 255-56 (1996). It is significant, therefore, that Nurse Bresee conceded that her interpretation of the observations that she made during B.D.\u2019s sexual assault examination was influenced by B.D.\u2019s version of events.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, Nurse Bresee\u2019s and Karolyn Tontarski\u2019s expert opinions are only as good as the foundation\u2014the factual context and the credibility B.D. provides for their observations\u2014that undergirds their expert opinions. Because an expert\u2019s opinion is only as good as the factual predicate on which it is based, Maryland juries are not required to give an expert\u2019s opinion any weight at all. <em>See </em>Md.Crim. Pattern Jury Instr. 3:14 (2003).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The scientific testimony presented to the jury could have been interpreted by the jury as consistent with either Taylor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>or B.D.\u2019s version of events. Just as the weight to be given the expert\u2019s testimony is for the jury to decide, how to strike the balance and assess a witness\u2019s credibility is to be left to the jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, because it is the jury that determines the matter, that one interpretation is logically stronger, is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Taylor\u2019s strategy was to undermine B.D.\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By doing so, the scientific conclusions reached by Nurse Bresee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and Karolyn Tontarski, who both based their conclusions on B.D.\u2019s version of events, similarly would be undermined. Nurse Bresee testified that she observed an acute half-inch tear on B.D.\u2019s anal verge. On cross-examination, Nurse Bresee gave contradictory testimony about whether it was possible for a finger to cause the tear that she observed outside of B.D.\u2019s anus. On cross-examination, Nurse Bresee testified, in part, to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">[Defense Counsel]: So you testified that a finger could not make this tear. It was unlikely that a finger could make that tear, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">[Nurse Bresee]: In my experience it is unlikely. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Okay. But it\u2019s possible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">[Nurse Bresee]: It\u2019s possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">* * $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Okay. Well, what I\u2019m asking you is, is it possible that someone can use a finger and the fingernail can scratch the outside of the rectum?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">[Nurse Bresee]: I\u2019m stating it\u2019s not my opinion that you could cause a half inch tear by a fingernail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>[Defense Counsel]: All right. Okay. I\u2019m asking you is it possible, not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">[Nurse Bresee]: Then no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Nurse Bresee\u2019s statement that a finger could have made the tear that she observed in B.D.\u2019s anal verge is helpful to Taylor. It provides a basis for the jury to credit his version of the events. Her later statement, perhaps an attempt to retract her earlier statement, does not negate that fact. Her later statement simply stated that a fingernail could not have made the tear. At no time did she retract her testimony that a finger \u201cpossibly\u201d may have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The forensic scientist testified that she performed DNA typing on the swabs that Nurse Bresee took from B.D.\u2019s mouth, anus and rectum, finding Taylor\u2019s DNA only on both the perianus and rectal swabs. She conceded on cross-examination, however, that it was possible for an inanimate object, such as a finger, to have deposited the semen that she observed on the perianal and rectal swabs taken from B.D. To be sure, she qualified that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that it could have occurred that way, but how likely it was was for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The scientific evidence presented to the jury relied significantly, if not entirely on B.D.\u2019s credibility. If the jury believed B.D., that he had anal sex with Taylor, the scientific testimony supported that version of events. The jury did not have to believe B.D., however. Tontarski\u2019s testimony that the amount of semen on the perianal and rectal swabs taken from B.D. was consistent with an internal ejaculation, was premised on B.D.\u2019s testimony that he had a bowel movement after his sexual encounter with Taylor. Nurse Bresee\u2019s testimony about whether it was possible for a finger to cause the acute half-inch tear she observed on B.D.\u2019s anal verge was conflicting. The scientific testimony favorable to B.D. would be valid, therefore, only if B.D. was credible. If the jury did not believe B.D., the scientific testimony could be interpreted consistently with Taylor\u2019s version of events. For instance, with regard to the DNA in B.D.\u2019s anal and rectal area, Taylor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>testified that B.D. placed semen he got from Taylor\u2019s stomach and chest in between his own buttocks. Although Taylor did not testify that B.D. used his fingers to penetrate himself with Taylor\u2019s semen, he did deny emphatically that he caused the tear in B.D.\u2019s anal verge. Significantly, Tontarski\u2019s testimony that it was possible for a finger to have deposited the semen when coupled with Nurse Bresee\u2019s concession, made B.D.\u2019s credibility quite important.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Had the jury been given the opportunity to hear that B.D. previously lied to his father about his sexual past and to listen to the tape of B.D.\u2019s statement to Detective Mackie about his sexual history, it might have had a different perspective on the scientific testimony, which likely might have resulted in a different verdict. As Nurse Bresee admitted on cross-examination, her interpretation of the observations that she made during her sexual assault examination of B.D. was based largely on B.D.\u2019s version of events. Thus, without B.D.\u2019s story, Nurse Bresee lacked any factual context to interpret her observations. Thus, B.D.\u2019s credibility played a pivotal role for the jury, as well as for Nurse Bresee and Karolyn Tontarski, in determining how to interpret the scientific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In any event, how the erroneously excluded evidence would have impacted the jury\u2019s verdict is for it to decide. Based on my review, I conclude that there is a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the erroneously excluded evidence could have resulted in a different verdict for Taylor. Therefore, I would have granted him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">ELDRIDGE, J. has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">.

The importance of testing an accuser\u2019s credibility was highlighted in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeLawder, </em>28 Md.App. 212, 344 A.2d 446 (1975), where the Court of Special Appeals, in a postconviction proceeding, held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974) warranted granting DeLawder a new trial. Lee Franklin DeLawder, on re-trial, was convicted of carnal knowledge of a female under the age of 14. <em>DeLawder, </em>28 Md.App. at 213, 344 A.2d at 447. At trial, DeLawder\u2019s strategy was to show the jury that the prosecutrix falsely claimed she was raped by him because she thought she was pregnant and feared having to tell her mother that she was pregnant as a result of her voluntary sexual activity. <em>DeLawder, </em>28 Md.App. at 220, 344 A.2d at 451. In order for DeLawder\u2019s strategy to succeed, he attempted to introduce evidence that the prosecutrix had engaged in prior acts of sexual intercourse. The trial judge correctly refused to allow DeLawder to introduce this evidence under then existing legal precedent. <em>DeLawder, </em>28 Md.App. at 215, 344 A.2d at 448. The Supreme Court's subsequent decision in <em>Davis, </em>however, required that DeLawder be allowed to attack the prosecutrix's credibility in order to preserve his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Right. <em>DeLawder, </em>28 Md.App. at 227, 344 A.2d at 454-55. In applying the <em>Davis </em>decision, the <em>DeLawder </em>court recognized, unlike the majority here, that the credibility of a witness, especially one that is essential to the State's case, is everything, and that an appellate court \"cannot speculate ... as to whether the jury, as the sole judge of the credibility of a witness, would have accepted this line of reasoning had counsel been permitted to present it fully.\u201d <em>DeLawder, </em>28 Md.App. at 226, 344 A.2d at 454. This same appreciation for the fragility of credibility determinations made by the jury should have resulted in Taylor receiving a new trial. Unfortunately, the majority has taken upon itself to usurp the role of Taylor\u2019s jury and conclude that there was enough evidence to uphold his conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\">. In <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 468 A.2d 319 (1983), this Court held that a defendant should be permitted to impeach a prosecutrix concerning prior misconduct in the form of a false accusation against another individual. In <em>Cox, </em>the defendant attempted to impeach the prosecutrix's credibility by inquiring about a previous accusation of assault that she made against another individual, which she later recanted. <em>Cox, </em>298 Md. at 177, 468 A.2d at 320. The trial judge prohibited Cox from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>cross-examining the prosecutrix on this matter, and he eventually was convicted of numerous sexual offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment. <em>Cox, </em>298 Md. at 175-77, 468 A.2d at 320-21. We reversed Cox\u2019s conviction and rejected the State\u2019s argument that prohibiting Cox from impeaching the prosecutrix\u2019s credibility on her prior false accusation was harmless. <em>Cox, </em>298 Md. at 184-85, 468 A.2d at 324-25. In holding that the trial judge\u2019s error was not harmless, we noted that \u2018\u2018[djespite some corroborating physical evidence, the prosecution\u2019s case against <em>Cox </em>was based <em>on the </em>testimony of the victim.\u201d <em>Cox, </em>298 Md. at 185, 468 A.2d at 324. Consequently, the prosecution against Taylor was based almost entirely on B.D.\u2019s testimony which was articulated through the State\u2019s witnesses. Just like in <em>Cox, </em>B.D.\u2019s credibility was critical to the State\u2019s case. When the trial judge erroneously prevented Taylor's jury from hearing evidence that B.D. had a history of lying about his sexual past, the trial judge essentially guaranteed a guilty verdict for Taylor. This Court's refusal to vacate Taylor's conviction and grant him a new trial, in my opinion, only demonstrates the failure of the majority to appreciate the important role that credibility plays in a jury\u2019s interpretation of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
