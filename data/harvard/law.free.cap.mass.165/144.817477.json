It would seem that a motion to quash on this ground, made for the first time in the Superior Court, came too late. Pub. Sts. c. 214, \u00a7 25. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>11 Allen, 238. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>111 Mass. 420. But if the point may be taken, the answer is that the district court as well as the justices of it had the power to receive complaints. St. 1893, c. 396, \u00a7\u00a7 42, 43.
