They were a barber\u2019s shop and chair and divers other articles of furniture designed to be used in furnishing a barber\u2019s shop. The plaintiff was a minor, and he had no means of support except what he earned. The law does not contemplate that a minor shall open a shop and become a trader, or the proprietor of a business which involves the making of a variety of contracts. This has long been settled by the authorities. <em>Tupper </em>v. Cadwell, 12 Met. 559. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>13 Met. 306. <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>11 Cush. 40. <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Bardwell, </em>126 Mass. 366. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>138 Mass. 310. <em>Pyne </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>145 Mass. 558. It is clear that the articles in question were not necessaries. If they had been hand tools to a reasonable amount, such as are ordinarily provided by a journeyman, and necessary for use in his trade or business, the case would be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
