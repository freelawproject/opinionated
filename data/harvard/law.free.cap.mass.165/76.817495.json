Hearing before <em>Maynard, </em>J., who reported the case for the determination of this court, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8H\">Reuben Champion, who was the husband of the plaintiff, took out a certain policy of insurance on his life for the sum of $1,000, payable on his death to the plaintiff in her own right, in the State Mutual Life Assurance Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7k\">Champion died testate on or about February 15, 1894. At the time of his death the policy was a valid and subsisting policy of insurance, on which the sum of $1,000 was thereupon due and payable to such person as is found upon this proceeding to be lawfully entitled thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACk\">The defendant has now in his possession the policy of insuranee.

After the making of these notes, Champion was duly adjudged a bankrupt by proceedings under the bankruptcy laws then in force; and under such proceedings he received a full discharge of his then existing debts and liabilities, on March 18, 1876. The above notes were due and provable in bankruptcy against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AaY\">The defendant\u2019s testator proved against Champion, in such bankruptcy proceedings, the note for $330, for which the testator held, at the time of such proof, the policy of insurance as security, by virtue of the assignment above mentioned. The testator, when making proof of his claim against Champion in the bankruptcy proceedings, did not surrender for the benefit of the bankrupt\u2019s estate or creditors the policy of insurance, or release or assign for the benefit of the bankrupt\u2019s estate or creditors the policy, or the testator\u2019s interest therein j but the testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>did, in his proof of claim, make oath that <em>\u201c </em>for which said sum of $298.29 and interest as aforesaid, (which was the balance due on the note proved, deducting the sum of $125.34, the amount of a debt due from McFarland to Champion,) or any part thereof, this deponent says he has not, nor has any person by his order, or to this deponent\u2019s knowledge or belief, for his use, had or received any manner of satisfaction or security whatsoever. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-3\">The defendant\u2019s testator signed his assent to the discharge of Champion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-4\">A decree was entered dismissing the bill. If the decree was erroneous, it was to be set aside, and the case remanded to the Superior Court for such further decree as this court might order; otherwise, the decree was to be affirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-5\"><em>H.

The first question is, what effect did the discharge which Champion obtained have upon the demands so held by McFarland. If it extinguished them, then clearly they were not subsisting at the time of the farmer\u2019s decease. If they were not extinguished, then it must follow that they were subsi sting in some form at the time of Champion\u2019s death, since it is not contended that they were paid or satisfied; and the question then arises whether McFarland\u2019s estate held them as creditor within the fair construction of the assignment. It is to be observed that one of the notes was proved in bankruptcy by McFarland against Champion, a debt of the former to the latter being allowed in the proof in set-off, but that the other and larger note was not proved, though it is found that it was due and provable. The operation of the discharge upon this note was not affected, however, by the fact that it was not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-26\">We think that the discharge did not extinguish the debt or demand. It released the debtor from the legal obligation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>he was under to pay the notes, and took away from the creditor the right to enforce the payment of them. But the debt was not paid or satisfied. That still remained as a moral obligation on the part of the debtor, and was sufficient to sustain a new promise if he had seen fit to make one waiving the statute bar. <em>Maxim </em>v. Morse, 8 Mass. 127. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>3 Pick. 207. <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>1 Met. 520, 522. <em>Way </em>v. <em>Sperry, </em>6 Cush. 238. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Shearman, </em>103 Mass. 21. <em>Dusenbury </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>53 N. Y. 521. <em>Shippey </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>14 Johns. 178. <em>Betton </em>v. <em>Cutts, 11 N. </em>H. 170, 179. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Neally, </em>20 N. H. 464. <em>Corliss </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>28 Maine, 550. <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Gazlin, </em>31 Maine, 567. <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Bennet, </em>4 Camp. 205. <em>Trueman </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>Cowp. 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The effect of a discharge in bankruptcy is analogous to that of the bar of the statute of limitations or of infancy except in the case of necessaries; though it is said that a party is not to be deprived of his right to rely on his discharge unless he has used words that plainly mean to renounce it. <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>139 Mass. 12. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>18 Wall. 1. The running of the statute of limitations puts an end to the remedy to which it applies, not to the debt. <em>Ilsley </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>3 Met. 439. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>2 Gray, 148. <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Franklin Ins. Co. </em>114 Mass. 155. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Silloway, </em>145 Mass. 503, 506, 507. If the debt was not extinguished by the discharge, and has not been paid or satisfied, then it follows that the security may be availed of for the payment of it, if McFarland or his estate can be regarded as a creditor having a subsisting demand at the time of Champion\u2019s decease, and there is no other valid objection. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>19 Pick. 535. <em>Ipswich Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Story, </em>5 Met. 310, 312. <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Franklin Ins. Co. </em>114 Mass. 155. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>142 Mass. 433, 435. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Silloway, </em>145 Mass. 503. We are not aware of any case which holds that the word \u201c creditor \u201d means under all circumstances a person having an obligation against another which is capable of legal enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">To give it that meaning here would be to hold that the parties contemplated that the security should continue if Champion remained solvent, but not if he became bankrupt and got a discharge. The object of the parties in giving and taking the assignment was clearly to secure to McFarland the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>of any debt that was due or that might become due to him from Champion. And we think that, the debt which the assignment was given to secure not having been paid or satisfied at Champion\u2019s' decease, McFarland fairly may be regarded as a creditor having a subsisting demand within the meaning of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\">The plaintiff further objects, that McFarland waived the security by omitting in the proof any \"reference to it, and by making oath that he had no security, and by assenting to the discharge. The policy, though issued upon the life of Champion, was for the use of his wife, and was made payable to her. She was the beneficiary, and entitled to the proceeds, and she executed the assignment with her husband. The case presented is therefore one where the security really comes, not from the bankrupt, but from a third party. We have not deemed it necessary to consider whether, under such circumstances, in a case to which the United States bankrupt act applies, the rule laid down in <em>Lanckton </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>6 Met. 305, should govern, or that which appears to have been followed in the United States courts and in England. <em>In re Cram, </em>1 <em>Nat. </em>Bankr. Reg. 504. <em>In re Alexander, </em>1 Lowell, 470, 472. <em>In re Holbrook, </em>2 Lowell, 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">The plaintiff is the executrix of Reuben Champion, and his widow. As executrix, her only interest in the policy is to collect the proceeds and pay them over to herself as beneficiary. In either capacity it is immaterial to her whether McFarland did or did not refer to the policy in his proof, or did or did not assent to the discharge. The only parties interested were the assignee and creditors, and they do not appear to have interposed any objection, and the plaintiff does not appear to have acquired any rights under them so as to be able to set up McFarland\u2019s proceedings as an estoppel. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Farrington, </em>104 Mass. 212. It may be added, that so far as the assent to \u25a0 the discharge was concerned, it was, if anything, favorable to Champion\u2019s estate, and not a matter of which the plaintiff justly could complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-29\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
