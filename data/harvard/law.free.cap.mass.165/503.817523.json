Writ dated July 9,1894. Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Dunbar, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AyZ1\">There was evidence tending to show that the note in suit was delivered to one Chevalier for the plaintiff; that the consideration therefor was the cancellation of a note of earlier date, which had been given by the defendants to Chevalier, a witness for the plaintiff; and that the consideration for the first note had been money loaned by the plaintiff. During the cross-examination of Chevalier, and in direct examination of each of the defendants, the defendants\u2019 counsel offered to prove that, at the time of giving each of the notes, and as a part of each transaction, it was agreed by and between Chevalier and the defendants that the payment of the notes was not to be called for until after Chevalier had sold for the defendants, who were artists, some of their paintings, and that the note was to be paid out of the proceeds; that payment was to be deferred until that time; and that no suit was to be brought, and nothing was to be done in regard to the collection of the note. The judge excluded the evidence, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-5\"><em>C.
