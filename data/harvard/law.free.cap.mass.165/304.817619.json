This section is as follows: \u201c No mortgage of household furniture on which interest is charged at the rate of eighteen per centum or more per annum, made to secure a loan of less than one thousand dollars, shall be valid unless it state with substantial accuracy the amount of the loan, the time for which the loan is made, the rate of interest to be paid, and the actual expense of making and securing the loan, nor unless it contain a provision that the debtor shall be notified in the manner provided in section seven of chapter one hundred and ninety-two of the Public Statutes, of the time and place of any sale to be made in foreclosure proceedings at least seven days before such sale.\u201d The statute is entitled, \u201c An Act relative to the discharge of small loans and the redemption of the security given for such loans.\u201d The first section, in regard to the discharge of loans, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>provides in each case for the payment of the \u201c actual expenses of making the loan and securing the same.\u201d The section quoted above refers exclusively to mortgages of household furniture, and the purpose of it apparently is to provide special safeguards for the protection of articles used in the household, which their owner, under the pressure of necessity, has conveyed as security for the payment of borrowed money.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The provision requiring the insertion in the mortgage of a statement of the \u201c actual expense of making and securing the loan \u201d is not applicable to a mortgage like that in the case at bar. While in a broad sense of the word the credit given for the price of goods sold may be called a loan, it is not a loan in the ordinary and usual sense of the word, and we think it is not a loan within the meaning of the statute. The language here used has reference primarily to money furnished to another to be repaid, and it is not intended to include credits given for goods sold upon which a mortgage is taken back by way of security. The ruling at the trial was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the finding.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
