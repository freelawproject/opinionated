In these respects the defendant is not a public charitable corporation, but one established for the peculiar benefit of its members. For this reason the case is not governed by <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Massachusetts General Hospital, </em>120 Mass. 432. The defendant has no right to exemption from liability for such negligence as the evidence stated in the report tended to show, but, like a religious society, is liable therefor. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Central Congregational Society, </em>129 Mass. 367; <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Boston Catholic Cemetery Association, </em>146 Mass. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\n<em>Verdict set aside, and new trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
