Sts. c. 91, \u00a7 84, as amended by St. 1887, c. 314, \u00a7 1, to the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, alleging that the defendant, on March 11, 1895, had in his possession seventy-four lobsters each \u201c less than ten and one half inches in length, measuring from the extremity of the bone projecting from the head to the end of the bone of the middle flipper of the tail of each of the said lobsters extended on its back its natural length.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-9\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Fessenden, J., the case was submitted to the jury upon the following agreed statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-10\">The defendant, in March, 1895, was carrying on the business of dealing in lobsters in Boston, under the name of the New, England Lobster Company. On the 11th of that month, two members of the district police found in the defendant\u2019s store four barrels covered with sacking, hooped down and nailed, and each marked with a tag, on which was printed the words \u201c From New England Lobster Company,\u201d and some written words, the name of some person addressed, \u201c New York City, N. Y. By Express.\u201d The officers found in one barrel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>twenty-three short lobsters, and short lobsters in the other three barrels, all under ten inches from the bone in the head to the end of the middle flipper, being seventy-four in all. The lobsters had arrived on the morning of that day from Nova Scotia, consigned by parties there to the defendant in Boston, had been opened and repacked for the removal of dead fish if any, and had not been offered or intended for sale in this Commonwealth. It was agreed that there are some lobsters in every package shipped from Nova Scotia less than ten inches in length, the statute limit there being less than that prescribed in this Commonwealth. The lobsters had been charged upon the defendant\u2019s books, and each barrel, after being covered and nailed up and tagged with the name and address as charged, was placed where it was found by the officers for the express company to take, the express company being notified to call for the packages, and was billed out. There are few lobsters caught in the waters of Massachusetts at that season of the year, the defendant only having fourteen, all of full size, during the month of March.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-3\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that, under the statutes, he was not liable, and no forfeiture could be imposed. The judge refused so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and' the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-5\"><em>W. E. </em>Jewell, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoC_\">contended, among other things, that <em>\u201c </em>the location of the packages, under the strict construction and presumption of which the court will give the defendant the benefit, shows no more than temporary custody of another\u2019s property.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-6\"><em>M. J. </em>Sughrue, First Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b417-7\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2AH\">This case was submitted to the jury upon a written statement of facts, which were admitted to be true, and upon which the defendant asked the court to rule that he could not be convicted. This ruling was rightly refused. The defendant now contends that \u201c the location of the packages, under the strict construction and presumption of which the court will give the defendant the benefit, shows no more than temporary custody of another\u2019s property.\u201d But the jury might draw the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>inferences that might have been drawn if the Commonwealth had introduced evidence to prove exactly the same facts which were admitted in the agreed statement. If the defendant had any other evidence to explain or qualify those facts, it was open to him to introduce it. In the absence of any such evidence, the jury might draw reasonable inferences as to his relation to the lobsters, and might find that he was not merely a forwarding agent for the Nova Scotia owners. We are not, therefore, called on to determine whether, as the defendant argues, a mere forwarding agent should not be deemed to be in possession of the lobsters within the meaning of St. 1887, c. 314, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">The objection that the statute does not apply to lobsters caught out of the Commonwealth cannot prevail. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Savage, 155 Mass. 278. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
