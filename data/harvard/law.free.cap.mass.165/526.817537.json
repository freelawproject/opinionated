C. O. 54020; shortly before four o\u2019clock I boarded a train for Springfield; I took a seat in the second car; shortly after passing through the tunnel, after leaving New York, the defendant collected my ticket and those of my companions; I was seated on the inside; my ticket was in my hat; I.was reading a newspaper when he took my ticket; I heard him say, 6 Are you going through ? \u2019 he turned to the passengers on the Other side, and I heard him use bis punch. [On July 22,1 came to Springfield, and from that day to the fourth day of August I was engaged in shadowing the defendant; on four days of each week he came in at 7.27 P.

I made a memorandum on the evening of each day. On August 9 I bought a ticket at the Grand Central station; I noticed the conductor when he came in ; I was sitting on the second last seat; I did n\u2019t see him when he took my ticket; the first stop was New Haven; the next time I saw the ticket was in the police court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-7\">Henry Dotzer, a witness for the government, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-8\">\u201c In June, July, and August, 1894, I lived in Hoboken, New Jersey, and was in the employ of Thiel\u2019s Detective Agency of New York City; [from July 17 to August 17, I had the defendant under surveillance almost daily; on several occasions, on leaving the train at Springfield at 7.27 P.

M.; three fourths of the time he went into Mesick\u2019s; on one occasion he and Mesick were in Mesick\u2019s store, and as I walked by on the opposite side of the street I saw the lights of two cigars; on several occasions the defendant would come down in the morning, stop at Mesick\u2019s, at Gruendler\u2019s, or go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>over to the depot, or walk about town, and then go back to Mesick\u2019s ; every day he was off he would go to Mesick\u2019s; he had nothing with him that I could see; I have seen the defendant and Mesick come out together; sometimes Mesick would lock the door and go away after the defendant left; ] I was in Springfield the night the defendant was arrested.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">On cross-examination, the witness testified as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">\u201c The defendant was arrested August 17; during the time I was here it was rather light on some occasions; when I saw the light from the two cigars it was dark; I could n\u2019t see the two men, but I could see the lights from the cigars; Mesick was n\u2019t at home every day, I saw him coming from New York twice; I don\u2019t know on how many other occasions he was away; on one or two occasions Mesick\u2019s wife was there and some others, but they came right out again; I don\u2019t know whether there was any one else there or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\">Sliubal F.

There must be an intent in fraudulent acts, but the mere intent without anything further is not embezzlement. There must be an intent to do the fraudulent act, arid some act toward it, and it differs from larceny. Now larceny is the taking of the property of another which is in the possession of another, or which he has a right to possess, and converting it to one\u2019s own use. In embezzlement, it is the converting to one\u2019s own use the property of another which has been intrusted to the party who is charged with the embezzlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-9\">\u201c The claim of the government is, that, if you shall find the facts proved as stated, this act of this defendant is an act of embezzlement, and not an act of larceny.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-10\">\u201cThe government contends that he was intrusted with the business by this corporation of taking up tickets which passengers had purchased, \u2014 taking them up and bringing them to some place designated by the corporation and delivering them there; but that after he had taken up this ticket, instead of carrying it to the corporation and depositing it with the corporation, as he was required to do, he carried it off, or took it away and sold it, converted it to his own use, so that it never came into the hands of the corporation. If this is true, that he was a servant of this corporation and took up the ticket, and if he had carried it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the corporation and put it into its proper place and delivered it to the servants who were to receive it, and then, after he had delivered it in the way he was required to do, he afterwards went and got the ticket, that would not have been embezzlement, but would have been larceny.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\">\u201c But that distinction need not trouble you so far as this case is concerned. The question is, Did this party receive rightfully from this passenger this particular ticket, and did he, without turning it over to the corporation, dispose of it, either by concealment or by gift or for sale, or put it into somebody\u2019s else hands for sale in this Commonwealth.

Now, he is to be tried for the embezzlement of this ticket, and not for any other, because this is the one that the Commonwealth relies upon. If you shall be satisfied that he has embezzled many others before and after, and are not satisfied that he had embezzled this one, then he should be acquitted, because he is only tried for this one offence; and the only purpose for which that evidence was introduced by the government, and allowed to be introduced, was for you to draw fair, reasonable inferences from his actions in connection with this particular one as to what was his intent and purpose in relation to this ticket. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-7\">\u201c The government contends that a man, Holmes, I believe, bought this ticket at the Grand Central station in New York, being two coupons, one running to New Haven, and the other from New Haven to Springfield; and they assert from the testimony of Holmes that this ticket was taken up by the defendant, and that he, the defendant, remained the conductor of this train until he arrived at Springfield, and that this ticket was brought by him to Springfield, and here disposed of; that it was not turned over, as it ought to have been, and as the rules of the corporation required, but that the defendant in some way, either by gift or by sale or otherwise, put it upon the market, in other words, converted it to his own use. It is not necessary for you to find what particular use he intended for it, or what he got for it. If he did not turn it over to the corporation, and intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>deprive the corporation of it, then the offence will be made out so far as that part is concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-3\">\u201c It is incumbent on the government to prove that he was in the employ of the railroad corporation. You have heard the testimony in regard to that.. It is incumbent on the government to prove that this was the property of the railroad corporation. You have heard that this was issued by the railroad corporation, that it was their property; and then you heard the testimony of the witness that he bought this ticket at the station in New York, and the testimony of the same witness that he received this ride upon it\" for the price paid from New York to Springfield, and that he delivered the ticket up to this conductor. Now, if these are the facts, that this was once the property of the railroad corporation by their printing it and issuing it, and that it was afterwards purchased by this passenger, that he received the ride which it called for, and it was delivered up to this conductor, then I must instruct you that this ticket became the property of the railrbad corporation. So that if, after this ride was made, this defendant here in this county disposed of this ticket, it was disposing of the property which belonged to this corporation. The government must satisfy you that he did the acts with the intention of appropriating this ticket to his own use, or, in other words, of depriving the railroad corporation of this property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-4\">\u201cNow it makes no difference where the intent began, whether it was in New York or Connecticut, or wherever it may be, it did not become embezzlement until it was consummated by the conductor\u2019s parting with this property ; and wherever you find that his first intent was, if his intent continued, and the parting of the property\u2014the consummation of it \u2014 was not until he arrived here in Springfield, or arrived in this county, why then the offence was committed in this county. Of course a man cannot be convicted in this county of an offence committed in New York or anywhere else; it must be an offence committed-in this jurisdiction. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-5\">\u201c Now, you will take this case, remembering that this defendant has been tried simply upon this one transaction, and the evidence in regard to other transactions, and the evidence of his going to see Mesiek at different times, the evidence which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>satisfy you that he had committed other offences, you are to use only as throwing light upon his transaction in regard to this. If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the railroad company owned this ticket, that they issued the ticket as their property, that the witness who testified purchased it, that the conductor, the defendant, took it up, that he brought it here to Springfield, that he did not deliver it, but turned it over and used it for some other purpose, and deprived the corporation of the ticket, and you shall find that to be of some value, then the defendant is guilty ; if you have any reasonable doubt about it, you should find him not guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b557-6\">The case was argued at the bar in September, 1895, and after-wards was submitted on briefs to all the judges.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b557-7\"><em>J.

If the indictment had contained the word \u201cand\u201d between the different allegations naming the property embezzled, it would have been perfect in form. We think the omission of this word is not fatal to it. It was evidently the intention of the pleader to charge the embezzlement of fifty pieces of paper, and also of fifty railroad tickets, so that his proof might be applied to either description that was deemed proper. It has repeatedly been held that an indictment charging larceny of a certain number of pieces of paper, each of a certain stated value, is good. <em>Regina </em>v. Perry, 1 Car. &amp; K. 725. <em>Rex </em>v. Mead, 4 Car. &amp; P. 535. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Bingley, </em>5 Car. <em>&amp; </em>P. 602. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Vyse, </em>1 Moody C. C. 218. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>4 Cox C. C. 336. \u201c No greater particularity in the description of the property is required, in an indictment for embezzlement, than in one for larceny. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Concannon, </em>5 Allen, 502. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butterick, </em>100 Mass. 1.\u201d Per Colburn, J., in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>137 Mass. 98, 106. The term \u201c railroad tickets \u201d is a sufficient description of property without a more particular statement of what the tickets are. There is no such difference between pieces of paper and railroad tickets in reference to the statutes punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ing embezzlement as to make it improper to charge an embezzlement of both kinds of property in the same count.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\">An ordinary railroad ticket in such form as to show that an innocent holder of it is entitled to ride over a railroad ought to be considered either a certificate of the payment of fare and of the acquisition of a right to ride, or a valuable contract in force, being the informal printed statement given by the railroad corporation as its agreement to carry the bearer over its railroad. The fourth request for an instruction was therefore rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The defendant made several requests for instructions based upon the theory that there was some evidence which would have warranted the jury in finding that the defendant appropriated the ticket outside of this Commonwealth. There was evidence that the ticket on which the government relied was sold on August 9, 1894, to one Holmes, a detective, in New York, and entitled the purchaser to a ride from New York to Springfield. Holmes testified that this ticket was taken by the defendant soon after leaving New York. It was the duty of the defendant, on his arrival in Springfield, to return this ticket to the office of the railroad company on the day he received it. The defendant was arrested on August 17, and up to this time the ticket had not been returned. There was also evidence that the defendant was in the habit, from some time prior to August 9 down to the time of his arrest, of trading tickets for produce at a shop in Springfield kept by one Mesick, and that this ticket was procured from Mesick on the morning of the defendant\u2019s arrest. We find no statement in the bill of exceptions whether the ticket had been punched by the defendant or not; but the trial proceeded upon the ground that the ticket in question had not been punched, and we assume this to be the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">On this state of facts, we are of opinion that the defendant was not entitled to the instructions requested. Our statutory provisions relating to embezzlement provide that one who embezzles \u201c shall be deemed guilty of simple larceny,\u201d or <em>\u201c </em>deemed guilty of larceny.\u201d Pub. Sts. c. 203, \u00a7\u00a7 37, 39, 40, 41, 43. The crime, therefore, which a person commits who violates the provisions of these sections, is that of larceny. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Pratt, 132 Mass. 246. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Holder, 9 Gray, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>7, it was stated by Chief Justice Shaw to be the settled law of this Commonwealth that a pel\u2019s on who committed larceny in another State and brought the stolen property here, could be punished for larceny here. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cullins, </em>1 Mass. 116; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>2 Mass. 14; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>7 Met. 475, 477; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Uprichard, </em>3 Gray, 434. In the case last cited, while the doctrine above stated was admitted, it was held not to apply to the case of goods stolen in one of the British Provinces, and brought here.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The offence of embezzlement has been often stated to be larceny committed by a certain class of persons, without a trespass, or, in other words, a statutory larceny. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macloon, </em>101 Mass. 1, 6; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>123 Mass. 430, 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">It may be suggested that the doctrine above stated in regard to larceny at common law rests upon a legal fiction, namely, that by taking the stolen property into another State the thief commits a new taking, and that in embezzlement there is no wrongful taking. But we do not see why it may not equally well be said that, so long as a person who embezzles property continues in possession of it, he newly converts it. In England it is well settled that a person may commit an act in one county which renders him liable to be there indicted for embezzlement, and yet he may commit another act in relation to the same property in another county for which he may be there indicted for embezzlement. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>3 B. &amp; P. 596. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>Russ. &amp; Ry. 56. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>2 Den. C. C. 298. <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>3 Q. B. D. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Since 1878, we have had a statute which seems broad enough to cover the case of a person having embezzled property in his possession, without regard to the place where he first embezzled it. As first passed it read as follows: \u201c A person charged with embezzlement may be complained of, or indicted, tried, and sentenced, in any county in which he had possession of the property alleged to have been embezzled.\u201d St. 1878, c. 105. This was re-enacted in the Pub. Sts. c. 213, \u00a7 20, so as to read as follows: <em>\u201c </em>The offence of embezzlement may be prosecuted and punished in any county in which the person charged had possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>property alleged to have been embezzled.\u201d While the language of the two acts differs, the meaning is the same. The statute clearly recognizes the principle that embezzlement is a continuing act, so long as the embezzler has possession of the property. If it had been intended to limit the effect of the act to the case of the first act of embezzlement taking place in this State, different language would have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We are of opinion, therefore, that he could be indicted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The defendant was not prejudiced by the testimony of States. The various acts and resolves introduced in evidence show that the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad Company, although acting under legislative authority from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York, is, in the transaction of business, but a single corporation. In the language of the indictment, it was \u201c duly and legally established \u201d in Massachusetts, as well as in Connecticut and New York, but its money and other property belong to a single owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">There was no error in the admission of the tickets taken from Gunn by the city marshal, nor in the introduction of the rule of the railroad company in regard to punching tickets with an extra baggage punch, nor of the testimony of the witnesses Holmes, Dotzer, Butterfield, and Gunn. Until the evidence was all in, it was not known whether the Commonwealth would be called upon to elect upon which ticket or tickets it would rely. Most, if not all of this evidence was competent for consideration upon the issue as it was finally submitted to the jury after the election by the district attorney. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In the opinion of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Allen, the exceptions should be overruled, but upon a narrower ground, which may be expressed as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Where a servant\u2019s duty in respect to his master\u2019s property in his care or custody is continuous, and extends over different States, and his first duty of accounting to his master for the property arises here, an embezzlement by him which is begun in another State but is not manifested there by any known overt act, and which is continued in this State, and is made complete and manifest here by an intentional failure or refusal to turn over the property as he is bound to\" do, is an offence for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>he may be indicted and punished as an embezzlement committed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">Mr. Justice Knowlton dissents from that part of the opinion which holds that our decisions in regard to larceny should be so extended as to make an act of embezzlement committed in another State punishable in this Commonwealth, and from that which makes the Pub. Sts. c. 213, \u00a7 20, applicable to such an act of embezzlement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
