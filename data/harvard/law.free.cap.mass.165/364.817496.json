Still the price of goods is not necessarily the consideration. It is the advantage on one side or disadvantage on the other which forms the consideration. In cases of exchange, for instance, there is no price, yet there is a consideration. At any rate, the terms of payment are distinguishable from the consideration itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-9\">4. In this case, the price of goods furnished Gagn\u00e9 was not the consideration of the contract of guaranty between the plaintiff and the defendant. It was the advantage derived by Gagn\u00e9 in getting goods under the guaranty which formed the consideration here. Therefore, the price of goods furnished the principal debtor and the time of payment became essential elements of the contract of guaranty, and should have been in the writing.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhW\">The guaranty sued on is undoubtedly ambiguous. It is as follows: \u201c Fall River, March 17th, 1890. I hereby agree to hold myself responsible for all goods bought by A. P. Gagn\u00e9 of Mark A. Sullivan. George E. Arcand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">For the purpose of showing what this guaranty means, it was competent to show the facts known to the parties with reference to which the guaranty was given. It appears from the auditor\u2019s report that the plaintiff was a wholesale and retail dealer in painters\u2019 supplies in Fall River; that A. P. Gagn\u00e9, in March, 1890, went into business as a painter; that a few days before March 17, the defendant, Gagn\u00e9, and the plaintiff had an interview relating to the plaintiff\u2019s furnishing Gagn\u00e9 with goods; that the plaintiff agreed to furnish them if the defendant would guarantee payment; that in pursuance of such an arrangement the defendant signed the guaranty declared on; and that after the guaranty was signed, the plaintiff, on March 17, 1890, and from time to time up to July 18, 1890, furnished Gagn\u00e9 with goods. On March 17, 1890, Gagn\u00e9 ordered goods to the amount of $210, and afterwards gave other orders, all of which were filled. Gagn\u00e9 paid something on account, but there was a balance remaining unpaid. The defendant \u201c was notified by plaintiff\u2019s clerk of the condition of Gagn\u00e9\u2019s account while the bill was being run up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Upon the question whether the guaranty should be construed as a continuing guaranty, or as confined to the single purchase of goods by Gagn\u00e9 on March 17, the fact that Gagn\u00e9 as a painter desired to purchase goods to be used in his business, which was known to the defendant, seems to us competent evidence ; and it is fairly to be inferred from the auditor\u2019s report that it was understood that the purchases were to be made from time to time, as Gagn\u00e9 might need the goods in his business. The guaranty is a contract collateral to the contract or contracts made between the plaintiff and Gagn\u00e9; and what the contemplated contract or contracts between them were, if known to the parties to this suit, is, as between such parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>a fact with reference to which the guaranty was given. Interpreting the guaranty with reference to the facts found by the auditor, although the case is a close one, we think that the court rightly held that it was a continuing guaranty. At the time the guaranty was given no goods had been bought, and the guaranty may well be held to cover all goods which might be bought. <em>Bent </em>v. Hartshorn, 1 Met. 24. <em>Stoops </em>v. Smith, 100 Mass. 63. <em>Melendy </em>v. Capen, 120 Mass. 222. <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. Barnes, 34 Conn. 27. <em>Heffield </em>v. Meadows, L. R. 4 C. P. 595. <em>White's Bank </em>v. Myles, 73 N. Y. 335. Brandt, Suretyship &amp; Guaranty, (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 156 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"><em>We </em>infer from the exceptions that before the trial the defendant filed a motion to recommit the auditor\u2019s report for the alleged reason, among others, that the auditor had misinterpreted the guaranty and had wrongly admitted oral evidence to control or modify its meaning, and that this motion was denied. At the trial, the plaintiff offered the auditor\u2019s report in evidence, to which the defendant objected for the same reason, and the court admitted it, and the defendant excepted. The auditor\u2019s report was the only evidence in the case. The practice, when it appears that an auditor has found material facts upon incompetent evidence, is shown in <em>Collins </em>v. Wickwire, 162 Mass. 143, and in cases there cited. If it be assumed that on a motion seasonably made before the trial to recommit an auditor\u2019s report upon the ground that certain material facts have been found by the auditor upon incompetent evidence, the moving party, if it so appears, has the right to have the report recommitted, or discharged, or the facts so found stricken from the report, we think that, if the motion is denied, an exception to this action of the court should be taken at the time if the party desires ultimately to bring before this court any questions of law which may arise upon the denial of the motion. That was not done in this case. If the ground of objection to the report appears on the face of the report, the party may request suitable rulings at the trial. The auditor\u2019s report recites that, \u201c against defendant\u2019s objection, plaintiff was allowed to produce evidence tending to prove that it was the understanding of the parties that this [the guaranty] should apply to future advances.\u201d But we do not know what this evidence was. If it was only evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>dence of the arrangement made between the plaintiff and Gagn\u00e9, with reference to the purchase of goods by Gagn\u00e9, we think it was competent. It also appears in the report that for the same purpose \u201c plaintiff\u2019s counsel was allowed to ask plaintiff during his examination, \u2018 What was the talk between Mr. Arcand and you about Gagn\u00e9\u2019s buying goods and Arcand\u2019s becoming responsible for them ? \u2019 \u201d to which the defendant objected. We do not know what the answer was, but if the plaintiff answered that Gagn\u00e9 proposed to buy the goods of him from time to time, to be used in his business, and that the plaintiff had agreed to furnish them if the defendant would guarantee payment, we think the evidence was competent. We do not know that the auditor admitted any incompetent evidence. We are of opinion that the exceptions should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
