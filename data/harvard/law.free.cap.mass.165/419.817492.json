The resolution was duly approved by the mayor of the city, but no loan was negotiated. The trustees of the school were duly incorporated in July, 1895. The corporation was not possessed of real or personal property, and had made no contract, and had done no act looking to the establishment of the school. The incorporators were fifteen in number, and of these twelve were citizens and residents of Lowell, two of Boston, and one of Billerica. The act was not submitted to the citizens of the city for acceptance by popular vote, nor was the action of the city council in passing the resolution authorized or ratified by a vote of the citizens.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-7\"><em>J.

It is in aid of manufactures, which the Constitution (Part 2, c. 5, \u00a7 2) enjoins the Legislature to encourage, and the statute (St. 1895, c. 475) falls within the doctrine of <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>12 Allen, 500, and is constitutional.
