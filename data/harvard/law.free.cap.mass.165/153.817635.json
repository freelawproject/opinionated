She was then asked by the district attorney, \u201c Who were your assailants ? \u201d In reply she named and designated the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-9\">The defence was an alibi, and an issue of fact raised was the identity of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-10\">The government also called Dr. James P. Broderick, who testified that he attended Miss Meakin after nine o\u2019clock on the evening of the robbery, and she was then in a hysterical condition ; that he attended her the morning after the robbery, and also attended her the next morning thereafter; and that she was hysterical on both occasions. To the admission of this evidence the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-11\">William Schneider, a witness for the government, testified that he had known Miss Meakin for some time before the robbery, and just before it occurred \u201c she looked very well \u201d ; that he saw her several times after the robbery, and saw her at her house after her return from an asylum; and that on this occasion her health was poor and her condition was hysterical. To the admission of this evidence the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-12\">The defendants called one James T. Kelley, who testified, in substance, that he was with the defendant Flynn on the night of the robbery shortly before eight o\u2019clock at a place so far remote from the scene thereof as to make it impossible for Flynn to have participated therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-13\">On cross-examination as to his means of fixing the time of the occurrence and the time of the robbery, the district attorney, against the defendants\u2019 objections, was allowed to ask this witness the question, \u201c Did you associate Flynn with the robbery ? \u201d to which the witness replied, \u201c Tes \u201d ; the witness having previously said, on cross-examination, that his attention was called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>to the robbery on the day succeeding it, and that he then thought of Flynn. To the admission of this question and answer the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">One Albert Brown, a witness for the defendants, testified that he was with the defendant Droney, at the time of the robbery, in the city of Worcester. It appeared from the evidence in chief of this witness, that he had been arrested for complicity in this offence and held in the lock-up at Jamaica Plain, and brought before Miss Meakin there by the officers for identification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">On cross-examination, against the defendants\u2019 objection, the following question was put: \u201cMiss Meakin did not identify you as the man who assaulted her? \u201d and he answered \u201c No. I don\u2019t know as she saw me. I saw her. She could have seen me if she looked.\u201d To the admission of this evidence the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\">In rebuttal, the government called John H. Connor, a police officer, who testified that on the day of the robbery he saw the defendant Flynn and the witness Brown together, on Centre Street in Jamaica Plain ; that he fixed the time from the circumstance of the stealing of some electric wire which he reported to the police station at or about the time of the robbery; that his attention was called to the robbery in January; and that then, at the police station, he looked at a book of records of the police station. A book was then shown to the witness, whereupon he was asked, against the defendants\u2019 objection, \u201c Is this the book you looked at ? Is the report you made contained in that book ? \u201d To both of which questions he answered, \u201c Yes.\u201d Neither the book nor report which it was said to contain was read to the jury. To these questions and answers the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\">In the course of his charge to the jury, and referring to the evidence of Miss Meakin and the matter of the identity of the defendants, the judge said, \u201c She identifies them here at the trial without hesitation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-9\">At the end of the charge the defendants excepted to so much thereof as is comprised in the words above quoted. The judge thereupon, and referring to the use of the words to which the defendants took exception, instructed the jury as follows: \u2018\u201cI was then depending upon my recollection. It is for you to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>what the evidence is.\u201d Whereupon the defendants renewed their exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-6\"><em>J.

Upon an indictment for a robbery it is always competent to show the effect of the assault upon the person assaulted. The physician who attended Florence Meakin for two days after the robbery might well testify that she was hysterical when he saw her. The testimony of the witness Schneider was not admitted as the opinion of an expert, but as a description of the appearance of the person robbed, and of her apparent physical condition before the robbery and after it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sturtivant, 117 Mass. 122, and cases cited. The witness Kelley, having testified to facts which tended to prove an alibi for the defendant Flynn, and having said that his attention was called to the robbery on the next day after it occurred, and that he then thought of Flynn, the government, in cross-examination, for the purpose of fixing the time and testing Ins accuracy, was rightly permitted to ask him the question, \u201c Did you associate Flynn with the robbery ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The witness Brown had testified that he was in Worcester with the defendant Droney at the time of the robbery, and the defendants were not injured by the question put to him in cross-examination, \u201c Miss Meakin did not identify you as the man who assaulted her?\u201d and by his answer, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know as she saw me. I saw her. She could have seen me if she looked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">No error appears in permitting the witness Connor to refresh his recollection by looking at the book in which his report was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The only other exception is' to a remark of the judge in the course of his charge referring to the testimony of Miss Meakin : \u201c She identifies them here at the trial without hesitation.\u201d It is contended that the meaning of the word \u201c identify \u201d is to prove identical, or to prove to be the same, and that therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the remark was an expression of opinion in regard to the credibility of the witness, and not a mere statement of a part of the evidence. Pub. Sts. c. 153, \u00a7 5. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Foran, 110 Mass. 179, 180. It is not disputed that she testified without hesitation to her identification of the defendants as her assailants, and we think it clear that the judge used the word \u201c identifies \u201d in reference to her testimony in a colloquial sense as meaning \u201c asserts their identity. \u201d We do not think the jury could have been misled by the remark. Moreover, when his attention was directed to it, he said to the jury, \u201c I was then depending upon my recollection. It is for you to say what the evidence is.\u201d It was plainly his purpose to have the jury understand that they were not to consider his opinion of the credibility of the witness, if he had seemed to express it.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
