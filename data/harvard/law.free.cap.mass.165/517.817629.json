Moore, to the plaintiff, who was her husband. At the trial in the Superior Court, before Blodgett, J., it appeared that the plaintiff had received from the defendant $800, in full settlement of the claim; that the defendant held a release of all demands under seal executed by the plaintiff, and that before the bringing of the action the plaintiff did not tender the amount received by him to the defendant. At the request of the defendant, the judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-10\"><em>S.

There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>room for the suggestion that he was still to have a right of action left, and that the money was to apply only to a part of his claim. Under these circumstances he could not rescind the settlement and maintain an action on his claim without first returning the money which he received. <em>Drohan </em>v. <em>Lake Shore Michigan Southern </em>Railway, 162 Mass. 435, and cases there cited. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
