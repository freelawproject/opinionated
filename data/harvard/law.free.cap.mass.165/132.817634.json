It is this part which now is sued for. The rest has been paid, except twelve dollars and nineteen cents, as to which the only question is one of tender.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The case is governed by <em>Homer </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>11 Cush. 62, which is stronger than this. There the claim of the firm, which one partner had undertaken to set off against his own debt, was preexisting, so that his transaction was only an unauthorized attempt to discharge a valid claim, yet it was held that he could not rescind his own act, and that as he necessarily was one of the plaintiffs, they could not recover. Here the original terms on which the defendant accepted the goods were as we have stated, and the plaintiff who made the contract, at least, cannot recover on \u00e1 different contract from the one he made. It is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>that the agreed facts do not expressly state that the defendant acted in good faith, but that is immaterial. <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Lovell, </em>103 Mass. 387.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b153-7\"><em>P.
