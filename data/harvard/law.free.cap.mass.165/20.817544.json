Taylor. The first parcel was on Pleasant Street, and the lot conveyed by the defendant to the plaintiff is a part of it. The deed to Taylor contains the following language, next after the description of the real estate, to wit: \u201c This deed is made upon the conditions that within fifty years hereafter no buildings shall be erected or suffered to remain upon that parcel of land first above described, which fronts upon Pleasant Street and its continuation \u2018as above stated towards the Boston and Maine Railroad station, but thoroughly finished, first-class two-story detached dwelling-houses, with only such customary outbuildings as are required for them as dwelling-houses, and used in connection therewith, and that no part of any such dwelling-house shall be placed or suffered to remain nearer to said Pleasant Street or to its said continuation than fifteen feet distant therefrom, and that no part of such out or other building shall be placed or suffered to remain nearer to said Pleasant Street or its continuation than forty feet distant therefrom, with reversion to the grantor, his heirs and assigns, in case of any breach of such condition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">The \u201cparcel of land first above described,\u201d to which said conditions, agreements, or restrictions refer, is the parcel of which a part was conveyed by the deed from the defendant to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-8\">At the date of the deed to Taylor, Johnson owned a certain other parcel of land situate in Bradford, on the other side of Pleasant Street, together with buildings thereon, the same being occupied by Johnson as his residence. This residence is opposite the land conveyed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Johnson left heirs who are now living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-9\">On April 22, 1882, Taylor, by warranty deed in common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>form, of that date and duly recorded, conveyed to the defendant the land described in the deed from Johnson to Taylor, including the land conveyed by the defendant to the plaintiff, the deed containing covenants of warranty and against all encumbrances, but making no reference to the restrictions or conditions in the deed from Johnson to Taylor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">On October 26, 1881, by deed of that date duly recorded, the trustees under the will of Johnson conveyed the land and buildings, and its appurtenances, which Johnson had so occupied as a residence, to Harry H.

We do not think that such a construction should be given to the deed. Johnson\u2019s residence was on the opposite side of the street, and there is nothing in the deed, or in the manner of using or occupying the respective estates, or in their situation, which in terms or by necessary or reasonable implication shows that the provision was designed to subject the property that was conveyed to Taylor to an easement in favor of the premises where Johnson lived. The case is very different from <em>Merrifield </em>v. Cobleigh, 4 Cush. 178, on which the defendant relies. It probably was or would be an advantage to the premises where Johnson resided that houses built on the opposite side of the street should be set back a certain distance from the street line, and that outbuildings should not be nearer to it than a certain other distance. But we cannot by reason of that fact alone construe the provision as subjecting the lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>conveyed to an easement or servitude in favor of the premises occupied by Johnson. A more natural construction would be, it seems to us, that it was expected that other lots besides the one purchased by Taylor would be sold out of the tract of which that was a part, and that the condition or restriction which was inserted in the deed to him was one which it was expected would be inserted in other deeds, for the common benefit and advantage of parties so purchasing and their successors in title. Whether regarded as a condition or restriction, it constitutes an encumbrance. <em>Ayling </em>v. Kramer, 133 Mass. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The defendant has placed some stress on the use of the word \u201c assigns,\u201d in the provision creating the encumbrance. The right of entry for breach of a condition subsequent is not assignable, and if the provision is to be regarded as creating a condition subsequent the word was inapt. <em>Hopkins </em>v. Smith, 162 Mass. 444. We think that, if it is not to be rejected altogether, it is to be regarded as inserted rather to show that the condition or restriction was a continuing one, than with a purpose to establish an easement or servitude in favor of the premises occupied by Johnson as a residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">It is not necessary to consider whether, if an easement or servitude was created as contended by the defendant, it has been extinguished by the joining of the defendant\u2019s husband in her deed, and releasing \u201c all right . , . by courtesy or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
