The indictment is bad for duplicity, in conjunctively describing and alleging several offences in each count, when the statute makes them disjunctive. <em>2. </em>Uncertainty as to which offence of the statute is described, and the pleading in each count is alternative. 8. With reference to the same premeditated act describing and alleging in the same counts a simultaneous attempt to commit the crimes of assault with intent to rob, larceny, and confining in the second count, and also that of confining a person with intent to commit larceny. 4. The indictment is bad for both duplicity and uncertainty as to which offences, \u2014 robbery, assault with intent to rob, and confining a person \u2018 both with and without the -intent to commit larceny,\u2019 \u2014 is meant to be charged from the language in each count in the indictment. 5. There is no averment in each count that the language is but different descriptions of the same act, as the time and particulars of the offence are the same in each count of the indictment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-7\"><em>Gaslcill, </em>J. sustained the motion as to the second count, and overruled the same as to the first and third counts; and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-8\">At the trial, the judge instructed the jury, without objection, as to the third count, that the only offence therein charged was an assault with intent to commit larceny, and gave other instructions appropriate thereto, to which no objection was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-9\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>F. F. Sullivan J. M. </em>Sullivan, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b479-5\"><em>J. D. McLaughlin, </em>Second Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b479-6\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az_C\">The second count having been quashed, we have before us only the objections to the first and third counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The defendants contend that each count is bad for duplicity, and that a verdict of guilty on the two counts involves an inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">By Pub. Sts. c. 202, \u00a7 26, \u201c Whoever with intent to commit larceny . . . confines, maims, injures, or wounds, ... or puts in fear any person, for the purpose of stealing from a building,\u201d is made punishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The first count sufficiently charges the above offence, though with unnecessary averments as to the details of the intent and of the acts done, and without accurately following the language of the statute; but it is not open to the objection of duplicity, although all the elements of another offence, viz. assault and battery, are contained therein. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Harney, 10 Met. 422. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Brown, 14 Gray, 419, 430, 431. <em>Jennings </em>v. Commonwealth, 105 Mass. 586. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>116 Mass. 346. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barling, </em>129 Mass. 112. 1 Bish. Crim. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 434-439.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The third count appears to be founded upon the same section of the statutes, but alleges an \u201c assault,\u201d which word is not found in that section, and adds particulars substantially as in the first count. Neither of the two counts follows the statute with as much exactness as is desirable, but each contains enough to stand as a valid charge under \u00a7 26, and the unnecessary details do not render it bad. No objection was made to the instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">The various acts charged in both counts are all consistent with one another, so that there is no inconsistency in the verdict of guilty on both counts; the objections not existing which were found in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad, </em>120 Mass. 372, 381, and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>133 Mass. 383, 391, 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
