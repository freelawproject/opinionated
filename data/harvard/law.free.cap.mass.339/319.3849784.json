L. c. 123, \u00a7 91 (as amended through St. 1950, c. 684, \u00a7 9<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>). The petitioner is held at Bridgewater State Hospital under an order of commitment to Boston State Hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>entered on July 31, 1952, in the Probate Court for Suffolk County under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 51 (as amended through St. 1950, c. 684, \u00a7 6<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), and under an order of transfer by the department of mental health dated March 3, 1954. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The order of transfer was made for security reasons because of attempts to escape. The single justice, after hearing, found that the petitioner is suffering from a psychosis, and is mentally ill within the statutory definition, G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 1 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 637, \u00a7 1); ruled that the petitioner was not entitled to a discharge; and dismissed the petition. The petitioner appealed and alleged exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">At the time of the commitment in 1952 there was no requirement of notice to the alleged insane person. The record is silent as to whether in fact there was such notice. In the view that we take of the case we need not reconsider <em>Dowdell, petitioner, </em>169 Mass. 387. See <em>O\u2019Leary, petitioner, </em>325 Mass. 179, 183. Statutes presently effective provide for such notice. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 51 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 637, \u00a7 8, and St. 1956, c. 589, \u00a7 2). For present purposes we regard the petitioner as lawfully committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">At the time of his transfer to Bridgewater State Hospital in 1954 there likewise was no express provision for notice. There is such a provision at the present time. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 20 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 637, \u00a7 5). We cannot be required to take judicial notice of regulations. <em>Finlay </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing </em>Assn. <em>Inc. </em>308 Mass. 20, 27. <em>Mastrullo </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>Ryan, </em>328 Mass. 621, 622. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Merrimac Dev. Corp. </em>333 Mass. 758, 759. But since there must be further proceedings, we have, in order to ascertain what might be brought to the attention of the court at that time, examined Regulation No. 1 of the department of mental health contained in the Handbook of the Department of Mental Health (1955) pp. 138-145. We there learn that the department has not designated Bridgewater State Hospital under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 10 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 637, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>). By G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 22A (as amended through St. 1941, c. 194, \u00a7 7), \u201cThe department [of mental health] shall . . . have the same supervision over the commitment of insane persons to the Bridgewater state hospital as it has over the commitment of insane persons to other state hospitals under the provisions of this chapter; it shall have the same authority to discharge or transfer inmates of said Bridge-water state hospital who are not under sentence, or whose sentences have expired, as it has to discharge or transfer inmates of other state hospitals. . . . But the said Bridge-water state hospital shall remain under the jurisdiction of the department of correction and the control of the superintendent of the state farm. . . <em>.\u201d </em>See G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 18 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 11); \u00a7 19 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 11, and St. 1956, c. 715, \u00a7 16). See for the analogous provision in 1954 G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 125, \u00a7 48, now repealed. There is grave doubt whether, even if the department had designated Bridge-water State Hospital under c. 123, \u00a7 10, the petitioner could be transferred to a correctional institution without notice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Page, ante, </em>313.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Because of the availability of the simple procedure of c. 123, \u00a7 91, we do not pause to consider whether a petitioner whose petition for a writ of habeas corpus has been dismissed in the trial court may bring his case here on exceptions. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>10 Gray, 240; <em>King\u2019s Case, </em>161 Mass. 46, 50-51; <em>Bishop, petitioner, </em>172 Mass. 35, 36; <em>Chambers\u2019s Case, </em>221 Mass. 178, 179; <em>Harris, petitioner, </em>309 Mass. 180, 184; <em>Baker, petitioner, </em>310 Mass. 724, 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In order to reach a prompt and just result, the public interest requires that the petitioner\u2019s situation be considered anew by the department acting pursuant to statutes now in effect. The dismissal of the present petition would not be to any extent a bar to such further proceedings. Nevertheless in order to leave a clear field we shall reverse the order dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-15\"> Section 91. \u201cAny person may make written application to a justice of the supreme judicial court at any time and in any county, stating that he believes or has reason to believe that a person named in such application is confined as an insane person in an institution . . . and ought not longer to be so confined . . . and requesting his discharge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> Section 51. \u201cNo person shall be committed to any institution for the insane designated under or described in section ten . . . unless there has been filed with the judge a certificate ... of the insanity of such person by two properly qualified physicians, nor without an order therefor, signed by a judge . . . stating that he finds that the person committed is insane and is a proper subject for treatment in a hospital for the insane ....
