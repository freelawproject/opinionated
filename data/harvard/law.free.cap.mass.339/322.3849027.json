The relief granted is more fully described below. Both Wasson and the director have appealed. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">The trial judge made findings upon which the following statement of the principal facts is based. The civil defense agency exists under St. 1950, c. 639, The director by \u00a7 2 \u201cmay . . . appoint . . . assistants . . . and may remove them.\u201d The employees so appointed are not subject to the civil service provisions found in G. L. c. 31. It was conceded by Wasson that the director had power to remove Wasson at pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">While the director was absent from the State on December 2, 1957, one Zizza, senior administrative assistant, without any prior direction or authorization from the director, purported to remove Wasson by action which the trial judge would have been warranted in finding was wholly arbitrary. The action had been taken when Zizza \u201chad exercised the power of a senior assistant for approximately three hours.\u201d The judge^found that the director did not \u201csubsequently, formally o/by writing\"of any kind affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>act of Zizza,\u201d and ruled that c. 639 \u201cdid not give power of discharge to Zizza,\u201d but that the \u201cpower vested in . . . [the director] only.\u201d The \u201cevidence . . . did not establish delegation of the power to Zizza; and . . . [his] act . . . was . . . without warrant of law.\u201d The judge, however, found that the \u201cemployment of . . . [Wasson] was limited to the period of the then existing authorization\u201d (mentioned below) of Wasson\u2019s employment which ended December 31, 1957. The judge accordingly ordered that Wasson be reinstated with pay for the period December 2-31, 1957, but for no longer period.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">1. The evidence shows that the director\u2019s actions with respect to Wasson throughout the relevant period were by no means clear cut and unequivocal. Wasson had been notified by the agency\u2019s administrative offices on October 9, 1957, that \u201cwe have established a policy of allowing the [a]rea [directors to . . . discharge their own [s]ector [d]irectors subject only to personnel policy.\u201d A grievance committee to review proposed and purported removals had been set up by the director, not as a matter of right, but as a matter of fairness. In a memorandum, the director had stated \u201cthat no employee is to be discharged without sufficient cause\u201d and that it would \u201cbe incumbent on any [a]rea [director who discharges any employee ... to justify the discharge <em>before </em>this committee.\u201d The director testified that he had told his area directors \u201cback ... in . . . October . . . that . . . [he] would not delegate any . . . powers conferred ... by statute, but their . . . recommendation would affect . . . [his] decision. If they didn\u2019t want a sector director, all they had to say was, 'We don\u2019t want him,\u2019 and . . . [he, the director] would see that he was discharged.\u201d He also told them he \u201cdidn\u2019t want any arbitrary dismissals.\u201d From this confused testimony the judge plainly was warranted in finding there had been no express delegation to Zizza of authority to discharge, even if we make the questionable assumption that the director could delegate his power to discharge at all. We intend no suggestion that he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Wasson was notified by a letter of December 5 from one Nickerson, the chief of administration and personnel of the agency, that his \u201cservices . . . terminated as of December 2, 1957,\u201d but this letter does not appear to have been sent by the director or at his direction. Nickerson, on December 11, 1957, sent Wasson another letter, composed by the director \u201calmost in its entirety,\u201d stating that \u201c[w]e have been informed of your discharge by . . . Zizza \u201d and telling Was-son that he was \u201centitled to a hearing by the . . . [grievance [c]ommittee.\u201d The letter further said that \u201c[i]f the discharge is not justified, it is mandatory that the employee be reinstated.\u201d On December 27, Nickerson received a letter from Wasson asking what action by him was necessary to obtain a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The director learned on December 5, by a telephone call to him in Battle Creek, Michigan, from Mrs. Wasson, that Wasson had been removed and later upon his return was again so informed by his chief of staff and by Nickerson. As the trial judge found, no document signed by the director amounts to formal action expressly confirming Zizza\u2019s action. The director\u2019s testimony indicates that he may have thought he \u201cwas supporting . . . Zizza\u2019s desire not to retain\u201d Wasson, and that Wasson\u2019s employment then was \u201ccompletely terminated, but not necessarily permanently.\u201d However, he also testified that he was \u201cmerely allowing them [apparently Zizza and Nickerson] to exercise initial action, subject to . . . [his] supervision\u201d; that before he \u201cmade final determination . . . [he was] awaiting the grievance committee\u2019s recommendation\u201d; and that \u201cif they [the committee] had brought back ... a report . . . that he [Wasson] was relieved from his duties unjustifiably, . . . [he, the director] would have . . . reinstated him to an administrative position . . . given him a new position.\u201d The director further testified that he had told Zizza and other area directors that \u201cif they discharged anybody . . . and . . . [he] had reason to believe it . . . improper . . . [he] was going to submit it ... to the . . . grievance committee to determine that.\u201d The closest to affirmative action by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the director prior to December 31 was the letter of December 11, mentioned above. That, however, was not explicit and was by no means the direct statement reasonably to be expected from an executive backing up a subordinate by immediate and complete ratification of the subordinate\u2019s action. As indicated below, a letter written by the director on December 18, 1957, did nothing to affect the situation prior to December 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On this evidence, very largely oral, there was clear basis for the conclusion reached by the trial judge that no formal action of the director himself terminated Wasson\u2019s employment prior to December 31, 1957. His conclusion certainly was not plainly wrong, for he was not required to conclude that even passive acquiescence by the director in Zizza\u2019s action was the equivalent of suspension or discharge of Wasson by the director himself. <em>Furlong </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>305 Mass. 455, 456-457.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">2. The civil defense agency was operated in 1957 in accordance with rules and regulations (introduced in evidence) issued under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 45 (6), as amended through St. 1955, c. 643, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Regulation No. 1 requires each official desiring to make an appointment to notify the division of personnel and standardization. In the case of an appointment like that of Wasson, not under civil service provisions, the division, if it approves, will so indicate to the appointing official. See Reg. No. 4 (b). Wasson had first gone to work for the agency in February, 1955. Under the regulations mentioned above, the director, on October 16, 1957, had asked the director of the division of personnel and standardization for approval of the extension of the service of Wasson and some seventy-four other employees of the agency through December 31, 1957. This approval had been given. A prior requisition for these services was then about to expire on October 31, 1957, and, without this approval, the employees\u2019 services would have ended on that date. It was the director\u2019s intention, so far as the approval of his letter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>October 16, 1957, was concerned, that Wasson and the other employees, by virtue of that approval at least, \u201cwould remain ... in the service of the agency, only up until December 31, 1957.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Similarly on December 18, 1957, the director wrote to the division asking a further extension to February 15, 1958, for most of the same employees, but Wasson\u2019s name was omitted from this letter. The director was aware of this omission, and intended that \u201cWasson would not be an employee . . . until such a time as the grievance committee could . . . bring back a recommendation that his discharge was unjustified.\u201d This letter was a formal manifestation of intention not to reappoint Wasson for any period after December 31, but in terms it had no reference to the period prior to that date. Even if the director, on December 18, 1957, thought that Wasson was then no longer an employee, the letter of December 18 did nothing to make that thought manifest as a formal approval of Zizza\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Upon this evidence, the trial judge was justified in determining that Wasson\u2019s employment simply expired on December 31. The director\u2019s failure to reappoint Wasson sufficiently showed affirmative intention that this employment was to end December 31. This circumstance makes unnecessary consideration (a) of events after December 31, 1957, which have been argued, and also (b) of the contention of Wasson that the director had no power to suspend Wasson. The director himself did nothing to affect Wasson\u2019s employment for the period prior to December 31. Since he alone had removal power, Wasson remained an employee until then, but by the director\u2019s action he ceased to be an employee after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">3. In behalf of the civil defense director, it is argued that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the reasons asserted by Zizza for his purported discharge of Wasson, both in conversation with Wasson and before the grievance committee. In our view of the case it is unnecessary to decide this question as the conclusions stated above do not depend in any way on this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>4.
