In the first count Olga E. Evangelio, hereinafter called the plaintiff, seeks to recover for injuries she sustained by the explosion of a bottle of carbonated beverage alleged to have been negligently manufactured by the defendant; in the second count the plaintiff\u2019s husband sues for consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Findings of an auditor, to whom the case was referred under the usual rule, include the following: The defendant was engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing a carbonated beverage called Pepsi-Cola. In the sale and distribution of its product, the defendant\u2019s employees used motor trucks from which sales were made to \u201cvarious tradesmen and storekeepers\u201d who sold it at retail. In \u201cthe course of such sales most of the cases were piled on top of each other on the defendant\u2019s trucks.\u201d \u201cFrom the time Pepsi-Cola was manufactured and bottled until delivery to a purchaser this beverage and the bottles containing it were in the. sole custody and control of the defendant.\u201d There was no evidence as to who manufactured the bottles or as to how they were made. There was no evidence relating to the degree of carbonation of the beverage, or as to its ingredients or with respect to the process or care employed in its manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s husband owned and operated a variety store in South Boston in which he sold Pepsi-Cola at retail in bottles. The plaintiff frequently assisted her husband in running the store. On March 16, 1955, while the plaintiff was in charge of the store, an employee of the defendant delivered two cases of Pepsi-Cola. The employee deposited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>these cases in the rear of the store, \u201cone on top of the other,\u201d and received payment for them from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">About fifteen minutes later, the plaintiff picked from the top case two bottles with her left hand and one bottle with her right and proceeded toward an ice box fifteen feet away. When she reached the ice box she deposited therein the bottles held in her left hand and while in the act of depositing the bottle held in her right hand, it exploded and injured her hand. The bottle exploded before any part of it touched any part of the ice box.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">From the time the cases were delivered at the store until the accident the plaintiff was alone in the store and during this period nothing had touched the bottles other than the handling of them by the plaintiff as above indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The auditor, after finding the foregoing facts, left the question of liability to be determined by the court and assessed the damages to which the plaintiff and her husband would be entitled if they should prevail on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In the Superior Court, the case was heard by a judge solely on the auditor\u2019s report. The plaintiffs moved for judgment on the auditor\u2019s report, and the defendant did likewise. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion was granted and that of the defendant was denied, subject to the defendant\u2019s exceptions. The correctness of this action presents the sole question for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The plaintiff offered no evidence of a specific negligent act or omission as the cause of her injuries. The issue, then, is whether an inference of negligence on the part of the defendant could have been drawn from the fact that the bottle exploded, coupled with proof that it was handled properly after it had left the defendant\u2019s control. In cases of this character the question is normally phrased in terms of whether the doctrine of res ipso loquitur applies. See, e.g., <em>Roscigno </em>v. <em>Colonial Beacon Oil Co. </em>294 Mass. 234. In recent years this court has tended to avoid the use of the Latin phrase even while applying the principles included within it by the common understanding. See <em>DiRoberto </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Lagasse, </em>336 Mass. 309; <em>Poulin </em>v. <em>H. A. Tobey Lumber Corp. </em>337 Mass. 146, and cases cited; <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Samuel Evans Constr. Co. Inc. </em>338 Mass. 752. This has been done in order to avoid the confusion and \u201cmass of verbiage\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> built up around the expression. See Prosser, Res Ipsa Loquitur in California, 37 Cal. L. Rev. 183; Seavey, Res Ipsa Loquitur: Tabula in Naufragio, 63 Harv. L. Rev. 643. Compare Jaffe, Res Ipsa Loquitur Vindicated, 1 Buffalo L. Rev. 1. From an offhand remark by Baron Pollock in <em>Byrne </em>v. <em>Boadle, </em>2 H. &amp; C. 722, in 1863, there has developed an \u201cuncertain \u2018doctrine\u2019 . . . which has been the source of so much trouble to the courts that the use of the phrase itself has become a definite obstacle to any clear thought, and it might better be discarded entirely.\u201d Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) p. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In essence, this doctrine, however denominated, merely permits the tribunal of fact, if it sees fit, to draw from the occurrence itself of an unusual event the conclusion that it would not have happened unless the defendant had been negligent. It does no more than recognize that negligence and causation, like other facts, may be established by circumstantial evidence. The nature of this permitted inference has been stated with clarity and succinctness by Lummus, J., in <em>Roscigno </em>v. <em>Colonial Beacon Oil Co. </em>294 Mass. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Our first inquiry must be whether the explosion of a bottle containing a carbonated beverage is the kind of occurrence which usually does not happen in the absence of negligence. Neither of the parties has offered evidence as to the specific cause of the explosion. The burden of proof as to this matter, of course, rests on the plaintiff. She is not required to exclude every possible cause for her injuries other than that of negligence; she is only required to show a greater likelihood that her injury was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence than by some other cause. See <em>Rocha </em>v. <em>Alber, </em>302 Mass. 155, 157-158; <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Acc. Co. </em>307 Mass. 246, 250-251. See also <em>Zentz </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>39 Cal. 2d 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The question presented is not one of first impression in this Commonwealth. In <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Lowell Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>322 Mass. 456, the plaintiff purchased a bottle of coca cola from a coin operated vending machine owned by the defendant. The bottle broke in her hand a short distance from the machine. There was evidence that she had exercised due care in removing the bottle from the machine and in handling it in the brief period prior to the accident. This court held that the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was error because there \u201cwas no evidence to show that the breaking of the bottle was due to any negligence of the defendant at its bottling plant or elsewhere, nor to warrant a finding that any defect in the bottle that the jury might have found caused it to break should have been discovered by the defendant by reasonable inspection.\u201d 322 Mass. 456, 458-459.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Recovery was also denied in <em>Ruffin </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>311 Mass. 514, where the plaintiff, a patron in a delicatessen store, was injured by the explosion of a chilled bottle of coca cola as he removed it from the ice chest. However, that case is distinguishable from the case at bar by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to exclude the possibility of damage to the bottle through negligent handling after it had passed from the control of the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Both the <em>Howard </em>and the <em>Ruffin </em>opinions relied in part on <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>225 Mass. 408, where recovery was denied a plaintiff who was injured by the explosion of a carboy containing spring water. That case is also distinguishable from the situation presented here, because the carboy contained an uncarbonated beverage. The possibility of an explosion due to excessive carbonation or similar causes was therefore excluded. Compare <em>Honea </em>v. <em>City Dairy, Inc. </em>22 Cal. 2d 614, with <em>Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>24 Cal. 2d 453, and <em>Zentz </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>39 Cal. 2d 436; <em>Coralnick </em>v. <em>Abbotts Dairies, Inc. </em>337 Pa. 344, with <em>Loch </em>v. <em>Confair, </em>372 Pa. 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The defendant relies heavily on the <em>Howard </em>decision. There is no significant difference between the facts of that case and those here. Thus if that decision is to be followed the defendant is entitled to prevail. However, we think the time has come to reexamine the <em>Howard </em>case. Numerous decisions of other courts and a considerable body of comment and analysis by learned commentators since the time of the <em>Howard </em>decision have shed new light on the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In determining whether there is a balance of probabilities in favor of negligence, resort may be had either to expert testimony or to common knowledge. <em>Roscigno </em>v. <em>Colonial Beacon Oil Co. </em>294 Mass. 234. See Harper &amp; James, Torts, \u00a7 19.6. Expert evidence as to the possible causes of an explosion of a bottle containing a charged beverage has been often employed. See, e.g., <em>Escola </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>24 Cal. 2d 453. No expert testimony, however, was offered by either side in the case at bar. We must therefore rely on common knowledge in assessing the possible causes of an accident of the sort here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Numerous possible causes have been discussed in the cases dealing with exploding bottles, among which are (1) defects in the bottle, (2) defects caused by improper handling of the bottles, and (3) excessive carbonation. There are doubtless other causes. Most of the courts which have considered this problem since the time of the <em>Howard </em>decision have permitted the tribunal of fact to draw an inference that the explosion was caused by negligent conduct, leaving it to the defendant to explain why in a given case it was more probable that the explosion was the product of a cause for which the defendant was not responsible. Professor Prosser accurately summarizes the course of decision: \"... [[TJhe</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">great majority of the courts now hold that [the explosion of] even a single bottle is enough to permit a finding of negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) pp. 203-204. In general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>we are in accord with this position subject, however, to the qualification presently to be mentioned. To the extent that the case of <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Lowell Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>322 Mass. 456, is not in accord with views here expressed, we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">To recover in a situation of the sort here involved the plaintiff must prove more than the fact of the explosion. Where, as here, the accident occurs after the defendant has surrendered control of the instrumentality involved, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that the instrumentality had not been improperly handled by himself or by intermediate handlers. <em>Escola </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of </em>Fresno, 24 Cal. 2d 453. <em>Zentz </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>39 Cal. 2d 436. Harper &amp; James, Torts, \u00a7 19.7. Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 42. Here that requirement was satisfied. The auditor found that the defendant had sole custody of its product up until the time its employee stacked the cases in the rear of the store and that nothing touched the bottles until the plaintiff removed them from the case. Thus the judge could properly find that there was a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>able probability that all who handled the bottle prior to the injury other than the defendant did nothing that would cause the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">It follows that the judge did not err in allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the auditor\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> <em>Jesionowski </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine R.R. </em>329 U. S. 452, 457.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> Recovery, however, has been permitted in actions of contract based on breach of warranty. <em>Poulos </em>v. <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Boston, </em>322 Mass. 386. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>329 Mass. 440.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\"> In the early cases involving explosions of carbonated beverage containers a majority of the courts denied recovery. See <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Crystal Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>50 Ariz. 60; <em>Slack </em>v. <em>Premier-Pabst Corp. </em>40 Del. 97; <em>Stodder </em>v. <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Plants, Inc. </em>142 Maine, 139; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Laurel Bottling Works, </em>111 Miss. 442; <em>Seven-Up Bottling Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Gretes, </em>182 Va. 138. Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Berkens </em>v. <em>Denver Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>109 Colo. 140. Some courts have allowed recovery only where there was evidence of similar explosions of bottles filled by the same bottler within a short period of time. Compare <em>Loebigs\u2019 Guardian </em>v. <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>259 Ky. 124, with <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Works </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>214 Ky. 118; <em>Styers </em>v. <em>Winston Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>239 N. C. 504, with <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Graham Chero-Cola Bottling Co. </em>176 N. C. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">However, a rapidly growing number of jurisdictions now allow recovery, if a showing of due care on the part of those other than the defendant who have handled the bottle has been made. <em>Florence Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>259 Ala. 56. <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Fort Smith </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>215 Ark. 803. <em>Escola </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>24 Cal. 2d 453. <em>Zentz </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>39 Cal. 2d 436. <em>Canada Dry Ginger Ale Co.
