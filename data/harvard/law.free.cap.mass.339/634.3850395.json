Ardini &amp; Pfau, Inc. (the subcontractor), took a subcontract for a part of this work. The plaintiff, who supplied to the subcontractor materials used in the turnpike work, brings this bill in equity against the authority, the prime contractor, the subcontractor, and Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (Indemnity) to recover the amount due for the materials and to obtain payment of the amount from a \"payment bond\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> executed on March 31, 1955, by the prime contractor and Indemnity in connection with the contract and on the same day as the execution of a performance bond <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> given by them. Each bond named only the authority as obligee.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The bill alleged these facts and also (a) that the subcontractor owed the plaintiff $2,363.25 plus interest of $141.80 for the materials; (b) that the prime contractor and Indemnity by the payment bond \u201cmade an offer of a unilateral contract to . . . [the plaintiff] to pay for materials . . . used ... in the construction of the . . . [t]urnpike . . .\u201d and that the \"offer was accepted by . . . [the plaintiff] by furnishing\u201d the materials; (c) that the payment bond was \"held by the . . . authority in trust for the bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>fit of\u201d the plaintiff and others similarly performing labor and furnishing materials \u201cin reliance\u201d upon the bond; (d) that the plaintiff \u201cknew of and relied upon\u201d the bond; and (e) that on January 25, 1956, the plaintiff filed with the authority a sworn statement of its claim, within sixty days after it last furnished materials. Demurrers were filed by the prime contractor, by Indemnity, and by the authority on the ground, among others, that the bill failed to state any case for equitable relief. The demurrers were sustained. A final decree ordered the subcontractor to pay the amount owed by it and dismissed the bill as against the other defendants. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">1. The payment bond was not a statutory bond. General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 29 (as amended through St. 1938, c. 361), was in effect on March 31, 1955. Although \u00a7 29 was amended by St. 1955, c. 702, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so that thereafter a statutory payment bond would have been required, in connection with contracts with the authority, for the benefit of persons in the position of the plaintiff,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this amendment did not become effective until after the execution of the bond here under consideration. No such bond was required by \u00a7 29 prior to the 1955 amendment, for certainly the authority was not a \u201ccounty, city or town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Similarly no such bond was then required by G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39, which was amended by St. 1955, c. 702, \u00a7 1, in respects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>not here material, for \u00a7 39 required a bond only from officers \u201cor agents contracting in behalf of the commonwealth for the construction . . . of . . . public works.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The authority, although a \u201cpublic instrumentality\u201d performing \u201can essential governmental function\u201d (see St. 1952, c. 354, \u00a7 3), is not the Commonwealth itself. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 721, 734. Contracts of the authority are not made \u201cin behalf of the commonwealth\u201d in the sense in which that term is used in \u00a7 39, which we interpret as meaning contracts upon which the Commonwealth itself is directly hable in some manner. See <em>Duteau </em>v. <em>Salvucci, </em>330 Mass. 531, 537. Under St. 1952, c. 354, \u00a7 2 (see also \u00a7 3), expenses of the authority \u201cshall be payable solely from funds provided under the authority\u201d of c. 354, and these funds are to be obtained from toll revenues and revenue bonds upon which (\u00a7 3) the Commonwealth is not to be hable.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">2. The payment bond took effect only as a common law bond. <em>Johnson-Foster Co. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amore Constr. Co. </em>314 Mass. 416, 419-420. See <em>Robinson Clay Prod. Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Constr. Co. of </em>Mass. <em>Inc., ante, </em>406, 409. The bond, however, does not contain any provision, like that considered in the two cases just cited, showing that the bond was given for the benefit of all persons furnishing labor and materials on account of the prime contract. The <em>Johnson-Foster Co. </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 420-422, allowed suppliers to enforce in equity the \u201cObligations of the makers of the bond springing into existence after the original delivery of the bond.\u201d These obhgations arose by the acceptance by the suppliers of \u201cthe offer of a unilaterial contract\u201d contained in the bond, in rehance upon the offer and the bond. See Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 826, esp. n. 6. Here there is no offer in the bond in terms, comparable to the provision relied on in the <em>Johnson-Foster Co. </em>case, running to suppliers- of labor and material, unless it can be implied from the fact that the usual purpose of a payment bond is to assure the payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>such suppliers, particularly where, in the case of public works, there is a broad area of freedom, for the property involved, from statutory mechanics\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 liens. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4; <em>Lessard </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>171 Mass. 294, 295; <em>Massachusetts Gas &amp; Elec. Light Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Rugo Constr. Co. Inc. </em>321 Mass. 20, 22-23. In the light of the Massachusetts precedents, we think that we should not imply an obligation or offer by the makers of the bond to suppliers merely (a) because it may be difficult to see any purpose of taking the bond if no such obligation was intended, or (b) because in the case of a precisely similar bond required by the Commonwealth, a county, a city, or a town, such an obligation would be imposed under the applicable statute. The decisions in Massachusetts have interpreted the range of obligees and beneficiaries of such bonds narrowly, except where, as in the <em>Johnson-Foster Co. </em>case, 314 Mass. 416, <em>supra, </em>there is shown a specific intention to benefit suppliers or to make an offer to them. Unless suppliers have been given benefits under the bond by statute (see e.g. <em>A. L. Smith Iron Works </em>v. <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>275 Mass. 74, 76; Williston, Contracts [Rev. ed.] \u00a7 367, p. 1072, but see \u00a7 372) suppliers, not within a class of beneficiaries mentioned in the bond, have been held to have no enforceable rights under it. See e.g. <em>Central Supply Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>273 Mass. 139, 142-145. Even rights created by statute have been held to be available only to those classes of suppliers specifically mentioned as beneficiaries of the bond in the statute. See e.g. <em>Claycraft Co. </em>v. <em>John Bowen Co. </em>287 Mass. 255, 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">If the parties had intended to create rights in the suppliers, it would have been natural for them to say so in essentially the language considered in the <em>Johnson-Foster Co. </em>case, 314 Mass. 416, <em>supra. </em>We interpret the payment bond as intended to confer no enforceable benefit upon suppliers. Accordingly, there is no merit to the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that the bond was designed to make the authority trustee of the bond for the benefit of all suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">3. General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 29A, inserted by St. 1949, c. 185, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>gives to the plaintiff no direct right of recovery upon the bond. That section purports to give suppliers such direct rights where a surety bond is \u201cgiven in connection with any written contract for the erection ... of any . . . structure upon privately owned land\u201d if the bond contains \u201ca condition for the payment of all labor and material used.\u201d The land of the authority is held for public use and cannot aptly be described as \u201cprivately owned land.\u201d See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 721, 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">4. The interlocutory decrees sustaining the demurrers and the final decree are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\"> The relevant parts of the payment bond read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">\u201c. . .

The words italicized were added by the amendment. Statute 1955, c. 702, \u00a7 3, provided that \u00a7 2 should apply only to contracts executed after the effective date (November 21, 1955) of the amendment, and that contracts \u201cexecuted prior to the effective date\u201d of the amendment \u201cshall be subject to the provisions\u201d of G.

It would appear that the Legislature theretofore simply had failed to make \u00a7 29 applicable to bodies like this authority although \u00a7 29 had been made applicable to housing authorities.
