This was a straight life policy in the' sum of $1,000 issued effective January 7, 1948. Attached to it was a rider \"for \u2018family income\u2019 benefit,\u201d which in substance provided, in consideration of an additional premium, that should the insured die within a period of twenty years, there would be paid to the beneficiary $10 a month for the remainder of that period. The controversy is whether the rider was in effect at the time of the insured\u2019s death. Liability on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>base policy is admitted. The case was heard upon an \u201cagreed statement of evidence\u201d by a judge who found for the plaintiff in the amount of the base policy only.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">This action was consolidated for trial with nine actions on identical policies issued by nine other savings banks. By stipulation the same final judgment is to be entered in them as in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The rider reads in part: \u201cIn the event that the policy is not kept in force by payment of premiums, this rider and the provisions for family income benefit, above set forth become void. The non-forfeiture benefits under the policy are not affected by this rider.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The premiums on the ten policies were paid in one sum to an agency bank. The quarterly amount for all the policies was $59.10, which included the premiums for the family income benefit rider. All premiums due through October 7, 1952, were paid. Payments due on January 7, 1953, were not made. The insurers applied accumulated dividends to pay premiums due until March 7, 1953. After the running of the grace period of thirty-one days, each policy was placed on participating extended term insurance under the provisions of the nonforfeiture values clause of the policy, thereby extending the life insurance coverage until June 28, 1954. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1941, c. 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The plaintiff asserts that at the insured\u2019s death the policy was still \u201ckept in force by payment of premiums,\u201d notwithstanding that the insured had not paid a premium for more than a year; and that, in consequence, the rider was not void. The argument seems to be that because premiums had been paid in the past, and because there are policy provisions for a grace period and for participating extended term insurance, anything in the policy which kept alive any interest of the insured, however attenuated in comparison with the original benefits, was a keeping in force of the policy by payment of premiums. We think that this is clearly not so. To begin with, it is a forced and unreasonable construction of the unambiguous language used in the rider. Im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>mediately following the statement that the rider will become void if \u201cthe policy is not kept in force by payment of premiums,\u201d there is a sharply drawn distinction expressed in the words, \u201cThe non-forfeiture benefits under the policy are not affected.\u201d Emphasis upon this distinction would have been unnecessary were all the provisions of the rider to continue in effect coterminously with the policy itself. The plaintiff\u2019s contention, moreover, is made in the teeth of a statement on the first page of the policy reading, \u201cExcept as herein stated, the payment of a premium or installment thereof shall not maintain this policy in force beyond the date when the next premium or installment thereof is payable.\u201d No pertinent exception can be found in either the policy or the rider. When March 7, 1953, came and went without a payment of the premium in the normal manner, there were at least two results: (1) The rider for \u201cfamily income\u201d benefit lapsed. (2) The thirty-one day grace period began to run, following which participating extended term insurance came into effect. See <em>Kansas City Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lipsey, </em>123 F. 2d 998, 999 (5th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The present case is controlled by <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>274 Mass. 212, where there was an action upon a policy of life insurance with a rider providing double indemnity in case of accidental death. At the time of- the accidental death of the insured there had been a default in the payment of premiums, and in accordance with the nonforfeiture provisions of that policy there was a period of automatic extended insurance. The rider there contained the provision, \u201cThese provisions as to accidental death benefit shall become null and void if any of the non-forfeiture provisions of said policy shall be operative.\u201d At pages 216-217, the court said, \u201c. . . we think it plain that there is nothing in the insurance law or in the terms of the contract of insurance which inhibits the provision of the \u2018 rider \u2019 that that part of the policy shall be void in the event the nonforfeiture provisions of the policy were in force when the death occurred.\u201d See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 144 (7) (d), as amended through St. 1943, c. 227, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"Ano\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We have examined all the remaining points raised by the plaintiff, and find in them nothing meriting discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
