The defendant demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s bill on the ground that the suit was prohibited by G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 47A. The demurrer was overruled by interlocutory decree and the defendant appealed. She then answered and made counterclaim for the return by the plaintiff of two rings given to him by her. The case was referred to a master who reported the following facts. The parties met in December, 1952. The plaintiff was then married. In February, 1954, his wife became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u201cvery\u201d ill and was hospitalized. He discussed with the defendant the possibility of marriage if his wife died. In March they picked out a six carat diamond ring which the plaintiff purchased and gave to the defendant. He also gave her at some time three other rings. His wife died on April 6. About May 3 the defendant gave the plaintiff a \u201cman\u2019s diamond ring ... in contemplation of marriage, and as an engagement ring.\u201d The plaintiff negotiated for the purchase of a house which the defendant had selected and they installed there a quantity of her furniture and numerous articles purchased by him as gifts for her. At some time between the wife\u2019s death and the following No-f vember the parties had agreed to marry. In January, 1955, the defendant broke the engagement without \u201cadequate Lcause\u201d or \u201cfault\u201d on the part of the plaintiff. The master found that the six carat diamond ring was given by the plaintiff to the defendant as an \u201cengagement ring . . . upon the implied condition that the parties would be married when and if his wife died\u201d and that the other rings given by him were \u201cabsolute gifts.\u201d The master\u2019s report was confirmed and a final decree entered dismissing both the plaintiff\u2019s bill and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">It is generally held that an engagement ring is in the nature of a pledge, given on the implied condition that the marriage shall take place. If the contract to marry is terminated without fault on the part of the donor he may recover the ring. <em>Gikas </em>v. <em>Nicholis, </em>96 N. H. 177. <em>Priebe </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>90 Cal. App. 2d 79. See 24 A. L. R. 2d 579. General Laws c. 207, \u00a7 47A, on which the defendant relies, was inserted by St. 1938, c. 350, \u00a7 1. It provides that \u201cBreach of contract to marry shall not constitute an injury or wrong recognized by law, and no action, suit or proceeding shall be maintained therefor.\u201d Its title, \u201cAn Act abolishing causes of action for breach of contract to marry, with a view to preserving the marriage institution and protecting the public morals,\u201d is indicative of its purpose. See 33 Mich. L. Rev. 979. We held in <em>Thibault </em>v. <em>Lalumiere, </em>318 Mass. 72, that after breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>of such a contract a woman could not maintain an action in tort to recover damages for embraces and caresses to which she had submitted during the engagement. The present suit is different in character. It is a proceeding not to recover damages either directly or indirectly for breach of the contract to marry but to obtain on established equitable principles restitution of property held on a condition which the defendant was unwilling to fulfil. It seeks to prevent unjust enrichment. Authority for the maintenance of such a suit is found in the Restatement: Restitution, \u00a7 58, and in the judicial decisions in other States having statutes similar to \u00a7 47A. <em>Gikas </em>v. <em>Nicholis, </em>96 N. H. 177. <em>Pavlicic </em>v. <em>Vogtsberger, </em>390 Pa. 502. See 29 Cornell L. Q. 401. We think it is not the kind of suit which the Legislature intended to abolish and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover his engagement ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">It was said in the <em>Thibault </em>opinion that \u00a7 47A \u201cabolished any right of action, whatever its form, that was based\u201d upon breach of promise. Further consideration leads us to think that the statement was too inclusive and that a proceeding may be maintained which although occasioned by breach of contract to marry, and in a sense based upon the breach, is not as was the action in the <em>Thibault </em>case brought to recover for the breach itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The interlocutory decree overruling the defendant\u2019s demurrer is affirmed. The final decree is reversed in so far as it provides for the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s bill and is affirmed as to the dismissal of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. A new final decree is to be entered providing that the defendant deliver to the plaintiff the six carat diamond engagement ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\"><em>So </em>ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
