L. c. 265, \u00a7 17). In support of his exceptions he contends that the judge erred in refusing to rule that a finding of not guilty was required in law, and in denying requests to the judge near the close of the second day of the trial for the issuance of process to summon certain witnesses. The issue of the sufficiency of the evidence was raised by a \u201cmotion for a directed verdict\u201d which we consider as a request for ruling. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>332 Mass. 615. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">The' robbery occurred at Westboro on January 31, 1958. The only testimony linking the defendant with the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>was that of an admitted accomplice. If believed, this was direct and full evidence that the defendant committed the robbery. The defendant stresses the importance of careful scrutiny of such testimony <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giacomazza, </em>311 Mass. 456, 464) and points to inconsistencies in it, and to conflicting testimony, evidence of a fight between the accomplice and the defendant at Norfolk Prison Colony, and evidence of the accomplice\u2019s stated intent to get even with the defendant. There was some peripheral corroboration of the accomplice\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We cannot rule that the testimony was incredible as a matter of law, that the inconsistencies destroyed its significance, or that there was a lack of evidence which, if believed, would sustain a finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>310 Mass. 811, 816-817. It is, of course, not for us to weigh the evidence and there is no suggestion that the trial judge did not do so in all respects as law and justice require.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The defendant contends that the judge was obliged to direct the issuance of summons because of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 66, which, so far as relevant, provides that <em>\u201cA </em>prisoner indicted for a crime punishable with death or imprisonment for life, upon demand by him or his counsel upon the clerk, shall have . . . process to summon witnesses who are necessary to his defence, at the expense of the commonwealth.\u201d It does not appear that any application had been made to the clerk. We need not determine the limit of the defendant\u2019s right imposed by the word \u201cnecessary\u201d (as to fees of expert see <em>Clark, petitioner, </em>104 Mass. 537), or indicate here the means available to the defendant to enforce his rights under the statute if process is refused by the clerk. We assume without deciding that upon seasonable application to the clerk the defendant could have required process, and that the usual course, upon such application being made, is to issue the process demanded. That is irrelevant. The defendant shows no right to call upon the judge to order process to issue. So far as appears it was solely within the judge\u2019s discretion whether in the midst of trial to indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>his view that summons should issue, or to reinforce that with an order. We are not now concerned with the effect of such an order if one had been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
