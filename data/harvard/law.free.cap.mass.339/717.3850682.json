(Furniture), a Massachusetts corporation, which had made with Whitehall Mercantile Corporation (the factor), a New York corporation, an agreement (the agreement) dated June 19, 1956, to provide for securing certain loans. A written guaranty agreement (the guaranty), also dated June 19, 1956, was executed by each plaintiff and each defendant. By this instrument, the signers jointly and severally guaranteed \u201cthe due payment and performance by\u201d Furniture \u201cof all moneys to be paid . . . pursuant to . . . [the] agreement.\u201d Each instrument provided that the law \u00f3f New York was to be applicable to it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The foregoing facts were alleged, or incorporated by reference, in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill in equity to which were attached copies of the agreement and the guaranty. The bill also states (a) that the factor had brought suit against the plaintiffs in a Massachusetts court, the factor in that action alleging that Furniture had failed to pay the factor $8,968.29 and \u201cthat the plaintiffs therefore owe . . . [that] sum to . . . [the factor] together with reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d; (b) that the plaintiffs\u2019 property has been attached; (c) that the defendants as coguarantors with the plaintiffs \u201cowe a duty of contribution to the plaintiffs\u201d; (d) that if \u201cthe plaintiffs are required to pay the obligation before enforcing any right of contribution ... it will cause [them] hardship and financial distress\u201d; and (e) that in equity the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>fendants should \u201cmake contribution of their share of the obligation before payment thereof by the plaintiffs.\u201d The bill seeks (1) a decree that the defendants \u201care jointly and severally hable for one half of the obligation which the plaintiffs . . . may be required to pay\u201d and (2) an order that the defendants pay to the factor one half of any judgment which the factor may recover against the plaintiffs. There is a prayer for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The defendants demurred on the ground that no basis for relief had been stated in the bill and that there was an adequate remedy at law. The demurrer was sustained with leave to the plaintiffs to amend their bill. A final decree dismissing the bill was entered. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">1. The agreement (executed on the same day as the guaranty) provided that it was not to \u201cbecome effective until accepted by . . . [\u00a1the factor] at its office in New York.\u201d New York thus appears to have been the place (see <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>125 Mass. 374, 376; see also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>State St. Trust Co. </em>270 Mass. 140, 150) where both instruments were made. In any event, since New York is the place where, as the agreement states, \u201cthe transactions hereunder will take place,\u201d effect should be given, in determining the substantive rights created by the instruments, to the reasonable stipulations of the parties (see footnote 1, supra) that New York law is to be applicable. See <em>Mittenthal </em>v. <em>Mascagni, </em>183 Mass. 19, 21-22; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>State St. Trust Co. </em>270 Mass. 140, 150; <em>Maxwell Shapiro Woolen Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Amerotron Corp., ante, </em>252, 257. See also <em>Samincorp So. Am. Minerals &amp; Merchandise Corp. v. Lewis, </em>337 Mass. 298, 301; 2 Rabel, Conflict of Laws, 357-429; 3 <em>ibid., </em>344-368.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Any claim to contribution among the coguarantors is not based directly upon the instrument by which the coguarantors are bound to the creditor, but rests upon an implied obligation, equitable in character, growing out of the relationship of cosurety or coguarantor. See <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Pasons, </em>176 Mass. 570, 575-577; <em>Quintin </em>v. <em>Magnant, </em>285 Mass. 450, 451-452; <em>Aspinwall </em>v. <em>Sacchi, </em>57 N. Y. 331, 335-336; <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>66 N. Y. 255, 258; <em>Deering </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>Earl of Winchelsea, </em>2 B. &amp; P. 270, 273; Restatement: Restitution, \u00a7 81, and Seavey and Scott notes. See also <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>King, </em>317 Mass. 210, 216-217. The execution and delivery of the guaranty gave rise to such a coguaranty relationship. That circumstance leads us to determine the extent of the equitable obligation in accordance with the law which governs the guaranty, at least in a case where the parties have stipulated the applicable law in the guaranty itself in such broad language.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">2. New York applies the general rule (Restatement: Security, \u00a7 149; see \u00a7 82, comment g) that a surety or guarantor, who discharges more than his proportionate share of the principal\u2019s obligation is entitled to contribution from a cosurety. <em>Aspinwall </em>v. <em>Sacchi, </em>57 N. Y. 331, 335-338. See <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>66 N. Y. 255, 258. The right to contribution from coguarantors arises in New York when a coguarantor who is \u201clegally liable upon his guaranty\u201d has \u201cpaid the claim\u201d of the creditor. \u201cThen, and not until such payment, has he the right to exact contributions.\u201d <em>Hard </em>v. <em>Mingle, </em>206 N. Y. 179, 184, relying largely upon <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>1 Met. 387, 388-389, and citing <em>Seabury </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>183 Mass. 105, 107. See <em>Quintin </em>v. <em>Magnant, </em>285 Mass. 450, 451-452; Restatement: Restitution, \u00a7 82; Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 411, 1417-1418. In <em>Empire Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bartley &amp; Co. Inc. </em>258 App. Div. (N. Y.) 249, 251-252,. where comparable statements were made, it was pointed out that, if contribution were to be required from one cosurety in favor of another before the latter had paid more than his proportionate share of the debt, the creditor might still be able to recover the whole debt from the contributing cosurety except as by payment to the creditor the principal debt had been reduced. Contribution was not enforced before payment by the cosurety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>seeking contribution. No New York case has come to our attention in which a surety or guarantor, in advance of payment of more than his share of the principal obligation, has been granted equitable relief by way of exoneration against a cosurety or coguarantor in the form of an order that the latter pay his share of the obligation to the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In Restatement: Security, \u00a7 156, it is said that \u201c[w]here sureties are under a duty of immediate performance to a creditor, a surety has a right of exoneration against the cosureties who have consented to his becoming a surety, to the same extent that upon performance he would be entitled to contribution.\u201d With \u00a7 156 must also be read Restatement: Security, \u00a7\u00a7 112, 144-147, 149-150; Restitution, \u00a7\u00a7 76, 81, 82. The rule set out in \u00a7 156 of the Restatement has frequently been stated. See e.g. Brandt, Surety-ship and Guaranty (3d ed.) \u00a7 301; Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 1275 (but see \u00a7 1278); Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 931, notes 76-77, \u00a7 1150; Simpson, Suretyship, \u00a7\u00a7 46, 49; Arant, Suretyship and Guaranty, \u00a7\u00a7 74, 75; Stearns, Suretyship (5th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 11.18, 11.25-11.31 esp. 11.26, where it said, \u201cAlthough it is the general rule that a surety must first make payment of the principal\u2019s debt before he can call upon his co-sureties for contribution, in certain situations equity gives a surety the right to call upon his co-sureties for exoneration before any payment is made. For example, if one of several co-obligors is called upon to pay the entire debt, a compliance with this demand might cause financial disaster to him, which his right of contribution after payment would not prevent.\u201d See also Chafee and Simpson, Cases on Equity, 326n; Ames, Cases on Suretyship, 597, 598nn; 50 Am. Jur., Suretyship, \u00a7 301. The principal decision cited by most of the authors (see Restatement: Security, Tentative Draft No. 4, April 4, 1940, \u00a7 148, and notes, pp. 229-230) is <em>Wolmershausen </em>v. <em>Gullick, </em>[1893] 2 Ch. 514, 528-529. There a plaintiff, a surety\u2019s executrix, was given declaratory relief as to her right to enforce contribution from a cosurety, and conditional relief by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>\u201cupon the [p]laintiff paying her own share, the [d]efendant . . . [was] to indemnify her against further payment or liability, and . . . [was] by payment to her or to the principal creditor or otherwise, to exonerate the [p]laintiff from liability beyond the extent of her own share.\u201d The court intimated that, if the creditor had been made a party, the cosurety would have been directed to make immediate payment to the creditor of the cosurety\u2019s share. \u2022 The amount of the claim had been established against the surety\u2019s estate of which the then plaintiff was executrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In effect, under the fair and sensible rule of the <em>Wolmershausen </em>case, (a) a court may decree specific performance of a matured joint principal obligation simultaneously by all the cosureties, who are bound equally to that joint obligation, and (b) that specific performance may be fairly conditioned upon performance by the plaintiff of his share of the joint obligation. The plaintiff thus is not put to the expense and risk of paying the xyhole joint obligation and seeking reimbursement, possibly at some hardship in financing the payment and because of the costs, inconvenience, and hazards of litigation. Instead, a court of equity enables him to pay, when it is due, no more than his own share of the joint principal obligation and the attendant expenses, at the same time forcing the others equally liable to pay their fair share, which eventually they could be required, at law or in equity, to reimburse to the plaintiff (once he has paid more than his share) by way of equitable contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The <em>Wolmershausen </em>case was approved in <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>235 Pa. 99, 103, and followed in <em>Reeder </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co. </em>26 Pa. Dist. 833, 836-838. See <em>Shepheard </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>[1906] 2 Ch. 235, 240, 253; <em>In re Fenton, </em>(1930) 99 L. J. Ch. (N. S.) 358, 361; <em>A Debtor </em>v. <em>Trustee of the Property of Waite, </em>[1956] 2 All E. R. 94, 99; <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>2 Day (Conn.) 491, 493-495; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Poyntz, </em>7 Dana (Ky.) 307, 32 Am. Dec. 92, 93; <em>Ferrer </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>57 N. C. 455, 456-458; <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>George, </em>2 Rich. Eq. (S. C.) 15, 20, 22. See also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Topliff, </em>107 Ill. 241, 248-251; <em>Keach </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>84 Ill. App. 413, 415-416; <em>Vian </em>v. <em>Hilberg, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>111 Neb. 232, 250 (where, however, the court relied in part on <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Potter-Lovell Co. </em>169 Mass. 7, 8-9, a case in which the plaintiffs had apparently satisfied more than their shares of the principal obligation). Cf. situation in <em>Evans, Coleman &amp; Evans, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Pistorino, </em>245 Mass. 94, 100, where reference is made to the <em>Wolmershausen </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In view of the language of the <em>Empire Trust </em>case, 258 App. Div. (N. Y.) 249, <em>supra, </em>there may be doubt whether a New York court, even upon proper allegations and with proper joinder of parties, would grant conditional relief by way of equitable exoneration to the plaintiffs against their coguarantors in advance of payment by the plaintiffs of more than their proportionate share of Furniture\u2019s debt to the factor. In the New York cases already cited, the possibility of properly conditioned equitable exoneration of a surety by his cosureties was not discussed, and it is possible that, when the question is raised in New York, the <em>Wolmershausen </em>case will be followed. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>4 Johns. (N. Y.) 123, 134-135, however, relied on by the plaintiffs as supporting such exoneration, does not remove the doubts created by the <em>Empire Trust </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">3. Once the substantive obligations of the parties are determined under New York law <em>(Lundblad </em>v. <em>New Amsterdam Cas. Co. </em>265 Mass. 158,161-162; <em>Klefbeck </em>v. <em>Dous, </em>302 Mass. 383, 384), the extent to which those obligations can be protected under available Massachusetts equitable remedies and procedures is to be determined by the Massachusetts forum by Massachusetts law. <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>280 Mass. 248, 251-252. See <em>U. S. B. &amp; M. Liquidation Corp. </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>307 Mass. 114, 116-117; Restatement: Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 584-587, 607-608; Beale, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 584.1-584.2, 607.1-608.1; Goodrich, Conflict of Laws (3d ed.) 226 et seq.; Stumberg, Conflict of Laws (2d ed.) 134 et seq. No Massachusetts decision directly applies the principles of Restatement: Security, \u00a7 156. Exoneration, however, has been granted in other contexts, is clearly within usual Massachusetts equity jurisdiction, see G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1 (as amended through St. 1935, c. 407, \u00a7 2), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u00a7 3 (2), and is possible under Massachusetts equity procedure. See <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Bixby, </em>190 Mass. 69, 70 (surety\u2019s exoneration by principal debtor\u2019s estate); <em>Fitcher </em>v. <em>Griffiths, </em>216 Mass. 174, 176-177 (exoneration of land subject to a mortgage securing another\u2019s debt); <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Armour &amp; Co. </em>323 Mass. 28, 29-30 (exoneration of guarantors by principal debtors). See also <em>Rhoades </em>v. <em>Secunda, </em>296 Mass. 1, 2-3; <em>Killoren </em>v. <em>Hernan, </em>303 Mass. 93, 96-100; <em>Sokol </em>v. <em>Nathanson, </em>317 Mass. 325, 327. Cf. <em>Pappone </em>v. <em>Masters, </em>325 Mass. 437, 438-439. Cf. also <em>Administrator of O. P. A. </em>v. <em>Chook, </em>320 Mass. 187, 190-193. Certainly, the plaintiffs, upon suitable allegations and joinder of all necessary parties, would be entitled at least to declaratory relief against the defendants and other necessary or appropriate parties, stating their substantive rights. See G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5, 6, 8, 9. We see no reason why, using Massachusetts equitable remedies (even if they are regarded as more ample and flexible than those of New York), the plaintiffs should not also have appropriate consequential relief, if the allegations of their bill, and their proof, justify it. The propriety of such relief as is contemplated by Restatement: Security, \u00a7 156, was at least suggested in <em>Quintin </em>v. <em>Magnant, </em>285 Mass. 450, 452, where, in discussing contribution among coobligors, it was said, \u201cIt is true that contribution may be enforced in an action of contract .... A bill in equity often affords more complete remedies,\u201d citing the <em>Wolmershausen </em>case, [1893] 2 Ch. 514, <em>supra. </em>The reasons of fairness and good sense, already mentioned above, for approving the rule in the <em>Wolmershausen </em>case, and that of \u00a7 156, make exoneration of cosureties and coguarantors as appropriate as in other situations where exoneration has been granted in Massachusetts. Such relief can be conditioned upon the plaintiffs\u2019 prompt payment of their proportionate share of Furniture\u2019s debt to the factor, as in the <em>Wolmershausen </em>case, for conditional equitable relief is no novelty. See <em>Jurewicz </em>v. <em>Jurewicz, </em>317 Mass. 512, 517; <em>Kressler </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>323 Mass. 610, 612-613; Seavey and Scott notes to Restatement: Restitution, \u00a7 82, pp. 119-120. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>The present case, of course, is not one where an action at law by the plaintiffs against the defendants to recover the latter\u2019s share of the principal debt would be available without prior payment of the principal debt by the plaintiffs. Cf. <em>Broadway Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>285 Mass. 459, 465-466; <em>Pappone </em>v. <em>Masters, </em>325 Mass. 437, 438. Because of the risks and hardship of such prior payment, the remedy at law may not be adequate if the facts show that all co-guarantors should fairly be specifically required to perform simultaneously their equitable share of the obligations guaranteed by them jointly, rather than remitting two of the coguarantors to performance of the whole joint obligation with an attempted recovery over against the others of their shares. Such relief is justified where the facts alleged meet the standards set by Restatement: Security, \u00a7 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">4. In a case of this character, it is open to the plaintiffs to seek merely consequential relief by way of exoneration. If they do so, they should allege that the plaintiffs and the defendants, as well as the principal debtor, are under a duty to the creditor of immediate performance (see Restatement: Security, \u00a7 112, comment d; \u00a7 156; see also Williston, Contracts [Rev. ed] \u00a7 1275, p. 3640; Stearns, Suretyship [5th edj \u00a7 11.38), as, for example, by alleging that the creditor has recovered judgment against the plaintiffs or that the plaintiffs admit the obligation of the cosureties and assert that it exists as to all cosureties. In the alternative, the plaintiffs may seek a declaration of the existence and extent of the principal\u2019s and the cosureties\u2019 obligations, and then conditionally seek consequential relief by way of exoneration with respect to whatever obligations are determined to exist. Where such a determination by declaratory relief is sought (and perhaps even where it is not), questions, not argued and which we need not now discuss, may arise whether all necessary parties have been joined or, in the alternative, whether the failure to do so has been adequately explained, as, for example, by an allegation that the principal debtor is insolvent or unavailable. See Restatement: Security, \u00a7 164; Restitution, \u00a7 81, comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>h, i; \u00a7 82, comment a; \u00a7 85, comment h, and Seavey and Scott notes to these sections; Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed.) \u00a7 1418. See also G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 8; <em>Sadler </em>v. <em>Industrial Trust Co. </em>327 Mass. 10, 13. To the extent that such a bill seeks declaratory relief (see G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1) it should allege the existence of a controversy and state with \u201cclarity what the controversy\u201d is. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Neelon, </em>335 Mass. 357, 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The present bill, judged by these principles, does not justify the relief sought. The interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrer was proper. Nevertheless, we think that the plaintiffs should be allowed further opportunity to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">5. The interlocutory decree is affirmed. The plaintiffs are to be given a further period of not less than thirty days from the date of the rescript within which they may file a motion to amend their bill. The final decree is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-9\"> The agreement provided that \u201cthis agreement and all transactions, assignments and transfers hereunder, and all rights of the parties, shall be governed as to validity, construction, enforcement, and in all other respects by the laws of ...
