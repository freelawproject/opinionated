The defendant, The Welch Co. (hereinafter called Welch), owns land which adjoins the parking area on the north. At the northerly end of Welch\u2019s parcel is a pier which extends into the harbor about one hundred feet. Between the northerly edge of the parking area and the southerly side of the wharf is an area of water, about five hundred feet in length and varying in width from one hundred to two hundred feet, set back somewhat from the main harbor. \u201cBoats in this area . . . are at no time in the path of boats proceeding southerly by the end of . . . \u00a1[Welch\u2019s] wharf and by the easterly edge of\u201d the parking area. \u201cPrior to the spring of 1958, there was an island . . . which at low tide covered a substantial part of this area.\u201d In February and March, 1958, the department of public works of the Commonwealth (the department) dredged about nine acres in Scituate harbor \u201cto provide for six feet of water at mean low water\u201d and this \u201cdredging was extended to include removing the island in the area between\u201d Welch\u2019s wharf and the parking area. As a consequence, \u201cmore space became available in the inner harbor for the mooring of boats. This would necessarily result in some increased traffic between the inner and outer harbors. The entrance to the inner harbor from the outer harbor is by the northerly end of\u201d Welch\u2019s wharf.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Late in 1957 the harbor master of Scituate suggested the installation of a marina<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the area between Welch\u2019s wharf and the parking area. Welch was not interested but one Maxwell (a defendant in one of the present suits and the plaintiff in the other) did talk with the harbor master \u201cwho approved the project at that time.\u201d Maxwell and the town\u2019s selectmen thereafter (and prior to April 29, 1958) studied the project and Maxwell and one selectman visited \u201cthe department ... to find if any permit was necessary . . . and learned that none was required.\u201d Up to April 29, 1958 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>there was \u201cno apparent opposition by the selectmen to the placing of the marina off the Welch . . . property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u201cMaxwell ordered fourteen moorings, each weighing two tons, made of . . . concrete, 4% feet square and <em>V/2 </em>feet thick\u201d on each side of which \u201cis a % inch rod cast in the block.\u201d These were delivered on April 28. By then Maxwell had ordered materials for ten floats, each six feet wide and twenty feet long, later built.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Protests about the marina were made to the selectmen at their meeting on April 29. About this time the harbor master told Maxwell \u201cthat the picture had changed . . . [and] that he would not approve the marina unless ... so directed by the selectmen.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 7, Maxwell wrote to the harbor master of his intention to proceed to build the marina. On May 9, the harbor master wrote to Maxwell \u201cthat the marina . . . would constitute a menace to navigation and could not be sanctioned by him.\u201d When Maxwell received this letter he had constructed two floats and thereafter he built eight more.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">On May 21, the town brought a bill to enjoin Maxwell from placing the floats. A preliminary injunction was denied. Thereupon Maxwell finished the marina which extended out from the shore one hundred forty-two feet and then turned in a northerly direction toward the wharf about sixty feet. It was Maxwell\u2019s intention later to extend the marina three hundred feet toward the wharf.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">On May 26, the harbor master told Maxwell that he was compelled to give him notice to remove the floats, and on May 26 by mail gave him such notice to do so within twenty-four hours. After obtaining the agreement of the selectmen to \u201cshare in the responsibility\u201d the harbor master retained one Gilley and, through him, one Wheeler to remove the floats and they started to do so, in the presence of the harbor master and one selectman, less than twenty-four hours from Maxwell\u2019s receipt of the notice to remove.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">On June 3, 1958, Maxwell filed a bill in equity against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>selectmen, the harbor master, Gilley, and Wheeler,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking to restrain interference with the marina and for other relief. The suits were referred to a master. The facts stated above are based upon his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The master also found (a) \u201cthat the harbor master, in good faith, ordered the removal . . . under the belief that he had authority . . . under\u201d G. L. c. 102, \u00a7 24; (b) that the harbor master\u2019s \u201cdetermination . . . that the marina constituted a menace to navigation was based on speculation and apprehension as to . . . possible interference with ordinary traffic in the channel . . . that such possibility was remote . . . [and] that this determination . . ., in all the circumstances, was unreasonable\u201d; (c) that the harbor master\u2019s order of May 26, 1958, \u201cto Maxwell was arbitrary and unreasonable\u201d; (d) that Maxwell\u2019s moorings \u201ccomplied substantially\u201d with regulations of the harbor- master made under G. L. c. 102; (e) that there was no evidence that these regulations had been published or communicated to Maxwell; and (f) that, although a regulation of the harbor master required that mooring permits be obtained, there was no evidence that the regulation had been published and the evidence showed that no such permit had ever been issued to anyone. The master ruled that the marina was not a vessel within the meaning of G. L. c. 102, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The trial judge confirmed the master\u2019s report, denied a motion to recommit the report, and overruled the exceptions of the town and its officers to the report. Final decrees were entered dismissing the town\u2019s bill and permanently enjoining the defendants in the suit by Maxwell from interfering with the installation and operation of the marina. The town and its officers seek review of the various decrees by bills of exception and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">1. By G. L. c. 102, \u00a7 19, the selectmen of a town with an improved harbor are directed to appoint a harbor master. By \u00a7 21 each master of a vessel is directed to \u201canchor his vessel according to the regulations of the harbor master, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>and . . . [to] move to such place as he directs.\u201d Under \u00a7 24 a harbor master at the owner\u2019s expense may \u201ccause the removal of any vessel . . . not moved when directed by him.\u201d By \u00a7 26, a harbor master \u201cmay regulate and station all vessels in the streams or channels of his harbor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The powers given to a harbor master relate to the control of \u201cvessels.\u201d Examination of G. L. c. 102, \u00a7\u00a7 19-26, persuades us that the Legislature used the term \u201cvessel\u201d in its ordinary sense of a ship, boat, or barge. Nothing in the language of the sections, or in the decided cases discussing them, suggests any grant of power to harbor masters to control structures, even if they consist in part of floats. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>223 Mass. 84, 85-86. With reference to what is now \u00a7 23, see <em>The Clover, </em>1 Lowell, 342 (D. Mass.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Some support to our interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 19-26 may also be given by c. 102, \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">2. By G. L. c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 10<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 14 (as amended respectively through St. 1931, c. 394, \u00a7 59, and St. 1931, c. 426, \u00a7 206), the department is given certain powers with respect to harbors and structures therein. Section 10 gives to the department \u201cgeneral care and supervision of . . . harbors\u201d and \u00a7 14 provides that the department may license wharves, piers, or other structures. In view, however, of our holding as to the powers of the harbor master, we need not decide whether this marina is essentially a floating pier with mooring accessories and thus sufficiently like a wharf or pier to come within \u00a7 14. See <em>F. W. Fitch Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>323 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>U. S. 582, 585-586. See also <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>New England Inst. &amp; New England Sch. of Accounting, Inc. </em>335 Mass. 486, 488-489. Cf. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>328 Mass. 404, 408.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">3. The harbor master was without power to remove the marina. Since no relief is sought by the department, which is not a party to either suit, we have no occasion to consider the extent of the department\u2019s powers. The exceptions are overruled. The interlocutory and final decrees are affirmed. Maxwell is to have costs of these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> \u201cA marina is an arrangement of floats in the form of an \u2018L\u2019 or a \u2018T\u2019, moored in the water, and so arranged that . . . boats . . . can be tied up to the marina. Anyone with, a boat tied up to the marina would walk from the shore onto the floats down to his boat.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"> It appeared that the marina would conflict with a bait pier near the parking space which had been at some time under discussion by town officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\"> The case against Gilley and Wheeler was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\"> Cases defining the word \u201cvessel\u201d in broader terms for other purposes have no application here.
