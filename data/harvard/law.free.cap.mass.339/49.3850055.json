The bill, as amended, sets out that \u201cstructures existing on . . . [the] land at the date . . . zoning by-laws became effective, have subsequently been altered to an extent which amounts to reconstruction, extension, and structural change\u201d and to \u201cprovide for . . . use in a manner substantially different from the use . . . before . . . alteration.\u201d The trial judge made comprehensive findings of fact, which he later adopted as a statutory report of material facts. A final decree was entered dismissing the bill. The town appealed. The evidence is reported. The scope of our review is that stated in <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Willett, </em>333 Mass. 323, 324, <em>Zelman </em>v. <em>Killion, </em>337 Mass. 666, 669, and <em>Linse </em>v. <em>O\u2019Meara, </em>338 Mass. 338, 345. Except as otherwise noted, the facts stated are as found by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The town\u2019s zoning by-law (the principal applicable provisions of which are set out in the margin<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) became effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>on December 26, 1942. Anthony, at least as early as April, 1942, had been removing from the Greene lot gravel, there processed. He had obtained in 1940 from Greene, its owner, an option to buy the lot, with the privilege of removing sand and gravel in the meantime, and purchased the lot in 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">He put up on the lot a building ten feet by twelve feet for telephone, storage, and office purposes. A crusher and a sand and gravel plant were assembled and a platform, mentioned below, was built \"on which bags of cement were stored . . . and . . . covered with a canvas.\" Wooden bins were \"erected upon wooden posts, with the base . . . sufficiently high ... to permit trucks to pass underneath and be loaded with . . . ingredients used in making\" concrete. From \u201cthe processing plant . . . [came] different grades of gravel and sand. A power shovel and loader picked up these . . . and put them in the bins and the trucks . . . underneath were loaded, the material being dumped into the compartments in the truck\u201d through the base of the bins. Bags of cement were opened and placed on the top. Anthony\u2019s testimony shows that this was done from the small platform, about ten feet by twenty-five feet, where the cement bags were stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The judge found that \u201cthe different ingredients . . . were then mixed,\u201d although this finding seems somewhat in conflict with Anthony\u2019s own testimony which indicated that any mixing consisted of putting the materials into the trucks in horizontal layers in dry form. In any event, the loaded material was \u201ctaken away for delivery to the customer in dump trucks.\" This loading method, with such mixing of the ingredients as occurred, \"was in operation for several months prior to the adoption of the zoning [by-]law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In late 1941 or early 1942, a \u201cmake shift elevator or \u2018bucket line\u2019\u201d was built. Driven by a gasoline engine, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>arrangement replaced the power shovel in loading. \u201cThe plant . . . thus constructed continued in operation . . . and in 1953 the wooden bins . . . used for the . . . gravel and sand, had fallen into disrepair.\u201d The town building inspector on April 7, 1953, issued Anthony a permit \u201cto build or alter a building ... to be occupied as steel bins . . . about 15 by 15 over-all .... [T]he defendant erected steel bins set upon eight concrete posts.\u201d A worn out conveyer belt was replaced. Thereafter cement \u201cwas brought to the plant in . . . [airtight] trucks [in bulk instead of in bags] and dumped into a bin which . . . [Anthony] had been permitted to erect, by means of a \u2018bucket elevator.\u2019\u201d The gravel and sand were stored in a separate bin. \u201c[A] tube from the cement bin leads into the bin storing the . . . [gravel and sand] and the entire mixture is . . . lowered into a truck\u201d containing a revolving drum and a water tank, \u201cso constructed that it may be activated during the transit of the material and . . . water . . . added to the mixture of stone, gravel, and cement. Sometimes the material [now] leaves the plant . . . dry . . . <em>; </em>at other times . . . water is added during transit . . . to the customer, and at other times the operation is completed at the point of delivery.\u201d There was testimony that the new operation resulted in a very much larger volume of truck traffic than had previously existed and that much larger trucks were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u201cAfter 1942 a small building was erected where the cement was dumped for transmission by the elevators to the bin to prevent dust from scattering\u201d and two other small buildings were built. The testimony shows that one of these was for heating the mixture, which Anthony stated he \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle . . . before in the wintertime.\u201d These small buildings, the judge found, were \u201cof insignificant size.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Anthony\u2019s business \u201chas increased in volume but is now concentrated in a smaller area ... in closer proximity to the mechanical plant.\u201d Electricity instead of a gas engine now operates the elevator bucket line. There was testimony that facilities for weighing the cement have been added.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>To one of the steel \u201cbins replacing the . . . wooden bins . . . there is attached an elevator that carries the bulk cement into the bin. From the foundation to the top of the . . . bins is 34 feet 1 inch.\u201d There is a belt \u201c17 feet 11| inches above the top of the bin, and above this belt there is an electric motor . . . braced to stop vibration, ... 4 feet 8 inches above the top of the belt. The total height from . . . ground level ... is 56 feet, 8 inches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The judge, in what we interpret to be ultimate findings based upon the Subsidiary findings just outlined, concluded so far as here material (a) \u201cthat the business as presently conducted is the same as that . . . prior to . . . the zoning [by-]law, and that while it has . . . greater volume, it has not been extended by uses differing substantially\u201d from its pre-zoning operation; \u201cmodern mechanism made necessary by the increased volume . . . facilitates . . . the business but does not change its . . . original character\u201d; (b) that, because of the hazy recollection of witnesses, he could not find the dimensions of the worn out wooden bins; (c) that the steel bins (apart from motor braces and elevators) did not exceed the 35 foot limit imposed by the zoning by-law and that the braces, belt, and elevator \u201care accessories without which the bins would be without practical value\u201d; (d) that the post-1942 small buildings are buildings customarily on land used in tins type of business; and (e) \u201cthat there has been no change of use, . . . alteration of . . . structures for any purpose . . . substantially different from its [prior] use ... or for its use to a substantially greater extent than that existing at the time of the zoning by-law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The testimony, including that of Anthony, described the changes from pre-zoning by-law days in somewhat greater detail than did the trial judge. Examination of the testimony confirms various inferences which we draw from the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings and which differ from the conclusions reached by the judge upon the same basic facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The new 1953 structures turned a makeshift set of arrangements for furnishing to dump trucks in one place all the ingredients of concrete into a modem plant using more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>elaborate fixed facilities for use in connection with more complicated vehicles than in 1942. The old arrangement used cement only in bags whereas the new use of bulk cement resulted in turning the Greene lot in effect into a substantial supply terminal for cement mixer trucks. There was not merely a permitted increase in the volume of business done in an existing plant. See <em>Building Commr. of Medford </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>312 Mass. 461. There was change in and enlargement of the plant which made it \u201cdifferent in kind in its effect upon the neighborhood.\u201d See <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of Burlington </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>320 Mass. 207, 210, and cases there cited, especially <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>316 Mass. 124, 128 (where a small local tailor shop was held improperly expanded into a mechanized dry cleaning establishment employing seventeen people). See <em>Adamsky </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>326 Mass. 603, 605; <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Capitol Motor Transp. Co. Inc. </em>330 Mass. 417, 420-421; Rhyne, Municipal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 32-28, 32-30. See also <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>325 Mass. 494, 495-496. Cf. <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Roemer, </em>287 Mass. 500, 508-509 (which has been recognized as resting upon the special statutory provisions applicable in Boston; see <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of Burlington </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>320 Mass. 207, 109); <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Scituate, </em>301 Mass. 365, 370-371. There was here in total more change than the mere use of either improved and more modern equipment within an existing building, or of more modern movable equipment outdoors. Cf. <em>Wayland </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>325 Mass. 637, 642-644.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The new bin for cement with its mechanical apparatus extending above thirty-five feet from the ground was a violation of \u00a7 VIII of the by-law. The judge concluded that these items were permitted as accessories to the new steel bin used for cement. We construe \u00a7 VIII as permitting such accessories to go above thirty-five feet only when placed on residence and municipal buildings, schools, and churches allowed by the by-law to be built within an \u201cA Residence\u201d district. We find no suggestion in the by-law that structures replacing others formerly used for nonconforming uses are to be permitted to have accessories more than thirty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>feet from the ground. See somewhat comparable situation discussed in <em>Building Inspector of Falmouth </em>v. <em>Gingrass, </em>338 Mass. 274, 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Under \u00a7 V, no board was to permit a nonconforming use to be expanded or changed to one \u201cmore detrimental or objectionable to a neighborhood,\u201d and under \u00a7 VIII, the building inspector had no authority to issue any permit for a building not in conformity with the by-law. The permit granted to Anthony did not create an estoppel against the town to enforce the by-law. If the structure \u201cwas a violation of a . . . zoning by-law, no permit could legalize it.\u201d <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of Burlington </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>320 Mass. 207, 210. See <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Saugus, </em>333 Mass. 760, 764-765; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>338 Mass. 704, 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The replacement of the wooden platform for loading and storing cement by a steel bin and accessories, and the additions of wholly new small buildings and a heating plant to permit winter use, were violations of the precise terms of the zoning by-law. See <em>Planning Board of Reading </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Reading, </em>333 Mass. 657, 660-661. They were not temporary, expendable structures like that considered in <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Leahy, </em>336 Mass. 158, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">On the grounds stated, the judge\u2019s conclusions (apart, possibly, from his inability to find that the steel bins exceed in size the old wooden bins) are not justified by the evidence or by his own subsidiary findings. Accordingly, the decree is reversed. A new decree is to be entered (1) requiring Anthony to remove entirely (a) the steel bins to the extent necessary to restore the aggregate bin capacity for sand and gravel to no more than it was in 1942 (a matter about which there must be further hearing and as to which Anthony has the burden of proof), (b) all parts of any of the steel bins and all mechanical equipment and accessories which reach to a greater height than is permitted by the zoning by-law, and (c) all the small buildings placed on the Greene lot after 1942 ; and (2) enjoining him (a) from storing bulk cement on the Greene lot, (b) from distributing cement on or from the Greene lot otherwise than in bags and in the manner em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ployed by him prior to the adoption of the zoning by-law, (c) from using any of the steel bins or accessories for the storage of anything other than sand and gravel, and (d) from using the Greene lot for the delivery or sale of sand, gravel, and cement to mobile cement mixers, or otherwise than to dump trucks and vehicles of the size and general type used in 1942 and in the manner employed by him prior to the adoption of the zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-8\"> Prior litigation between the same parties relating to a much larger parcel adjacent to that here involved is reported in <em>Seekonk </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>328 Mass. 236.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\"> Section V. \u201cThis by-law . . . shall not apply to existing . . . structures, nor to the existing use of any . . . structure, or of land to the extent to which it is used at the time of the adoption of this by-law. It shall apply to any change of use thereafter or to the . . . alteration of building or structure for a purpose, or in a manner substantially different from the use to which it was put before alteration, or for its use for the same purpose to a substantially greater extent ....
