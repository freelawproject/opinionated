Brentwood Avenue was a private way until February 7, 1955, when the city took by eminent domain an easement for a public street forty feet wide. The avenue had appeared as a private way forty feet wide on a 1923 plan recorded with the registry of deeds but, prior to 1955, it had a dirt surface and, as a private way, was in fact constructed and used only to a width of twenty-four feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>In 1950 the petitioners completed a house on their land. It included a basement garage \u201cbelow the ground surface level, [with] access ... by a driveway declining from the private way to the garage.\u201d Until February 7, 1955, this garage could be used. When, however, the city constructed the avenue \u201cas a public street ... it made the street twenty-four feet wide from the . . . (street) edge of the sidewalk on one side to the . . . (street) edge of the sidewalk on the other side.\u201d The city also \u201cconstructed sidewalks eight feet wide on each side of\u201d the avenue and \u201capproximately six and one half inches above the road level.\u201d The evidence, at the trial of this petition under G. L. c. 79 for assessment of damages resulting from the taking, was sufficient to warrant findings by the jury, (a) \u201cthat as a result of . . . such construction . . . the grade of the driveway . . . was so altered as to deprive the petitioners of the use of the garage and the driveway as a means of access thereto\u201d; and (b) that the consequent damage to the petitioners was $7,500. The jury returned a verdict for this amount and the trial judge reported the case under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111, for the determination of certain questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Subject to the petitioners\u2019 exception, the judge admitted in evidence an application by a corporation (Fred Holland Chamberlin, Inc.) in 1925 to the city\u2019s board of survey for permission to lay out and construct Brentwood Avenue as a private way. The board voted approval \u201cwhen the plans meet the requirements of the city engineer.\u201d A plan, which was not the plan filed with the application, of land \u201cpurported thereon to be owned by Fred Holland Chamberlin, an individual . . . dated March 1926 . . . bears the notations that it was approved by the . . . board of survey on March 23, 1926, and filed in the . . . city engineer\u2019s office.\u201d This plan shows Brentwood Avenue as forty feet wide. Brent-wood Avenue, while a private way prior to 1955, had no sidewalk in front of the petitioners\u2019 property, and the petitioners\u2019 driveway had a \u201cgradual slope leading\" from the . . . garage to the dirt road,\u201d and \u201cbushes were growing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>on . . . [the petitioners\u2019] lots and there were brush and rubbish there, and the bushes, brush, and rubbish went to the edge of the dirt road.\u201d The city engineer testified that trees on these lots extended to the edge of the dirt road.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In addition to their general verdict, the jury found in response to special questions (1) that \u201call persons, other than the petitioners, who had rights . . . over that part of Brentwood Avenue used ... as a driveway\u201d had abandoned those rights before 1955, and (2) that \u201cthe petitioners\u2019 driveway as it existed prior to . . . 1955, [did not] unreasonably obstruct the rights of others in Brentwood Avenue as a private way.\u201d To the putting of the question relating to the abandonment of rights the city excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The trial judge reported for our determination the questions (A) whether the plan approved in 1926 by the board of survey was \u201cproperly admitted in evidence as an approval of a street layout under \u201d G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 73-81; (B) whether there was \u201csufficient evidence to warrant . . . submitting . . . to the jury\u201d the question of abandonment; and (C) whether in the light of the answers to (A) and (B) above, \u201cthe petitioners [are] barred from recovering damages for the loss of use of their garage and . . . driveway.\u201d By the terms of the report judgment is to be entered for the city if the answers to both (A) and (C) are in the affirmative; otherwise judgment is to be entered on the verdict with interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">There was no evidence that at the time of the taking in 1955 any other person had, or was asserting, rights in the area of Brentwood Avenue (the fee in which was owned by the petitioners) lying outside the travelled dirt way twenty-four feet wide, except what inferences might be drawn from the circumstances that a recorded plan showed other lots bounding upon the avenue. There was also no evidence that the city, at the time of the taking, had any rights in Brentwood Avenue, unless it gained some rights by the board of survey\u2019s approval of the 1926 plan showing a layout of the avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">We assume, but without deciding, that the approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>1926 plan was a valid approval of the establishment of Brent-wood Avenue as <em>\u201ca </em>private way for public use\u201d in accordance with G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 74.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such approval, even if valid, \u201camounted merely to the regulation of existing rights and determined in the public interest the manner in which such rights should be exercised. After the approval of the\u201d 1926 plan, Brentwood Avenue, if laid out and constructed, could be built only \u201cin conformity with\u201d the plan. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>E. William &amp; Merrill C. Nutting, Inc. </em>302 Mass. 535, 543. The city gained no rights in the avenue other than the power to require that action to construct a way for public use, if taken by persons having rights in the avenue, should comply with the plan. Such persons could not be required to take action. The action of the board of survey, prior to any city action laying out a public highway or taking land for a highway, did not prevent the petitioners from using the undeveloped area in any way which did not interfere with the existing rights of others, so long as the petitioners did not construct over that undeveloped land a \u201cway for public use\u201d in a manner inconsistent with the approved plan. See Swaim, Crocker\u2019s Notes on the Common Forms (7th ed.) \u00a7 839 at p. 453.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The special answer of the jury that the petitioners\u2019 pre1955 driveway did not \u201cunreasonably obstruct the rights of others\u201d in the avenue is thus conclusive of this case. That answer established for the purposes of this case that the petitioners, when the taking was made in 1955, were entitled to maintain for their own private use their driveway as it then was, regardless of whether others having rights in the undeveloped portion of the avenue were not asserting or had abandoned those rights. It is thus unnecessary to consider the adequacy of the evidence of abandonment or whether the question with respect to abandonment should have been put to the jury. The petitioners\u2019 use prior to 1955 simply did not interfere with any rights of others. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>281 Mass. 217, 225. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hewitt, </em>314 Mass. 346, 350; <em>Ampagoomian </em>v. <em>Atamian, </em>323 Mass. 319, 322. Restatement: Property, \u00a7\u00a7 481, 486. Tiffany, Real Property (3d ed.) \u00a7 811. Compare <em>Delconte </em>v. <em>Salloum, </em>336 Mass. 184. The city action, in making a formal taking to establish Brentwood Avenue, thus took from the petitioners substantial value existing in their driveway and caused them damage. The petitioners were not barred, by any interest of the city or of others, from seeking assessment of such damage under G. L. c. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In accordance with the terms of the report, since the petitioners are not barred from recovering damages, judgment is to be entered on the verdict, with interest thereon, and with costs in favor of the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-5\"> Section 74 reads, \u201cAfter the establishment of a board of survey no person shall open a private way for public use without first submitting to said board suitable plans thereof ....
