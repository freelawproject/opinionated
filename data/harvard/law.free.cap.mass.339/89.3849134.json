L. c. 40, \u00a7 53,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to \"prohibit . . . raising . . . money by taxation of real estate in a manner not authorized by law.\u201d The taxpayers allege that they \"are advised and believe and therefore aver that for . . . several years the . . . assessors . . . [have] pursued a policy of fractional or percentage valuations of real estate; that assessments have been based on such . . . valuations . . . [which] have not been made on a uniform basis . . . but . . . different properties have been assessed at widely varying percentages of their fair cash value; . . . that the greater portion of . . . assessments are at substantially less than the fair cash values of the . . . parcels; . . . that the general average ... is substantially less than one hundred per cent of the full . . . cash values; . . . [and] that the . . . [assessors], for 1958, are about to, and . . . intend to, pursue the same valuation and assessment practice . . . [and] to commit the resultant tax list, with its unlawful valuations and assessments and their warrant to the collector of taxes . . . and ... for subsequent years . . . intend to follow the same unlawful practice.\u201d They further aver that it is the duty of the assessors to \"levy proportional and reasonable assessments . . . and by statute [G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3, 38] the uniform standard to apply ... is fair cash value\u201d; that certain of the taxpayers own real estate \"which several parcels have been . . . overvalued ... in relation to other real estate . . . assessed at substantially lower percentages of fair cash value, and in relation to the general average . . . ratio of assessments to fair cash value . . . which . . . ratio is well under one hundred per cent . . . [so that the taxpayers] will be forced to pay more than their proportionate shares of the taxes raised\u201d; that against this type of assessment (e.g. \"eighty per cent assessments as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>forty per cent assessments\u201d) the remedies \u201cby appeal from overassessment are not available\u201d and would not \u201cresult in equalization\u201d; and that the taxpayers have no adequate remedy at law. The trial judge sustained a demurrer by the assessors. The taxpayers appealed from both the interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrer and the final decree dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>268 Mass. 480, 485, it was held that assessors come within G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53, but in the particular case equitable relief was denied because (p. 490) \u201cthe method adopted ... for assessing taxes . . . [was] .in conformity to the terms of the enabling statutes\u201d and the court noted (at p. 491) \u201cnothing disproportionate in the proposed tax levy.\u201d In <em>Amory </em>v. Assessors <em>of Boston, </em>306 Mass. 354, 357-358, this court held that mandamus did not lie to force assessors (see p. 356) \u201cto perform their official duties fairly . . . and to refrain from valuing taxable property . . . otherwise than at its fair cash value in accordance with their honest judgment\u201d in view of the existence of the remedy under c. 40, \u00a7 53. In the later case of <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>310 Mass. 199, 203-204, relief against overvaluation of properties in Boston was denied to ten taxpayers, where it was not \u201calleged that the manner of assessment will result in a total ... in excess of the . . . amount required for municipal expenses \u201d and the petition on the issue of overassessment failed \u201cto show that the protection of the public interests requires the intervention of a court of equity.\u201d See comment 22 B. U. L. Rev. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The statutory duty of the assessors, of course, is to assess all taxable property in the city at its full and fair cash value as determined in their honest judgment, without discriminatory treatment of any persons or property. \u201cThe standard . . . established by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38, is the fair cash valuation of all the real and personal estate subject to taxation. That standard cannot be varied by public officers .... There must be rigid adherence to that standard.\u201d <em>Waltham Watch &amp; Clock Co. </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>272 Mass. 396, 412. This principle and the provisions of c. 59, \u00a7 38, are supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>by the Massachusetts Constitution, Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, giving authority \u201cto the . . . general court ... to impose and levy proportional and reasonable assessments . . . and taxes.\u201d Article 4 has been \u201cconsistently construed ... as establishing the principle of uniformity of taxation of all classes of taxable property.\u201d See cases collected in Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 63, 64, pp. 109, 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The existence of the constitutional and statutory principle requiring proportional property taxation does not, by itself, require or permit relief in a proceeding in equity under c. 40, \u00a7 53, for relief under \u00a7 53 is limited by general equitable principles as well as by the terms of the statute. Although the principle of proportional taxation was relied on by the ten taxpayers in the second <em>Amory </em>case (310 Mass. 199) a demurrer was there sustained, the court mentioning various grounds for its action, including what was at least a strong suggestion that c. 40, \u00a7 53, was not intended to give ten taxpayers a right \u201cto secure what in effect would be an abatement of taxes upon thousands of parcels of real estate,\u201d or to permit \u201cten taxpayers, none of whom is illegally burdened by the assessment of a tax upon his property and none of whom contends that the total . . . assessment is excessive, . . . [to] compel a revaluation of nearly all of the taxable real estate of a large city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">We need not decide, however, whether upon these allegations any such petition could be maintained<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> despite the suggestions in the second <em>Amory </em>case, just mentioned. It is now apparent that the present case has become moot as to 1958 assessments, and that no case is adequately stated under c. 40, \u00a7 53, with respect to 1959 and later assessments. The petition was filed on May 14, 1958, and indicates that the 1958 assessment process had not then been completed. The 1959 assessments then were over a year in the future. To be sure, the petition alleges \u201cthat for subsequent years\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the assessors \u201cplan ... to follow the same . . . practice\u201d and that the same practice of disproportionate assessments \u201cappears imminent . . . for 1958 and subsequent years.\u201d Under c. 40, \u00a7 53, however, proceedings to restrain municipal official action cannot anticipate events beyond the relatively near future. There must be some reasonably certain and immediate unlawful action in prospect to warrant relief under \u00a7 53. \u201cA well grounded expectation of such [unlawful] conduct is not enough to confer jurisdiction under the statute.\u201d <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Trustees of Deerfield Academy, </em>252 Mass. 258, 260. It is inappropriate to assume and allege in 1958, over a year in advance, that the assessors \u201cwill not apply proper principles,\u201d in the performance of their public duties. See <em>Board of Health of Woburn </em>v. <em>Sousa, </em>338 Mass. 547, 554. Even the collection process on the 1958 assessments must have now been completed, or substantially completed. We do not understand that any injunctive relief with respect to 1958 assessments is now practicable, if, indeed, any such relief is now sought.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No motion has been made to amend the petition to make more specific allegations with respect to 1959. The original allegations, viewed as of the time when they were made, did not set out with certainty sufficient facts with respect to 1959 to show the type of immediately contemplated municipal action necessary to state a case under c. 40, \u00a7 53, even if it be assumed that a petition can be maintained under \u00a7 53 seeking essentially assessment equalization for the whole of a large city.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-5\"> Section 53 reads, \u201cIf a town or any of its officers . . . are about to raise . . . money ... in any manner other than that ... in which such town has the legal and constitutional right and power to raise . . . money . . . the . . . superior court may, upon the petition of not less than ten taxable inhabitants of the town, determine the same in equity . . ..\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> As amended by St. 1954, c. 459, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\"> See discussion of this problem by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in <em>Switz </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>23 N. J. 580, 598-599. Cf. <em>Randell </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>63 Conn. 321, 323-324, overruled in <em>E. Ingraham Co. </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>144 Conn. 374, 383, which points out the practical problems presented in a situation closely comparable to that in the present case. Cf. also <em>Burritt Mut. Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>20 Conn. Supp. 476, 480.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\"> It was stated at the arguments that proceedings have been brought under G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 98, to recover, as illegally assessed and as wholly illegal, the 1958 taxes paid by these taxpayers under protest. We have not considered the effect of the alleged 1958 assessment methods under \u00a7 98 or under generally related sections like \u00a7\u00a7 82, 87.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\"> Obviously such an equalization involves problems of great practical complexity, usually solved by executive action or pursuant to express legislative directions. These problems may certainly be taken into account in a proceeding in equity seeking such an equalization, under the principle that, if the consequences of giving relief are speculative or relief is unlikely to be effective, relief may be denied in appropriate cases.
