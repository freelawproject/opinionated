The agreement for sale was executed November 29, 1954, and provided for a conveyance of title on or before January 30, 1955. It contained a clause that the seller \u201cagrees to execute an assignment to the buyer of all warranties received by him from subcontractors with reference to plumbing, heating and roofing on the subject premises.\u201d There was evidence that the defendant said he had a twenty year \u201cwritten bond guarantee\u201d for the roof .and told the plaintiff that he would deliver it to the plaintiff \u201cwithin the next few days of the date of passing papers.\u201d The parties met on January 12, 1955, and the defendant gave to the plaintiff a paper (exhibit 2) reading as follows: \u201cAssignment January 12, 1955 For, and in consideration of the passing of papers upon the premises located on Lot #8, Sharpe Road, Newton, Massachusetts, I hereby assign all right, title and interest in and to the following service guarantees: Service Guarantees 1. Hot water heater. 2. Boiler-heating system. 3. Oven and stove. 4. Roof. 5. Disposal. (Signed) Benjamin Shaffer.\u201d The papers were passed and it appears that the plaintiff did not receive the written guaranty as to the roof. The defendant said that he would deliver it within the next few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The judge found that \u201cthe talk re: a warranty or bond for the performance of the roof was more than sales talk standing alone, but that with exhibit #2, the plaintiff had more than talk to persuade him to make the purchase of the house in question.\u201d He found for the plaintiff and reported the questions of law raised by his denial of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings only the following of which are now material: \u201c1. The evidence requires a finding for the defendant. 2. The law requires a finding for the defendant. ... 8. The acceptance of the deed by the plaintiff discharges all of the obligations of the defendant.\u201d As to No. 8 the judge stated: \u201cThe deed was not offered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>evidence. The trial court does not know the contents of the deed. As presently advised 'the trial court rules that exhibit #2 was not extinguished by the deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The case is here on the defendant\u2019s appeal from a decision of the Appellate Division which held that \u201cthere was no prejudicial error in the rulings of the trial judge\u201d and ordered the report dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">From the meager evidence recited in the report the judge could have found that the service guaranty of the roof to which reference was made in the assignment of January 12 was understood by the parties to be a written twenty year bond and that the plaintiff was damaged by the defendant\u2019s failure to deliver it. The defendant\u2019s contention that the judge could not properly consider the oral evidence as to the bond and its promised delivery because in violation of the paroi evidence rule cannot be sustained. The meaning of \u201cservice guarantee\u201d is ambiguous and it would be permissible to resort to prior negotiations, the conduct of the parties and statements after the contract was executed, not to vary or enlarge it, but to define its terms. <em>Letts-Parker Grocer Co. </em>v. <em>W. R. Marshall &amp; Co. Inc. </em>232 Mass. 504, 506. <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>303 Mass. 16, 21. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Jablonski, </em>253 Mass. 451, 456; <em>Maybury Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Izenstatt, </em>320 Mass. 397, 403-404. There was no error in denying requests numbered 1 and 2. There also was no error in denying request numbered 8. The assignment of the bond was collateral to the conveyance of the house and land.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
