The auditor found for the defendants. The judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment on the auditor\u2019s report, and reported the cases to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We state facts found by the auditor. On July 1, 1955, about 1:30 p.m. the taxicab was in operation on West Street, a public way in the city of Gardner, by the taxicab company\u2019s agent, one LeBlanc. As he drove in a westerly direction, the automobile went out of control, jumped a curb, and ran into the pole on the north side of West Street about five feet from the edge of the sidewalk. LeBlanc was \u201cseriously injured,\u201d and the automobile \u201cbadly damaged.\u201d The pole was jarred by the impact, and telephone wires hung low across the street. There was a hole in the sidewalk near the base of and to the west of the pole. The hole was approximately five inches wide and \u201cabout the radius of the telephone pole.\u201d Immediately after the accident telephone company men repaired the wire damage. They did nothing to the pole. The taxicab company\u2019s president went to the scene, ordered the automobile towed away, but \u201cdid nothing to warn anybody about the pole and the hole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">On July 15, 1955, about 10:15 p.m. the plaintiff, who lived near by, stepped or fell into the hole. On the morning of July 16 the hole was thirty inches in length, eighteen inches in width, and twelve inches in depth. The widest part was at the northwest \u201ccorner\u201d of the pole. The hole was about five inches from the inside edge of the curb. The sidewalk consisted of about two inches of black top upon sand and gravel. There were \u201cjagged edges of pavement around the hole,\u201d and pieces were lying in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In the action against the taxicab company the auditor applied the doctrine of res ipso loquitur, and found that the accident was caused by LeBlanc\u2019s negligence. He found that a statement made by LeBlanc to police officers, that he thought he was going to \u201cblack out\u201d and tried to apply his brakes, \u201cwas not sufficient to rebut the presumption of negligence.\u201d Compare <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Bouley, </em>338 Mass. 625, 627-628. The auditor found that the defendant\u2019s negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>was not the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, because two weeks had intervened, during which time the hole had grown in size, and the city, which had notice, had the obligation to repair the defect under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7 15, and to warn the public of its presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In the action against the telephone company the auditor found that a permit had been issued to it in conjunction with an electric company \u201cto erect and maintain pole and wires on West Street,\u201d but stated that the defendant, which was not responsible for the damage to the pole and for the hole in the sidewalk, was not under any duty of repairing the hole or of placing barriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\u201cThe general finding of the trial judge rendered upon an auditor\u2019s report as the sole evidence imports the drawing of all rational inferences and the finding of all subsidiary facts tending to support that conclusion of which the case is susceptible.\u201d <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>283 Mass. 336, 339, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The judge could have drawn the inference that the hole in the condition in which it was on July 15 or 16 was riot the proximate result of the negligent act of the taxicab company\u2019s driver on July 1. Not enough appeared in the report to require a finding that the greatly expanded hole had so greatly grown in size because of the original act of running into the pole. Similarly, even were we to assume that the telephone company was under obligation to fill in the hole in its condition on July 1 \u2014 a matter which we need not, and do not, decide \u2014 there was nothing to require a finding that any failure to perform that duty was the proximate cause of the growth of the hole to its size on July 15 or 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">In accordance with the terms of the report, let the entry in each case be</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
