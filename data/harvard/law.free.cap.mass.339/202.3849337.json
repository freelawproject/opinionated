This contract was in evidence but is not before us. The findings of the trial judge showed that a reference to a \u201cbeauty parlor\u201d was struck out before the contract was signed. The troublesome clause in the contract, in so far as it appears in the report, is \u201ccarport to be finished as extra room.\u201d The report showed that there were no specifications in the contract nor any other directions as to the manner in which the \u201cextra room\u201d was to be finished. The report showed that the defendant wanted a house like the \u201cmodel house she had looked at\u201d which belonged to the plaintiff and that \u201cthe carport was to be finished as an extra room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">There was no description of the \u201ccarport\u201d in the report and no dictionary description of a \u201ccarport\u201d has been brought to our attention. However, it seems to be a matter of common knowledge that an ordinary \u201ccarport\u201d is a sort of a lean-to against the side of a house with a roof or covering over it which rests on several poles. Three sides of the '' carport \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>are open. Sketches or photographs of a \u201c carport \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>are frequently shown in newspaper advertisements of sales of houses in new developments of real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The plaintiff testified that when the contract was signed he did not understand that the \u201cextra room\u201d was to be used as a beauty parlor. There was further evidence that the plaintiff did the work which he now claims was an extra and that the defendant paid him the contract price of $15,250.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">One Jenkins, who originally brought the plaintiff and the defendant together, was called as a witness by the defendant. He testified without objection that he had talked with the plaintiff before the contract was signed. He was asked in direct examination, \u201cWill you tell us what conversation you had with . . . Cotty, relative to what he was to build with respect to the beauty parlor.\u201d Upon objection of the plaintiff this question was excluded. Thereupon the defendant made an offer of proof that the witness would answer that he, \u201cexplained to . . . Cotty that Mrs. Meister wanted the extra room closed off from the main house, with a separate front and rear entrance, a picture window in front, a lavatory and a rear exit from the main house, with a walk running from the house rear exit to the rear exit of the extra room, which was to be the beauty parlor, and . . . Cotty agreed to do the entire job within the contract price of\u201d $15,250.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The defendant requested that the ruling excluding the question be reported to the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division after hearing found no error and dismissed the report. The defendant appealed. This ruling on evidence presents the only issue before us. We are of opinion that there was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In Williston on Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 630, it is said in substance that the paroi evidence rule makes ineffectual the intention of the parties unless the written contract is not a complete integration of the parties\u2019 agreement and the oral agreement is intended to retain an independent collateral existence. In \u00a7 636 it is further said, \u201cThe paroi evidence rule assumes agreement upon the writing in question as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>complete statement of the bargain, that is, as an integration. If the parties never adopted the writing as a statement of the whole agreement, the rule does not exclude paroi evidence of additional promises.\u201d See Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">It is plain that the written contract in the instant case as it is described in the report is incomplete for no specifications nor any description of the manner in which the \u201ccarport\u201d was to be finished as an extra room was set forth. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>326 Mass. 611, 615, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Because there was error in the exclusion of the question, the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report must be reversed and the action must be remanded to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
