L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 3 (10). On March 21, 1952, the plaintiff was on the premises of the defendant Handy Cafe, Inc., and sustained injuries as a result of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>assault committed by one McBrayer, its employee. The plaintiff recovered judgments against both the defendant Handy Cafe, Inc., and McBrayer, for which executions, issued on November 6, 1956, are unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The defendant insurers filed pleas in abatement and demurrers, which assigned as a ground that the suit was barred by the one year statute of limitations contained in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4, as amended. The demurrers also assigned as a ground want of equity in the bill. The judge sustained the demurrers and allowed the pleas. The plaintiff appealed from a final decree dismissing the bill against the defendant insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">1. The suit is not barred by the statute of limitations. The defendants\u2019 argument that it is so barred is based upon an incomplete quotation of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4, as amended. This statute, so far as material, reads: \u201cActions for assault and battery . . . shall be commenced only within two years next after the cause of action accrues; and actions for libel and actions of tort for bodily injuries or for death the payment of judgments in which is required to be secured by chapter ninety and also actions of tort for bodily injuries or for death or for damage to property against officers and employees of the commonwealth . . . arising out of the operation of motor or other vehicles owned by the commonwealth . . . , suits by judgment creditors in <em>such actions, of tort </em>\u00a1Italics supplied] under section one hundred and thirteen of chapter one hundred and seventy-five and clause (10) of section thre\u00e9 of chapter two hundred and fourteen . . . shall be commenced only within one year next after the cause of action accrues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">We think that the italicized words refer to the two types of motor vehicle tort actions immediately previously described, namely, those required to be secured by c. 90 and those against officers and employees of the Commonwealth arising out of the operation of vehicles owned by the Commonwealth. Had the interpretation contended for by the defendants been the legislative, intent, we would expect the statute to assume a simpler form, such as suits by judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>creditors to reach and apply under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113, and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3 (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">2. Bodily injuries caused by an assault and battery are not \u201caccidental bodily injuries\u201d within the meaning of the policy. The case is controlled on this point by <em>Sontag </em>v. <em>Galer, </em>279 Mass. 309, where after showing (p. 312) that the liability of the insurance company to the plaintiff was dependent upon its liability to the insured, the court said (p. 313): \u201cWe do not adopt the contention made in behalf of the plaintiff that an injury is accidentally sustained merely because it may be accidental from the plaintiff\u2019s standpoint. It is the state of the \u2018will of the person by whose agency it [the injury] was caused\u2019 rather than that of the injured person which determines whether an injury was accidental.\u201d The circumstance that the assault in the <em>Qaler </em>case was by the defendant rather than by an agent of the defendant does not affect the underlying principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">3. The only ground for sustaining the pleas was the statute of limitations, which is not a bar. The order allowing the pleas must be reversed and the pleas must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">There was an additional ground of demurrer, want of equity, which was good. See <em>Hiller </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>324 Mass. 24, 25. The interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrers is affirmed. The final decree dismissing the bill against the insurers is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
