The only question argued by the plaintiff is whether the trial judge correctly directed a verdict for the defendant. The relevant facts are stated in their aspect most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The plaintiff was first appointed assistant professor at the college for the academic year beginning in September, 1948. With the letter of appointment was enclosed a copy of the college's \u201cFaculty Personnel Policy'' (the pohcy). This stated \u201cthe arrangement that governs appointments and tenure,\u201d defined the extent of its application to various teachers and other employees,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and contained provisions governing \u201ctenure\u201d and \u201cseparations.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s appointment was successively renewed for one year for the academic years beginning in September of 1949 and 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">On February 28, 1951, following a conversation with the college\u2019s president in which it appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s reappointment was \u201cuncertain,\u201d the plaintiff was notified that he would not be appointed for another year \u201cdue both to the curtailment made necessary by reduced enrollment and to an impending reorganization of our curriculum.\u201d Thereafter, there were several conversations between the plaintiff, on the one hand, and either the college president or a dean, during which the plaintiff contended that he had not been given the real reasons for the failure to reappoint him. There was discussion of part time employment which the plaintiff refused, at the same time talking of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">On June 4,1951, the college president wrote to the plaintiff \u201c. . . I am prepared to renew your appointment . . . for ;the academic year beginning in September, 1951, under the \u2022following conditions: (1) that this is to be regarded as a .terminal appointment with no commitment beyond the next academic year; (2) that you shall be free to ask release ... up to September 1 ... to accept another position.\u201d This was accompanied by another letter, not here relevant, stating certain of the president\u2019s reasons for his action. The plaintiff, who at the time had legal counsel, acknowledged both letters on June 6 and said \u201cI hereby accept the content of both letters,\u201d adding \u201c[t]he arrangements which you have made . . . will . . . give me a fair opportunity to provide for my best interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">On June 12, despite the correspondence just described, the plaintiff requested the faculty personnel committee created pursuant to the policy to make an investigation of his \u201cterminal contract.\u201d After investigation, the faculty personnel committee recommended on December 5, 1951, that the plaintiff \u201caccept the situation.\u201d The plaintiff, on March 4, 1952, requested permission to appear before the instruction committee of the trustees. A subcommittee of the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>tian committee found, among other things, that the president acted in good faith, that the grounds for separation listed in \u00a7 17 of the policy \u201capply only to members of the faculty on tenure,\u201d and that the plaintiff did not have tenure status. The subcommittee approved the action of the president in giving the plaintiff a terminal appointment. The subcommittee\u2019s report was reviewed by the chairman of the instruction committee and transmitted to the plaintiff on May 23, 1952. The present action was initiated by writ dated June 12, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">1. Section 16 of the policy (see footnote 2, supra) provides that it is only after \u201cthree years of service, [[that] members of the faculty may assume that they have permanence of tenure\u201d and that the \u201cfirst three years are to be probationary.\u201d The term \u201cprobationary\u201d in this written contractual provision must be interpreted in its \u201cusual and ordinary sense.\u201d <em>Ober </em>v. <em>National Cas. Co. </em>318 Mass. 27, 30. In ordinary connotation, the word indicates a status of experimental testing of the employee. It certainly implies no commitment for continuance of employment, if for any reason the experimental relationship leads to the conclusion that a more extended relationship may be unsatisfactory. See <em>Scott v. Manager State Airport, Hanscom Field, </em>336 Mass. 372, 375-377, construing the provisions of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 20D, relating to probationary civil service appointees. Section 20D, indeed, in various respects may be more precise, and afford more protection to the probationary employee, than the somewhat general provisions of \u00a7 16 of the policy. Cases under the civil service laws with respect to probationary employees obviously do not furnish an exact analogy to annual academic appointments prior to the acquisition of tenure, but the concept of probationary service is in a general way comparable. See e.g. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works, </em>304 Mass. 27, 28-29; <em>Crimmins </em>v. <em>Highway Commn. of Brockton, </em>304 Mass. 161, 164, 168-171; <em>Gibney </em>v. <em>Mayor of Fall River, </em>306 Mass. 561, 566; <em>Younie </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Unemployment Compensation, </em>306 Mass. 567, 570; <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Selectmen of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>Westwood, </em>316 Mass. 481, 483. See also Annotation, 131 A. L. R. 383, 386, 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">When the plaintiff received the \u201cterminal\u201d appointment of June 4, 1951, he had not completed the \u201cprobationary\u201d three years of service. He was then serving under a reappointment for the academic year beginning in September, 1950. He had been notified by letter dated February 28, 1951 (see Restatement 2d: Agency, \u00a7 442), that the college could not \u201coffer ... a reappointment.\u201d Accordingly, no contention reasonably can be made that there was failure to notify him \u201cnot later than March 15,\u201d if, indeed, such notification was in any degree required by \u00a7 16 of the policy, a question we need not decide. See Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 32, illustration 2. Cf. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Wickwire Spencer Steel Co. </em>239 Mass. 584, 586-587. Without more, his employment would simply have terminated at the end of the academic year. See <em>Wasson </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Defense, ante, </em>322, 327; Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 1027, p. 2844. He was not deprived of employment during any academic year for which he had been appointed, so we need not decide whether, during such a year, he could have been discharged immediately only in a manner consistent with \u00a7\u00a716 and 17 of the policy. We find nothing in either \u00a7 16 or \u00a7 17 which makes failure to reappoint a teacher, not on \u201ctenure\u201d and employed only for one year, a separation within the meaning of \u00a7 17, and we interpret failure to reappoint during the probationary term as merely a determination by the college, within its complete discretion, not to continue a relationship expiring by the terms of the appointment itself. To construe \u00a7\u00a716 and 17 as requiring the college to reappoint a \u201cprobationary\u201d appointee in the absence of one of the specified causes of \u201cseparation\u201d listed in \u00a7 17 (or other valid ground for termination of the employment of a professor on tenure, if any) would make meaningless the obviously intended difference between \u201cprobationary\u201d status and tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We attach no weight to the sentence in \u00a7 6 (a) of the policy (see footnote 1, supra) to the effect that the \u201ctotal content <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>of the . . . policy applies to\u201d the teaching faculty, which, we assume, includes \u201cprobationary\u201d teachers during the term of their appointments. The sentence is obviously used in contrast to the provisions of \u00a7 6 (b) and (c), dealing, respectively, with administrative officers (who are stated to be covered only by part of the policy) and with part time teachers (to whom the policy does not apply at all). The record discloses no particular in which the policy was not complied with so far as it may have been applicable at all to a \u201cprobationary\u201d teacher like the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">2. By the letter of June 4, 1951, which is the only breach of contract alleged by the plaintiff, the plaintiff was given an unequivocally terminal appointment of one year, for the next succeeding academic year. Prior to the acceptance of this appointment, the plaintiff had no contract for the succeeding year and was entitled to none. He is bound<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by the terms of the contract which he accepted. The college\u2019s act in making the contract itself cannot constitute a breach of that contract or a separation from an employment for the succeeding year which the plaintiff did not have until the contract was made. It was not a separation from the employment for the then current year (1950-51) for the plaintiff was never separated from that. Even if the plaintiff\u2019s employment be viewed as continuous (cf. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Royal Worcester Corset Co. </em>200 Mass. 1, 4-5; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. </em>205 Mass. 569, 574; Williston, Contracts [3 ed] \u00a7 39; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 684) from the plaintiff\u2019s first appointment, the letter of June 4, 1951, was simply an exercise of the college\u2019s discretion, already stated, existing during the probationary period, offering further employment for one year only on the condition (accepted by the plaintiff and thus modifying his earlier contracts) that it was to be \u201cterminal\u201d and, in effect, to give rise to no rights of tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">7 , <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\"> Section 6 of the policy defines \u201ca member of the faculty\u201d and states that faculty members are divided into three groups: (a) teaching faculty; (b) administration; and (c) part time or special. Of group (a), \u00a7 6 says, \u201cThe total content of the . . . policy applies to such individuals.\u201d Group (b) may \u201center into all discussions, have the right to vote, and hold office\u201d but \u201cthey are not covered by the other features of this policy.\u201d The \u201ccontents of this . . . policy [do not] apply to\u201d group (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> Section 16 of the policy, dealing with \u201ctenure,\u201d reads: \u201cIt is the policy of the college to maintain continuity of service. After three years of service, members of the faculty may assume that they have permanence of tenure, if their work continues to be satisfactory to the trustees of the college. It is understood, of course, that major changes in educational pohcy, in which subjects or departments are discontinued, or a serious financial crisis, requiring drastic budget reconstruction, might modify this general pohcy of continuous service. <em>The first three years are tobe probationary. . . . </em>Members of the staff wih be notified of their reappointment not later than March 15. After three years of service, no formal notice of reappointment need be given\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">The relevant portion of \u00a7 17, dealing with \u201cseparations,\u201d reads: \u201cIf separation is desired by the administration, faculty members who have been notified of their separation shall have the right of appeal either personally or through the elected faculty personnel committee to the president and the trustees\u2019 committee on instruction. Notice of such separation will be given in writing to the faculty member not later than March 1. If an appeal is made, the committee on instruction will state the grounds for separation in writing. These grounds may include any or all of the following: (a) Personal inadequacy; (b) Incompetence in teaching or administration; (c) Moral delinquency; (d) Conduct or teaching inconsistent with the standards and purposes of the college, (e) Contingencies such as are enumerated in article 16. The decision of the instruction committee of the trustees will be final. Faculty members desiring to terminate their service will notify the president of their intentions not later than May 1.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> There is no suggestion of fraud inducing the acceptance of this contract (at a time when the plaintiff had counsel) which would permit disregard of the acceptance. Cf. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Victoria Coach Line, Inc. </em>314 Mass. 262, 267-269, on which the plaintiff relies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
