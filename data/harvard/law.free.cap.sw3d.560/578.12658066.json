Instead, the trial court imposed sentences for a term of years, specifically a 100 year sentence for each offense, to be served consecutively.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-26\">\n      Libertus complains that the effect of imposing consecutive 100 year sentences was to impose consecutive life sentences without the possibility of probation or parole, with life sentence defined as the duration of his natural life, even though that sentence is only authorized by section 566.030.2(3) and 566.060.2(3) where the victim is less than twelve years of age and the offender's conduct is particularly outrageous or vile. Libertus argues that read as a whole, sections 566.030.2 and 566.060.2 authorize progressively more onerous sentences commensurate with progressively more onerous conduct, and that this requires us to construe the phrase \"for a term of years not less than five (or fifteen) years\" to include an unexpressed maximum of thirty years. Otherwise, as Libertus's argues, an offender with an adult victim can receive a sentence for a term of years that is greater in its effect than the maximum sentence that must be imposed where the victim is younger than twelve years of age.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-27\">\n      \"In analyzing a criminal statute, this Court determines the legislature's intent from the language of the statute, and gives effect to that intent.\"\n      <em>\n       State v.

The Court noted that although certain term of years' sentences could equate to a life sentence, that \"is not true with every sentence of a term of years not less than five years.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959670\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/417/#p419\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      In addition, \"[a] life sentence and a sentence of a term of years also have different consequences for parole.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959670\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/417/#p419\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      \"Under section 558.019.4, RSMo 2000, for parole purposes, a life sentence is calculated to be 30 years, while any sentence greater than 75 years is calculated to be 75 years.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959670\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/417/#p419\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      \"Regardless, the plain and ordinary meaning of the statute indicates that the legislature intended to give sentencing courts two options-life imprisonment or an unlimited term of years not less than five years-and this plain meaning is supported by the differences between the two options.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959670\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/417/#p419\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      In short, section 566.030.2 \"unambiguously authorizes a life sentence or a sentence of an unlimited term of years not less than five years.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959670\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/417/#p419\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959670\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/417/#p419\">\n       at 421\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      We are bound by the holding in\n      <em>\n       Hardin\n      </em>\n      which addressed section 566.030.2, and is equally applicable to section 566.060.2. As the Supreme Court noted in\n      <em>\n       Hardin\n      </em>\n      , had \"the legislature intended to authorize a sentence of a limited term of years, it could have done so.\"\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959670\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/417/#p419\">\n       429 S.W.3d at 420\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . In fact, the legislative history of sections 566.030 and 566.060 reveals that in 1993, section 566.030 was amended to change the authorized term of imprisonment for the unclassified offense of forcible rape from \"life imprisonment or a term of years not less than five years\" to \"life imprisonment or a term of years not less than five years\n      <strong>\n       <em>\n        and not greater than thirty years\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n      .\" Section 566.030.2 RSMo Cum. Supp. 1993 (emphasis added). At the same time, the authorized term of imprisonment for sodomy or forcible sodomy remained \"life imprisonment or a term of years not less than five years.\" Section 566.060.2 RSMo Cum. Supp. 1993. In 1994, section 566.030.2 was again amended to delete the phrase \"and not greater than thirty years,\" realigning the authorized sentence for forcible rape with that for forcible sodomy-\"life imprisonment or a term of years not less than five years.\"\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      section 566.030.2 RSMo. 1994 and section 566.060.2 RSMO 1994. \"A statute as amended should be construed on the theory that the lawmaker intended to accomplish something by the amendment.\"\n      <em>\n       Wigand v.

App. St. L. Dist. 1970). In addition, \"[a] statute as amended should be construed on the theory ... that the legislature had in mind the construction placed upon it by the appellate courts of the state prior to the amendment.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10149312\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/454/951/#p956\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      It is thus relevant that in\n      <em>\n       State v. Davis\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008680,10008541\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/867/539/\">\n       867 S.W.2d 539\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 542 (Mo. App. W.D. 1993), this court considered section 566.030.2 RSMo Cum. Supp. 1992, which authorized a term of imprisonment for forcible rape of \"life imprisonment or a term of years not less than five years,\" and rejected the argument that the maximum sentence authorized by the statute was a term of thirty years. In so holding,\n      <em>\n       Davis\n      </em>\n      noted that by an amendment effective August 28, 1993 that was not applicable to Davis's case (referring to section 566.030.2 RSMo Cum. Supp. 1993), the Missouri legislature changed the penalty for forcible rape to \"life imprisonment or a term of years not less than five years and not greater than thirty years.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008680,10008541\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/867/539/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Davis\n      </em>\n      characterized the amendment as intended to address the \"logical discrepancy\" argued by Davis.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008680,10008541\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/867/539/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-34\">\n      We cannot ignore that in 1993, the legislature added a thirty year maximum term of years to section 566.030.2, and that in 1994, following\n      <em>\n       Davis\n      </em>\n      , the legislature removed reference to a maximum term of years that could be imposed. Through the 1993 and 1994 amendments to section 566.030, the legislature demonstrated both that it knows how to authorize a sentence of a limited number of years, and that it knows the effect of removing that limit.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-35\">\n      We conclude, therefore, as our Supreme Court did in\n      <em>\n       Hardin\n      </em>\n      , that a sentencing court is unambiguously authorized by sections 566.030.2 and 566.060.2 to impose sentences for forcible rape or forcible sodomy where the victim is twelve years of age or older that are equivalent to, or greater than, the sentence that must be imposed where a victim is less than twelve years of age. Any perceived inequity is ameliorated by section 558.019.4 which, as\n      <em>\n       Hardin\n      </em>\n      noted, calculates any sentence greater than 75 years as a 75 year sentence for purposes of probation and parole.\n      <footnotemark>\n       5\n      </footnotemark>\n      <em>\n       Hardin\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959670\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/417/#p419\">\n       429 S.W.3d at 420\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
