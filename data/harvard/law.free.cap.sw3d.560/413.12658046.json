In one issue, Matthew contends that the denial was error. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Araceli K. filed for divorce from Matthew in January 2005 (Divorce Proceeding) in the trial court. She originally alleged discord or conflict of personalities but later amended her petition to allege cruel treatment as the sole ground for divorce. Matthew filed a counterpetition, alleging that the marriage was insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities. The law firm of Koons, Fuller, Vanden Eykel &amp; Robertson, P.C. represented Araceli in the Divorce Proceeding. The trial court signed a final decree of divorce in 2007, granting the divorce on the ground of insupportability. Neither Judge Shipman nor her then-law firm represented Araceli in the Divorce Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2005, while the Divorce Proceeding was ongoing, Araceli's parents, brother, and sister sued Matthew and another person for intentional infliction of emotional distress and sought temporary and permanent injunctions (the Family Members Tort Case). They filed this suit in the 362nd District Court of Denton County. In 2006, Araceli became a plaintiff in the suit by amended petition. Araceli and her family members were represented in the case by lawyers Jane Thacker and Sam Burke, members of the law firm Wood, Thacker, and Weatherly. At the time, Judge Shipman was an associate at the firm. At one point in that case, then-attorney Shipman signed a subpoena for a trial witness. After a trial, the jury assessed Araceli's damages at $100. The final judgment in that case was signed on November 6, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2014, seven years after the final decree of divorce, Araceli filed a petition to modify the parent-child relationship and to obtain an accounting of custodial property, beginning the Modification Proceeding. The petition was filed in the 16th District Court of Denton County; Judge Shipman had by then become the presiding judge of that court. Matthew filed a counterpetition and a petition for enforcement of orders of the court (Enforcement Proceeding). Araceli filed an amended petition to modify the parent-child relationship and a motion for enforcement of child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Matthew filed a motion to disqualify or alternatively to recuse Judge Shipman (Motion to Disqualify) from both the Modification Proceeding and the Enforcement Proceeding. He asserted that Judge Shipman must be disqualified under Texas Constitution article V, section 11 and Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b(a)(1) based on her law firm's representation of Araceli in the Family Members Tort Case and her signing of the subpoena request. Judge Shipman declined to recuse herself and forwarded the motion to the presiding administrative judge for resolution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f)(1)(B). On October 12, 2016, the presiding administrative judge denied Matthew's Motion to Disqualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 22, 2017, Judge Shipman signed the final order in the Modification Proceeding. About two weeks later, Araceli filed an amended motion for enforcement of child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Matthew filed a motion to reconsider the Motion to Disqualify, which the presiding administrative judge denied. The presiding administrative judge's order stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   After considering all of the evidence, to include the trial pleadings, I hold that the matters at issue in the\n   <em>\n    [Family] Members Tort Case\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    K[.] Divorce Proceedings\n   </em>\n   are different. Although both actions involve the divorcing spouses and the actions were not legally joined, the claims, defenses, and law were different in each action. The\n   <em>\n    K[.] Divorce Proceeding\n   </em>\n   involved property division and the conservatorship of the children. The\n   <em>\n    [Family] Members Tort Case\n   </em>\n   involved claims of tortious activity which are unusual and involve unique issues of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Matthew now appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In one issue, Matthew argues that the presiding administrative judge erred in denying his Motion to Disqualify. He asserts that \"[t]he question at issue for purposes of disqualification in this case is whether or not the divorce case and the case alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress were to be considered the same matter in controversy. The pleadings and the evidence show that they were the same.\" Matthew challenges only the failure to disqualify Judge Shipman. He does not argue that Judge Shipman had to be recused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     No Attorney May Serve in a Case and Then Preside Over It\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Judges may be removed from particular cases because they are constitutionally disqualified or because they are disqualified or recused under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    In re Union Pac.

By amended petition, she alleged cruelty \"in that [Matthew] ... fraudulently stole[ ] [her] separate property assets ..., made numerous false claims regarding [Araceli] and her family members, ... made disparaging comments regarding [Araceli] to numerous third parties, and ... [did] numerous other acts of a nature that render[ed] further living together insupportable.\" Several months before the final judgment in the Family Members Tort Case, she again amended her divorce petition to more briefly allege that Matthew was \"guilty of cruel treatment toward [her] of a nature that render[ed] further living together insupportable.\" Matthew in his counterpetition asked for a divorce, a division of property, and orders for conservatorship and support of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 24, 2007, the trial court signed a final decree of divorce in the Divorce Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In September 2014, Araceli filed a petition to modify the parent-child relationship and for accounting of custodial property. In her petition, she asked to be awarded the exclusive right to make decisions regarding psychological and psychiatric treatment for the children, for an increase in child support, and for the court to order an accounting of the children's Texas Tomorrow Fund accounts. In his counterpetition, Matthew asked to be appointed as the person who has the right to designate the children's primary residence, for the trial court to order that Araceli's visits with the children be supervised, and for his ongoing child support obligation to be decreased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Judge Shipman rendered temporary orders regarding child support. By amended counterpetition, Matthew sought to have the exclusive right to consent to the children's \"medical, dental, and surgical treatment involving invasive procedures\" and to their psychiatric and psychological treatment. Matthew then filed his petition for enforcement of orders of the court, alleging that, in violation of the court's orders, Araceli made disparaging remarks about him in the presence of others and attempted to take the children out of the country without notifying him of her intent to do so. Araceli filed her own motion for enforcement asserting that Matthew failed to pay child support in accordance with the court's orders. Judge Shipman signed orders on the enforcement motions in October 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Family Members Tort Case.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the Family Members Tort Case, Araceli and her family members sued for damages for Matthew's\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 threatening to call Araceli's father's place of employment to make false accusations against him;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 implying that he would \"see to it that [Araceli's father] spen[t] years in prison\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 threatening Araceli's mother by \"making statements such as 'I'm going to get you\" ' and \"your family is going to drop like flies\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 sending a letter to Araceli's brother and her brother's neighbors falsely asserting that her brother was under investigation by CPS for child molestation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Araceli and her family members further sought a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction enjoining Matthew from causing or threatening to cause bodily injury to any of the family members; threatening the family members; making disparaging remarks about them in the presence of a third party; going near the family members' places of business; or contacting Araceli's father. Araceli's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was based on observing and being aware of Matthew's conduct rather than on any statements made directly to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Matthew filed a counterpetition in which he alleged claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, malicious criminal prosecution, assault by offensive physical contact and by threat of bodily injury, and conspiracy. He alleged that Araceli and her family members had made various threats against him and had falsely accused him of sending a derogatory letter about Araceli's brother. In his conspiracy claim, he alleged that Araceli and her family members had conspired to commit the alleged causes of action in order to make him give Araceli a larger share of the couple's community property in the Divorce Proceeding. A third party, William Haynes, joined Matthew's counterpetition and asserted the same causes of action against Araceli and her family members as Matthew had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Family Members Tort Case and the Divorce Proceeding are not the Same Matter in Controversy for Purposes of Disqualification\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a matter of law, the Family Members Tort Case and the Divorce Proceeding are not the same case or \"matter in controversy.\" Importantly, Matthew does not argue that the matters resolved by the adjudication of Araceli's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim in the Family Members Tort Case have been raised again by the Modification Proceeding or Enforcement Proceeding (and we note that they have not been).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9378436\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/92/446/#p450\">\n    92 S.W.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (current proceeding raised again matters resolved by prior proceeding and was therefore the same matter). Rather, the basis of Matthew's argument that the two proceedings are the same is that Araceli alleged cruelty as a ground for divorce and that the elements of cruelty and intentional infliction of emotional distress are the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accepting that Matthew is correct regarding the similarity of the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress and cruelty as a ground for divorce, the two claims are still not the same \"case\" for the purposes of disqualification of a trial judge. Yes, in the Divorce Proceeding, Araceli asked for a disproportionate share of their estate for, among other reasons, Matthew's fault in the breakup of the marriage. Yes, Matthew alleged in the Family Members Tort Case that the suit was an attempt to get Araceli a larger share of the couple's property. But the two cases were two separate matters in controversy. The Family Members Tort Case involved additional parties and claims unrelated to the divorce and division of Matthew and\n   Araceli's marital estate: it did not seek a division of community property, child support, or orders regarding the custody of the children. The two actions were tried in separate courts before different judges. In the Family Members Tort Case, Araceli's family members, who were not involved in the Divorce Proceeding, sued Matthew and another party, William Haynes, for claims that were not and could not have been adjudicated in the Divorce Proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brauss v.

Haynes asserted cross-claims against Araceli's family members, claims that were not and could not have been adjudicated in the Divorce Proceeding. The Family Members Tort Case involved different liability theories and defenses. Those claims would have involved evidence not relevant in the Divorce Proceeding (or, for that matter, in the Modification or Enforcement Proceedings), and vice versa.

Because, as a matter of law, the Family Members Tort Case and the Divorce Proceeding are not the same matter in controversy, and the Family Members Tort Case and the Modification and Enforcement Proceedings are not the same matter in controversy, unlike in\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   it does not matter whether the Divorce Proceeding is the same matter as the Modification and Enforcement Proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Matthew's Other Arguments In Favor of Disqualification Are Without Merit\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Request for Attorney's Fees was not a Judicial Admission that the Family Members Tort Case and the Divorce Proceeding were the Same Matter\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Matthew points out that in the Divorce Proceeding, Araceli asked to be awarded attorney's fees for the services of her attorney in the Family Members Tort Case. In her third amended divorce petition, Araceli asserted,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   It was further necessary for [Araceli] to secure the services of C.

Araceli counters that although she asked for attorney's fees for services her attorney Jane Thacker provided to defend her against Matthew's actions while the Divorce Proceeding was ongoing, that did not constitute an admission that the Family Members Tort Case was the same case as the Divorce Proceeding. Matthew's attorney acknowledged at the disqualification hearing that Thacker's law firm-Judge Shipman's former law firm-did not appear in the Divorce Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   It is axiomatic that a \" 'judicial admission must be a clear, deliberate, and unequivocal statement,' and 'occurs when an assertion of fact is conclusively established in live pleadings, making the introduction of other pleadings or evidence unnecessary.' \"\n   <em>\n    Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v.

The paragraph asking for attorney's fees for Thacker's services in the third amended divorce petition does not state what services Thacker provided to protect Araceli from Matthew's actions, though a reasonable inference is that the services related to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. However, accepting the inference and reading the paragraph as Araceli asking for her attorney's fees for the Family Members Tort Case to come out of Matthew's share of the marital estate, it does not constitute a judicial admission that the two cases are the same matter. Araceli asserts that the phrase \"actions during this divorce\" is a temporal phrase, referring to the period in which the Divorce Proceeding was ongoing, not an assertion that Thacker served as Araceli's attorney in the Divorce Proceeding. We agree. This paragraph reads as an argument that in dividing the marital estate, the trial court in the Divorce Proceeding should consider Matthew's actions while the Divorce Proceeding was pending. That is, because of actions Matthew took while the Divorce Proceeding was ongoing, Araceli had to defend herself by securing the services of an attorney (whether to assert the intentional infliction of distress claim or perform other unidentified services), and that as part of the division of the estate, Araceli should be awarded an amount to pay for those services. It is not a clear, deliberate, and unequivocal statement that the Family Members Tort Case and the Divorce Proceeding are the same matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Araceli's Joining the Family Members Tort Case Does Not Transform It into the Same Matter as the Divorce Proceeding\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Matthew next argues that Araceli's \"decision to join her family in their case\n   against [him] in the weeks before trial w[as] calculated to give her another opportunity in a different court to obtain additional monetary damages from [him] for the same conduct alleged in the divorce.\" Matthew may be correct, although we can only speculate as to Araceli's motive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, whatever Araceli's purpose was in joining the Family Members Tort Case, it cannot turn two separate cases into one case, and Matthew cites no authority for the proposition that it does.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

First, he describes Araceli's attorney's opening statement in the Family Members Tort Case and argues that according to the attorney's opening statement, the divorce provided the overall context in which the tort case was brought. He contends that \"[t]he character and the same alleged conduct of Matthew K. was at issue in both cases. In other words, any evidence arising out of the [Family Members Tort Case] would be relevant in the divorce case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Matthew does not tell us what evidence, if any, was relevant to or was used in both proceedings. Certainly,\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the evidence used in or arising from the Family Members Tort Case would have been relevant in the Divorce Proceeding, given that the plaintiffs in the Family Members Tort Case complained of Matthew's actions in the time period shortly before and during the Divorce Proceeding, and his actions during that time were also relevant to matters in the Divorce Proceeding. But that does not make the two proceedings the same matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilhite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300421\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/298/754/#p758\">\n    298 S.W.3d at 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Matthew then points to closing arguments in the Family Members Tort Case. Matthew notes that in his closing arguments, attorney Sam Burke, Thacker's co-counsel in that case, mentioned a letter that one of Matthew's witnesses in that case had sent to the judge in the Divorce Proceeding, Judge Shipman's predecessor. Burke stated in his closing argument, \"Mr. Padilla [the witness] writes to Judge Worley in the divorce case for reasons I can't-I can't understand why he'd think he'd need to be in that case.\" Matthew contends that this statement \"highlights a direct connection between the cases\" and shows that \"the cases were intertwined. The letter clearly demonstrates that [the witness] did not distinguish his role as a witness in the divorce case from that in the tort case.\" What the witness's purpose was in writing to the judge in the Divorce Proceeding is a matter on which we have no evidence and will not speculate. It does not affect whether the Family Members Tort Case is the same matter as the Divorce Proceeding for the purposes of disqualification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Juror's Affidavit from the Family Members Tort Case Does Not Convert That Case into the Divorce Proceeding\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In a somewhat misguided contention, Matthew argues that an affidavit from a juror in the Family Members Tort Case, which Matthew attached to his motion\n   for new trial in that case, shows that the Family Members Tort Case and the Divorce Proceeding are the same matter. In the affidavit, the juror stated that the jury took too seriously the Araceli's family members statements that Matthew \"had lost collateral decisions in a divorce matter unrelated to the matter at hand\" and \"confused the issues as being relevant.\" Matthew argues that this juror's affidavit \"clearly shows that actions in the divorce case were the subject of deliberation by the jury in the tort case.\" Matthew does not explain what \"collateral decisions\" the jury considered or what issues the jury confused \"as being relevant\" and neither did the juror's affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As noted above, the actions of Matthew that were the subject of the Family Members Tort Case occurred while the dissolution of the marriage was ongoing. That is, the divorce was the context for Matthew's actions. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the jury heard about the fact of the ongoing Divorce Proceeding. Any juror confusion about the relevance of an unidentified issue from the Divorce Proceeding to the tort claims does not establish that these two separate cases were the same case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Mere Knowledge of Facts in the Divorce Proceeding Does Not Make It and the Family Members Tort Case the Same Matter\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Matthew points out that in the Family Members Tort Case, Araceli's attorney filed a motion for enforcement of a temporary injunction against him and that the basis of the motion was his making derogatory remarks in front of the children. Matthew argues that to prepare the motion, Thacker had to have \"specific knowledge of the divorce and any child visitation provisions, including those which prohibit parties from making disparaging remarks about the other in the presence of the children.\" He points out that in support of the motion for enforcement, Thacker provided the affidavit of Lavonda Tinkle, the same trial witness whose subpoena Judge Shipman signed when she was an associate at the firm. He argues that from Thacker's and Burke's opening and closing statements and Thacker's motion to enforce, \"they were thoroughly knowledgeable with the facts relevant to the divorce.\" And, Matthew argues, \"[a]ny conduct or motives otherwise deemed harmful or injurious in the tort case would be clearly relevant in the divorce case because the pleadings in both cases complain of the same conduct of Matthew.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, we disagree with Matthew's contention that Thacker had to have knowledge of the child visitation provisions in the Divorce Proceeding to prepare the motion to enforce in the Family Members Tort Case because that motion asked the trial court to enforce the injunction issued by\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the pleadings in both cases do not necessarily complain of the same conduct by Matthew. The pleadings in the Family Members Tort Case detail what conduct the family members complain of. On the other hand, the pleadings from the Divorce Proceeding that Matthew relies on are less specific (and were subsequently amended to be even less specific), alleging that he \"made numerous false claims regarding [Araceli] and her family members\" and did \"numerous other acts of a nature that renders further living together insupportable.\" Matthew agreed that the petition was too vague; he filed special exceptions complaining that the paragraph \"broadly states acts or actions of [Matthew] but provides no information as to what acts or actions [Araceli] is complaining about.\" We may infer that that these allegations included at least some of the\n   same acts alleged in the Family Members Tort Case, but it is only that-an inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   More importantly, although Judge Shipman's imputed knowledge of some facts at issue in the Family Members Tort Case that may have also been alleged in the Divorce Proceeding could be relevant in a motion to recuse,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is not grounds for disqualification.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(a) (listing grounds for disqualification),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b) (listing grounds for recusal, including for a judge's personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts in the proceeding).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tesco Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311185\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/550/#p553\">\n    221 S.W.3d at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that under the Texas Constitution and Rule 18b(a), the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   grounds for disqualification are the judge's (1) having an interest in the case; (2) being related to one of the parties; and (3) having served as counsel, or practicing with an attorney who served as counsel, in the same matter in controversy). That Araceli's attorney in the Family Members Tort Case had knowledge of some of the facts relevant to the Divorce Proceeding would be unsurprising, given that the events on which the Family Members Tort Case was based occurred in the months leading up to the filing of the divorce petition and directly after the filing. While that knowledge may be imputed to Judge Shipman by virtue of her working at the same firm,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Med. Enters., Inc. v.
