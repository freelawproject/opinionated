Stewart and T.S. made a $5,000 down payment on a rent-to-own arrangement for the residence at issue. When Stewart failed to return home one\n   night, T.S. told him to leave and \"not to come back.\" Stewart agreed and began sleeping in a camper on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 23, 2015, a few days after Stewart agreed to move out of the residence, T.S. asked Stewart to deliver firewood to the residence. Stewart and T.S.'s uncle moved the firewood into the basement. After delivering the firewood, Stewart went upstairs and knocked on T.S.'s bedroom door. T.S. exited the bedroom with another man. T.S. observed Stewart holding a gun and told him to leave. Stewart responded by firing the gun into the ceiling. T.S. testified she was \"startled\" by the shot and more forcefully told Stewart to leave. Stewart threatened to kill T.S. and her guest. Stewart then left the residence and, as T.S. went to close the door behind him, Stewart fired a shot through a window near the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a jury trial, the circuit court entered a judgment convicting Stewart of third-degree domestic assault, first-degree burglary, armed criminal action, and unlawful use of a weapon. The circuit court overruled Stewart's motion for judgment of acquittal.

The word \"apprehension\" means \"the act or power of perceiving or comprehending\" or \"the result of apprehending mentally: conception.\" Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 97 (1989). Therefore, Stewart's conviction for third-degree domestic assault will be affirmed if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find beyond a reasonable doubt T.S. perceived, comprehended, or conceived immediate physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the record shows Stewart knocked on T.S.'s bedroom door while holding a gun. When she told him to leave, Stewart discharged the gun into the ceiling. T.S. testified she was \"startled\" by the shot and more forcefully told Stewart to leave. T.S. testified, if the bullet had hit her at close range it would \"do some damage.\" Finally, T.S. moved to shut the door behind Stewart, at which time Stewart fired a second shot back into the house. T.S.'s testimony that she was startled by the gunshot, forcefully told Stewart to leave, was aware she could have been injured by the gunfire, and moved to shut the door behind Stewart as he left constitutes sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find T.S. subjectively perceived, comprehended, or conceived immediate physical injury due to Stewart's actions. The circuit court did not err in overruling Stewart's motion for judgment of acquittal on his conviction for third-degree domestic assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The dissent relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    J.D.B. v.

The issue here is whether the fundamentally different facts of this case are sufficient to support Stewart's conviction for third-degree\n   <em>\n    domestic\n   </em>\n   assault. Further,\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   did not follow this Court's basic rule\n   of statutory interpretation for undefined statutory terms by applying the plain, ordinary meaning of the word \"apprehension.\"\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   reasoned there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find the victim was \"placed in fear for her physical well-being, nor is there any other evidence in the record that would warrant such a finding.\"\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554393\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/2/150/\">\n    2 S.W.3d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore,\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   did not apply the plain, ordinary meaning of the word \"apprehension.\" Instead, the court of appeals uncharacteristically referenced Black's Law Dictionary and equated \"apprehension\" with \"fear.\" While a victim's fear may prove apprehension, fear is only one way in which a victim may perceive, comprehend, or conceive immediate physical injury from the defendant's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Burglary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The state charged Stewart with first-degree burglary pursuant to \u00a7 569.160.1(3) for knowingly remaining unlawfully in the residence possessed by T.S. for the purpose of committing a domestic assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In pertinent part, \u00a7 569.010(8) provides \"a person enters unlawfully or remains unlawfully in or upon premises when he is not licensed or privileged to do so.\" Stewart argues there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt he was not licensed or privileged to remain on the premises because he had a property interest in the residence and continued to use the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Stewart's alleged property interest in the residence does not foreclose his burglary conviction. Section 569.160 defines the circumstances in which \"a person\" commits the crime of burglary. Similarly, \u00a7 569.010(8) provides \"a person ... knowingly remains unlawfully when he is not licensed or privileged to do so.\" Both statutes apply, without limitation, to \"a person,\" and neither statute immunizes those with a property interest in the premises from criminal liability for burglary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dispositive issue is whether Stewart was licensed or privileged to remain in the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 569.010 does not define the terms \"licensed\" or \"privileged.\" \"In the absence of a statutory definition, words will be given their plain and ordinary meaning as derived from the dictionary.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Additionally, when the legislature utilizes an undefined statutory term with an established judicial or common law meaning, this Court presumes the legislature acted with knowledge of that meaning.\n   <em>\n    Citizens Elec.

A \"privilege\" is defined generally as \"a right or immunity granted as a peculiar benefit, advantage or favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1805. Consistent\n   with these definitions, the common law provides a \"license is a privilege to enter certain premises for a stated purpose\" and \"may be revoked at the will of licensor.\"\n   <em>\n    Riverside-Quindaro Bend Levee Dist., Platte Cty., Mo. v.

App. 2003). Therefore, Stewart's license or privilege to remain in the residence was based on whether he had permission or a right to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to verdict, the evidence shows T.S. and Stewart agreed he would move out of the residence. Consistent with that agreement, Stewart stayed away from the residence and surrounding property, returning only at night to sleep in the camper. Stewart testified he and T.S. \"were not living together on January 23, 2015.\" Under these circumstances, a reasonable juror could find T.S. was in sole possession of the residence and Stewart relinquished his license or privilege to remain there. Further, a reasonable juror could find Stewart exceeded the scope of any limited license and privilege to remain in the residence when, after delivering firewood to the basement, he went upstairs, twice ignored T.S.'s demands that he leave and, instead, fired a gun and threatened to kill her. Stewart's assertion he was licensed or privileged to remain in the residence because he continued to use the residence fails because it is based on evidence and inferences contrary to the verdict. Consequently, there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could find Stewart committed a burglary by knowingly remaining unlawfully in the residence for the purpose of assaulting T.S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court did not err in overruling Stewart's motion for judgment of acquittal on his conviction for burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Wilson, Russell, Powell and Breckenridge, JJ., concur; Draper, J., dissents in separate opinion filed; Stith, J. concurs in opinion of Draper, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    DISSENTING OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   George W.

Instead, Stewart argues the state failed to offer sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his actions placed T.S. in apprehension of immediate physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The principal opinion attempts to diminish the authority of\n   <em>\n    J.D.B. v.

The principal opinion emphasizes Stewart's case involves domestic assault, not third-degree assault. Yet section 565.070.1(3) employs the same operative language as section 565.0745 regarding \"apprehension of immediate physical injury.\" The only distinction between the two statutes is that third-degree domestic assault requires the victim be a family or household member, while third-degree assault does not. This is a distinction without a difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   , a juvenile was convicted of third-degree assault after purposefully attempting to scare a woman, who was locked in her car, while the juvenile and his friends surrounded her car, waved a plastic machete, and made sexual crude gestures toward her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554393\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/2/150/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554393\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/2/150/\">\n    at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Yet this Court unanimously adopted use of Black's Law Dictionary definitions to construe statutory language as recent as\n   <em>\n    Mantia v. Missouri Department of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387109\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/804/\">\n    529 S.W.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2017), as discussed below. Further, when citing to standard dictionary definitions, this Court typically cites the Webster's Third New International Dictionary from 1993, which defines \"apprehend\" as \"to anticipate esp. with anxiety, dread, or fear\" and \"apprehension\" as \"suspicion or fear....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106. Because the standard dictionary definitions echo the definition\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   adopted from the Black's Law Dictionary, there is no legitimate reason to toss aside this precedent other than the principal opinion cannot reconcile it with the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In this case, T.S. testified after she saw Stewart holding the gun, she told him to get out of the house. After Stewart fired the gun into the ceiling, T.S. testified the gunshot startled her, and if the bullet had hit her at close range it would have done some damage. T.S. then more forcefully told Stewart to get out of the house. When Stewart finally left the house, the prosecutor asked T.S. what was going through her mind at the time. T.S. answered, \"I don't really remember.\" The following exchange then occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [The prosecutor]: I'm asking you were you concerned when you heard that gunshot or the glass break that you could have been hit by that bullet?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   T.S. I don't know. I don't remember what I felt. I guess.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [The prosecutor]: So is your answer you don't remember?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   T.S. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This scant testimony constitutes the entirety of the evidence presented concerning T.S.'s\n   <em>\n    subjective\n   </em>\n   apprehension of immediate physical injury. On cross-examination, T.S. explicitly denied being in fear or afraid of Stewart despite the gunshots and threats because he was \"just blowing steam.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The principal opinion rejects Stewart's argument, finding the jury was free to disregard T.S.'s testimony because the jury is under no obligation to believe any particular evidence. In disregarding T.S.'s uncontradicted testimony she had no subjective apprehension of immediate physical injury, the principal opinion relies on\n   <em>\n    objective\n   </em>\n   circumstantial evidence to support the conviction, such as Stewart discharging the gun twice and making threats to T.S. and her overnight guest as he left the residence. I believe the principal opinion's reliance on this evidence incorrectly applies an objective standard when reviewing the evidence despite recognizing\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   requires evidence of the victim's\n   <em>\n    subjective\n   </em>\n   apprehension of immediate physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   An objective standard is a \"legal standard that is based on conduct and perceptions external to a particular person.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1624 (10th ed. 2014). An objective standard contrasts with a subjective standard, which is defined as a \"legal standard that is peculiar to a particular person and based on the person's individual views and experiences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mantia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387109\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/804/\">\n    529 S.W.3d at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   There is little doubt an objective, reasonable juror may well feel an apprehension of immediate physical injury if placed in T.S.'s position during Stewart's confrontation or under the circumstances of\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   However, the law does not require proof of what an\n   <em>\n    objective\n   </em>\n   person would apprehend under those circumstances. Instead,\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   requires proof of the victim's\n   <em>\n    subjective\n   </em>\n   apprehension, which is to say T.S.'s peculiar,\n   individual views and experiences. At best, as T.S. explicitly stated, she was startled and possibly concerned about Stewart's actions, but denied she was fearful or afraid of Stewart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I am mindful domestic assault victims may be reluctant to testify or express the necessary subjective state of mind to provide sufficient evidence to support a third-degree domestic assault charge. Hence, I do not believe the victim's testimony is the only way to prove his or her subjective apprehension of immediate physical injury. In\n   <em>\n    Schumer v.

App. W.D. 2013), the court of appeals found sufficient evidence to discipline a police officer for committing third-degree assault-despite the victim not testifying at the disciplinary hearing-by relying on a second officer's testimony about the incident.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092521\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/404/443/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092521\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/404/443/#p449\">\n    at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App. W.D. 2008), the court of appeals found sufficient evidence to support a finding the victim was placed in apprehension of immediate physical injury to convict the defendant of third-degree domestic assault despite the victim stating, \"Everything's fine. Not a big deal\" and she was not upset at the time of the incident. In that case, there was testimony from a neighbor who heard part of the dispute, called the police, and witnessed the victim immediately after the incident, observing the victim's face was red and she seemed scared.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208763\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/293/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208763\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/293/#p298\">\n    at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

None of them testified. Further, the police were called to the residence many hours later, at which time they collected forensic evidence concerning the gunshots. The officer who testified at trial provided no evidence whatsoever regarding T.S.'s appearance, state of mind, or any other observation indicating she had a subjective apprehension of immediate physical injury. The only subjective evidence presented regarding T.S.'s subjective apprehension was her own testimony, which flatly denied any fear of Stewart. What remains is minimal objective evidence a reasonable person could find caused an apprehension of immediate physical injury, which is not what the law requires. Based on the paucity of the record, I believe the state presented insufficient evidence from which reasonable jurors could find Stewart committed third-degree domestic assault beyond a reasonable doubt.
