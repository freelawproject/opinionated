He contends that the trial court's ruling violated his privilege against self-incrimination. He argues that his statements should have been suppressed because they were involuntary and made as a result of custodial interrogation before he had been given\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   warnings.

Corporal Hillyard saw a vehicle matching that description travelling northbound and then slowing down and stopping halfway on the shoulder and halfway in the driving lane. He watched the vehicle pull back onto the highway and continue northbound. The patrol car's dash camera video recorded activity\n   inside and outside of the patrol car. Corporal Hillyard pursued the vehicle and activated his lights. The vehicle pulled off onto the shoulder of the road and parked on the white fog line. Corporal Hillyard parked ten to fifteen feet behind the vehicle. When Corporal Hillyard approached the vehicle from the passenger side, he detected the odor of alcohol emanating from the vehicle. Corporal Hillyard asked the driver for his driver's license, but the driver gave Corporal Hillyard a credit card. Corporal Hillyard again requested the driver's license, but the driver was unable to produce one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Corporal Hillyard then asked the driver to turn the vehicle off and come back to his patrol car. After the driver exited his vehicle, Corporal Hillyard observed that the driver stumbled and swayed as he walked to the patrol car. When the driver was in the patrol car, Corporal Hillyard detected the odor of alcohol coming from the driver's person and noticed that the driver's speech was slurred and his eyes were bloodshot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Corporal Hillyard asked the driver to perform a preliminary breath test, but he refused. Because the driver did not have a license on his person, Corporal Hillyard asked the driver his name. The driver gave the trooper a false name. Corporal Hillyard ran a computer check and told the driver that the descriptors and the picture did not match him. When Corporal Hillyard ran the vehicle's license plate, he discovered that the vehicle was registered to Mack. Mack then gave Corporal Hillyard his true identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A back-up patrol car arrived and parked behind Corporal Hillyard's patrol car. Corporal Hillyard asked Mack to recite the alphabet from A to Z without singing it. Mack's speech was slurred, and he missed several letters, saying \"SWVXYZ now I know my ABC's, would you sing them to me? That's how we used to do it as a kid, right?\" Next, Corporal Hillyard asked Mack to count backwards from 64 to 48. Mack counted slowly and used his fingers for every number. He counted correctly but his speech was slurred. Finally, Corporal Hillyard administered horizontal and vertical gaze nystagmus tests. Mack had six of six clues on the horizontal gaze and two of two clues on the vertical gaze, which indicated to the officer that Mack was impaired by either alcohol or drugs. Corporal Hillyard again asked Mack to perform a preliminary breath test, but he refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Corporal Hillyard then asked Mack to step out of the patrol car to perform additional field-sobriety tests. In the presence of the second officer, Corporal Hillyard instructed Mack how to perform the one-leg stand, which Mack was unable to complete successfully. Next, Corporal Hillyard instructed Mack how to perform the walk-and-turn test, which Mack was unable to complete after multiple attempts. Following these tests, Corporal Hillyard placed Mack under arrest for driving while intoxicated and handcuffed him. Corporal Hillyard asked Mack for permission to move Mack's vehicle off the road and onto the grass, and Mack consented. Corporal Hillyard had Mack sit in the front passenger seat of the patrol car. At this point, an exchange occurred between Corporal Hillyard and Mack, the admission of evidence of which Mack challenges on appeal, to-wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   HILLYARD: Is there anything illegal in your car?

But do you give me permission to at least go in there and move it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   MACK: Uh, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   HILLYARD: No, I can't do that? Okay.

You've been honest ... you said you're going to move my vehicle I said move it ok you said just move it ok you can move it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   HILLYARD: Now, I'm just thinking about my different options I have, okay. Because you have been drinking, I can look for alcohol in there. So, I can search your vehicle and look for alcohol okay? If I happen to find something else in an area where alcohol could be found, then that's part of it, okay? So I am going to search your vehicle, just to see if I can find any alcohol in there, because you are telling me you're not drinking and you won't [submit to a preliminary breath test]. So I am going to do that, okay? If I can still move it over, once I'm done with that, that'd be great. If not, I'm going to have to tow it, of course. So after I get done looking for alcohol in there, can I move it over?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   MACK: So you're looking for alcohol?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   HILLYARD: Yes, I am going to search your vehicle, okay? Because if there is alcohol in there, and you're refusing to give me, you know, a breath sample, and I can smell alcohol, this is just me corroborating everything. I am allowed to do that, okay? So, I'm going to go ahead and search it then make sure ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   MACK: Okay, man, look, I've been, I've been drinking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   HILLYARD: Yes. Yes. I know that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   MACK: Okay, I've been drinking.

Alright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   MACK: I've been drinking. Okay, that's what you want to hear? I've been drinking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   HILLYARD: Well, it's alright if I move your vehicle then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   MACK: Yeah. You might find a beer. If you want to search it, you're not going to find [any] drugs or [any] guns. You'll find a beer, you might find a beer in there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   HILLYARD: Okay. Alright, that sounds, that sounds fine. I'll be right back with you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Prior to moving Mack's vehicle, Corporal Hillyard searched the vehicle. He found an open, empty alcohol container in the back seat of the vehicle, but he did not check to see if it was wet or dry and did not seize it as evidence. Corporal Hillyard moved Mack's vehicle further off the side of the road. When Corporal Hillyard returned to his patrol car, he read Mack the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Corporal Hillyard also read Mack the warning required under the implied consent statute, section 577.041. Mack refused to take the breath test. Before Corporal Hillyard transported Mack to the Harrison County Jail, Mack fell asleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The State charged Mack as a prior and persistent offender with one count of driving while intoxicated and one count of driving while his license was suspended or revoked. The prosecutor dismissed the second count prior to trial. Mack moved to\n   suppress his statements to Corporal Hillyard that he had been drinking and there may be a can of beer in his vehicle, arguing that they were made in response to a custodial interrogation prior to being advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. In response, the State argued that Mack's statements were voluntarily made and not in response to a specific question by the arresting officer. The trial court denied Mack's motion to suppress, finding that Mack's statement was voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The dash camera video containing Mack's statements was offered by the State at trial, admitted into evidence over Mack's objection, and played for the jury. The jury found Mack guilty. Mack's motion for new trial included an allegation that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence statements by Mack after he was taken into custody and before he was given a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning. The trial court overruled Mack's new trial motion and sentenced him to four years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mack timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mack argues that the trial court's admission into evidence of his statements to Corporal Hillyard that he had been drinking and there was a beer can in his car violated his privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed under the United States and Missouri Constitutions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST . amend. V ; MO. CONST . art. I, \u00a7 19. Mack contends that his statements were made involuntarily as a result of custodial interrogation before he had been given\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part that \"no person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" Article I, section 19 of the Missouri Constitution provides in pertinent part that \"no person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal cause.\" \"[T]he protection against compelled self-incrimination afforded by the state constitution is coextensive with the right recognized in the federal constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
