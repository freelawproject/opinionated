They went to a Papa John's restaurant located near their hotel to get some food around 2:00 A.M., only to find that the restaurant was closed. While there, they were approached by an unknown man riding a bicycle. The man was later identified as Appellant, Kalief Cummings. The sisters found his presence and interaction with them to be unsettling. So, Sherrie and Melissa continued their walk to find something to eat. Jennifer returned to the hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Approximately ten to fifteen minutes later, Sherrie and Melissa saw Appellant riding his bike across the street in a zig-zag pattern. They crossed the street in order to avoid him. However, Appellant quickly approached the women and stabbed Sherrie and Melissa with a knife before fleeing the scene. They sustained serious stab wounds which required extensive hospitalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Sherrie positively identified Appellant from a police photobook. Sherrie and Melissa identified the person on the Papa John's surveillance camera footage as the person who stabbed them. Based on the Louisville Metro Police Department's investigation, Appellant was arrested, indicted, and tried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A Jefferson County Circuit Court jury convicted Appellant of two counts of first-degree assault and for being a first-degree persistent felony offender. He received a total sentence of thirty-five years' imprisonment. Appellant now appeals his judgment and sentence as a matter of right pursuant to \u00a7 110(2)(b) of the Kentucky Constitution. Two issues are raised and addressed as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Juror Selection\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to excuse Juror #25 and that reversal of his conviction is required. Juror #25 served as a member of the jury, even though that juror was peremptorily struck by Appellant. It appears that no one, including the defense, realized Juror #25 was sitting on the jury during the trial. Because this issue was raised for the first time on appeal, we will review for palpable error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCr 10.26 ;\n   <em>\n    McCleery v.

In fact, defense counsel became aware that another juror, Juror #22, was erroneously empaneled\n   and appropriately brought that issue to the court's attention prior to trial. As a result, the court designated Juror #22 as an alternate and then added another juror. Thus, there is no indication in the record that the defense should not have been similarly aware of the erroneous presence of Juror #25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, Appellant has failed to allege that Juror #25 was biased. Of course, the use of a peremptory strike implies some indication that Juror #25 would not be sympathetic to the defense. However, that is something quite different than what justifies a strike for cause or some other clearly articulable evidence of a juror's bias. In any event, we cannot say that the erroneous inclusion of Juror #25 constitutes palpable error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Improper Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For his next and final argument, Appellant contends that the trial court erred by admitting recorded portions of his police interrogation. Appellant specifically argues that this evidence was improperly admitted under KRE 404(b). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   KRE 404(b) prohibits the introduction of \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" used \"to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" We review this evidentiary issue for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Stansbury v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6884992\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/454/293/#p297\">\n    454 S.W.3d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (Ky. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Prior to trial, Appellant filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude certain portions of his statement to Louisville Metro Police Detective Matt Ditch. The Commonwealth did not object to the motion. Prior to Detective Ditch's trial testimony, the Commonwealth successfully sought to introduce a particular portion of Appellant's police interview where Appellant stated the following to Detective Ditch:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I don't tote no knife on me all day, every day. You know what I'm saying? I just seen other guys wearing them. Hell, I better put something on me too ... I'm gonna keep something on me sometime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Appellant objected to the introduction of this statement as improper under KRE 404(b). The contested statement was not included in Appellant's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine.\n   </em>\n   Unlike the hearsay statements successfully excluded by Appellant in his motion\n   <em>\n    in limine,\n   </em>\n   the statement at issue here was Appellant's own statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We agree with the Commonwealth that this brief portion of Appellant's police interview does not qualify as \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" and, thus, is not covered by KRE 404(b). Carrying a knife is not a crime. And nothing in the statement at issue implies violence or use of a knife for criminal or otherwise wrongful purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This statement was relevant and probative in that it indicated that Appellant, by his own admission, possessed a knife, or at least intended to possess a knife. KRE 401. As previously noted, the weapon used to assault the victims was a knife. Moreover, Appellant's statement to Detective Ditch was certainly not unduly prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRE 403 ;\n   <em>\n    Dixon v.

Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we hereby affirm the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   All sitting.

I must dissent from the majority's discussion of these substantial rights and its cursory examination of whether the violation of this right constitutes palpable error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This Court has wavered in its treatment of peremptory challenges. In 1993, the Court delivered the opinion of\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

In that opinion, the Court analyzed federal peremptory challenges to determine that peremptory challenges are a procedural, rather than substantive, right.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8424646\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/189/99/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8424646\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/189/99/\">\n    at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court cited to Justice James Keller's dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Stopher v.

However, while the majority holds that Appellant here waived the issue, I am unconvinced that the inaction of defense counsel in this case constitutes a full waiver of a substantial right. I am even further unconvinced by this conclusion when examining the record. The voir dire examination at this trial was unusual; for cause challenges were left to the end of the voir dire examination. Additionally, while the clerk referred to jurors by their seven-digit juror number for record purposes, the attorneys referred to jurors by their seat number for challenge purposes. When the final jury was called, the clerk called juror numbers. Yet, throughout the entire voir dire process, the attorneys and judge referred\n   to these potential jurors by their seat number. To compound the problem, when the jurors came back into the courtroom for the final selection, the judge informed them that they did not need to sit in their original seats from the voir dire. Thus, at that point, there was little left for the attorneys to recognize from these jurors during the final call. Given this information, it is even more apparent that defense counsel's inaction was a result of a puzzling process rather than a strategical waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Additionally, objections to preserve error are required in order \"to present to the trial court those questions of law which may becomes issues on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Hatton v.

I understand this Court's past willingness to infer waiver of an error; in many of those circumstances, there is nothing left to be reviewed for the Court. As stated, this Court reviews for\n   <em>\n    error,\n   </em>\n   if there was no opportunity for action, then there is nothing left to review and an error must be presumed as waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   However, the error before us in Appellant's case is distinct. Defense counsel did take the necessary steps to challenge this particular juror peremptorily. There is no allegation that he should have been excused for cause and Appellant was forced to use one of these peremptory challenges; as such, there was no necessity for Appellant to note another juror that would have been struck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court, through the procedure for peremptory challenges, was aware of Appellant's peremptory challenges.

Appellant did raise the issue of error on the other peremptory challenge and we have no evidence in the record why no one realized this juror was also on the jury inadvertently. From these circumstances, I am unwilling to assume that this inaction was a waiver of Appellant's rights. In\n   <em>\n    Branham,\n   </em>\n   the Sixth Circuit determined that because the defendant had taken \"no affirmative steps to voluntarily waive his claim\" that such was a \"forfeiture of that right, and not a waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649829\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/835/#p842\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McQueen v.

But this is not a situation of a \"complete absence of any challenge.\" Defense counsel did note that this juror was to be struck, using one of the peremptory challenges to which Appellant was entitled. Thus, this situation was not a complete failure to note an objection or intent to strike a juror. Such inaction, therefore, should not be construed as an intent to waive the issue.
