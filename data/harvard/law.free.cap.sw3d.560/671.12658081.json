Chapa, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The trial court revoked appellant's bail bond, allowed him to leave the courtroom, and ordered him to report later to the county jail, which he failed to do. Has the appellant committed an offense under section 38.10 of the Texas Penal Code, \"Bail Jumping and Failure to Appear\"? Deciding issues of first impression, we conclude he has; he was \"released\" from custody, and he subsequently failed to \"appear\" in accordance with the terms of his release. But, because the trial court erred by assessing attorney's fees, we modify the judgment to delete the assessment of attorney's fees and affirm the judgment as modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After being involved in a car accident, appellant Troy Allen Timmins was indicted in Bandera County for manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He was arrested and subsequently released from confinement on bail. The State moved to revoke Timmins's bail, alleging he had used drugs in violation of the conditions of his bail bond. The trial court set a hearing on the State's motion. Because Timmins could not drive and, believed he would not be taken into custody, Timmins had his\n   elderly mother drive him from San Antonio to Bandera County for the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the hearing, the trial court revoked Timmins's bond, but allowed Timmins to accompany his mother on her return to San Antonio. The trial court ordered Timmins to report to the Bandera County jail by 3:00 p.m. later that same day. Timmins accompanied his mother to San Antonio, but did not subsequently report to the Bandera County jail as ordered. Timmins was thereafter indicted, convicted by a jury, and sentenced for failing to appear under Texas Penal Code section 38.10. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 38.10 (West 2016). Although the trial court found Timmins was indigent, the trial court assessed attorney's fees. Timmins filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    PENAL CODE SECTION 38.10, \"BAIL JUMPING AND FAILURE TO APPEAR\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Section 38.10 of the Texas Penal Code generally provides that \"[a] person lawfully released from custody, with or without bail, on condition that he subsequently appear commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly fails to appear in accordance with the terms of his release.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 38.10(a). In two legal sufficiency issues, Timmins argues his failure to report to the county jail was not an offense under section 38.10 because he was never \"released\" from custody and he did not fail to \"appear,\" which he contends is a technical term meaning one's physical presence in court for a judicial proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Parties' Arguments and Authorities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Timmins's challenges to the legal sufficiency of the evidence raise issues of first impression. They require us to construe\n   the terms \"release\" and \"appear,\" as they are used in section 38.10. Timmins relies on\n   <em>\n    In re B.P.C.\n   </em>\n   , a case in which a juvenile challenged his adjudication for having engaged in the delinquent conduct of \"escape\" under section 38.06 of the Texas Penal Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 03-03-00057-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201171670\">\n    2004 WL 1171670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App.-Austin May 27, 2004, no. pet.) (mem. op.). In\n   <em>\n    In re B.P.C.\n   </em>\n   , the juvenile's disposition required him to report to a detention facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The trial court released the juvenile to retrieve some of his belongings and ordered him to report back to the detention facility, but the juvenile absconded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    In re B.P.C.\n   </em>\n   opined that prosecution under section 38.10 would have been a \"strange fit\" because the juvenile \"was not released and ordered to appear at a later proceeding as envisioned by the failure to appear/bail jumping statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court cited to cases and definitions suggesting \"appear\" means being physically present in court for a judicial proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Because the\n   <em>\n    In re B.P.C.\n   </em>\n   court addressed a charge of \"escape\" under section 38.06, we consider the court's remarks about section 38.10 to be dicta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Timmins likewise cites to dictionary definitions suggesting \"appear\" means being physically present in court for a judicial proceeding, and he cites to cases in which appellate courts have affirmed defendants' convictions for failing to appear when the defendants were not physically present in court for a judicial proceeding. The cases cited by Timmins support only the proposition that a failure to appear under section 38.10 includes failing to be physically present in court for a judicial proceeding; not that section 38.10 excludes failing to report to jail under the circumstances similar to those in this case. Conversely, the State has cited no case involving a defendant's conviction under section 38.10 when the defendant failed to report to jail under circumstances similar to those in this case. In the absence of any authority on point, we address the issues of first impression by applying the general guiding rules and principles of construing statutes and reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D. \"Release\" from Custody\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Timmins argues he was never \"released\" from custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Release\" is not statutorily defined for purposes of section 38.10, but its plain meaning in this context is \"[t]he action of freeing or the fact of being freed from restraint or confinement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1316 (8th ed. 2004). \"Custody\" includes being \"under restraint by a public servant pursuant to an order of a court of this state.\" TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 38.01(1)(A) (West 2016). The statutory definition of \"custody\" includes the word \"restraint,\" as does the dictionary definition of \"release.\" Although \"restraint\" is not statutorily defined, its plain meaning in this context is \"[c]onfinement, abridgement, or limitation,\" or \"[p]rohibition of action; holding back.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1340. Thus, a person may be \"released\" from custody under section 38.10 when the person is freed from a prohibition or limitation on one's action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The evidence at trial showed the conditions of Timmins's bail required him to be physically present for all hearings in the underlying case. Consequently, during the hearing on the State's motion to revoke, Timmins's physical presence in the courtroom was required and he was prohibited\n   from leaving the courtroom. When the trial court revoked Timmins's bail, Timmins remained under a prohibition against leaving the courtroom. It was only when the trial court allowed Timmins to accompany his mother on her return to San Antonio that Timmins was freed from the prohibition against leaving the courtroom and freed from the limitation of being physically present in the courtroom. Giving \"release\" in section 38.10 its plain meaning, we hold that under these circumstances, a jury rationally could have found Timmins was \"released\" from custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 38.01(1)(a), 38.10(a). We therefore overrule Timmins's challenge to the \"release\" element of the offense, and turn to addressing whether Timmins's failure to report to the county jail as ordered was a failure to \"appear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Failure to \"Appear\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Timmins argues his failure to report to the county jail was not a failure to \"appear\" because being physically present at a county jail is not an \"appearance\" under section 38.10. Timmins contends the term \"appear\" in section 38.10 has acquired a technical meaning of being physically present in court for a judicial proceeding. He further contends a failure to report to jail under the circumstances presented in this case is an \"escape\" under section 38.06, not a \"failure to appear.\" The State counters that \"appear\" should be construed as \"showing up\" anywhere required by the terms of a defendant's release from custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    1. \"Failure to Appear\" vs. \"Escape\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Whether Timmins's conduct constituted an \"escape\" under section 38.06 is immaterial to whether Timmins's conduct constituted a \"failure to appear\" under section 38.10. A defendant's singular act or course of action may constitute multiple offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vick v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11615233\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/991/830/#p833\">\n    991 S.W.2d 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 833 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). If a prosecutor has probable cause to believe the defendant committed an offense defined by statute, the prosecutor's decision of what charges, if any, to file generally rests entirely within the prosecutor's discretion.\n   <em>\n    Neal v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9186437\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/150/169/#p173\">\n    150 S.W.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (Tex. Crim.

Timmins does not contend, and we do not conclude, that the State's construction would render any part of section 38.06 meaningless. We therefore need to consider only whether Timmins's failure to report to the county jail was a failure to \"appear,\" as that term is used in section 38.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    2.

But section 38.10 's various provisions make it apparent that section 38.10 's principal purpose is to ensure the defendant is physically present for trial on a pending criminal charge. A criminal case generally cannot proceed to trial unless the defendant is physically present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 33.03 (West 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

Texas law generally provides two methods of ensuring the defendant is physically present for trial: (1) confining the defendant until trial; or (2) if the defendant is released from confinement before trial, ordering the defendant to be physically present for trial.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. arts. 17.01 - 17.49. The Texas Legislature has provided for bail forfeiture, which incentivizes the defendant to be physically present for trial on a pending criminal charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. arts. 22.01 - 22.18 (West 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   By providing an offense for not being physically present at trial on a pending\n   criminal charge, section 38.10(a) further helps to ensure the underlying criminal case may proceed to trial and to an adjudication of the charged offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 38.10(a). Conversely, subsection (b) provides defenses to prosecution when there are no criminal charges pending: when adjudication of the charges have been deferred (pre-trial community supervision), and when the charges have been adjudicated (post-conviction community supervision, parole, and intermittent sentences).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054264\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/337/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 38.10(b). The apparent purpose is also reflected by subsections (d) through (f), the offense classification provisions, which refer to the \"offense for which the actor's appearance was required.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054264\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/337/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 38.10(d) - (f). Thus, section 38.10 's apparent purpose is to ensure the defendant will be physically present at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   When, as here, the defendant is released from confinement before trial on bail, and the trial court revokes the bail, the only options are to confine the defendant until trial or to conduct another bond hearing. However, circumstances, such as those in this case or those in\n   <em>\n    In re B.P.C.\n   </em>\n   , may arise when a trial court may exercise its discretion to grant the defendant some clemency before having the defendant confined again.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201171670\">\n    2004 WL 1171670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. In such circumstances, the purpose of the trial court ordering the defendant to report to jail comports with the purpose of section 38.10 : ensuring the defendant is accounted for so that the criminal case may proceed to trial on the pending criminal charge. Construing \"appear\" as including the facts of the present case would therefore be consistent with section 38.10 's apparent purpose, whereas Timmins's narrow construction would seem to undermine section 38.10 's apparent purpose.

It would make little sense that, to further the purpose of section 38.10, a trial court would have to set a hearing; condition the defendant's release on returning to the courtroom for that hearing; open the case; order the defendant to be arrested by the sheriff's deputies; and then have the sheriff or sheriff's deputies transport the defendant to jail. When the defendant can report directly to jail, \"[i]t would make little sense to require [the defendant] to appear in the courtroom personally before the judge simply to be transported to the jail.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Application of the Law to the Evidence Admitted at Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The evidence admitted at Timmins's trial shows Timmins had criminal charges pending, Timmins was released on bail, and the trial court revoked Timmins's bail. The evidence further shows the trial court released Timmins from the courtroom and imposed a condition on Timmins's release. The terms of Timmins's release required him to report to and be physically present at the county jail by 3:00 p.m. later that day to await trial. The evidence also shows Timmins failed to report to and be physically present at the county jail as required by the terms of his release. We therefore hold there is legally sufficient evidence that Timmins failed to appear in accordance with the terms of his release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

In its brief, the State agrees, acknowledging Timmins is entitled to have the judgment reformed because the presumption of indigence was never rebutted. The record shows the trial court determined Timmins was indigent, and did not make a finding that Timmins was able to repay any amount of the costs of court-appointed legal counsel. In such circumstances, the proper remedy is to delete the assessment of attorney's fees from the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cates v.

Nevertheless, considering the text and purpose of section 38.10, chapter 38 as a whole, other statutes on similar subjects, and the consequences of Timmins's constructions, we conclude the facts of this case fit within the fair, objective meaning of section 38.10.
