The appeal raises the recurring issue of whether claims asserted in a worker's employment discrimination lawsuit were first raised in an administrative charge of discrimination. That question is important, because under our statutory framework, a trial court can only hear claims timely pursued in the administrative review process, or those factually related claims that can reasonably be expected to grow out of it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, we conclude that the employee's sexual harassment and retaliation claims were not raised in the administrative process, and we render judgment dismissing the case for want of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   SCS, which operates \"7-11\" convenience stores, hired Norma Mora in 2002 and promoted her to a managerial position in 2007. She was supervised by Daniel Silva. In October 2011, she requested to self-demote back to a store clerk position. The how and why of that request lies at the heart this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Administrative Discrimination Charge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 22, 2011, Mora filed a charge of discrimination with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC). Specifically, her charge alleged the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   I. On or about October 30, 2011, I told my supervisor, Danny Silva, male, that starting February 2012 I was going to be stepping down from manager to clerk. Immediately after I told Mr. Silva about my intentions to step down, he began harassing and intimidating me about everything. From about December 03, 2011 to now, Mr. Silva has given me three written warnings without a legitimate reason. Mr. Silva's intentions are to get me discharged because of my sex, female.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   II. No legitimate reasons are given.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   III. I believe I have been discriminated against because of my sex, female, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Part of Mora's EEOC investigation file includes \"Charge Detail Inquiry Intake Notes\" that read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Mora] stated that about October 30, 2011, she told her supervisor, Danny Silva, male, that starting February 2012 she was going to be stepping down from manager to clerk. [Mora] claims that she told him that she was going to begin her own business therefore would be leaving the store at one point. [Mora] claims that she wanted to step down to clerk because of her future plans of opening her own business. [Mora] then claims that immediately after she told Mr. Silva about her intentions to step down and her own business, he began harassing and intimidating her about everything. [Mora] claims that he would yell at her in front of customers. I asked her what would he say and she just said about store issues but nothing really discriminatory. [Mora] then stated that from about December 03, 2011 to present Mr.\n   Silva has given her three written warnings, one for tardiness, whom she claims is true; two for not reporting gasoline, [Mora] could not explain that to me and three because the food in the fridge was bad. [Mora] claims that she was not in charge of the store on that day the food went bad and that her assistant was in charge. I asked [Mora] if that assistant was her subordinate and she said yes. I then asked if Mr. Silva is like that with everyone as to the harassment and intimidation and she said yes. I then explained to her about our statutes and asked her in what way did she feel discriminated against. [Mora] the[n] stated that Mr. Silva's intentions are to get her discharged because of her sex, female. I asked [Mora] if there was a tangible action and she said no. I then asked her if she reported the harassment to anyone else including HR and she said no. I explained to [Mora] that there was insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case; however she had the right to file a charge of discrimination. [Mora] decided to proceed with the charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 11, 2012, the EEOC issued its dismissal and notice of right to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SCS Fires Mora\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 27, 2012, SCS terminated Mora's employment. SCS based the termination on Mora cashing money orders for a store deposit. Mora, however, claims that she was following Silva's orders and he directed her to cash the money orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mora Files this Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 6, 2013, Mora filed suit against SCS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both her original and first amended petitions allege claims of sexual harassment by Silva dating back to 2009. Specifically, Mora alleged that Silva made sexual advances toward her and later frequently insulted her for not yielding to such advances, calling her \"useless\" and telling her that she \"was not pretty anymore\" whenever she refused his sexual overtures. Mora also alleged that she tried to transfer to a different store but was told she needed to demote herself to be eligible for a transfer. When she informed Silva that she was stepping down as a manager to resume a position as a clerk, Silva allegedly retaliated against her for expressing an intent to transfer to another store, and for not yielding to his sexual advances. Specifically, he reprimanded her on at least three separate occasions between December 11 and 22, 2011. The lawsuit also alleges that Mora \"was terminated because she refused to capitulate to Supervisor Silva's sexual advances, and in retaliation for protected activity under the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Proceedings Below\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   SCS answered the lawsuit and filed a plea to the jurisdiction contending that it was not until the filing of her lawsuit that Mora made any claim of unwelcome sexual harassment and retaliation. As a result, SCS argued that because Mora failed to include her claims of sexual harassment and retaliation in her charge of discrimination, she did not exhaust her administrative remedies thereby preventing the trial court from exercising its jurisdiction over the claims. The trial court denied SCS's plea to the jurisdiction but later granted its motion for permissive appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.014(d) (West Supp. 2017)(trial court in a civil action may permit an appeal from an otherwise unappealable interlocutory order if it \"involves\n   a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion\" and \"an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, SCS contends that the trial court erred in denying its plea to the jurisdiction because Mora failed to exhaust her administrative remedies when she failed to include both her sexual harassment and retaliation claims in her original charge. While SCS presents these arguments in a sole issue, we will address the sexual harassment and retaliation claims separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea by which a party challenges the court's authority to determine the subject matter of a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Bland Independent School Dist. v.

After evaluating the charge, the factual allegations contained therein, and the charge detail inquiry notes, we cannot conclude that the Charge contains an adequate factual basis to put SCS on notice of the existence and nature of Mora's sexual harassment hostile work environment claim as alleged in her petition. The charge did not contain any reference to discriminatory treatment based on a sexual harassment hostile work environment claim. Although it mentioned the word \"harassment\" generally, it contained no suggestion that the harassment was based on the sexual advances Silva made toward her and the insults she received as a result of not yielding to his alleged advances, some of which, according to Mora, date all the way to 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201839399\">\n    2012 WL 1839399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (charge that stated only a claim for retaliation and contained no factual allegations of discrimination or hostile work environment based on gender could not support suit based on the later theories);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris-Childs v.

Here for instance, Mora claims that if she was asked why she self-demoted, then she would have disclosed the alleged history of sexual harassment by her supervisor. While that standard is akin to what should \"grow out\" of the agency investigation, we also must consider whether the claims are factually related, and here they are not. One claim was a sexual discrimination claim that began in November 2011 and included three warnings from her supervisor. The claim she now wants to pursue involves requests for sex that go back to 2009. Moreover, in this case we need not speculate about the questions that the EEOC asked and the answers given because the investigator's notes are included in the record. Mora and the EEOC investigator did discuss why Mora self-demoted: the claim notes recite \"[Mora] claims that she wanted to step down because of her future plans of opening her own business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the same notes, Mora described Silva as \"harassing and intimidating [her] about everything.\" However, when the EEOC specifically inquired into what Silva would say to Mora on these occasions, she replied, that it had to do with store issues \"but nothing really discriminatory.\" The three warnings discussed in her charge, which she alleged were given to her for no legitimate reason, were all accounted for\n   and discussed in the charge detail inquiry notes. For example, Mora explained that the first written warning she received was for tardiness, which she admitted was true. Her second written warning concerned the failure to report gasoline, and Mora declined to elaborate on this warning. And finally, Mora discussed how Silva gave her a third written warning because food had spoiled in the store refrigerators. Mora claimed that she was not the employee in charge of the store on the day the food spoiled, but rather, it was her assistant who was in charge. But when asked if that assistant was Mora's subordinate, she replied, yes. When questioned about her statement, \"Mr. Silva's intentions are to get me discharged because of my sex, female,\" Mora was unable to give any tangible action or example. If some of Silva's alleged conduct occurred as early as 2009 and continued until the date Mora filed her 2011 charge, then that conduct would have been included in her 2011 charge. We thus conclude that Mora's claims in her petition could not reasonably be expected to grow out of the EEOC's investigation of the claims and factual allegations stated in her charge. Issue One as it relates to the sexual harassment claim is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Retaliation Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In her petition, Mora also claimed SCS terminated her employment in retaliation for: (1) for not yielding to Silva's sexual advances; and (2) because she filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Again, SCS argues that Mora failed to exhaust her administrative remedies because her charge states only a bare-bones claim for sex discrimination and contains no claims or factual allegations based on retaliation. Of course, at the time Mora filed her original charge, she had not yet been terminated. And there's the rub.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Retaliation is a distinct theory of liability that is not encompassed by other theories of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Poindexter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7328042\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/306/798/#p807\">\n    306 S.W.3d at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Retaliation is a different legal theory from race-based discrimination.\");\n   <em>\n    Davis v.
