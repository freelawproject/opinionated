The jury assessed punishment at sixty-five years' confinement in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and a $10,000.00 fine. Torres raises several issues on appeal concerning three main areas: (1) because the State's key witnesses, David Zuniga and Juan Torres, were both accomplices, the trial court erred in failing to provide an instruction on the accomplice-witness rule requiring the State to provide non-accomplice testimony connecting Torres\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the offense; (2) the trial court's jury charge erroneously included an unindicted felony-murder charge; and (3) the cumulative impact of the errors was so great that reversal is required. We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 20, 2015, Torres, Juan, and David, all brothers, were living at 514 Porter, San Antonio, Texas. By all accounts, Juan was subleasing and was responsible for the rent. At some point during the evening, David and Torres decided they needed to make some \"fast money\" to help Juan with the rent. When Juan and Torres refused to allow David to sell his laptop, David decided to rob someone. Torres insisted that he would not allow David to \"go by himself.\" David testified the conversation was between himself and Torres; Juan was not present or a part of the conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Around 9:30 p.m., Torres and David left through the back of the house with Juan's .32 caliber firearm. Juan testified he saw his brothers leave out the back of the house. Juan went to the front of the house, through the screen door, to smoke a cigarette. He was talking on his cellphone and looking at Facebook when he saw his brothers across the parking lot. Juan testified he saw David standing at the bus stop when Torres came from behind and shot the person standing next to David. Both brothers ran. Although officers were called to the scene and evidence was collected, the case remained unsolved until Juan called the officers approximately two months later to report what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 17, 2016, a Bexar County jury returned an indictment against Torres for the murder of Jesse Richards. David was convicted of Richards's murder in January of 2017. Torres's case was called for trial on May 8, 2017. After two days of testimony, the jury returned a guilty verdict and subsequently assessed punishment at sixty-five years' confinement in the Institutional\n   Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and a $10,000.00 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We turn first to Torres's issues related to the accomplice-witness testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ACCOMPLICE-WITNESS TESTIMONY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because Torres's complaints about the lack of instruction and the insufficiency issue both revolve on whether David and Juan were accomplices, we begin with a determination of whether either witness is an accomplice as a matter of law or fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

David\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   David Zuniga, eighteen-years-old at the time of trial and the younger brother of both Torres and Juan, testified at Torres's trial. David was found guilty of Richards's murder in January of 2017, but he had not yet been sentenced at the time of Torres's trial. David averred his testimony was being given voluntarily and the State had not made any promises or provided any benefit or plea bargain in exchange for his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   David testified that he was at the house with Juan and Torres on December 20, 2015. He and Torres decided they needed to \"get money real quick,\" and David brought up the idea of a robbery because neither Juan nor Torres would agree to let him sell his laptop. Torres told David he would not allow David to go by himself. They left \"out the back of the house;\" David gave Torres the gun as they crossed the street outside the house. David waited for someone to walk up to the bus stop and David started talking to him. David explained, \"I was supposed to talk to the dude and [Torres] was just going to scare him.\" David started talking to the man, when he saw \"an individual come around the corner messed up and stand right behind me and shoot.\" David testified that at first he did not know who the shooter was, but then realized it was Torres. At one point, David thought Torres was going to kill him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   David's testimony supports that he participated before, during, and after the offense-he planned an armed robbery, he provided the weapon, he hid the weapon\n   immediately after the shooting, and helped keep the weapon hidden after the fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cocke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8467052\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/201/744/#p747\">\n    201 S.W.3d at 747-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, based on Torres's severance motion, dated September 22, 2016, David was charged with Jesse Rodriguez's murder as a co-defendant.

Juan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Juan Torres, twenty-years-old at the time of trial, was the middle brother between David and Torres. He was at the house on Porter with his brothers on the night of December 20, 2015. Juan testified that he was getting ready for bed when his brothers left through the back of the house. They had been playing around with Juan's gun; and, after they left, Juan could not find the gun. Juan testified that, shortly after his brothers left, he stepped outside the front screen door to smoke a cigarette. Juan was talking on his cellphone when he saw David and Torres at the restaurant across the street and \"then they went to the bus stop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Juan testified that he watched David walk around the corner to the bus stop. Juan could see David just standing at the bus stop. The prosecutor asked Juan at what point he saw Torres again.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [Torres] ran into the bus stop toward where David was.... When [Torres] came up, I just saw him go in his pocket, pull something out and just shoot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Juan described being in shock. He saw his brothers run back to the house. Juan asked Torres why he did that, and Torres told Juan \"You didn't see nothing. There wasn't nothing there. Just leave it alone, don't say nothing.\" Juan testified that he took Torres's statement as a threat because after watching Torres shoot the man at the bus stop, he did not know what else Torres was capable of doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The only testimony connecting Juan to the offense was David's statement that he and Torres decided to commit the robbery because Juan needed money for rent and Juan's testimony that he was the owner of the firearm that killed Richards. Unlike David, we cannot conclude that Juan participated before, during, or after the offense.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cocke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8467052\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/201/744/#p747\">\n    201 S.W.3d at 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
