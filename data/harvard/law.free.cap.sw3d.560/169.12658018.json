The indictments, which alleged the same conduct on three separate dates, were later amended to charge him with accepting employment as a security officer to carry a firearm without a security officer commission. The question in this case is whether the original indictments tolled the running of limitations for the amended indictments. We conclude that they did not and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 20, 2012, Appellant was indicted in three cases (for three different dates) for \"act[ing] as a guard company, by providing security services\" without a proper business license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 13, 2014, over Appellant's objection, the State amended the indictments to allege that Appellant \"accept[ed] employment as a security officer to carry a firearm\" without a security officer commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both offenses are Class A misdemeanors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   with a statute of limitations of two years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant was convicted and placed on probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred to allow the State to amend the indictments. He argued that each of the amended indictments charged a different offense than that alleged in each of the corresponding original indictments, so the State was required to obtain new indictments. He also argued that he was harmed by the amendments because, by the time the State moved to amend the indictments, the statute of limitations had run for the new offenses. The State responded that each original and amended indictment alleged the same statutory offense and also targeted the same conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court of appeals first found that each of the amended indictments fundamentally changed the nature of the allegations and did not allege the same statutory offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having determined that the trial court erred in allowing the indictments to be amended, the court conducted a harm analysis for non-constitutional error. The State argued that the error was rendered harmless because, rather than amending the indictments, the State could have simply obtained new indictments, with the original indictments tolling limitations. But the court of appeals found that the original and amended indictments did not allege \"the same conduct, the same act, or the same transaction,\" so the original indictments did not toll limitations for the amended indictments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Noting that the record would not support convictions for the offenses alleged in the original indictments, the court held that Appellant was harmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On discretionary review, the State takes issue with the court of appeals's tolling analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. State\n   </em>\n   , we held that a prior indictment tolls the statute of limitations for a subsequent indictment \"when both indictments allege the same conduct, same act, or same transaction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The original and amended indictments do not appear to comply with this requirement. The original indictments alleged that Appellant provided security services as an unlicensed guard company, i.e., operated an unlicensed\n   business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended indictments alleged that he accepted employment to carry a firearm without being personally commissioned to be a security officer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the amended indictments, Appellant did not even need to actually provide security services-the act alleged in the original indictments. And to provide security services under the original indictments, Appellant need not have carried a firearm or entered into any agreement to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   There are some common requirements for obtaining a security services license and a security officer commission,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   but a security officer commission, which allows the carrying of a firearm, involves some extra requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Suppose a defendant\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have a license to be in the guard company business and was facing one of these original indictments accusing him of not having such a license. What would make him think that the State was accusing him of (or that he needed to defend against) the allegation that he carried or agreed to carry a firearm without having been personally commissioned to do so?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It might be that a \"guard company\" indictment could contain enough specific facts to make it clear that the indictment was in fact alleging the same act, conduct, or transaction as a later indictment for agreeing to carry a firearm without a security officer commission. But the indictments in the cases before us do not contain much in the way of facts-they largely track the respective statutes on which they are based. And although the original and amended indictments in each case allege the same date, the indictments use \"on or about\" language-so that it is not at all clear that the same transaction, much less the same act or conduct, is being alleged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We agree with the court of appeals that the offenses alleged in the original indictments did not toll limitations for the offenses alleged in the amended indictments. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <opinion id=\"p-18\">\n   Keasler, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which Hervey and Newell, JJ., joined.\n  </opinion>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.

Crim. App. 1997) (\"It is well settled that the \"on or about\" language of an indictment allows the State to prove a date other than the one alleged in the indictment as long as the date is anterior to the presentment of the indictment and within the statutory limitation period.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <author id=\"p-19\">\n    Yeary, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      DISSENTING OPINION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Keasler, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Hervey and Newell, JJ., joined.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Under Article 12.05(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\"[t]he time during the pendency of an indictment ... shall not be computed in the period of limitation.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    This means that, so long as \"an indictment\" is pending against the defendant, the relevant limitation period is put on pause. We have rejected the idea that \"\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    indictment for\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    unrelated offense\" will allow the State to take advantage of this provision.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Otherwise, \"a person could be continually indicted for any offense that the State felt inclined to charge,\" and the State could thereby perpetually\n    skirt the statute of limitations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    So the question is: What kinds of indictments will give rise to tolling under Article 12.05(b) ?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Hernandez v. State\n    </em>\n    , the defendant was initially charged with possession of amphetamine.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    More than three years later, the State filed another indictment alleging possession of methamphetamine. This was a different statutory offense from the one originally alleged, but we held that, pursuant to Article 12.05(b), the three-year limitation period for the subsequent indictment had been tolled by the pendency of the first. Acknowledging that the legislative history weighed \"in favor of reading Article 12.05(b) broadly,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    we began by laying out the two interpretive extremes in order to find a possible middle ground. First, for the reasons explained above, we declined to interpret the phrase \"an indictment\" to mean \"any indictment for any unrelated offense.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    But we also declined to interpret that phrase to require both indictments to allege the same offense, for we noted that this requirement was present elsewhere in the Code and conspicuously absent from Article 12.05(b).\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Somewhere between these two extremes, we ultimately decided that, under Article 12.05(b), a prior indictment tolls the limitation period for a subsequent indictment \"when both indictments allege the same conduct, same act, or same transaction.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    We did not, in\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    , undertake to provide precise definitions of the terms \"conduct,\" \"act,\" or \"transaction.\" But the kinds of considerations the Court relied upon in adopting this test shed some light. Specifically, we sought to ensure that a defendant subjected to a second indictment would still receive \"adequate notice so that he may prepare a defense.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    This concern may be satisfied, we said, \"if the prior indictment gives adequate notice of the substance of the subsequent indictment.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    For, \"[i]f the defendant has adequate notice of a charge, he can preserve those facts that are essential to his defense.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    We also quoted approvingly of a federal district court opinion that emphasized \"the factual basis of an indictment\" over the \"specific charge alleged\" in determining whether a second indictment is proper under the federal analogue to Article 12.05(b).\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Applying the\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    test to the facts of this case, I disagree that the two sets of indictments alleged impermissibly divergent conduct. Both sets of indictments targeted the same three incidents, on the same three dates, arising from the same set of facts, made criminal within the same Private Security Act.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    \"[R]eading Article 12.05(b) to allow the tolling of the statute of limitations for an indictment charging a similar offense does not undermine the purpose of the statute of limitations.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    Though not identical, the offenses in this case are undeniably similar, and that is all that\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    requires. I do not contest that the two theories of guilt contained within these indictments would have required different proof. But this will almost always be true when different statutory violations are alleged.\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    makes it abundantly clear that whether two offenses are elementally different is not the proper test for tolling under Article 12.05(b).\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    So, instead of restricting our analysis to the particular wording of the indictments, we ought to look at their underlying factual basis\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    -Marks's providing private-security services without the proper license.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    With these facts in mind, it seems highly unlikely that Marks, charged with one violation of the Private Security Act, would have sought and preserved any different defensive evidence had he known that the State would ultimately prosecute him for an alternate Private-Security-Act violation bearing a strong resemblance to the first. After all, Marks's primary defensive theories were that (1) the Private-Security-Act licensing requirements did not apply to him because, at the time he engaged in private-security services, he was a full-time peace officer; and (2) even if he had not met the requirements of being a full-time peace officer, he believed in good faith that he had. The first of these defensive theories, if credited, would have acquitted him of both the initial, guard-company allegation and the subsequent, armed-security allegation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    And the second defensive theory likely would not have helped him with respect to either alleged offense, since the Private Security Act's penalizing statute does not prescribe a culpable mental state with respect to either of these discrete licensing requirements.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    It follows that any harm resulting from the State's untimely amendment should not be attributed to the switch from a guard-company allegation to an armed-security allegation, because this switch had no absolutely effect on either of Marks's defensive theories. This is a strong indication that Marks would have understood both indictments to reach the same core conduct or act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Even if I am wrong about that, I would conclude that the indictments at the very least alleged the same transaction, as each corresponding indictment alleged the same date. It is true that both indictments contain \"on or about\" language, potentially broadening the time period in which the State might prove an offense at trial. But this was also true in\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    did not describe \"on or about\" language as preventing a finding that two indictments reach the same transaction.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    Furthermore, even assuming that the phrase \"on or about\" casts doubt over whether two same-date-alleging indictments refer to the same transaction, there were two sets of three indictments in this case, and all three corresponding indictments match up day-for-day. This makes it exceedingly unlikely that Marks was initially preparing to defend against allegations pertaining to one span of time, and\n    then was surprised to learn that he would have to defend against allegations pertaining to another. With three day-for-day matches, it is far more likely that Marks understood both indictments to target the same transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Because they often have \"nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of the persons charged,\"\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    sought to limit the impact that \"procedural errors and defects in form\" would have on the State's ability to re-indict an offender.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    To that end,\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    instructs us to construe Article 12.05(b)\"broadly.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    Today's opinion takes a decidedly narrow view of what that statute permits.

But not so with\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    . Instead of implementing what we all but admitted was the plain import of the statute on its face, we immediately jumped to a conclusion that something must be missing: \"The Article provides no guidance as to how the indictments must be related to trigger the tolling provision.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286933\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/127/768/#p774\">\n     127 S.W.3d at 770\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    We did this despite the fact that there is nothing in the literal language of the statute to suggest that there must be any \"relatedness\" at all between one charging instrument and another already-pending charging instrument before tolling of limitations may be triggered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    It is simple enough to implement the statute without imposing any notion of \"relatedness\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    upon it, and there is no particular reason (at least none that emanates from the statutory language itself) to suppose that we ought to do so.
