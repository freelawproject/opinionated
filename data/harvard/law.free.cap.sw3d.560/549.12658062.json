The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This appeal arises out of a shooting in the early morning hours of September 25, 2012, at a building owned by Jungerman located at 131 South Belmont Avenue in Kansas City. The building was a 20,000-square-foot vacant warehouse with a loading dock. A chain-link fence surrounded the building and dock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Harris was living on the streets in the Northeast part of Kansas City at the time. That night, the weather was overcast and looking like rain, so Harris was looking for shelter and a place to sleep. He rode his bicycle to the back of the building, which he assumed was abandoned. He saw that the fence was \"kind of tilted\" and loose, and he rolled his bike over it through a hole, which he did not make. He walked up onto the dock and found a man, who he later learned was Robert Wallace, standing on the dock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wallace, who had also been riding his bike in the area, had heard a loud, banging noise coming from the building, which he had also assumed was abandoned. He walked up onto the dock to investigate but by then the banging had stopped. Wallace saw the overhead door from the building to the dock was halfway open. Thinking that that was unusual, he yelled into the building \"who's in there\" or \"hello.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By then, Harris walked up onto the dock and asked Wallace if he could sleep under a trailer beside the dock. As the two men were talking, they heard gunshots. Harris was shot in the back of the right leg, fell to the ground, and tried to crawl away. Wallace started running away from the dock and was shot in the buttocks. On the ground, Harris saw that his leg was bleeding badly, cut a rope off a pouch he was carrying, and tied his leg off to stop the bleeding. Just then, Jungerman struck Harris in the head with an AK-47 rifle. Jungerman said, \"[W]here they at? You MF-er. I'll kill you right here.\" Harris responded, \"F* * * you, you just shot my leg off,\" and Jungerman \"took off running.\" Harris testified that he never moved toward or threatened Jungerman and didn't even know Jungerman was there before Jungerman shot him. Wallace also testified that neither he nor Harris attacked Jungerman but instead that the shooting was unprovoked and \"came out of nowhere.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Harris was found on the ground next to the dock and transported to the hospital. Because of the extent of nerve and vascular injury, surgeons amputated Harris's\n   right leg below the knee. Afterward, he experienced further complications from the injury including four additional surgeries over the next three months for blood collection and infection in the wound and extended hospitalizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Harris's medical expenses totaled $226,000, and an orthopedic surgeon testifying as his expert opined that those expenses were reasonable and necessary. A certified nurse life care planner estimated Harris's future medical costs to be $772,425, which the expert also found reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Police arrived at the scene and found blood spatter and bone fragments just outside the dock door and a pool of blood on the ground east of the loading dock. Five shell casings were found in the same area in the corner of a large room of the building near the open door. No blood or bone fragments were found in the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Harris filed a petition for damages against Jungerman and two corporations of which he alleged Jungerman was the owner or sole shareholder. His petition raised claims of negligence, battery, and assault against the three defendants. It also included a separate count for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his answer, Jungerman asserted, as affirmative defenses, that the petition failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted and that he \"was justified in using deadly force against Plaintiff and that such justification is an absolute defense to Plaintiff's claims.\" He also claimed that Count IV asserted an independent cause of action for punitive damages and, therefore, failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Harris eventually voluntarily dismissed one of Jungerman's corporations as a party. No summons was ever issued for the second corporation, and no attorney entered an appearance for it. Harris also voluntarily dismissed his negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Jungerman requested a bifurcated trial on the issue of punitive damages under section 510.263,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the trial court granted. Jungerman dismissed his attorneys and continued\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   He eventually hired another attorney to enter a limited appearance to assist him as co-counsel while remaining\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   That arrangement continued through trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, Jungerman testified that he got a call from his alarm company around 2:20 a.m. that the silent, motion detection alarm at the building had been activated. He took a flashlight, a loaded AK-47, and a loaded .38 Smith &amp; Wesson pistol and drove to the building. He said that Harris and Wallace were both inside the building and that he intentionally shot at them because they were charging at him and he was defending himself. Leo Wynne, who had worked for Jungerman for more than 30 years, testified that he found blood drops, bone fragments, and dried blood inside the building by the door to the dock the next day. Jungerman did not report any of these findings to police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the first phase of the trial, Harris only submitted the battery claim to the jury, abandoning the assault claim. The jury found in favor of Harris, assessed compensatory damages at $750,000, and found that Jungerman was liable for punitive damages. During the second phase of the trial, the jury awarded Harris $5 million in punitive damages. The trial court accepted the verdicts and entered judgment accordingly. This appeal by Jungerman followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Jungerman raises two points on appeal regarding punitive damages. In his\n   first point, Jungerman asserts that the trial court erred in awarding punitive damages because Harris's petition did not plead any claim for punitive damages as to battery. He argues that his only claim for punitive damages was alleged in a separate count after his claim for assault, which was abandoned at trial, and the only actions alleged to warrant punitive damages in the separate count went to negligence, a count Harris dismissed before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A claim that the petition fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is solely a test of the adequacy of the plaintiff's petition.\n   <em>\n    City of Greenwood v.

Evil motive may be inferred when the defendant recklessly disregards the interests and rights of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10014235\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/769/780/#p787\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    J.M.

App. W.D. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under Count II for battery, Harris's petition alleged that Jungerman \"intentionally, harmfully and offensively contacted Plaintiff shooting him in the leg and then striking him in the face with the barrel of his assault rifle.\" In Count IV for punitive damages, the petition incorporated by reference all of the preceding allegations of the petition including those allegations under the battery claim. It then alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant Jungerman's actions manifest reckless indifference to the rights of Plaintiff. Defendant Jungerman knew or should have had information from [sic] which he in the exercise of ordinary care, should have known that the alleged negligent conduct created a high degree of probability of injury and thereby showed complete [sic] indifference or conscious disregard for Plaintiff's safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While the second sentence of the punitive damages allegation related to the negligence claim, the first sentence was applicable to the intentional tort claims. Liberally granting Harris all favorable inferences from his pleading, the petition sufficiently asserted that the wrongful acts alleged in the battery claim were done with a reckless indifference to the rights of Harris. The petition gave Jungerman fair notice of the nature of the demand for punitive damages and the grounds upon which it rested. Harris's petition sufficiently alleged a cause of action for punitive damages for battery. The point is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In Jungerman's fourth point on appeal, he claims that the trial court plainly erred in submitting Instruction No. 12 during the first phase of the bifurcated trial. Instruction No. 12 read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   If you find the issues in favor of plaintiff, and if you believe the conduct of the\n   defendant as submitted in Instruction Number 7 was outrageous because of defendant's evil motive or reckless indifference to the rights of others,\n   <strong>\n    then in addition to any damages to which you find plaintiff entitled under Instruction Number 11 you may award plaintiff an additional amount as punitive damages in such sum as you believe will serve to punish defendant and to deter defendant and others from like conduct\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   You may consider harm to others in determining whether defendant's conduct was outrageous. However, in determining the amount of any punitive-damage award, you must not include damages for harm to others who are not parties to this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If you find that defendant is liable for punitive damages in this stage of trial, you will be given further instructions for assessing the amount of punitive damages in the second stage of the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (emphasis added). He claims that the emphasized part of the instruction led the jury to believe that it could award an amount of punitive damages in the first stage of the trial in violation of 510.263 and MAI 10.01 and MAI Illus. 35.19. He asserts that manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice resulted because it was impossible to determine what part of the jury's original $750,000 damages award was intended as compensatory damages and what part was intended as punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Jungerman acknowledges that this claim is not preserved because he did not object to Instruction No. 12 at trial. He seeks plain error review. Rule 84.13(c) provides, \"Plain errors affecting substantial rights may be considered on appeal, in the discretion of the court, though not raised or preserved, when the court finds that manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice has resulted therefrom.\" A civil case will be reversed for plain error \"only where the error is so egregious as to weaken the very foundation of the process and seriously undermine confidence in the outcome of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    McCrainey v.

App. W.D. 2011) (internal quotes and citation omitted).

Jungerman has not met this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   If a Missouri Approved Instruction (MAI) is applicable in a particular case, the trial court is required to give it.

Section 510.263.2 requires the jury to determine in the first stage of a bifurcated trial (1) liability for compensatory damages, (2) the amount of compensatory damages, and (3) liability of a defendant for punitive damages. If during the first stage the jury determines that the defendant is liable for punitive damages, the jury shall determine in the second stage of such trial the amount of punitive damages. \u00a7 510.263.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   MAI 10.01 is the applicable instruction for submitting punitive damages in intentional tort cases in non-bifurcated trials. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   If you find the issues in favor of plaintiff, and if you believe the conduct of defendant as submitted in Instruction Number ___\n   <em>\n    (here insert number of plaintiff's verdict directing instruction)\n   </em>\n   was outrageous because of defendant's evil motive or reckless indifference to the rights of others, then in addition to any damages to which you find plaintiff entitled under Instruction Number ___\n   <em>\n    (here insert number of plaintiff's damages instruction)\n   </em>\n   , you may award plaintiff an additional amount of punitive damages in such sum as you believe will serve to punish defendant and to deter defendant and others from like conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [You may consider harm to others in determining whether defendant's conduct was outrageous. However, in determining the amount of any punitive damage award, you must not include damages for harm to others who are not parties to this case.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Comment C to MAI 10.01 directs parties to MAI Illustration 35.19 \"for an example of a submission of punitive damages in a bifurcated trial pursuant to \u00a7 510.263.\" Instruction Number 13 in Illustration 35.19 recommends modifying the phrase \"in addition to any damages to which you find plaintiff entitled under Instruction Number ___, you may award plaintiff an additional amount of punitive damages in such sum as you believe will serve to punish defendant and to deter defendant and others from like conduct\" to \"you may find that defendant ... is liable for punitive damages.\" It also recommends adding the phrase, \"If you find that defendant ... is liable for punitive damages in this stage of the trial, you will be given further instructions for assessing the amount of punitive damages in the second stage of trial.\" Then Verdict A of the Illustration advises adding the word \"compensatory\" before the word \"damages\" in the first-stage verdict form. It also suggests adding the following note and paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Note: If you found in favor of plaintiff ... and against defendant ..., complete the following paragraph by writing in the word(s) required by your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   We, the undersigned jurors, find that defendant ... ________ (\"is\" or \"is not\") liable for punitive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   MAI 35.19 is an illustrative instruction, not a mandatory instruction.\n   <em>\n    Delacroix v.

Continuing, it explained that because the jury had no idea at the time of the first verdict that it would deliberate a second time, the verdict form further misled the jury by not clearly stating that its award must be for \"compensatory\" damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6898543\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6898543\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/16/\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, this court determined that the incorrect submission of the unmodified 10.01 instruction coupled with the failure to limit the word \"damages\" in the verdict form rendered the instruction and verdict form misleading and prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6898543\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This instant case, however, differs significantly from\n   <em>\n    Advantage\n   </em>\n   . While the trial court failed to modify the first paragraph of Instruction No. 12 to refer to a finding of liability for punitive damages rather than to an award of punitive damages, it did include the additional paragraph suggested by Illustration 35.19, \"If you find that defendant is liable for punitive damages in this stage of trial, you will be given further instructions for assessing the amount of punitive damages in the second stage of the trial.\" This paragraph expressly informed the jury that punitive damages would be addressed in two phases-a first phase addressing liability and a second phase addressing the amount of punitive damages to be awarded. Furthermore, the trial court properly modified the first-stage verdict form per 35.19 to clarify that the jury was only awarding \"compensatory damages\" and determining whether Jungerman was or was not liable for punitive damages during that stage. Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Advantage\n   </em>\n   , Instruction No. 12 did not on its face cause confusion for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The amount of damages awarded by the jury in each phase of the trial further supports the conclusion that the jury was not confused about the type of damages being awarded in each phase. At trial, Harris presented medical bills totaling $226,000 and evidence of future medical care totaling $772,425. In closing arguments, Harris's attorney asked the jury to award $2 million in compensatory damages-$1 million for past and future medical and $1 million for pain and suffering.

The fact that Secrist tested positive for 50 ng/ml of THC (marijuana)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   means nothing without context. Certainly the average juror would have no knowledge as to what this number means as it relates to the level of impairment of the person in whose system it was found. It has been noted by other courts that THC may remain in the blood or urine for days if not weeks after marijuana use, and the physiological effects of marijuana use dissipate long before the THC leaves the system; therefore, without further evidence as to the significance of the particular levels of THC on a person's functioning, THC levels in the person's system are no indication of impairment therefrom. Also, evidence regarding abnormal behavior is not sufficient without some evidence that the behavior is consistent with identifiable symptoms of ingestion of the particular drug. Popular stereotypes regarding the characteristics and behaviors of drug users are not sufficient in a court of law. Evidence of the level of drugs in the person's system is meaningless to the layperson until there is\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   evidence as to what effect those levels of that drug in a person's system would be expected to have on the individual in question.

Harris's theory during the second phase of trial was that Jungerman's conduct was outrageous in that it was an unnecessary and unreasonable level of violence against him warranting the imposition of punitive damages. The evidence of the subsequent shooting at the same building and of the incident involving the ex-employee on other property owned by Jungerman showed a pattern by Jungerman to over-react violently with firearms to any perceived threat on his property however unwarranted. The other incidents tended to show Jungerman's evil motive in, or reckless disregard for the consequences of, shooting Harris without any warning to or threat by Harris after finding him on his property. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.
