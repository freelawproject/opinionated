PPG asserts the Circuit Court of St. Louis County cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over it because the underlying claim arises solely out of PPG's wide-reaching, passive website and does not arise from its contacts with Missouri.

Hilboldt, as a subcontractor, was to supply curtainwalls, which included coated aluminum extrusions. The project specifications required the aluminum extrusions be coated with a product made by PPG, a Pennsylvania-based corporation, or an approved substitute. Hilboldt alleges that after seeing on PPG's website that Finishing Dynamics, LLC, was an \"approved\" applicator of the required coating, it contracted with Finishing Dynamics to apply the coating.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-10\">\n  When Finishing Dynamics failed to properly coat the aluminum extrusions, rendering them defective and unusable in the construction project, Hilboldt sued PPG and Finishing Dynamics. The count against PPG was for negligent misrepresentation based on PPG's online representation that Finishing Dynamics was an \"approved extrusion applicator.\"\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  PPG filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, arguing its website was insufficient to render it subject to the state's personal jurisdiction. After the circuit court overruled PPG's motion to dismiss, PPG filed a petition for a writ of prohibition in this Court seeking to prevent the circuit court from taking any further action in the case other than dismissing the claim against it.

In\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   , the defendant sent physical mail and emails and made phone calls directly to the Missouri plaintiff. Here, no such direct or individual communication was made to Hilboldt. PPG did not contact any Hilboldt representative through its website, nor did Hilboldt interact with any PPG representative using the website. The website was not used to complete any transaction, facilitate any communication, or beget any interaction between Hilboldt and PPG. And although the website was accessible by Missouri residents, it was not\n   <em>\n    targeted\n   </em>\n   at Missouri residents. PPG sent nothing into Missouri, nor did it attempt to solicit web traffic from Missouri specifically. PPG did nothing more than publish information that was equally as available to individuals in each of the other 49 states as it was to residents of Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The absolute remoteness of the connection between PPG's online representation and the forum state bears emphasizing. PPG merely indicated on its website that Finishing Dynamics was one of an indeterminate number of companies it had deemed \"approved extrusion applicator[s].\" This wide-reaching, public posting of information was the extent of PPG's \"action\" at issue here. Given the broad and general nature of PPG's website, PPG's suit-related contacts with Missouri are not sufficient to be considered tortious acts within the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Additionally, the information on PPG's website that Hilboldt allegedly relied upon was used to enter into a contract with a third party, Finishing Dynamics - a contract in which PPG had no role. And it was this third party's alleged unilateral mistake that is the true basis for the underlying lawsuit, which muddles the connection between PPG and Missouri even further.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without more, the website's accessibility in Missouri is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The mere allegation that a website, accessible by internet users in every state in the country, published false or misleading statements cannot be enough to conclude the website owner acted tortiously within Missouri. To find specific jurisdiction under these facts would allow PPG - and virtually any other company with a website - to be sued in Missouri if its website was viewed by a party who believes it was aggrieved by the information obtained. Such a result would open up Missouri courts to suits against companies who lack even negligible contacts with the state. In other words, it would essentially \"resemble[ ] a loose and spurious form of general jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1780\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
