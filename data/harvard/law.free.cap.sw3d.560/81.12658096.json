The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded with directions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Nelson owns a home in Weatherby Lake in Platte County, Missouri. Farm Bureau issued a homeowner's policy on the property that was in effect from December 27, 2005, until December 27, 2006. Ms. Nelson also had a separate insurance policy on the property issued by American Security Insurance Company, which provided coverage for the dwelling only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 11, 2006, Ms. Nelson sustained a partial fire loss to the residence and the personal property in it. She notified Farm Bureau of the fire that day. She subsequently presented claims to Farm Bureau to recover insurance proceeds for losses to the structure and personal property and for additional living expenses incurred. Farm Bureau paid Ms. Nelson two\n   $2,000 advance payments with a reservation of rights that if it determined that the loss was not covered, she would repay the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in March, the Farm Bureau claims adjuster prepared several adjuster summaries outlining the scope of damage and the cost of repair for the structure claim. The first one dated March 9, 2006, showed an estimate of $26,905.33. After Ms. Nelson and her contractor reviewed the summary, they requested three additional items. The adjuster agreed with the additions and prepared a second summary on March 18 with an estimate of $28,267.12. Ms. Nelson and her contractor continued to request additional repairs. Although the claims adjuster did not agree with the new additions, he prepared two more summaries on April 3 for $38,061.00 and on April 12 for $55,110.77 to reflect Ms. Nelson's additional claims. Ultimately, because of the disagreement between Farm Bureau and Ms. Nelson about the scope of damage and cost of repair on the structure claim, Farm Bureau retained All Service Restoration to prepare an estimate for repairing the damage to the house. All Service's bid was $28,410.95. Believing the All Service bid was an accurate assessment of damages and cost of restoration, Farm Bureau issued a payment to Ms. Nelson in May in the amount of $23,372.99 based on the All Service bid plus $4,962.04 for interior structure cleaning minus a $10,000 deductible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Toward the end of April, Ms. Nelson prepared and submitted an inventory list of personal property damaged in the fire. The list claimed $24,382.65 for damaged property, which included a claim of $1,609.52 for spoiled food. In May, Farm Bureau issued a payment to Ms. Nelson and ServiceMaster in the amount of $10,871.09 for ServiceMaster's bill of $14,871.09 for laundry and dry cleaning, pack out and storage, and content cleaning less the $4,000 in advance payments already made to Ms. Nelson. In June, after an inspection of Ms. Nelson's personal property, Farm Bureau issued another payment to Ms. Nelson in the amount of $3,134.57 for items on her inventory that were damaged or not cost effective to clean, food, and clothing. In total, Farm Bureau issued $18,005.66 to Ms. Nelson for her claimed personal property damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Nelson also made a claim in the amount of $12,178.33 for additional living expenses as a result of not being able to live in her home after the fire until the beginning of July. Farm Bureau determined that the home was inhabitable on May 13, 2006, after the cleaning by ServiceMaster and issued payments totaling $5,828 for her claimed additional living expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2006, Ms. Nelson informed Farm Bureau that she intended to make additional claims. At that time, Farm Bureau invoked the appraisal process under the policy. That process started at the beginning of February 2007. Farm Bureau selected Brachman Construction as its appraiser, and Ms. Nelson selected French Remodeling. The Brachman bid was $46,947.86; the French bid was $77,568.55. When the process started, Farm Bureau also requested a copy of Ms. Nelson's American Security Policy. In April 2007, Farm Bureau received a copy of the American Security Policy and determined that that policy was the primary policy and the Farm Bureau policy was for any excess over American Security Policy coverage limit. Farm Bureau also learned that Ms. Nelson filed a lawsuit against American Security and settled the claims for less than the policy coverage limit in May 2007. Accordingly, Farm Bureau determined that because the primary insurance coverage was not exhausted, its policy was not\n   triggered and stopped the appraisal process. It notified Ms. Nelson in August 2007 that it wasn't moving forward with the appraisal process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Nelson filed a lawsuit against Farm Bureau and American Security for breach of contract and vexatious refusal to pay. Her claims against America Security were dismissed with prejudice based on her settlement with them, and her case against Farm Bureau proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the close of Ms. Nelson's case, Farm Bureau filed a motion for directed verdict arguing, among other things, that Ms. Nelson failed to make a submissible case on the proper measure of damages for the structure and personal property claims. Specifically, it argued that Ms. Nelson failed to introduce evidence of the actual cash value of the structure and personal property, which is defined under Missouri law as the difference between the reasonable value of the property immediately before and immediately after the loss. It asserted that Ms. Nelson instead merely submitted some evidence of the cost to repair the structure and the replacement value of the personal property, which by itself was insufficient to prove actual cash value. Farm Bureau also argued that Ms. Nelson failed to make a submissible case on the prejudgment interest claim. The trial court sustained the motion on Ms. Nelson's structure, personal property, and prejudgment interest claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. Nelson's claims for additional living expenses and vexatious refusal to pay remained and were submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Nelson on the policy in the amount of $6,350.33, for penalty in the amount of $785.03, and for attorney's fees in the amount of $35,000. The trial court entered judgment accordingly, and this appeal by Ms. Nelson followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Nelson raises three points on appeal challenging the trial court's directed verdict on her structure, personal property, and prejudgment interest claims. In reviewing the trial court's granting of a motion for directed verdict, the appellate court determines whether the plaintiff made a submissible case.\n   <em>\n    Investors Title Co., Inc. v.

She argues that the evidence presented on the appraisal process produced an appropriate measure of damages that was not manifestly unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ms. Nelson's insurance policy with Farm Bureau at the time of the fire was a replacement cost policy.

The court discussed whether the appraisal fixed the \"sum of money equal to the damage done to the property,\" which it found was the amount the insured was entitled to under section 379.150.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020347\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/891/838/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020347\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/891/838/\">\n    at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Quoting\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   , it further noted that the amount of damages under section 379.150 is to be determined by the difference in value of the property immediately\n   before and immediately after the loss and that cost of repair by itself is not sufficient to establish that amount of damage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020347\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/891/838/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the appraisal amount fixed only the amount for the replacement costs to bring the property to the condition it was in, the court ultimately gave the appraisal the effect of fixing the amount of the insured's damages because neither party objected to or discussed the appraisal's use of the improper measure of damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020347\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/891/838/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Abercrombie\n   </em>\n   , the appraisal process in this case was never completed; the parties' respective appraisers never agreed on the amount of loss, an umpire was never selected, and an award was never made. And unlike in\n   <em>\n    Abercrombie\n   </em>\n   , Farm Bureau did object at trial to Ms. Nelson's use of cost of repair as the measure of damages. In its motion for directed verdict, it specifically argued that actual cash value was the proper measure of damages, not cost of repair, which was the only evidence Ms. Nelson submitted on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ms. Nelson's Farm Bureau policy was consistent with section 379.150. Under section 379.150 and the policy, the measure of damages was the difference between the value of the property immediately before and immediately after the fire, and Ms. Nelson had the burden to prove the two values. However, at trial, Ms. Nelson presented cost of repair evidence regarding the structure, including adjuster summaries outlining the scope of damage and the cost of repair for the structure and a $77,568.55 repair estimate prepared by her appraiser. But cost of repair was not the proper measure of damages in this case as an exception to actual cash value or diminution of value. It was not comparatively insignificant considering the total insured value of the house of $206,938. Additionally, while Ms. Nelson's cost of repair evidence was admissible as some evidence of damages, it was not itself sufficient to establish the amount of damages. Ms. Nelson did not introduce evidence of the market value of the house before the fire or the market value of the house after the fire. She acknowledges in her brief that neither her appraisal nor Farm Bureau's appraisal, which were based on the cost to repair the house, complied with section 379.150 and\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   . She, therefore, failed to make a submissible case on the issue of damages on her structure claim, and the trial court properly directed verdict in favor of Farm Bureau on the structure claim. The point is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In her second point on appeal, Ms. Nelson argues that Farm Bureau waived or was estopped at trial from objecting to the measure of damages for the structure and personal property. Specifically, she asserts that because Farm Bureau assisted and instructed her in the claims process and manifested an intention to use cost of repair or replacement cost as the measure of damages, it waived or was estopped from asserting actual cash value or diminution in value as the correct measure of damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Farm Bureau does not dispute that it used repair estimates to ultimately arrive at a figure for settlement. But nothing in the record indicated that it intended to pay full repair cost prior to the property actually being repaired. Further, Farm Bureau did not adopt or invite the trial court to adopt the wrong measure of damages-cost of repair-by its failure to object to, or its own introduction of, such evidence at trial. As discussed in\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Scism\n   </em>\n   , cost of repair throws light on and is admissible as evidence of damages, but itself is not sufficient to establish the amount of damages.\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9930949\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/653/207/#p210\">\n    653 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   210 ;\n   <em>\n    Scism\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=224%20S.W.%2048\">\n    224 S.W. at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Farm Bureau's conduct during the claims process and at trial did not clearly and unequivocally show a purpose to relinquish its right to insist that the trial court apply the proper measure of damages of actual cash value or diminution of value or that such conduct constituted an admission, statement, or act that cost of repair was the proper measure of damages. It did not waive and was not estopped from asserting that Ms. Nelson failed to make a submissible case on her structure claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, Ms. Nelson argues that Farm Bureau waived and/or was estopped from asserting actual cash value or diminution of value as the measure of damages for the personal property because it provided her with, and she completed, the personal property inventory form to submit her claim. She argues that Farm Bureau's form, which requested the date each item was purchased, the replacement cost for each item, and a determination of whether each item was salvageable, established a cost of replacement measure of damages to which Farm Bureau was bound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The form, however, did not evince intent by Farm Bureau to pay full replacement cost of the personal property. Ms. Nelson acknowledges that the form contained additional columns to be completed by Farm Bureau for \"Betterment\" and \"Settlement value.\" In fact, the additional columns were completed by Farm Bureau for some of the items and showed its adjustment of the replacement cost to account for the difference necessary to replace old property with new property, which the insured is responsible to bear under the actual cash value measure of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dollard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9364344,9364290\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/96/885/\">\n    96 S.W.3d at 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Farm Bureau's use of the inventory form did not clearly and unequivocally show a purpose to relinquish its right to insist that the trial court apply the proper measure of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, Ms. Nelson argues that her inventory list along with her testimony that items on the list were destroyed and a letter from Service Master indicating that the property was unsalvageable or not cost effective to clean was sufficient to make a submissible case on damages to personal property.
