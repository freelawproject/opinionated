Ruff filed a motion for post-conviction relief under Supreme Court Rule 24.035, which the circuit court denied following an evidentiary hearing. Ruff appeals. He asserts that his counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to present mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing concerning Ruff's adolescence, and the state of his brain development given his age. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
