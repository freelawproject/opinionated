Therefore, Carr's present status is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   as an offender \"who has been ... required to register under ... federal law,\" and the circuit court erred in finding a registration obligation under SORNA triggered a registration obligation under SORA.

There is no need for a remand here, because the record plainly establishes that Carr's victim had \"attained the age of 13 years\" at the time of the offense. The indictment to which Carr pleaded guilty explicitly alleged that the victim \"was then fourteen years old,\" and Carr testified in the circuit court that the victim \"was thirteen years or older.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
