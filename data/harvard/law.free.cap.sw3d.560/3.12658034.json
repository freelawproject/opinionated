Vickers raises five claims on appeal. He argues that (1) he was denied his right to a speedy trial; (2) the court erred in excluding his proposed alibi witness; (3) the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of deliberation; (4) he was entitled to a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence; and (5) he was entitled to a mistrial when a State's witness volunteered information associating Vickers with an unrelated drug offense. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In August of 2011, Kristen Forbush lived on 85th Terrace in Jackson County with her fianc\u00e9, Edward Ewing, III, and her two young children. On August 15, 2011, Forbush worked from 6:00 p.m. to midnight; neither of her children were home that night. While she was at work, Forbush received a call from a high-school friend, Kyeisa Ransom, asking Forbush why she had not attended a party the weekend before that was hosted by Vickers. Ewing had attended the party and took Forbush's camcorder with him. During Forbush's conversation with Ransom, Forbush indicated that she got off work at midnight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After Forbush got off work, she stopped for groceries before heading home. Around 1:00 a.m., as she was coming up the street toward her house, Forbush noticed a car parked down the street with its parking lights on, which she thought was unusual. Forbush parked in her driveway and began to unload her grocery bags when she noticed that the car she had seen with its parking lights on was now sitting at the edge of her driveway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Three men wearing hoodies got out of the car and approached Forbush. She immediately recognized Vickers as one of the men and Garron Briggs (Ransom's boyfriend and Vickers's cousin) as another; she did not know the third man.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Forbush saw that Vickers was carrying a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As the men approached, they directed Forbush to open the door to the house. She responded by saying, \"Please take whatever you want. You can have whatever you want.\" But the men continued to instruct her to open the door. As Forbush put the key in the door, Briggs grabbed her while Vickers and the third man went inside. Briggs led Forbush into the house and directed her to lie on the floor in the living room, where he then stood over her with a gun pointed at her, while Vickers and the other man went to the back bedroom where Ewing had been sleeping. Forbush heard Vickers and the other man repeatedly demand, \"Where's it at? Where's it at?\" Ewing kept asking, \"Where is what at? What are you all looking\n   for?\" Briggs asked Forbush where the camcorder was, and Forbush responded, \"What camcorder?\" Meanwhile, she could hear people going through closets and drawers while Vickers and the other man continued to demand, \"Where is it at?\" Ewing kept asking, \"What are you all looking for? I don't sell drugs. What are you all looking for?\" Ewing, Vickers, and the third man approached the living room, with Ewing stopping along the way to open a coat closet and let the men search. When Ewing saw Forbush on the floor, he said, \"You all got me messed up. What are you all doing? What are you all looking for?\" Forbush told Ewing to \"chill,\" and then Ewing, Vickers, and the third man headed back toward the bedroom. The third man briefly returned to the living room and told Briggs, \"They don't have shit. Now what?\" Briggs responded, \"Just do it.\" Briggs then shot Forbush in the neck and ran out the front door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Forbush heard approximately six shots from the back bedroom. She heard four shots, a pause, and then two more, after which Vickers and the third man ran out the front door. Either Vickers or the third man tripped over Forbush's leg on the way out, but she could not tell which one it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the men left, Forbush called 911 and went to check on Ewing, who was unresponsive. When officers arrived, they asked Forbush if she knew who had attacked her, and she told them it was Briggs, Vickers, and a third man she did not know. She further advised that the men had been in Ransom's car. At the hospital, Forbush viewed several photographic lineups presented by officers, and she identified Vickers, Briggs, and Ransom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ewing died as a result of his injuries. A subsequent examination of his body revealed that he had been shot in both the head and chest seven times, six of which would have been fatal in isolation. Forensic analysis of the bullets, bullet fragments, and shell casings found at the scene suggested that there were at least two different guns and that all of the rounds fired at Ewing were from the same gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State filed a complaint against Vickers on August 19, 2011, charging him with first-degree murder, first-degree assault, and two counts of armed criminal action. After Vickers was arrested, he contacted Keith Jones, seeking money to post bond. Jones provided the money and discussed the case with Vickers. Vickers told Jones that he \"drove the car.\" Vickers also told Jones that he, Briggs, and another man went over to Ewing's house for the purpose of retrieving a moneybag belonging to Briggs. Vickers was tried on May 16, 2016, after which the jury found him guilty as charged. The court sentenced Vickers, as a prior offender, to concurrent terms of life without parole, and three terms of thirty years' imprisonment. Vickers appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Vickers raises five points on appeal. In his first point, he argues that his right to a speedy trial was violated in light of the fact that nearly five years elapsed between the date of the State's initial complaint and the date of his trial. In his second point, he claims that he was denied his right to present a defense when the trial court precluded him from presenting testimony from a proposed alibi witness as a discovery sanction. Vickers's third point alleges that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he deliberated-a necessary element for first-degree murder. His fourth point claims that he was entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly\n   discovered evidence pertaining to the credibility of one of the State's witnesses. And his final point argues that he was entitled to a mistrial when a State's witness volunteered during the trial that Vickers was known as a \"wanna-be rapper who was into drugs.\" Finding no reversible error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Speedy Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State filed the initial complaint against Vickers on August 19, 2011, and Vickers was arrested on the associated warrant on August 22, 2011. On September 2, 2011, Vickers was indicted by a grand jury. The trial was originally set for March 12, 2012. On January 24, 2012, the State requested a continuance in order to obtain DNA evidence from Vickers, and Vickers did not oppose the continuance. Trial was rescheduled for July 9, 2012. On June 26, 2012, Vickers and the State filed a joint application for a continuance because the DNA analysis had not yet been completed. The trial was then rescheduled for November 26, 2012. On October 15, 2012, Vickers and the State filed another joint motion for continuance on the ground that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant was named in a multi-defendant federal drug indictment, 4:12cr-00283-BCW, dated September 26, 2012, and the parties request an opportunity to investigate the potential consequences of said federal case before expending substantial judicial resources on the instant case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Vickers was transferred into federal custody pursuant to the federal charges on October 19, 2012. At a scheduled pretrial conference on November 1, 2012, the court set a new pretrial conference for May 2, 2013, which was subsequently rescheduled to May 9, 2013. At the May 9, 2013 conference, the court set trial for September 23, 2013, at 9:30 a.m. and noted that no further continuances would be granted. On August 9, 2013, however, Vickers requested another continuance, unopposed by the State, due to the hospitalization of a member of defense counsel's family. On August 15, 2013, the court held a pretrial conference of which no record was apparently made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 10, 2013, the State voluntarily dismissed Vickers's case and then refiled a complaint alleging the same charges thirteen days later. After the complaint was refiled, nothing happened in the State murder case until after Vickers was sentenced in federal court on May 28, 2015, upon conviction of a drug offense. On June 12, 2015, Vickers was again indicted on the State charges. On September 11, 2015, without objection, the court set a trial date for May 16, 2016. On May 9, 2016-seven days before trial-Vickers filed a motion to dismiss, asserting for the first time a violation of his right to a speedy trial. The State filed a response to Vickers's motion, arguing that Vickers either acquiesced or actively contributed to most of the delay; specifically, the State argued that Vickers either joined in all of the pretrial continuance requests or requested them on his own and that Vickers supported the State's decision to dismiss and refile the charges so as to allow Vickers's federal case to conclude before proceeding with the State charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before trial, the court held a hearing on Vickers's motion to dismiss, wherein the\n   State reiterated that the decision to dismiss and refile was based, in large part, on Vickers's desire to resolve his federal case first:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I think [defense counsel] made the decision that it was a good idea because of the consecutive time issue when the Court was not going to grant his continuance back in September of 2013. I believe he filed his in August. It wasn't brought up until a pretrial sometime two weeks before the actual trial date in September, 2013. At that time the State dismissed it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   And it is my understanding the State dismissed it so he would face the charges in federal court with the understanding that then it would be more likely they can run concurrent times under the two cases. And I know there were negotiations going on between the parties at all times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Vickers did not refute the State's assertion. And, upon hearing the State's assertion and reviewing the sparse record before it, the trial court accepted the State's explanation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-29\">\n   I think the best information I can infer from what's been alleged in the motion and response and what I have heard the two of you talk about here this morning is that after the federal indictment was handed up, there was some recognition joined by both lawyers for both parties which concluded that the defendant would like to get the federal case resolved before the State case was resolved. That's kind of what the procedural history of this case looks like to me. That's common practice. It is typical for people to try to arrange things and go that way. Because the case wasn't continued by Judge Midkiff in Division one, it was dismissed and refiled. There is nothing here that leads me to believe that I should grant the motion to dismiss. So I will overrule the Motion to Dismiss based on the speedy trial argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

After refiling the complaint, the State took no action on Vickers's case until June 12, 2015, when Vickers was formally indicted on the refiled charges.

The parties disagree as to whether this time should be counted against the State, or even counted at all. The State argues that,\n   because the time does not commence until a formal indictment or information is filed, the time between the September 2013 dismissal and the second indictment in June 2015 should not be considered. Vickers argues that the time begins when actual restraints are imposed by an arrest and, because he was in custody throughout the duration, all of the time should be counted. Vickers further argues that, even if the State's argument is correct, the time should nevertheless be counted against the State because the State's dismissal in September 2013 was a calculated strategy, done in bad faith, intended to gain an advantage over Vickers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court found that the choice to dismiss was the result of \"some recognition joined by both lawyers for both parties which concluded that the defendant would like to get the federal case resolved before the State case was resolved.\" And, because the trial court indicated that no further continuances would be granted, the only way to resolve the federal case first was for the State to dismiss the state charges and then pursue them at the conclusion of Vickers's federal case. Thus, the trial court determined that, rather than a deliberate delay to hamper the defense, the intentional delay here was done to help Vickers resolve his federal case first. This is a finding to which we grant \"considerable deference.\"\n   <em>\n    Sisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875080\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/458/304/#p313\">\n    458 S.W.3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we need not decide whether the period between the State's dismissal of charges in September 2013 and its reindictment of Vickers in June 2015 should be excluded from the analysis in the circumstances of this case. Instead, it is sufficient to observe that the trial court found that Vickers invited and acquiesced in the delay resulting from the dismissal and refiling, in furtherance of his desire to have his pending federal charges resolved before his State charges. Because of Vickers's complicity in the twenty-one-month delay between September 2013 and June 2015, that delay cannot establish a speedy-trial violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition to the dismissal and refiling, there were a number of continuances in the case made pursuant to either a joint request from both parties or solely to Vickers's request. The first continuance request was made on January 24, 2012, by the State for purposes of conducting DNA analysis. Vickers did not object to this continuance, and it resulted in a delay of trial from March 12, 2012, to July 9, 2012, or approximately four months. \"Delay resulting from the state's performance of DNA analysis is weighed against the state but not heavily.\"\n   <em>\n    Sisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875080\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/458/304/#p313\">\n    458 S.W.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 26, 2012, the parties filed a joint application for continuance, again based on DNA analysis. This continuance delayed the trial for another four months until November 26, 2012. Because it was requested by both parties, it is a neutral factor in the analysis. A second\n   joint application for a continuance was filed on October 15, 2012, resulting in an approximately ten-month delay of the trial to September 23, 2013. This joint application was based on the parties' desire to discern the consequences of Vickers's pending federal drug case. Again, its effect is neutral to the analysis. A final request for continuance was made solely by Vickers on August 9, 2013, due to a health issue with a family member of Vickers's counsel. This request was not ruled on because the State subsequently dismissed the charges on September 10, 2013; thus, it is impossible to discern what effect this request had on the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, of the fifty-six months between Vickers's initial arrest and his trial, thirty-five months are neutral to the analysis because they involved delay that Vickers joined the State in seeking (fourteen months for joint applications for continuances and twenty-one months for dismissal and reindictment to resolve federal charges). Any remaining delays were due to either the court's docket or the State's effort to obtain DNA evidence, all of which weigh only slightly against the State. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of Vickers, but only slightly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    3.

DeMarea then spoke with an investigator for the Public Defender's Office the morning of the first day of trial, \"with regard to her memory of the events and believe[d] that she was with Mr. Vickers on the evening of this incident, which is August 15, leading into the morning of August 16, 2011.\" The State objected, noting that, at no point during the five years leading up to trial, had Vickers ever given any indication of an alibi defense. In fact, Vickers's counsel acknowledged that, one week earlier, in response to a discovery request from the State, Vickers had expressly denied any intent to rely on an alibi defense, despite his awareness of DeMarea as a potential alibi witness at that time. The court denied Vickers's request for late endorsement and assertion of an alibi defense:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    I'm going to deny the motion.

On May 9, 2016, one week before trial, Vickers responded to the discovery request by stating, \"The defendant does not intend to rely on the defense of alibi at this time. Should this change, a supplemental response to discovery will be filed.\" It was not until the first day of trial, in the midst of\n    <em>\n     voir dire\n    </em>\n    , that Vickers first gave any indication of a possible alibi defense, despite the fact that he had been aware of and actively investigating DeMarea for at least two weeks. Additionally, DeMarea's potential alibi evidence would have been known to Vickers, as she claimed to be with him the night of the charged crimes. But, when Vickers first revealed DeMarea's presence to the State, his case had been pending for approximately fifty-six months, and he had raised a claimed violation of his right to a speedy trial. And, even if the court had agreed to grant a continuance, there is no way of knowing how long it would have taken the State to investigate DeMarea's testimony and, thus, how much further delay would have been caused by permitting the late endorsement. Accordingly, his offer of a continuance to allow the State to investigate DeMarea put the State in the awkward position of either proceeding in the face of an uninvestigated defense or further delaying Vickers's trial and thereby supporting his claimed speedy-trial violation. In short, Vickers's request to endorse DeMarea clearly took the State by surprise and would have resulted in fundamental unfairness to the State.

Second, when Vickers and the third individual were unable to find whatever they were seeking, Briggs said, \"Just do it,\" after which both Forbush and Ewing were shot, suggesting that the plan had been to kill any witnesses\n    upon completion of the search. This inference is further supported by the fact that none of the men made any effort to hide their identity from the victims who both knew at least two of the men (including Vickers), suggesting that the men did not intend for the victims to survive, so there was no risk of being identified.

Background Facts\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    On May 2, 2016, a detective who served as a State's witness at Vickers's trial (\"Detective\") was involved in an altercation, unrelated to Vickers's case, that resulted in an official criminal investigation and an internal police department inquiry. Detective was identified as the victim of an assault by a man who believed Detective was having an affair with the man's wife. Detective initially denied the man's accusations, but the following day, he admitted to his superiors that he had, in fact, been having an affair with the woman. That same day, the prosecutor's office declined to file charges against Detective's assailant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    From May 2, 2016, through July 18, 2016, Detective's superiors conducted an internal investigation into Detective's conduct surrounding the assault. Vickers's trial began on May 16, 2016, and Detective testified on May 17, 2016. The following day, May 18, 2016, Detective was first notified by his superiors of the internal investigation in a formal disciplinary report, wherein it was alleged that Detective violated Personnel Policy 201-8 Code of Ethics and Rules of Conduct, Section IV-Rules of Conduct, Subsection B, Line 8, which provided that \"Members will not ... [e]ngage in or attempt to engage in, or knowingly consent to any form of dishonesty, including deviations from the truth, whether on or off duty.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Vickers's trial concluded on May 20, 2016, and he was given twenty-five days in which to file a motion for new trial. Vickers filed a motion for new trial twenty-one days later, on June 10, 2016. On July 15, 2016, Vickers's counsel sought a continuance of the originally scheduled sentencing hearing, based upon \"a letter received by the PD's office on another case in regard to Detective ..., with regard to that he is pending investigation with regard to his truthfulness.\" Despite its determination that any further motions for new trial would be untimely, the trial court, in an abundance of caution, granted Vickers a continuance to further investigate the information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The existence of the investigation into Detective was formally disclosed to Vickers on August 10, 2016. Vickers then filed a second motion for new trial on August 23, 2016, alleging that the investigation\n    into Detective's conduct constituted newly discovered\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    evidence warranting a new trial. As of August 24, 2016, Detective had not been subjected to any disciplinary action, and the internal inquiry was still pending review and final determination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    At the hearing on Vickers's second motion for new trial, the trial court expressed its concern \"as to whether a witness, a police officer or otherwise, who has been determined to have been dishonest in some other matter can be impeached by bringing up an unrelated matter where there was some specific instance of dishonesty.\" Thereafter, the court denied Vickers's motion, finding that Detective's testimony was neither adverse to Vickers nor his theory or defense and, therefore, the newly discovered evidence was not material. The court stated its belief that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    the strength of the State's case herein would always rise or fall exclusively on whether the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the credibility of the eyewitness identification of Defendant by the surviving victim, Krist[e]n Forbush. The testimony of Detective ... had no material impact on the identification issue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The court further determined that \"extrinsic evidence concerning the unresolved disciplinary proceeding against Detective would not be properly admissible as impeachment evidence under\n    <em>\n     Mitchell v.

The State asked Sergeant Sanders, \"Did she tell you how she knew it was [Vickers] that night?\" Sergeant Sanders replied, \"She said she knew him as a wanna-be rapper that was into drugs.\" Vickers objected on the ground that the testimony violated the court's ruling on the motion in limine and\n    requested an immediate mistrial.

First, the prosecutor's question was not designed to elicit any information about Vickers being involved in drugs. The prosecutor asked\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n    Forbush knew Vickers, not what she knew\n    <em>\n     of\n    </em>\n    him. Forbush knew Vickers because\n    they attended high school together-that was the information the question sought. Second, after Sergeant Sanders's answer and Vickers's objection, the prosecutor advised, \"We can leave that alone. I won't bring it up anymore.\" And there is nothing else in the record to suggest that the prosecutor did otherwise. Third, the remark itself was somewhat vague. It mentioned that Vickers was \"into drugs,\" but did not specify what that meant. It did not indicate that he had been charged or convicted of any drug offenses, nor did it state that he used or sold drugs. But, even accepting that it would be reasonable to infer illegal activity from the reference, Vickers still cannot prevail on this claim. As to the fourth factor, though the trial court did not sustain the objection and instruct the jury to disregard, the reason it did not do so is because Vickers declined the court's offer of any other form of relief besides a mistrial. \"The fact that a defendant limits his request for relief to that of a mistrial rather than making a request for a less drastic corrective action cannot aid him.\"\n    <em>\n     State v. Wright\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7084353\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/383/1/#p11\">\n     383 S.W.3d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 11 (Mo.

App. W.D. 2007) ). And, as to the final factor, there is no reason to believe that this single, isolated reference, which amounted to nothing more than Forbush's reported impression of Vickers, played a decisive role in the jury's verdict. The entire case hinged on Forbush's identification of her assailants, two of whom she knew from high school. The jury apparently accepted her identification and, therefore, found Vickers guilty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    In short, because the reference was brief, isolated, and unlikely to have affected the verdict, Vickers has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request for a mistrial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Point V is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Vickers has failed to demonstrate any reversible error made by the trial court.
