Armstrong (\"Armstrong\") appeals the judgment of the trial court following a jury trial in which he was convicted of two counts of attempted first-degree statutory rape, seven counts of first-degree\n   statutory sodomy, six counts of attempted first-degree statutory sodomy, and six counts of first-degree child molestation. Armstrong raises nineteen points on appeal. Armstrong argues the trial court plainly erred in submitting the verdict directing instructions for sixteen counts because the instructions violated his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict. Armstrong also argues there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support three of his convictions. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. E.D. 2017). The State charged Armstrong with two counts of attempted first-degree statutory rape, in violation of Sections 566.032 RSMo (2000)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 564.011; seven counts of first-degree statutory sodomy, in violation of Section 566.062; six counts of attempted first-degree statutory sodomy, in violation of Sections 566.062 and 564.011; and six counts of first-degree child molestation, in violation of Section 566.067. The case proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, Victim testified Armstrong is her father. In 2016, Armstrong, Victim's mother (\"Mother\"), Victim, and her younger brother and half-brother lived together in an apartment in Ste. Genevieve. Victim was twelve turning thirteen years old. One night in February 2016, when Mother was working the night shift, Victim testified Armstrong came into her bedroom while she was asleep, and tried to climb on top of her and pull down her sweatpants. Armstrong said, \"Let me do it.\" Victim said, \"No,\" and pushed Armstrong away. Later that same night, Victim testified Armstrong came back into her bedroom. Armstrong touched Victim's vagina and breasts. Armstrong also grabbed Victim's hand and tried to get her to touch his penis. Victim testified during the month of February, Armstrong came into her bedroom at night, and touched her vagina \"at least ten\" times, touched her breasts \"at least five\" times, and tried to get her to touch his penis \"at least ten\" times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2016, Victim testified she, Mother, and brother moved into a different apartment. However, Armstrong continued to live in the apartment in Ste. Genevieve. Victim and her brother stayed overnight at Armstrong's apartment when Mother worked night shifts during the week. Then, in mid-May 2016, Victim, Mother, and brother moved to her grandparents' home, and Victim only spent weekends at Armstrong's apartment. Victim testified that from March 2016 until July 2016, almost every time she stayed overnight at Armstrong's apartment, he came into her bedroom at night. Each time, Armstrong touched her vagina and her breasts, and tried to get her to touch his penis. Victim testified during March, April, and May, Armstrong touched her vagina \"at least ten\" times each month, touched her breasts \"at least five\" times each month, and tried to get her to touch his penis \"at least ten\" times each month. In June, Armstrong touched her vagina \"about five\" times, touched her breasts \"about two or three\" times, and tried to get her to touch his penis \"about five\" times. Victim testified she did not disclose the abuse because Armstrong threatened to rape her if she told Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition, one night in July 2016, Victim testified she was asleep in a recliner chair at Armstrong's apartment. Armstrong turned on the light, causing Victim to wake up. Armstrong told Victim to lean\n   her head back and close her eyes. Victim complied, then felt something touch her lips. When she opened her eyes, it was Armstrong's penis, and Victim pushed him away. A few weeks later in July, Victim testified she was in her bedroom at Armstrong's apartment. Armstrong came into Victim's bedroom, and tried to climb on top of her and pull down her pants. After this last incident, Victim testified she refused to go to Armstrong's apartment. A few months later, Victim told Mother that Armstrong had sexually abused her and threatened to rape her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mother testified that in February 2016, the family lived together in the apartment in Ste. Genevieve, and she would leave Victim in Armstrong's care when she worked the night shift. After they moved out in March, Victim would stay overnight at Armstrong's apartment during the week while Mother worked. When they moved in with Victim's grandparents in mid-May, Victim continued to stay overnight at Armstrong's apartment, though, less frequently. Mother testified that around late July 2016, Victim would \"throw a fit\" when she had to spend the night at Armstrong's apartment, and Mother would have to force Victim to go. Mother stopped forcing Victim to go in August or September. Mother testified that after Victim informed her of the sexual abuse, she brought Victim to the Children's Advocacy Center (\"CAC\"), where a forensic interviewer conducted a videotaped interview with Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the CAC interview, which was admitted into evidence at trial and played for the jury, Victim recounted the multiple, identical acts of sexual abuse she described in her trial testimony. Victim stated that from February 2016 to July 2016, every time she stayed at Armstrong's apartment, Armstrong came into her bedroom at night and touched her vagina. Victim also stated Armstrong touched her breasts and tried to get her to touch his penis between February and July. Victim did not indicate how many times these acts occurred during each month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Additionally, Armstrong voluntarily spoke with police and, although, he initially denied Victim's allegations, he eventually admitted touching Victim's vagina and breasts outside her clothing. Armstrong also told police Victim touched his penis outside his clothing. Armstrong further admitted he took his penis out and tried to get Victim to perform oral sex on him in the recliner chair. The videotaped interview was admitted into evidence at trial and played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the conclusion of trial, the trial court instructed the jury on the twenty-one counts charged. Armstrong did not object to the instructions as offered at trial. Nor did Armstrong raise instructional error in his motion for new trial. The jury found Armstrong guilty on all counts. Armstrong was sentenced to fifteen years for each count, with the sentences for the counts of attempted statutory rape, statutory sodomy, and attempted statutory sodomy to run consecutively, for a total of two hundred and twenty-five years' imprisonment. This appeal follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Points on Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Armstrong raises nineteen points on appeal. For ease of analysis, we first address Points I-XVI together and then address Points XVII-XIX together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Points I-XVI, Armstrong argues the trial court plainly erred in submitting verdict directing instructions for each of the\n   sixteen counts involving first-degree statutory sodomy (Counts 3-8), attempted first-degree statutory sodomy (Counts 9-13), and first-degree child molestation (Counts 16-20), and sentencing Armstrong because the verdict director for each count failed to specify a particular incident of abuse or instruct the jurors that they must unanimously agree on the same incident to support each conviction, and, thereby, violated his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In Points XVII-XIX, Armstrong argues the trial court erred in overruling his motions for judgment of acquittal, and imposing sentence and judgment upon him as to Count 14 (attempted first-degree statutory sodomy), Count 21 (first-degree child molestation), and Count 15 (first-degree statutory sodomy) because there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Points I-XVI-Instructional Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Points I-XVI involve the verdict directing instructions for six counts of first-degree statutory sodomy (Counts 3-8), five counts of attempted first-degree statutory sodomy (Counts 9-13), and five counts of first-degree child molestation (Counts 16-20). Armstrong argues the trial court plainly erred in submitting each of the sixteen verdict directors and sentencing him because the verdict directors failed to specify a particular incident of abuse or instruct the jurors that they must unanimously agree on the same incident to support each conviction, and, thereby, violated his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Armstrong concedes he did not properly preserve these sixteen claims of error and requests we review the claims for plain error under Rule 30.20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although Victim testified that all three acts occurred multiple times each month, as in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , Victim was unable to testify to particular acts on particular dates or distinguish between the repeated, identical acts in any way.

Point XIX-First-Degree Statutory Sodomy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Armstrong argues the trial court erred in overruling his motions for judgment of acquittal, and imposing sentence and judgment upon him as to Count 15 (first-degree statutory sodomy). Specifically, Armstrong contends insufficient evidence was presented from which a reasonable juror could have found he placed his penis on Victim's mouth. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"A person commits the crime of statutory sodomy in the first degree if he has deviate sexual intercourse with another person who is less than fourteen years old.\" Section 566.062.1. \"Deviate sexual intercourse\" is defined as \"any act involving the genitals of one person and the hand, mouth, tongue, or anus of another person ... for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of any person[.]\" Section 566.010(1) RSMo 2000 (Cum. Supp. 2007). Count 15 alleged Armstrong \"committed the felony of statutory sodomy in the first degree ... in that on or about June 1, 2016, to July 30, 2016 ... the defendant for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of defendant, had deviate sexual intercourse with [Victim], who was then less than fourteen years old, by placing his penis on her mouth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At trial, Victim testified that one night in July 2016, she was asleep in a recliner chair in Armstrong's apartment. Armstrong woke Victim, and told Victim to lean her head back and close her eyes. Victim felt \"[s]omething on my lips,\" opened her eyes, and saw it was Armstrong's penis. On appeal, Armstrong argues Victim's testimony was insufficient to support the conviction because the evidence presented was that he only touched his penis to Victim's \"lips,\" and not her \"mouth.\" Armstrong contends the words \"lips\" and \"mouth\" are not interchangeable. We find Armstrong's argument is entirely without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Although not statutorily defined, the dictionary defines \"lip\" as \"either of the two fleshy folds which surround the orifice of the mouth in man and many vertebrates[,]\" and \"this\n   <em>\n    part of the mouth\n   </em>\n   considered as an organ of speech.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE UNABRIDGED 1318 (2002) (emphasis added). Under this definition, the lips are undoubtedly part of the anatomy of the mouth. For example, when two people kiss on the mouth, the part of the mouth that is touching are the lips. Here, we note Armstrong was charged with placing his penis \"on her mouth\"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"in her mouth.\" As such, when Victim testified Armstrong placed his penis on her lips, his penis was clearly on her mouth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Bryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9461472\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/60/713/#p715\">\n    60 S.W.3d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715 (Mo. App. S.D. 2001) (finding the defendant's actions constituted deviate sexual intercourse when he \"plac[ed] his penis on [the victim's] lips,\" and attempted to or did place his penis against the victim's lips to arouse or gratify his sexual desire). The mere fact that Victim, a minor child, used a different, yet entirely reasonable, word to describe her mouth does not preclude a finding that Armstrong's actions constituted deviate sexual intercourse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7089080\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/407/162/#p167\">\n    407 S.W.3d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167 (Mo. App. E.D. 2013) (\"The fact that children, 'in their testimony, [use] unsophisticated language different from that of the statute to describe that part of their bodies' does not preclude an inference of contact.\"). Moreover, Armstrong admitted in the videotaped police interview that he took his penis out and tried to get Victim to perform oral sex on him in the recliner chair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Furthermore, Armstrong has cited no authority to support his proposition that a\n   defendant's act of placing his genitals on the lips of another person falls outside the definition of \"deviate sexual intercourse.\" Rather, Armstrong cites to\n   <em>\n    State v. Tolen\n   </em>\n   , in which this Court concluded evidence that the defendant touched the victim's \"butt\" or \"buttocks\" is insufficient to show the defendant touched the victim's \"anus.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Tolen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301363\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/883/#p887\">\n    295 S.W.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 887 (Mo. App. E.D. 2009). Armstrong contends that \"[t]he buttocks are near the anus in the same way that the lips are near the mouth, however this proximity is not enough to say that the two are one in the same.\" We find this argument unpersuasive. When a person touches the buttocks of another, it cannot be said he actually touches the anus. However, as explained above, when a person touches the lips of another, he is inevitably touching the mouth. Accordingly, Victim's testimony that Armstrong's penis touched her lips was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Armstrong placed his penis on her mouth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stallman\n   </em>\n   , 289 S.W.3d at 778.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We find the trial court did not err in overruling Armstrong's motions for judgment of acquittal, and imposing sentencing and judgment on the charge of first-degree statutory sodomy.
