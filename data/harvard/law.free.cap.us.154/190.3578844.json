In every action under this and the preceding section such damages may be given as under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u2019 \u201d The case was removed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Minnesota, where an answer was filed by the defendant, denying the averments of the complaint, and alleging that the death of Munro was caused solely by his negligence and carelessness, and not by the negligence of the defendant or any of its servants or employ\u00e9s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-4\">There was a verdict and judgment below in favor of the plaintiff for $10,000. ' To review that judgment this writ of error was sued out. The errors assigned were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\">' \u201c First. The court erred in charging the jury as follows: \u2018 Did it fail to discharge any duty which the law .imposed upon it for the safety of its employ\u00e9, the- plaintiff\u2019s intestate ? If it did, and if such negligence was the cause of the death of the engineer, Munro, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\u2019 \u201c Second. The court erred further in charging the jury as follows: \u2018 The charge in this complaint is that. this death was caused by the derailment of the engine, which took place because the plow was out ~ ? repair as described, or, at least, that the- defendant had not Used reasonable care in clearing its track, and that when the engineer in that condition arrived at this cut, two miles from Gray Cliff, the snow had accumulated to such an extent that the engine was thereby derailed, and that it was this negligence which eaused the death.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AvC\">\u201cThird. The court erred further in charging the jury as follows: \u2018 Many States have different laws. The law in this State until recently was that only $5000 could be given in a case of death. It has lately been increased to $10,000.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\">\u201cFourth. The court erred further in charging the jury as follows : \u2018 If you believe from all the evidence in the case that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then it is for you to determine what compensation you will give for the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. . The law of Montana limits it to such an amount as you think it would be proper under alT circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>stances of the case, and that is the law which will govern in this case.\u2019.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-4\">\u201c Fifth. The court erred further in refusing to give to the jury the following request tendered by defendant\u2019s counsel: \u2018 You, the jury, are instructed to find a verdict for the defendant.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\">Sixth. The court erred further in refusing to give to the jury the following request tendered by defendant\u2019s counsel: \u00a3 The laws of Minnesota limit the amount of damages to be recovered in this case to five thousand dollars.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-8\">\u201c Seventh. The court erred further in refusing to. give to the jury the following request tendered by defendant\u2019s counsel : \u00a3 The court instructs the jury that unless they find that it was customary for defendant company to send a snow-plow in advance of the trains running east from Livingston during storms of this character, and that unless, further, .the accident occurred by reason of the negligent and careless failure of the defendant to send such snow-plow in advance, they will find for the defendant.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-9\">\u201c Eighth. The court erred further in refusing to give to the jury the following request tendered' by defendant\u2019s counsel: \u00a3 The court instructs the jury that, unless they find that .the defendant carelessly and negligently furnished to the deceased engineer a plow attached to his engine, the iron 'bolts and rods of which were broken, imperfect, and insufficient, and that - by. reason of which. condition the said plow was loose and insufficiently secured to the pilot of said engine, and that when the said engine struck the snow at the cut, as testified to, the pilot plow of said engine, by reason- of its said broken, loose, and imperfect condition, did ride upon the accumulated snow and ice at said cut, and that thereby the said engine was thrown upon the track, the jury will find for the defendant.\u2019 \u201d .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-11\"><em>Mr. James McNaught, Mr. A. H. Garland, </em>and <em>Mr. H. J. May </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-12\">The issue the defendant was obliged to meet in the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>bar under the pleadings was, that the defendant had negligently furnished the plaintiff-with an engine with a defective \u201c pilot-plow,\u201d and that this- defect in the pilot-plow was rendered dangerous by failure of defendant to keep its track clear from snow and ice. It was not .contended by plaintiff either that the defective pilot-plow could have occasioned the accident except in conjunction with the accumulation of snow and ice, or the accumulation of snow and ice on the track could have occasioned it except in conjunction with the defective pilot-plow. They were inseparably joined both in the complaint and in the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-4\">The evidence shows clearly that Munro had full knowledge of the storm, of the general condition of the track, and that his means of knowing of the necessity of sending a snow-plow ahead of his train were as full and complete as the defendant\u2019s. He had been on this particular run for a number of years, he was a capable engineer, familiar with the country, and he kn\u00e9w that no snow-plow had been sent ahead of his train. It is an established rule on this subject that a servant who has a reasonable opportunity to inform himself of defects, is presumed, by remaining in the company\u2019s employ to have assumed the risk of them. Pierce on Railroads, <em>379; </em>Thompson on Negligence, 1008.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">Upon the pleadings and upon the 'evidence, or upon either of both, the question of negligence on the part of the company in not sending a'snow-plough in advance of the train or in allowing the sn\u00f3w and ice' to accumulate upon its track should be eliminated from the case as an independent factor upon which plaintiff'could recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">So it is insisted that the law upon the facts of this case is decidedly with the road, without going over distinctly and separately the different errors specified in the record, and the court should have directed the jury to find for the road as requested by it. The case when examined in the light of the authorities, is sufficiently discussed upon its merits, and there is left but one more proposition to place before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">The trial court- erred in refusing to instruct the jury, as-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>asked by the road, \u201cthat the laws of Minnesota limit the amount of damages to be recovered in this case to $5000.\u201d Instead of that the court told the jury the recovery should be estimated under the laws of Montana, where Munro was killed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-4\">It seems this action could have been brought in either Montana or Minnesota. The party had his selection as to the forum; that being so, it is but right and proper he should have only the remedy afforded by the law of the forum of his selection. Wharton, Conflict of Law, \u00a7\u00a7 479, 747-754; Gould\u2019s Pleading, 104-112, 131, <em>et seq.; </em>Story, Conflict of Law, \u00a7\u00a7 556, <em>et seq.; Nonce </em>v. <em>Richmond &amp; Danville Rail</em>road, 33 Fed.

The law of the Territory of Montana at the tin\u00bb'' provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">\u201c Where the death of a person not being a minor is caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another his heirs or personal representatives may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death, or if such person be employed by another person who is responsible for his action, then also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>against such other, person. In every action under this and the preceding section such damages may be given as under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u201d (Section 14, title II, chapter I, first division of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Territory of Montana.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Under the law of Minnesota, when the death occurred, the limit of recovery in case of death was $5000, but at the time of the trial of the case in the court below this limit had been increased to $10,000 by amendment of the Minnesota statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The question which those assignments of errors present is, was the amount of damage to be controlled by the law of the place of employment and where the accident occurred, or by the law of the forum in which the suit was pending ? In the case of <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railway </em>Company, reported in 81 Minnesota, 11, which involved the question of whether the courts of Minnesota would enforce and apply to a suit in that State for a cause of action originating in Iowa a law of the State of Iowa making railroad corporations liable for damages sustained by its employes in consequence of the neglect of fellow-servants, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cThe statute of another State has, of course, no extraterritorial force, but rights acquired under it will always, in comity, be enforced, if not against the public policy of the laws of the former. In such cases the law of the place where the right was acquired, or the liability was incurred, will govern as to the <em>right of action; </em>while all that pertains merely to the <em>remedy </em>will be controlled by the law of the State where the action is brought. And we think the principle is the same, whether the right of action be <em>ex contractu </em>or <em>ex delicto.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201cThe defendant admits the general rule to be as thus stated, but contends that as to statutory actions like the present, it is subject, to the qualification that, to sustain the action, the law of the forum and the law of the place where the right of action accrued must concur in holding that the act done gives a right of action. We admit that some text-writers\u2014 notably, Borer on Interstate Law \u2014 seem to lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>down this rule, but the authorities cited generally fail to sustain it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201cBut it by no means follows that, hecause the statute of one State differs from the law of another State, therefore it would be held contrary to the policy of the laws of the latter State. Every day our courts are enforcing rights under foreign contracts where the <em>lex loci contractus </em>and the <em>lex fori </em>are altogether different, and yet we construe these contracts and enforce rights under them according to their force and effect under the laws of the State where made. To justify a court in refusing to enforce a right of action which accrued under the law of another State, because against the policy of our laws, it must appear that it is against good morals or natural justice, or that, for some other such reason, the enforcement of it would be prejudicial to the general interests of our own citizens. If the State of Iowa sees fit to impose this obligation upon those operating railroads within her bounds, and to make it a condition of the employment of those who enter their service, we- s\u00e9e nothing in such a law repugnant either to good-morals or natural justice, or prejudicial to the interests of our. own citizens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">This opinion of the Supreme Court of Minnesota is in .accord with the rule announced by Chief Justice Marshall in <em>The Antelope, </em>10 Wheat. 66. In referring to that case in <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Railway </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>145 U. S. 593, the court said: \u201cThe'courts of no country execute the penal laws of another. But we have held that that rule cannot be invoked as applied to a statute of this kind, which merely authorizes a civil action to recover damages for a civil injury.\u201d The rule thus enunciated had been adopted in previous cases, and has since been approved by this court. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Condry, </em>1 How. 28; <em>The China, </em>7 Wall. 53, 64; <em>Dennick </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>103 U. S. 11; <em>The Scotland, </em>105 U. S. 24, 29; <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill, </em>146 U. S. 657, 670. Indeed, in <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for the court, said: \u201c The question, however, is one of general law, and we regard it as settled in <em>Dennick </em>v. <em>Railroad Co.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The contract of employment was made in Montana, and the accident occurred in that State, while the suit was brought in Minnesota. \"We think there was no error in holding that the right to recover was governed by the <em>lex loci, </em>and not by the <em>lex fori.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The fifth error assigned is the refusal to instruct the jury to. find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The evidence tended to show that Munro was an engineer in the employ of the railroad company at the town of Livingston ; that, as such engineer, he was driving engine No. 161 some time in the latter part of December; that whilst driving the engine he discovered that an appliance known as the \u201cpilot-plow,\u201d which was attached to the engine, was out of order, and in a dangerous condition. The purpose of such a plow is to push the snow from the track, and if not properly braced, as stated by one of the witnesses, it is likely to \u201c rise up and ride over the drift, instead of going through it, and the natural result would be to throw the engine trucks from the tracks.\u201d After Munro discovered that the plow was defective, he called the attention of the foreman of the shop and master mechanic to its condition. On or about the 2d day of January, Munro was taken sick and did not pursue his occupation until January 9, when he reported for duty. At about twelve o\u2019clock that night, while a severe snow storm was raging, Munro was sent for, by messenger, to take out a passenger train. The train was delayed in getting away from Livingston, and left that place about two o\u2019clock in the morning drawn by engine No. 161, with Munro in charge as engineer. At a place called Gray Cliff the engine, in passing through a cut, capsized, and Munro was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">There was no conflict of evidence as to the fact that the plow was defective some two weeks before the accident, when Munro so stated to the foreman and master mechanic, but there was a conflict upon the question whether or not it had been subsequently repaired. Testimony was adduced by the plaintiff tending to show that the necessary repairs had not \u25a0been made, and that at midnight on the 9th, when the engineer was called upon to take charge of the engine, the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>diti\u00f3n of the plow was quite as defective as it had been some two weeks before, when the engineer had made his report of its condition to the foreman. On the other hand, the defendant offered testimony which tended to show that the repairs had been made. It was proven that, at the time Munro was called upon to take charge of the engine, on the night of the 9th, the round-house was so full of steam that the engine could not have been critically examined by him. The presence of this steam was due to the fact that there was no heating apparatus in the round-house, and, therefore, steam was allowed to escap\u00e9 therein, in order to prevent the engines from freezing. There was some evidence that the effect of the defective pilot-plow would be to throw the train from the track whenever the engine struck an accumulation of snow which had been in any way impacted, the resistance \u00f3f the snow having the effect of pushing the defective plow up and thus derailing the engine. On the other hand, there was other evidence that such a result could not have followed from the defect in the plow.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Under this condition of proof it is clear that the instruction was rightfully refused. The. obligation of the employer to furnish to his employe sound implements is established. <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>100 U. S. 213, 218; <em>Union Pacific Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>152 U. S. 681. And the fact that the engineer, when called upon at midnight on the 9th to perform duty, took the engine out under the conditions surrounding it in the round-house, implies no assumption by him of the risk of defective machinery. The proof showed, or tended to show, that notification by the engineer to. the foreman and master mechanic of the existence of the defect was given, some ten or twelve days before the accident, and that at the time there was an impression created in Munro\u2019s mind that it was to be remedied. It also shows that work of this character was usually done in the shops at Livingston, over which the foreman presided and in which the engine lay when the notice was given. From the time of the notice up to the time when the engineer was called upon to use the engine he was not on duty, but was absent on sick leave. As the employe had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>given notice of the defect to the proper officer whose duty it was to make the repairs, and the impression had been conveyed to him that these would be made, he had a right to assume that they had been made, and to act upon that assumption. The mere fact of his taking the engine out at midnight .under the circumstances did not of itself, unsupported by other proof, imply an assumption by him of the risk resulting from the dangerous and defective condition of the attachment to the engine. <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Railway </em>Co., 100 U. S. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The first assignment of error is, we think, without merit. The language of the charge complained of is: <em>a </em>Did it [the defendant company] fail to discharge any duty which the law imposed upon it for the safety of its employe, the plaintiffs intestate? If it did, and if such negligence was the cause of the death of the engineer, Munro, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\u201d Separated from the context this general language might' have misled, but when considered in proper connection with the rest of the instruction given, it could not have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The eighth error assigned was to a refusal of the court to give the following charge: \u201c The court instructs the jury that unless they find that the defendant carelessly and negligently furnished to the deceased engineer a plow attached to his engine, the iron bolts and rods of which were broken, imperfect, and insufficient, and that by reason of which condition the said plow was loose and insufficiently secured to the pilot of said engine, and that when the said engine struck the snow at the cut, as testified to, the pilot-plow of said engine, by reason of its said broken, loose, and imperfect condition, did ride upon the accumulated snow and ice at said cut, and that thereby the said engine was thrown from the track, the jury will find for the defendant.\u201d The charge -which the court gave was substantially as- requested, and correctly stated the law. It was as follows : \u201c The court instructs you that unless you find that the defendant negligently and carelessly furnished to the deceased engineer a plow attached to his engine, the iron bolts and rods of whicl were broken, imper-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>feet, and insufficient, and by reason of said imperfect condition, when the engine struck the snow at the cut, as testified to, the engine and tender were derailed by reason thereof, which caused the accident in question, then the defendant would be entitled to a verdict. The claim is that the snow had accumulated to such an extent in that cut that when the engine struck it, the plow being in that condition in which it was, it was unable to clear the track, the accumulation of snow being so great, and that, as described by some witnesses, it rode up and threw the engine off the track from the fact that the front trucks of the engine .could not ride over it. I instruct you that unless- the cause of this derailment and the throwing over the engine was the imperfect condition of this plow, that it could not clear the cut from the snow which had accumulated there, but the engine was thrown over and thereby death ensued \u2014 unless this is found to' be true to the satisfaction of the jury, the defendant would be entitled to' a verdict.\u201d We can see no material variance between the charge requested and the charge which was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The seventh error assigned is to the refusal of the court to instruct the jury \u201c that unless they find that it was customary for defendant company to send a snow-plow in advance of the trains running east from Livingston during storms of this character, and that unless, further, the accident occurred by reason of the negligent and careless failure of the defendant to send such snow-plow in advance, they will find for the defendant.\u201d This instruction was, of course, justly refused, because it implied that the defendant was entitled to a verdict, if, contrary to its custom, it had not sent a snow-plow in advance, of the train, without reference to the defective condition of the pilot-plow, which was the cause of action upon which the plaintiff relied. Indeed, although the petition charged negligence on the part of the defendant in failing to send a snow-plow ahead of the train, the action, as stated in the complaint, was predicated upon the defect in the machinery, or pilot-plow \u2014 the failure to send the snow-plow being alleged as a mere incident, or remote cause of damage. And this distinction was elucidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>with great clearness in the charge of the court. It nowhere indicated that there could be any liability on the part of the defendant arising from the failure to send a snow-plow ahead of the train, as a distinct and substantive cause of action. It referred to the failure to send a snow-plow ahead of the train merely as the reason why it was necessary to have the pilot-plow attached to the engine. The court said : \u201c The charge in this complaint is that this death was caused by the derailment of the engine, which took place because the plow was out of repair as described, or at least that the defendant had not used reasonable care in clearing its tracks, and that when the engineer with the engine in that condition arrived at this cut, two miles from Gray Cliff, the snow had accumulated to such an extent that the engine was thereby derailed, and that it was this negligence on the part of the defendant that caused the death.\u201d In other words, throughout the whole charge, the court instructed the jury that the liability, if any, must result from the defective condition of the machinery or pilot-plow of the engine; and where it referred to the failure to send a snow-plow ahead of the train as an act of negligence, treated it as negligence giving rise only remotely, and not proximately, to the injury; the proximate cause being the defective machinery, and the remote accumulation of snow, which rendered the use of the engine unsafe because of the defect in the pilot-plow attached thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-5\">Mk.
