What real estate that the parties to this suit owned <em>and </em>undivided interest in.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">\u201c2.

Turner, commissioner in chancery, for report.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Commissioner Turner, in execution of the order of reference, proceeded to take the depositions of Mrs. Martha Joyce and others. The notices given to- take these depositions are not in the record. The depositions-returned with the report, however, contain this statement in the caption: \u201cTaken * * * pursuant to the notice given to all interested parties,\u201d and this statement in the certificate appended to the depositions: \u201cI * * * do hereby certify that the foregping depositions were duly taken * * * pursuant to the notice to all parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">.The report of Commissioner Turner is dated May 17, 1928, but when it was filed does not appear; With certain immaterial omissions- made for the sake of brevity, it reads: \u201cI, * * *, desire to report * * * that after giving notice to all of the resident defendants and to the plaintiffs that I proceeded to take, state and report the following account, to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">\u201c (1) What real estate that the parties to this suit own an undivided interest in.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">\u201cAns. I find that said parties to this suit own an undivided interest in and to 282 acres and 18% acres, more or less. The said tracts of land located in the county of Patrick; in Mayo' River district and charged for taxation in the name of Christopher Zigler, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">' \u201c(2) The name of all of the heirs interest in said real estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">\u201cAns. I desire ,to refer to the evidence of Mr. \"H. F. Zigler, <em>et als., </em>for the names and address- of the heirs of Christopher Zigler, deceased. The depositions are herewith filed and made a part of this report.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">\u201c(3) Any liens against the lands or against any parties to this suit?\u201d :</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201cAns. I found none. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\u201c(4) By reference to the depositions filed in' this cause it will be seen that the said lands cannot be divided in kind between the heirs without material injury, and it will be to the interest of the parties to this suit for the said tracts of land to be sold and for the proceeds of sale, after the payment of the cost, to be divided among the heirs as required by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The notices for the taking of this account' are not in the record and nothing appears with reference thereto, except the recitals above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The depositions taken by the commissioner contain testimony to the following effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Christopher Zigler left two1 children surviving him, Leonard and Richard. Leonard never married, and died more than thirty years ago. Richard Zigler married, and died (when does not appear), leaving surviving him four children, Kit, Lucy, Nannie and Mary. \u201cThey are all dead and they left no children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">There was no evidence returned by the commissioner as to whether Christopher Zigler, Leonard Zigler, or Richard Zigler died testate or intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"AkU\">Christopher Zigler had two brothers, Ruben Zigler and Isaac Zigler, sometimes called Ike or Mike. Each of these brothers married, and died leaving descendants. There is no testimony as to either the dates, or the order of their several deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Ruben Zigler and Isaac Zigler have a large number of living descendants, many of whom are named and their courses of descent given. But the evidence is so incomplete that it is impossible to make up from it a statement which can be said with any certainty to1 contain, either by name or designation, all the descendants of Ruben and Isaac Zigler who are entitled to an interest in the land here involved. Perhaps it is for this reason that Commissioner Turner did not attempt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>On June 4, 1928, the court entered its decree, the material parts of which read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\u201cThis day this cause came on again to be further heard on the papers formerly read, the decrees heretofore entered and the argument of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\u201cUpon consideration of all of which and it appearing to the court from the report filed by Miss Alma N. Turner, one of the commissioners in chancery of this court, that the lands mentioned in the bill and proceedings cannot be divided in kind among the parties to- this suit without material injury, and no-exceptions having been filed to- said report, the same is hereby approved and confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">\u201cIt is ordered, adjudged and decreed that R. E. Woolwine and J. D. Humphries be, and they are hereby, appointed special commissioners and receivers in this cause to make sale of said lands upon the following terms and conditions:\u201d (Here follows the terms and conditions of sale.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Special Commissioners Woolwine and Humphries made sale under the decree of June 4, 1928, and reported to the court that acting under said decree they \u201cdid on the 1st day of August, 1928, sell the said tracts of land according to the terms and conditions as mentioned in the said decree\u201d * * * and that \u201cthe said land was finally sold to- J. Nick Brown, at the price of $2,950.00,\u201d and recommend the confirmation of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">No- other description is given in the above decree or report of the property sold, other than is contained in the above quotations.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">By its decree entered September 6, 1928, the court confirmed said report, and directed Woolwine, as special commissioner, to collect the purchase price and execute a deed to the purchaser, Brown. The decree then reads: \u201cAnd the said special commissioner and receiver will pay first the costs o-f this suit, including a fee of $150.00 and $5.00 for deed and said fees to be taxed as cost of this suit, and second, taxes and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>residue thereof disbursed according to- law.\u201d The special commissioner is also directed to report his acts to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">No determination of the parties owning the land in question or entitled to receive the proceeds thereof appears to have been made by the court, except in so. far as the confirmation of Miss Turner\u2019s report can be said to have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">By decree entered December 6, 1928, the court entered its order directing that the sums, ranging from $4.63 to $19.00, due to the eleven Plasters and Barbour children, who are infant complainants, and to Frank Amos, Paul Amos, Lillie May Amos, Broadus Amos, Wilmeth Atkins, and Harry, Oscar, Lottie and Annie Zigler, infant defendants of Isaac and Ruben Zigler, be paid to them or their fathers without the intervention of a guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The special commissioner does not appear to have made any report to* the court of his acts under the decrees, of September 6 and December 6, 1928, but from other proceedings had after the filing of the cross-bill, hereinafter mentioned, it appears that he collected the purchase money, executed a deed to J. Nick Brown, and disbursed the proceeds of the sale, less costs, to eighty-five persons descended from Isaac and Ruben Zigler, a number of whom are neither made parties defendant by name in the bill filed by Mrs. Plasters nor mentioned in the evidence returned by Commissioner Turner, which is all the evidence taken in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In November, 1929, Mrs. Sadie M. Bowden filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the Circuit Court of Patrick county what she denominates a petition and cross-bill in the said chancery cause of <em>Mrs. Eliza Plasters and others </em>v. <em>Mrs. Lent Zigler and others.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The opening paragraph in this cross-bill reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">\u201cThe petition and cross-bill of Sadie M.

Matthews, being all the children and heirs-at-law of George Matthews, dec\u2019d, respectfully showeth unto your honor the following facts as the ground of this petition and cross-bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">However, there is no further allegation or proof of any such assignments to Mrs. Sadie M. Bowden.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">After alleging the proceedings had on the original bill filed by Mrs. Plasters, <em>et als., </em>the cross-bill, alleges the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The 282-acre tract which the court sold to J. Nick Brown in the said suit of <em>Zigler </em>v. <em>Zigler </em>was owned by Richard Mills, whose daughter, Sarah, married Christopher Zigler.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Richard Mills left surviving him as his heirs at law four children, Sarah Zigler (wife of Christopher Zigler), Elizabeth Abingdon (widow of John Abingdon), Austice Murphy (wife of Jesse Murphy,'Jr.), and William'Mills.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">After the death of Richard Mills, all his said heirs at law, except Sarah Zigler, by deed dated June 11, 1842, recorded November 14, 1842, conveyed to Christopher Zigler, Richard Zigler and Leonard Zigler (the last two- being sons'of Christopher Zigler) the 282-acre tract here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The 18)4-acre tract which the court sold to J. Nick Brown in the suit of <em>Zigler </em>v. <em>Zigler </em>was conveyed to Christopher Zigler by James W. Athey and wife by deed dated May 8, 1858, recorded June 7, 1858.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Christopher Zigler and Sarah Mills, his wife, both died intestate, leaving surviving them as their only heirs at law their two sons, Richard and Leonard, in whom the whole estate in both tracts of land vested by descent from their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Richard Zigler married Catherine Sidney Abingdon, daugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ter of John Abingdon and Elizabeth-Abingdon, his wife (who was a daughter of Richard Mills, the father of Sarah Mills Zigler); and died intestate, leaving surviving him his widow and four children, Kit, Lucy, Nannie and Mary, as his only heirs at law, all of whom outlived their mother, Catherine Sidney Abingdon Zigler.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Later Leonard Zigler died unmarried and intestate, after the death of his brother Richard, leaving as his only heirs at law the four children of his brother Richard.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Subsequently, Kit, Lucy aiid Nannie Zigler all died when over twenty-one years of age, unmarried, intestate and without issue, leaving-their sister Mary surviving them. Whereupon the whole estate in both tracts of land vested in her by descent from her parents and from her. brother- and sisters,</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Mary Zigler never married,-and died in 1926, being over twenty-one years of age, intestate and without issue, whereupon the two tracts of land passed one-half to her paternal kindred and one-half to her maternal kindred.'</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Mary Zigler\u2019s mother and all her maternal grandparents predeceased her. She had five maternal uncles and aunts all whom predeceased her; two-, Lucy Abingdon and Mary Abingdon East, had no descendants living at Mary Zigler\u2019s death; three, Sarah Abingdon Matthews, William Abingdon and Nannie Abingdon Mitchell, had descendants living at the death of Mary Zigler.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">At the time of her death Mary Zigler had only seven (7) maternal first cousins who were living or had descendants living. Those living were (1) John D. Matthews (son of Sarah Abingdon Matthews), (2) Lucy Abingdon (daughter of William Abingdon), (3) Ella Mitchell Craig, and (4) Richard D. Mitchell (the last two being children of Nannie Abingdon Mitchell). The three who had died were1 (5) George Matthews, (6) Celia Matthews Marshall, and (7) James W. Matthews, all three being children of Sarah Abingdon Matthews.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">George Matthews, dec\u2019d, left six (6) children: .Mrs. Carlton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Crews, Mrs. L. H. Houchins, G. A. Matthews, W. J. Matthews, Harold W. Matthews, Robert G. Matthews.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Celia Matthews Marshall, dec\u2019d, left three (3) children: Jim Marshall, G. R. Marshall, and W. H. Marshall.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">James W. Matthews, dec\u2019d, left seven (7) children: Mary Matthews, Catherine Matthews, Celia Matthews Gordon, <em>Sadie Matthews </em>Bowden, Robert Matthews, Warren Matthews, and B. K. Matthews.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Therefore, one-half of the 282-acre tract and of the 1824-acre tract has descended to and is now vested in her maternal kindred above named.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Mary Zigler\u2019s father and all her paternal grandparents predeceased her. She had only one uncle or aunt on her father\u2019s side, Leonard Zigler, and he predeceased her without issue. Therefore, the moiety of Mary Zigler\u2019s estate which passed to her <em>paternal </em>kindred, passed one-half b&gt; the kindred of her grandfather, Christopher Zigler, and one-half, to&gt; the kindred of her grandmother, Sarah Mills Zigler.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Christopher Zigler had only two brothers or sisters, Richard Zigler and Isaac (or Mike) Zigler, and their descendants are, so far as the complainant in the cross-bill knows, correctly set-forth in the original bill, but instead of being entitled to the whole interest in the two tracts of land here involved they were and are entitled to only one-half of one-half (one-fourth) undivided interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Sarah Mills Zigler, the grandmother of Mary Zigler, had only three sisters or brothers, (1) William Mills, (2) Elizabeth Abingdon, and (3) A'ustice Murphy, all of whom predeceased Mary Zigler, and their descendants are entitled to one-half of one-half (one-fourth) of the two tracts of land here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">\u25a0 Austice Murphy and William Mills had no descendants living at the death of Mary Zigler. The descendants of Elizabeth Abingdon living at the death of Mary Zigler are the same persons hereinbefore set out as the heirs at law of Mary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Zigler on her maternal side, and, therefore, they take one-half of the two tracts of land as maternal heirs of Mary Zigler and one-fourth thereof as paternal heirs of Mary Zigler, being-entitled thus in the aggregate to three-fourths thereof. .</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The cross-bill then alleges that none of the parties who are therein alleged to be entitled to the one-half interest in said lands, which passed to Mary Zigler\u2019s maternal kindred, and also to the one-fourth interest therein, which passed to the kindred of her paternal grandmother, were ever made parties defendant to the bill filed by Mrs. Eliza Plasters and others against Mrs. Lent Zigler and others, and that they are not bound in any way by the decrees entered in said suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The cross-bill prays:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">A. That the following persons be made parties defendant, to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">(1) \u201cAll the parties, both plaintiffs and defendants, in the original suit.\u201d The names or designations of such parties are not, however, set out in any way other than in the above quoted language.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">(2) J. Nick Brown and Nannie Brown, R. E. Woolwine and J. D. Humphreys, special commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">(3) Jim Marshall, G. R. Marshall and. W. H. Marshall.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">(4) Lucy Abingdon and all other heirs of William Abingdon, dec\u2019d, whose names, ages and residences are unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">(5) The heirs at law of Austice Murphy, dec\u2019d, the heirs at law of William Mills, dec\u2019d, and the heirs at law of <em>Mary </em>Abingdon East, \u201cwhose n\u00e1mes, ages and residences are unknown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">(6) \u201cAll other heirs, if any, of Elizabeth Mills Abingdon, dec\u2019d, whose names, ages and residences are unknown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">B. That J. M. Hooker, a discreet attorney at law, be appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>for all such of the following unknown defendants as may be under twenty-one years of age, to-wit, of the infant descendants and heirs at law of Elizabeth Mills Abingdon, dec\u2019d, Austice Mills Murphy, dec\u2019d, William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Mills, dec\u2019d, <em>Nancy </em>Abingdon East; dec\u2019d, William Abingdon, dec\u2019d. \u2022 .:\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">C. That R. E. Woolwine, a discreet attorney \u00e1t l\u00e1w, be assigned as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for all such of the descendants and heirs at law, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of'Ruben Zigler and of Isaac (or Mike) Zigler as may be under twenty-one .years of age, whose names, ages and residences are unknown; and for Dovie Plasters, Hilmer Plasters,Mary Plasters, Elsie Plasters, James Plasters, Akers Plasters,' and Charles Plasters, infants; for Una Barbour, Anna Barbour, Jim Barbour, and Billy Barbour, infants; and for Oscar Zigler, Lottie Zigler and Annie Zigler, Frank Amos, Paul Amos, Wilmeth Atkins, Lillie May Amos and Broadus Amos ; and for all the infant heirs of Leonard' Zigler, dec\u2019d, William Zigler, dec\u2019d, Mrs. Zigler Beck, dec\u2019d, Michael Zigler, dec\u2019d; Tom Zigler, dec\u2019d, Bettie Carroll, dec\u2019d, Eliza Glid\u00e9well, dec\u2019d, Christopher Zigler, dec\u2019d, and Richard Zigler, dec\u2019d.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">. D. That all proper accounts and -inquiries be directed and taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">That \u201cthe said 282 acres and 18?4 acres \"of land that was owned by Mary Zigler,' d\u00e9c\u2019d, at the time of her death be sold for partition\u201d and the net proceeds distributed as follows: (1) one-half to \u201cthe descendants and heirs at law of the brothers and sisters of her mother, Catherine Sidney Zigler, dec\u2019d, (2) one-fourth to the descendants of Ruben Zigler, dec\u2019d, and Isaac (Mike) Zigler, dec\u2019d, brothers of her grandfather, Christopher Zigler, \u201cor to- their alienee, J. Nick Brown; and (3) one-fourth to the \u201cchildren and descendants\u201d of the brother- and sisters of Sarah Mills Zigler, dec\u2019d, the grandmother of Mary Zigler, dec\u2019d.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">That R. E. Woolwine and J. D. Humphreys, special commissioners, be directed to make such adjustments with J. Nick Brown and the heirs of Ruben and Isaac Zigler as the court may deem just, right and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">That the deed from Woolwine, special commissioner, to J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Nick Brown be set aside and annulled as to an undivided three-fourths\u2019 interest in said two tracts of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The cross-bill also contains a prayer for the allowance of an attorney\u2019s fee and for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The memorandum for issuance of process on said cross-bill filed with the clerk concluded with the following directions:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\u201cDeliver subpoenas for Mrs. Eliza Plasters, Mrs. Mattie Fulcher, R. E. Woolwine, special commissioner, and R. E. Woolwine as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the several infants herein above mentioned as having him as their guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and J. M. Hooker, as guardian <em>ad litem, </em>for the several infants herein above mentioned as having him for their guardian <em>ad litem, </em>John Barbour, Dillard Barbour, George Barbour, Mrs. Jennie Stone, Minnie Laymons, Geo. Laymons, Hardy (or Harry) Zigler, and Hobart Zigler fa\u00bb the sheriff of Patrick county.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\u201cDeliver subpoenas for James Marshall of Spencer, Va., Ruben Zigler of Bassetts, Va., Mrs. Lent Zigler and Reuben T. Zigler of Edgewood, Va., Vergie Zigler and Harry Zigler of Fieldale, Va., Sallie Kate Zigler and G. R. Zigler of Stanley-town, Va., Vergie Stewart of Preston, Va., fa\u00bb the sheriff of Henry county.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">\u201cDeliver subpoenas for G. R. Marshall of Victoria, Va., to the sheriff of Lunenberg county, Va.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The clerk issued subpoenas on this memorandum on November 13, 1929, requiring the defendants therein named to appear at the rules to be held on the fourth Monday in November, 1929, \u201cto answer a petition and cross-bill in chancery, exhibited against- them <em>et als. </em>* * * in the chancery cause of <em>Mrs. Eliza Plasters, et als. </em>v. <em>Lent Zigler, et als., </em>now pending in the Circuit Court of Patrick county by Sadie M. Bowden.\u201d These subpoenas were returned executed upon all the defendants mentioned in the three paragraphs above quoted <em>except </em>Mrs. Jennie Stone,.Geo. Laymons; Minnie-Laymons, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Hardy (or Harry) Zigler. The subpoena was also- returned executed upon A. L. Barbour, Oscar Zigler, and Lottie Zigler.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">So far as the record discloses, however, no order appointing a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for any of -the infants made parties defendant in the cross-bill was ever entered either by the clerk or by the court at rules, nor is any answer filed for any of them by any person purporting to1 act as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">On November 15, 1929, F. P. Burton and S. A. Thompson, attorneys for Mrs. Sadie M. Bowden, made an affidavit for an order of publication before the clerk as to' the unknown and nonresident defendants mentioned in the cross-bill, and on November 15, 1929, the clerk entered an order of p\u00fcblication against such unknown and nonresident defendants, and the decree of the court entered June 10, 1930, recites that the cause came on fi&gt; be heard1 upon the \u201corder of publication as to all the defendants named in said petition and cross-bill duly published and completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">On April 12, 1930, the court entered the following decree :</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">\u201cThis day this cause came on again to be heard on the papers formerly read, the decrees heretofore entered. The answer and cross-bill Mrs Sadie M. Bowden, <em>et als., </em>filed at rules, regular proceedings thereon, order of publication duly completed as to said answer and cross-bill, and set for hearing, the motion of the defendants in said cross-bill to strike out the same, and the argument of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">\u201cUpon consideration whereof, without passing on the motion to strike out the said answer and cross-bill, and without passing on any question raised by the pleadings in this cause, it is ordered that this cause be set for decision and decree in vacation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">At the June term, 1930, the following answers were filed: An answer styled in the opening paragraph thereof: \u201cThe answer of Eliza Plasters, Mrs. Mattie J. Fulcher, John Barbour, A. L. Barbour, Dillard Barbour, George Barbour, Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Jennie Stone, Geo. Laytnons, Hardy Zigler, Ruben Zigler, Eliza Carter, Martha Joyce, Hugh Zigler, John Zigler, William Zigler, Mike Zigler, James Zigler, Mrs. Lizzie Golden, Will Blidwell, Charlie Crutchfield, Charlie Carroll, Mary Carroll, Isaac Zigler, Walter Zigler, John Zigler, and all of the other plaintiffs in the original suit.\u201d This answer adopts the answer filed by J. D. Humphreys and R. E. Woolwine, and then reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">\u201cYour said respondents contend that the order of publication that was duly published and posted as required by law <em>as </em>broad enough to include all of the unknown heirs of Christopher Zigler, Richard Zigler, Leonard Zigler, Nannie Zigler, and Maty Zigler. The said Sadie M. Bowden, <em>et als., </em>are bound by the said order of publication and none of them have any standing in a court of equity and their petition should be dismissed :</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\u201cThat the 18^-acre tract was conveyed to Christopher Zigler by J. W. Athey, and an order of publication was duly issued, published, and posted as to all of the unknown heirs of Christopher Zigler, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">\u201cThat the 282-acre tract of land was conveyed to Christopher Zigler, Leonard Zigler and Richard Zigler, and an order of publication was duly issued, published, and posted as to all of the unknown heirs of the said Christopher Zigler, Leonard Zigler and Richard Zigler. The said Nannie and Mary Zigler, as daughters of Richard Zigler, deceased, were covered by the order of publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">\u201cThe said respondents deny each and every allegation in the petition and cross-bill not in keeping with this answer, and call for proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">\u201cYour said respondents do not agree with counsel for Sadie M. Bowden, <em>et als., </em>to the course of descent as mentioned in their petition and cross-bill and contend that the course of descent is not properly stated. The petitioners should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>charged with their part of-the funds-received from-:-. that was used by and for Mary\u2019and Nancy Zigler.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">, \u201cIt is the contention of' your said respondents that the petition of Sadie M. Bowden, <em>et als., </em>should be dismissed with their reasonable cost by them expended -in this behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">J. Nick Brown filed his answer alleging .that the sale to him Was valid 'and binding upon the complainant\u2019, and all the defendants mentioned in the cross-bill were properly before the court, because \u201call of the unknown heirs at law of Christopher Zigler, Ruben Zigler, Isaac Zigler,- Leonard Zigler, Richard Zigler, Nanie Zigler, <em>et als., </em>were proceeded against as provided by law\u201d in the original suit; and that the cross-bill should be. dismissed-as to him for. this reason, and also\u2019because a cross-bill can be filed only by leave of court, and this cross-bill Was filed without first getting leave of the court. This answer admits that there was no order of publication against the un-. known heirs of Mary Zigler by the description of unknown heirs of Mary Zigler, but alleges that in as much as the order\u2019 of publication was against the unknown heirs of Christopher Zigler and Richard Zigler, the father of Mary Zigler, and the unknown heirs of Nannie Zigler, sister of Mary Zigler, that' it necessarily included the heirs of Mary Zigler.-</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">J. D. Humphreys and R. E. Woolwine, special commis-; sioners, filed their answer praying the dismissal of the cross-bill, \u201cbecause all of the unknown heirs of Christopher Zigler, Leonard Zigler, and Richard Zigler, <em>et als., </em>were made defendants to the said proceedings and were duly proceeded against as expressly authorized by section 6069 of the Code of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">No evidence was introduced to substantiate the allegations\u2019 of the cross-bill as to the relationship of the parties alleged in the cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Certain affidavits made after the entry of the final decree here appealed from are tendered to this court on this appeal. These affidavits relate to how a final decree upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>merits of the cross-bill came to be entered without any evidence having been taken to- substantiate the allegations of the relationship of the several parties to Mary Zigler and the course of descents to and from her. These affidavits constitute no part of the record in the cause, and cannot be here considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On June 10, 1930, the court entered a filial decree on said cross-bill. This decree reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\u201cThe court doth hereby grant permission to Mrs. Sadie M. Bowden, <em>et als., </em>to file their petition and cross-bill in this cause, as a <em>mine pro tunc </em>order granting said permission the same <em>to be enforce and effect </em>as of the date on which the process on the said petition and cross-bill was issued. * * * And the court being of the opinion that the plaintiffs in the petition and cross-bill of Sadie M. Bowden, <em>et als., </em>were clearly within their rights in filing same, and doth overrule the motions to dismiss the same, and doth decide that they are now properly before the court. '</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\u201cUpon consideration of all the pleadings before the court, and exhibits therewith filed, the court is of the opinion that the course of descent of the-estate of Mary Zigler, deceased, is as set forth in the petition and cross-bill of Mrs. Sadie M. Bowden and others filed herein, so that, under the proceedings heretofore had in this cause one-fourth of said estate is now owned by J. Nick Brown and the remaining three-fourths thereof belongs to the maternal kindred of the said Mary Zigler, as set forth in. said petition and cross-bills, doth so decide and declare.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">\u201cThe court doth further adjudge, order, and decree'that the said J. Nick Brown be, and he is hereby, given the option of paying three-fourths of the- purchase price of said land as heretofore reported, to-wit: $2,950.00, less the lawful costs accrued up to the filing of the petition of Mrs. Sadie M. Bowden and others, to the attorneys representing the maternal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>kindred of the said Mary Zigler, deceased, as set forth in said petition, within' forty days from the rising of this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The decree then provides: If J. Nick Brown shall fail to pay three-fourths of the net proceeds of said $2,950.00 to the attorneys representing the maternal kindred of Mary Zigler, deceased, as set forth in said petition and cross-bill, within forty days, then F. P. Burton and S. A!. Thompson, who- are appointed special commissioners for the purpose, shall \u201cexecute a deed conveying to the said J. Nick -Brown the three-fourths interest of the maternal kindred of Mary Zigler, deceased, as set forth in said petition and cross-bill of Sadie M. Bowden and others, with special warranty of title.\u201d But if J. Nick Brown fail so- to do, then Burton and Thompson, special commissioners, shall sell the two tracts of land here involved at public auction upon the terms set forth in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The decree then proceeds to decree to J. Nick Brown several judgments against the eighty-five descendants of Ruben and Isaac Zigler to whom Commissioner Wool wine had distributed the net proceeds of the sale to J. Nick Brown, and to- decree the payment of costs, including an attorney\u2019s fee to counsel for Mrs. Bowden and certain allowances to- Mrs. Bowden for her expenses in prosecuting her cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">From this decree J. Nick Brown appeals, and assigns a number of errors, which are so interdependent that in the view which we take of this case we shall not discuss them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">If the allegations contained in the so-called petition and cross-bill filed by Mrs-. Sadie Bowd\u2019en are true, the kindred of the mother of Mary Zigler are clearly entitled to' an one-half undivided interest in the two tracts of land here involved, and the kindred of the paternal grandmother of Mary Zigler are clearly entitled to an undivided one-fourth interest in said two tracts. None of these kindred of Mary Zigler were before the court on process served upon them, and we are of opinion that the order of publication published on the original bill is wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>insufficient to give the court jurisdiction to enter a decree <em>in rem </em>against them making sale of their interests in these lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"> It, therefore, follows that if the allegations of the bill be true, the decree of sale under which J. Nick Brown purchased these two tracts of land and the deed conveying them to him are void in so far as they affect undivided interests in these lands aggregating at least a three-fourths interest. But in the state of the pleadings in this cause, and in view of the facts that there are infant defendants to this cross-bill and also to the original bill, for none of whom a guardian <em>ad litem </em>has been appointed, and that many of those alleged to have an interest in said lands are before the court only upon order of publication, we are of opinion that the court erred in entering a decree upon the merits of the cross-bill without proof of the allegations therein contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> While the court had no power to permit the filing of the petition and cross-bill <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>this is immaterial. If the allegations of the so-called petition and cross-bill be true, Mrs. Bowden, or those claiming by, through, or under her, then had and still has the right to file an original bill attacking the validity of the decree under which these lands were sold to J. Nick Brown so fai* as the kindred of the mother and paternal grandmother of Mary Zigler are concerned, and to have the deed to him declared void as to them, and to have these lands sold for partition. While Mrs. Bowden denominates the pleading filed by her as a petition and cross-bill in the suit of <em>Plasters </em>v. <em>Zigler, </em>it introduces new parties and is in effect an original bill and should be so considered, though it partakes in some respects of the nature of a cross-bill, and leave of court was not required to file it.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The decree of June 10, 1930, will be reversed in tofi&gt;, and the cause remanded for such further proceedings to be had upon the so-called cross-bill as may be proper, not in conflict with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
