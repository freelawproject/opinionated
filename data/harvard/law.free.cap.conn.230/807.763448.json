The plaintiff, First Marine Corporation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appealed from the judgment of strict foreclosure rendered by the trial court following a determination of priority in which the trial court upheld the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien. The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and concluded that the mechanic\u2019s lien was invalid without the attachment containing the complete description of the property. <em>First Constitution Bank </em>v. <em>Harbor Village Ltd. Partnership, </em>31 Conn. App. 15, 622 A.2d 1063 (1993). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>The parties\u2019 stipulations and the evidence in the record reveal the following facts. First Constitution Bank (First Constitution), the predecessor in interest to the plaintiff, instituted the present action to recover sums due under a commercial revolving loan note. The note was secured by a mortgage on six contiguous parcels of land (parcels) that are located along the Mianus River on River Road in Greenwich and are owned by Harbor Village Limited Partnership (Harbor Village) and William O. Rockwood, Jr., trustee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The loan proceeds, in the amount of $21,500,000, were used to finance the construction of a marina facility and a dockominium at the site of the parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">On March 3, 1989, before the recording of the mortgage,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant began to render services and furnish materials in the construction and improvement of the parcels in connection with the marina and dockominium project. On April 16, 1990, the defendant timely filed a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien on the parcels with the Greenwich town clerk. The certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien described the property to which the lien attached as being \u201csituated in the Town of Greenwich, County of Fairfield and State of Connecticut, on a lot of land belonging to said Harbor Village Limited Partnership and William Rockwood, Jr., Trustee, and bounded as follows: <em>See Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 attached. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court found that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>attorney, who had prepared the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien, had also prepared Exhibit A<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to be attached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>to that certificate for filing in the town clerk\u2019s office and had personally delivered the certificate, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Exhibit A attached, to the sheriff, now deceased. The lien certificate that ultimately was recorded on the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>records, however, did not include Exhibit A,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, consequently, did not contain references to the boundaries and street addresses of the parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">Notwithstanding this omission, the Greenwich town clerk correctly noted the street location of the property in the grantor/grantee indices and indexed the lien under the appropriate headings for the defendant, Harbor Village and Rockwood. Additionally, Exhibit A was attached to the copies of the mechanic\u2019s lien certificate that were served on Harbor Village and Rockwood as owners of the parcels, in connection with the recording of the lien. Moreover, Exhibit A was attached to the lis pendens filed on the land records by the defendant in connection with an independent action to foreclose its mechanic\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, at all material times, neither Harbor Village nor Rockwood owned any other property in Greenwich other than the parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">By an amended complaint dated December 18,1991, following a default on the loan by Harbor Village, First Constitution instituted a foreclosure action to recover sums due under the loan. In response to First Constitution\u2019s complaint, the defendant claimed that its mechanic\u2019s lien took priority over the mortgage duly recorded by First Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>tiff, as successor in interest to First Constitution, filed a motion for determination of priority and for judgment of strict foreclosure, asserting that the defendant\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was defective and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s interest in the parcels, if any, was subsequent to that of First Constitution. Following a hearing on the motion, the trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was valid and, consequently, was prior in right to the mortgage recorded by First Constitution. Accordingly, the trial court found in favor of the defendant, rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure, and set law days in inverse order of priorities. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of the trial court. This appeal by the defendant followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The defendant claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that its certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien is invalid. It argues that the mechanic\u2019s lien is valid under General Statutes \u00a7 49-34<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> because the certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>cate of mechanic\u2019s lien was indexed correctly in the land records and was within the chain of title, and because the certificate, as recorded, referred to the omitted Exhibit A. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">It is well established that a mechanic\u2019s lien \u201cwill not be valid unless the person having such claim shall, within a stated time, lodge with the town clerk of the town in which said building is situated a certificate in writing, describing the premises, the amount claimed as a lien thereon, and the date of the commencement of the services or the furnishing of materials. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4135, 4136.\u201d <em>Tramonte </em>v. <em>Wilens, </em>89 Conn. 520, 523, 94 A. 978 (1915). We also have repeatedly stated, however, that, although a mechanic\u2019s lien is in derogation of the common law, we do not compel a strict construction of its requirements. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>61 Conn. 578, 585, 24 A. 1056 (1891). \u201cWe have long endorsed a policy favoring liberal construction of claimed inadequacies in certificates of mechanic\u2019s liens in order to achieve the remedial purposes of the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes.\u201d <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>210 Conn. 511, 514, 555 A.2d 990 (1989). We recognize that the remedial purpose of mechanic\u2019s lien law is \u201cto furnish security for a contractor\u2019s labor and materials\u201d and that this beneficent purpose requires \u201ca generous construction.\u201d <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corp., </em>181 Conn. 592, 597, 436 A.2d 271 (1980); see <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 514 (generous construction requires only reasonable compliance with statutory provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">\u201cIn accordance with this policy, our courts have been liberal in validating liens despite claimed errors on the face of the lien certificate where the mistake was made in good faith and no resulting prejudice was claimed. See, e.g., <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>[185 Conn. 549, 555-56, 441 A.2d 171 (1981)] (copy of certificate served on owner by a subcontractor failed to state its intent to file a lien); <em>Morici </em>v. <em>Jarvie, </em>137 Conn. 97, 102, 75 A.2d 47 (1950) (misstatement of amount due); <em>Pierce, Butler &amp; Pierce Mfg. Corporation </em>v. <em>Enders, </em>118 Conn. 610, 615, 174 A. 169 (1934) (subcontractor mislabeled as contractor and agent); <em>Burque </em>v. <em>Naugatuck Lumber Co., </em>113 Conn. 350, 353, 155 A. 414 (1931) (defect in description); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>89 Conn. 554, 556-57, 94 A. 981 (1915) (inclusion of extra land in certificate); <em>Westland </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>47 Conn. 83, 86 (1879) (erroneous date of completion of work).\u201d <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 515; see also <em>Halsted &amp; Harmount Co. </em>v. <em>Arick, </em>76 Conn. 382, 387, 56 A. 628 (1904); <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Culver, </em>51 Conn. 177, 180 (1883); <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Kenyon, </em>44 Conn. 349, 356 (1877). As we have reasoned many times, \u201cwe do not think a court of equity can be called upon to declare [a] lien utterly void upon the motion of persons who have lost nothing by [the] mistake.\u201d <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Kenyon, </em>supra, 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Therefore, \u201c[w]here the misstatement of the claim is intentional, that is, where the statement of the claim is intentionally false, or where it is fraudulent, the lien will be void; but where it is the result of a mistake, the misstatement of the claim will not invalidate the lien. We apprehend that it would be impossible to differentiate between the mistake in the statement of the claim and the mistake in the description of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>claimed to be covered by the lien.\u201d <em>Tramonte </em>v. <em>Wilens, </em>supra, 89 Conn. 524; see also <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Persse &amp; Brooks Paper Works, </em>29 Conn. 256, 266 (1860) (mistake as to claim will be treated like mistake as to description of property). Where, however, there has been <em>\u201cno attempt to give </em>an accurate and true description, then . . . the certificate ought to be held void, as no better than a total omission <em>to attempt to comply </em>with its provisions.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tramonte </em>v. <em>Wilens, </em>supra, 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s inadvertent failure to include Exhibit A in the recordation does not indicate a failure to attempt to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 49-34. The defendant properly executed the lien certificate and served it, along with Exhibit A, on Harbor Village and Rockwood in connection with the recording of the lien. The trial court found that the defendant\u2019s attorney, who had prepared the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien and Exhibit A to be attached to the certificate for filing in the town clerk\u2019s office, had personally delivered the certificate, with Exhibit A attached, to the sheriff. Exhibit A, the property description in question, sets forth a separate description for each of the six parcels, referring to them as first tract (77-79 River Road), second tract (35 and 41 River Road), third tract (51 River Road), fourth tract (81 River Road), fifth tract (67 River Road) and sixth tract (59 River Road). Somehow Exhibit A became detached from its certificate of lien when it was recorded. In light of the defendant\u2019s demonstrated good faith attempt to comply with the statute, however, it was reasonable for the trial court to have concluded that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not reflect the type of intentional or fraudulent conduct that would be fatal to the lien.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>It was also reasonable for the trial court to have concluded that the mistake by someone other than the defendant would not undermine a finding of reasonable compliance with \u00a7 49-34. Reasonable compliance with statutory requirements has been routinely measured by whether the lienor\u2019s mistake was made in good faith and by whether prejudice resulted from the mistake. See <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. San-tella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 515. The certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien will be held invalid \u201cwhere the certificate is either intentionally false, or so grossly inaccurate as to show that there was no attempt to give an accurate and true description . . . .\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Persse &amp; Brooks Paper Works, </em>supra, 29 Conn. 266. If neither deficiency exists, we express satisfaction that the statute has been substantially complied with and reject the argument that the lien should be invalidated. See <em>Tramonte </em>v. <em>Wilens, </em>supra, 89 Conn. 526; <em>Shattuck </em>v. <em>Beardsley, </em>46 Conn. 386, 387-88 (1878).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Once the trial court has assessed the question of good faith, as it relates to the issue of reasonable compliance, it must then determine whether there was prejudice as a result of the claimed mistake. <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 515. The plaintiff concedes that there was no prejudice whatsoever to First Constitution as a result of Exhibit A having become detached. The mistake did not impact the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in any way. Work on the property by the defendant had begun prior to and continued long after the recording of the mortgage securing the loan from First Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Generally, the most obvious way to gauge prejudice is to examine the notice to the landowner, other lien holders and prospective lien holders. In this case, because neither the plaintiff nor the landowners can claim a lack of notice or prejudice, the real issue as it relates to the question of prejudice is one of notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>third parties. The claim before us, however, relates <em>solely to </em>whether the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien, as recorded, reasonably satisfied that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In the context of mortgages, we have recognized that \u201c[mjany errors in recording . . . are so neutralized by other matters which do appear in the record, that no searcher after the title possibly could be misled. Obviously, such shortcomings should not affect the validity of the record as notification.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Lorenzato, </em>221 Conn. 77, 83, 602 A.2d 959 (1992). If we begin with the land records; <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>210 Conn. 221, 230, 554 A.2d 735 (1989) (\u201cland records are the starting point for inquiry and not the ending point\u201d); the uncontradicted testimony indicates that the existence of the lien was apparent from the title search of the Greenwich land records. The certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien filed by the defendant recites that the defendant furnished materials and rendered services on a lot of land \u201csituated in the Town of Greenwich, County of Fairfield and State of Connecticut . . . belonging to said Harbor Village Limited Partnership and William O. Rockwood, Jr., Trustee, as bounded as follows: See Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 attached.\u201d Neither Harbor Village nor Rockwood owned any other property in Greenwich. As a result, the Greenwich town clerk correctly noted the property location in the grantor/grantee indices and indexed the lien under Fairfield Dock, under Harbor Village and under Rockwood. Moreover, the lis pendens filed on the land records by the defendant when it commenced the foreclosure of its mechanic\u2019s lien included Exhibit A and therefore contained the full legal description of the property. Finally, the plaintiff twice acknowledged in its own foreclosure complaint that the defendant claimed to have an interest in the premises by virtue of a mechanic\u2019s lien, setting forth in detail the pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>dates and volumes and pages of both the mechanic\u2019s lien and the lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 230, we concluded that, although \u201cthe mortgagee in recording its deed had inadvertently omitted documentation containing important information about the amount of the mortgage obligation,\u201d the recordation was nevertheless \u201ceffective because an express reference to the omitted documentation in the recorded mortgage deed would have enabled a title searcher to make the requisite inquiry to discover the terms of the mortgage.\u201d <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Lorenzato, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 83. Similarly, in <em>Lorenzato </em>we drew the distinction between the defective execution and the defective recording of a mortgage deed where the \u201cinadvertent mistake in recordation gave constructive notice to the lien creditor because the properly executed rider was sufficient to put a title searcher on inquiry about the status of the mortgage.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The issue before the court in <em>Lorenzato </em>was whether a properly executed, but defectively recorded, mortgage deed was valid. Although we do not decide today whether to apply the same standard in determining the validity of a defectively recorded mortgage and the validity of a defectively recorded mechanic\u2019s lien, we are free to consult other areas of the law for guidance, particularly when similar guiding policies are in play. In some instances, we have \u201creach[ed] back 169 years for the most cogent analogy.\u201d <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 517. As an example, in discussing the mechanic\u2019s lien statute in <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc., </em>this court analogized to law relating to the recording of a deed. Referring to <em>Pendleton </em>v. <em>Button, </em>3 Conn. 406 (1820), a case in which the defendant had proposed to prove title to certain land with a deed that had never been acknowledged in writing, we remarked \u201cthat a certificate of mechan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>ic\u2019s lien under General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 is sufficiently like a deed of land to make <em>Pendleton </em>dispositive of this case.\u201d <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. San-tella Co., </em>supra, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We recognize that there are clear differences between a mortgage and a mechanic\u2019s lien. A mechanic\u2019s lien, unlike a mortgage, is \u201cnot an agreement or contract between parties but rather a lien upon real estate which the plaintiff seeks to take by force of law and eventually to foreclose.\u201d <em>City Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Badstuebner Post No. 2090, </em>22 Conn. Sup. 230, 231, 167 A.2d 462 (1960). Unlike a mortgage deed, which may be reformed to reflect the contracting parties\u2019 mutual intent, the placement of a mechanic\u2019s lien is a unilateral act in which the lienor bears the burden of demonstrating statutory compliance. Nevertheless, reliance on mortgage law for the sole purpose of assessing whether notice was sufficient is appropriate. Although the differences in the origins of these two liens might affect a determination as to whether the execution was defective, such differences play no role in assessing whether there has been a defective recording. In both mortgage law and mechanic's lien law, the issue is whether the inadvertent mistake in recordation of a properly executed lien gave sufficient notice to put a title searcher on inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In this case, the Greenwich town clerk correctly noted the street location of the property in the grantor/grantee indices and indexed the lien under the appropriate headings for the defendant, Harbor Village and Rockwood. Accordingly, the trial court noted in its memorandum of decision that the land records themselves indicated that the defendant was claiming a mechanic\u2019s lien on property owned by Harbor Village and Rockwood and that a reasonable party searching the records would therefore conclude that a mechanic\u2019s lien could apply to all such properties. Additionally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>trial court noted that because the recorded certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien explicitly referred to \u201cExhibit \u2018A\u2019 attached\u201d for a description of the property, and because Exhibit A was not attached, \u201c[t]he mistake [was] obvious.\u201d Thus, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the trial court properly concluded that a reasonable party searching the land records would not have been misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Finally, the plaintiff relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 511, in which we held that a mechanic\u2019s lien was invalid because the certificate of lien did not contain a written oath sworn to by the signer despite uncontradicted evidence that the oath had been administered orally. That decision is not, however, inconsistent with the decision we reach in this case. A certificate that does not contain a written oath does not demonstrate on its face that the facts contained in the document are true. <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>224 Conn. 563, 578, 620 A.2d 118 (1993). Both <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc., </em>and <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>deal with the necessity of an oath to establish the veracity of the document's contents, not whether the recording sufficiently placed a title searcher on notice that a mechanic had not been paid.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In this opinion Berdon and Palmer, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\"> Although several defendants have been named in this foreclosure action, Fairfield Dock Company, Inc., is the sole defendant to appeal.

The majority disregards the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7 49-34<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the case law interpreting it. That statute requires a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien, with a description of the property to be encumbered, to be lodged with the town clerk in order to create a valid mechanic\u2019s lien. The defendant Fairfield Dock Company, Inc., has conceded in all phases of this litigation that it failed to lodge such a certificate with the Greenwich town clerk. That omission is a failure to comply with a key statutory element required to create a valid mechanic\u2019s lien. Without such compliance, the defendant\u2019s actions result in a nullity. Because the concept of reasonable compliance with a statutory scheme should not be stretched to encompass a complete lack of compliance with the terms of a statute, I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">The plain language of \u00a7 49-34 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] mechanic\u2019s lien is not valid, <em>unless the person performing the services or furnishing the materials, </em>(1) within ninety days after he has ceased to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>so, <em>lodges with the town clerk of the town in which the building, lot or plot of land is situated a certificate in writing, which shall be recorded by the town clerk with deeds of land, (A) describing the premises, </em>the amount claimed as a lien thereon, the name or names of the person against whom the lien is being filed and the date of the commencement of the performance of services or furnishing of materials . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">It is clear that the term \u201cdescribing the premises\u201d requires a description of the property to be encumbered by the mechanic\u2019s lien. The defendant has conceded throughout this litigation that <em>no description </em>of the premises intended to be encumbered by its mechanic\u2019s lien <em>was lodged with the town clerk or recorded in the Greenwich land records. </em>By failing to identify the property encumbered by the lien, the defendant has failed to comply with a statutory element required to perfect a mechanic\u2019s lien. General Statutes \u00a7 49-34. Unlike the majority, I am unwilling to equate \u201creasonable compliance\u201d with the specific statutory provisions with a complete lack of compliance with one of the enumerated statutory elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The majority does not apply our long-standing and recently reiterated standard for determining whether a mechanic\u2019s lien is valid under the statute: \u201cIn interpreting [the mechanic\u2019s lien statute] we are guided by well-settled principles of construction. . . . Even bearing in mind the statute\u2019s beneficent purpose, we are, however, constrained by the language of the statute as we find it, and cannot rewrite the statute or adopt the reasoning of precedents in other jurisdictions with different statutes. <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>[180 Conn. 545, 550, 429 A.2d 796 (1980)]; <em>New Haven Orphan Asylum </em>v. <em>Haggerty Co., </em>108 Conn. 232, 236, 142 A. 847 (1928); <em>Hartford Builders Finish Co. </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>99 Conn. 343, 345, 122 A. 76 (1923).\u201d <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corp., </em>181 Conn. 592, 597, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>436 A.2d 271 (1980). \u201cWe have long endorsed a policy favoring liberal construction of claimed inadequacies in certificates of mechanic\u2019s liens in order to achieve the remedial purposes of the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes. Provisions of mechanic\u2019s lien law should be liberally construed so as to reasonably and fairly implement its remedial intent. <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>185 Conn. 549, 553, 441 A.2d 171 (1981). We have also recognized, however, that such a policy has limitations: [T]he principles that guide our interpretation of mechanic\u2019s lien legislation are well settled. Although this legislation creates a statutory lien in derogation of the common law . . .its remedial purpose to furnish security for a contractor\u2019s labor and materials requires a generous construction. . . . Generosity of spirit does not, however, permit departure from reasonable compliance with the specific provisions of the statute. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Rosenfield, </em>[141 Conn. 188, 191, 104 A.2d 545 (1954)]; <em>City Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Borsuk, </em>[131 Conn. 640, 645, 41 A.2d 775 (1945)]. (Citations omitted.) <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>[supra, 550-51].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>210 Conn. 511, 514, 555 A.2d 990 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The majority has substituted for this standard, which measures the purported lienor\u2019s conduct against \u201creasonable compliance\u201d; see id.; with the statute, a different standard: whether \u201cthe defendant\u2019s inadvertent failure to include Exhibit A in the recordation . . . indicate[s] a failure to attempt to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 49-34.\u201d I agree that the defendant attempted in good faith to comply with the statute. If all that were needed to comply with the terms of \u00a7 49-34 were an attempt to comply with the statute, however, it would be difficult to imagine a case in which a defective lien certificate would ever fail to render a purported lien valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Moreover, <em>Tramonte </em>v. <em>Wilens, </em>89 Conn. 520, 94 A. 978 (1915), upon which the majority relies, is not to the contrary. In that case, as in all of the cases cited therein as well as all of the cases cited by the majority in which this court rejected claimed defects in the lien certificates,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there was a certificate lodged with the town clerk, as required by the statute, from which reasonable compliance with the statute could be measured. Thus, in that case as well as all of the previously mentioned cases, the lienor\u2019s \u201cattempt\u201d to comply was measured, not by his conduct in preparing the certificate, but by the certificate itself. In those cases, the court compared the recorded lien certificate against the statutory requirement. That cannot be said for the majority\u2019s analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The majority also asserts that because third parties had constructive notice of the purported lien of the defendant, that constructive notice reasonably satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 49-34. The majority relies on the law of mortgages to support this proposition. \u201c \u2018[M]any errors in recording . . . are so neutralized by other matters which do appear in the record, that no searcher after the title possibly could be misled. Obviously, such shortcomings should not affect the validity of the record as notification.\u2019 . . . <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Lorenzato, </em>221 Conn. 77, 83, 602 A.2d 959 (1992).\u201d The majority further states that \u201cwe drew the distinction between the defective execution and the defective recording of a mortgage deed where the \u2018inadvertent mistake in recordation gave constructive notice to the lien creditor because the properly executed rider was sufficient to put a title searcher on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>inquiry about the status of the mortgage.\u2019 \u201d Such reliance displays a basic misunderstanding of the different statutory schemes governing mortgages and mechanic\u2019s liens, and the differences between the two encumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Simply stated, notice to third parties, constructive or otherwise, is irrelevant to the validity of a mechanic\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because a mechanic\u2019s lien will be senior in priority to other encumbrances filed prior to the mechanic\u2019s lien, so long as the mechanic has commenced work or begun to furnish materials to the property to be encumbered prior to the recording of the intervening encumbrances, third parties will often not have notice of a subsequent mechanic\u2019s lien that will be senior in priority to their own claim. This lack of notice has no bearing on the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Conversely, third parties can have constructive notice of a purported mechanic\u2019s lien that is invalid. We have held that failure to append a written recital of the oath administered to the lienor invalidates a duly recorded mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 518. We have also held that the failure to conduct a formal ceremony in connection with the statutory oath invalidates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>224 Conn. 563, 579, 620 A.2d 118 (1993). In these two cases, the mechanic\u2019s lien was invalid because of its failure to comply with the applicable statutory provisions regarding administering or memorializing an oath. In both cases the mechanic\u2019s liens had been duly lodged with the town clerk, and recorded in the relevant land records in accordance with all other statutory requirements, including a description of the property encumbered. Constructive notice to third parties was achieved by these invalid liens. Having required strict adherence to the statutory formality of a written oath, actually administered to the lienor, I see no reason to ignore the statutory requirement of a description of the premises to be encumbered.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Because the majority ignores long-standing precedents of this court, and promulgates a decision that is inconsistent with mechanic\u2019s lien jurisprudence and the ordinary rules of statutory construction, I dissent, and would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 provides: \u201ccertificate of lien to be recorded and notice given to owner. A mechanic\u2019s lien is not valid, unless the person performing the services or furnishing the materials, (1) within ninety days after he has ceased to do so, lodges with the town clerk of the town in which the building, lot or plot of land is situated a certificate in writing, which shall be recorded by the town clerk with deeds of land, (A) describing the premises, the amount claimed as a lien thereon, the name or names of the person against whom the lien is being filed and the date of the commencement of the performance of services or furnishing of materials, (B) stating that the amount claimed is justly due, as nearly as the same can be ascertained, and (C) subscribed and sworn to by the claimant, and (2) within the same time, or prior to the lodging of the certificate but not later than thirty days after lodging the certificate, serves a true and attested copy of the certificate upon the owner of the building, lot or plot of land in the same manner as is provided for the service of the notice in section 49-35.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-5\"> In this connection, in both of the cases cited by the majority in which we rejected claimed deficiencies in the description of the premises liened, there was a certificate lodged with the town clerk that contained a reasonably adequate description of the premises. See <em>Burque </em>v. <em>Naugatuck Lumber Co., </em>113 Conn. 350, 155 A.2d 414 (1931); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>89 Conn. 554, 94 A. 981 (1915).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b845-6\"> Constructive notice is relevant to the enforceability of a mortgage against third parties because of the different legal requirements for the creation of an encumbrance against the grantor of a mortgage, and its perfection against third parties. When a mortgage is signed by the grantor and grantee, it is effective to create a security interest in favor of the grantee from the grantor. Recording is not necessary. To perfect the security interest against third parties, the mortgage must be recorded. Conversely, the means of creating a security interest encumbering property of the person for whom the mechanic has performed services or rendered materials, and perfecting that security interest against third parties, under the mechanic\u2019s lien statute, is unitary. In order both to create and to perfect a security interest with a mechanic\u2019s lien, the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien, with a description of property, must be lodged with the relevant town clerk. Were the mechanic just to execute the lien certificate, he would not have a security interest against either the owner of the property or third parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
