The plaintiff, New England Savings Bank, brought an action to foreclose its second mortgage on property owned by the defendant Dennis P. Nicotra (debtor).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first mortgagee, First Constitution Bank (inter-venor), received permission to intervene as a party defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for a rent receivership, but, despite the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>objection, directed the receiver to pay to the intervenor whatever rent receipts remained after payment of maintenance expenses and a maintenance reserve. The plaintiff appealed from the trial court\u2019s order to the Appellate Court, which granted the motion of the inter-venor to dismiss the appeal for lack of a final judgment. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to review the merits of the dismissal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now conclude that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The procedural history of the trial court\u2019s receivership orders starts with the court\u2019s order of November 26, 1991, which, at the plaintiff\u2019s request, appointed a receiver in the plaintiff\u2019s action to foreclose its second mortgage. The order not only directed the receiver to collect the rents and to pay necessary maintenance expenses, but also directed the receiver to pay any excess funds, after the payment of expenses, to the intervenor. The plaintiff objected to the second part of the court\u2019s order. On December 17, 1991, in response to the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration, the court directed that any excess collected funds be placed in an interest bearing escrow account pending the outcome of a prompt trial in the intervenor\u2019s separate action to foreclose its first mortgage. After a trial of the intervenor\u2019s first mortgage foreclosure action, in which the plaintiff participated, the trial court rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>a judgment of strict foreclosure and determined that the debt exceeded the value of the property by approximately $800,000. On May 11, 1992, the trial court granted the motion of the intervenor to modify its prior order and directed the receiver to resume payment to the intervenor of any funds available after payment of necessary current operating expenses and setting aside a $40,000 maintenance reserve for unanticipated expenses. Although the receivership has not been concluded and the plaintiffs second mortgage foreclosure action is still pending, the plaintiff has appealed the trial court\u2019s May 11, 1992 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">In the circumstances of this case, our case law supports the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. \u201cNo appeal lies from the appointment of a receiver of rents in a foreclosure action. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Polish Loan &amp; Industrial Corporation, </em>126 Conn. 714, 715, 11 A.2d 395 (1940); <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Kingston Realty Corporation, </em>114 Conn. 349, 350n, 158 A. 889 (1932). Review of that ruling must await an appeal from the final judgment of foreclosure. <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>192 Conn. 1, 5, 469 A.2d 778 (1984).\u201d <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>195 Conn. 218, 223, 487 A.2d 528, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 845,106 S. Ct. 135, 88 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1985). \u201cA ruling concerning the propriety of the rent receiver\u2019s conduct of the receivership is as interlocutory as is his initial appointment.\u201d <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>supra, 5. Furthermore, \u201c[although a receivership takes designated funds out of the control of the mortgagor, it does not vest their control in the foreclosing mortgagee, who \u2018has no claim upon the income and profit in [the receiver\u2019s] hands as such\u2019; since the funds are legally in the possession of the court subject to whatever disposition it may order.\u201d Id., 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>As an interlocutory order, the trial court\u2019s ruling would be immediately appealable only if it met the two part test articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). We are persuaded, however, that, in the circumstances of this case, an order directing a receiver\u2019s disbursement of funds prior to a judgment of foreclosure is neither an \u201corder or action [that] terminates a separate and distinct proceeding\u201d nor is it an \u201corder or action [that] so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d Id.; see <em>Mac\u2019s Car City, Inc. </em>v. <em>DiLoreto, </em>33 Conn. App. 131, 132, 634 A.2d 1187 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">On the facts of this case we conclude that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> The plaintiff, New England Savings Bank, was the successor-in-interest to OmniBank of Connecticut, Inc., the original payee of promissory notes executed by the debtor and the original mortgagee of mortgages executed by the debtor as security for these promissory notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The Union Trust Company was also named as a defendant in the plaintiff\u2019s foreclosure action. It is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\"> During the pendency of the petition for certification, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was appointed as receiver for the intervenor and moved to be substituted as the intervening defendant-appellee. On October 28, 1992, the Appellate Court granted the motion to substitute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\"> We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether an order for disbursements of the receiver\u2019s funds prior to vesting of title and assessment of a deficiency is an appealable interlocutory order?\u201d <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Nicotra, </em>224 Conn. 919, 617 A.2d 173 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">On May 21, 1993, after the filing of the briefs on the certified appeal, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was appointed as receiver for the plaintiff. In this capacity, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation moved, on June 9, 1993, for a ninety day stay of the appellate proceedings pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 (d) (12). The stay was granted by this court on June 14, 1993. Thereafter, Citizens Savings Bank took over the asset involved in this case and its motion to be substituted as the plaintiff-appellant was granted by this court on May 25, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
