The trial court suppressed evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant that was issued upon the application of two Hartford detectives. The issuing judge, however, had neglected to sign the jurat following the statement, executed by the detectives, that established probable cause. As a result of the suppression, the trial court dismissed the charges against the defendants. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">On February 6, 1992, Hartford Detectives Michael Perodeau and Stephen Grabowski submitted an application for a search and seizure warrant for 12 Willard Street, apartment 304, to Superior Court Judge Carmen E. Espinosa. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>32 Conn. App. 402, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>404, 628 A.2d 1347 (1993). Judge Espinosa found that a statement of the detectives contained in the section of the application denominated \u201caffidavit\u201d established probable cause and issued the warrant. The subsequent search of 12 Willard Street, pursuant to the warrant, resulted in the seizure of a substantial quantity of narcotics and $9329 in cash. Id., 405. The defendants were arrested and charged with violations of the narcotics laws. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">It was discovered subsequently that Judge Espinosa had neglected to sign the jurat following the detectives\u2019 statement in the application for the warrant. Id., 404. Both Perodeau and Grabowski, however, had signed and dated the jurat form in the proper places and in all other respects the application for the warrant had been properly completed and executed. Specifically, the affidavit supporting the request to delay delivery of the warrant, including its jurat, had been properly signed by Judge Espinosa and detectives Perodeau and Grabowski. Judge Espinosa had also properly signed the actual order directing the search. Id., 404-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">After a hearing, the trial court granted Colon\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant solely because Judge Espinosa had not signed the jurat following the detectives\u2019 signatures. Id., 404 n.2. After granting the state\u2019s subsequent motion to open and reconsider its decision, the trial court held a further hearing. Id. At this further hearing, the state introduced, over the objection of defense counsel, an affidavit from Judge Espinosa wherein she attested that she had found probable cause to issue the warrant, that she had properly administered the oath to the affi-ant officers, that the officers had sworn to the truth of their statement establishing probable cause in her presence and had signed the jurat following their statement, that she had signed the jurat requesting dispensation with the delivery requirement and had signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the actual search warrant, and that her failure to sign the jurat, following the statement of the detectives that had established probable cause, had been an oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Grabowski testified at the reopened hearing that both he and Perodeau had sworn to the contents of their statement before Judge Espinosa and had affixed their signatures to the jurat form. He further stated that Judge Espinosa had signed the order directing the search in the presence of both officers. Finally, Grabowski testified that neither he nor Perodeau had been aware of the absence of Judge Espinosa\u2019s signature on the jurat prior to searching the premises described in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The trial court adhered to its prior decision to suppress the evidence and to dismiss the charges against Colon, holding that the unsigned jurat rendered the warrant fatally defective. Perez, the second defendant, subsequently moved to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant. His motion was granted and the charges against him were also dismissed. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgments. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">We granted certification limited to the following issues: \u201c(1) Under the circumstances of this case, did the failure of the issuing judge to sign the jurat on the affidavit invalidate the search warrant? (2) If the answer to question (1) is \u2018yes,\u2019 should the remedy have been exclusion of the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>227 Conn. 926, 632 A.2d 705 (1993). Because we conclude that the search warrant was valid despite the unsigned jurat, we need not address the second certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">The state argues that Judge Espinosa\u2019s failure to sign the jurat following the detectives\u2019 statement establishing probable cause did not render the search warrant in question invalid. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The fourth amendment to the federal constitution provides in part that \u201cno warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d Similarly, article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution provides in pertinent part that \u201cno warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or things, shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d Neither constitutional provision specifies a particular procedure for evidencing whether probable cause has been supported by oath or affirmation; both simply require that probable cause, in fact, be so supported. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>558 F.2d 46, 50 (2d Cir. 1977) (telephonic oath); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunn, </em>99 Or. App. 503, 506, 783 P.2d 26 (1989); <em>Vance </em>v. <em>State, </em>759 S.W.2d 498, 500 (Tex. App. 1988). A jurat provides one effective means of attesting that an affidavit was sworn to under oath, but it is not the only effective or permissible means. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunn, </em>supra, 505-506; see also <em>Gossard </em>v. <em>Vawter, </em>21 N.E.2d 416, 417 (Ind. 1939); <em>American Home Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Heide, </em>199 Kan. 652, 655, 433 P.2d 454 (1967); <em>Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority </em>v. <em>Zitko, </em>386 S.W.2d 69, 78 (Mo. 1965); <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>150 App. Div. 2d 622, 541 N.Y.S.2d 491, cert. denied, 546 N.Y.S.2d 576, 545 N.E.2d 890 (1989); <em>People </em>v. <em>Zimmer, </em>112 App. Div. 2d 500, 490 N.Y.S.2d 912 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>33 N.C. App. 492, 494, 235 S.E.2d 424 (1977); <em>White </em>v. <em>State, </em>702 P.2d 1058, 1061 (Okla. Crim. 1985). Therefore, the absence of the signed jurat is not a state or federal constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a (c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> however, requires in pertinent part that \"[a] warrant may issue only on <em>affi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>davit </em>sworn to by the complainant or complainants before the judge and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Appellate Court concluded that \u00a7 54-33a (c) requires a completed jurat in order to effect an affidavit to support a warrant. In so concluding, the Appellate Court relied principally on its own prior decision in <em>Willametz </em>v. <em>Susi Contracting Co., </em>9 Conn. App. 1, 6-7, 514 A.2d 383, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 814, 517 A.2d 631 (1986), wherein the court held that an unsworn statement purporting to be an affidavit of debt filed in a civil case that recited only that the \u201c \u2018[d]efendant agreed to pay [the] plaintiff the sum of $100,030.00 on September 9, 1977, in settlement of [the] judgment\u2019 \u201d was not an affidavit. The court reasoned that the purported affidavit of debt was not an affidavit because it \u201cnot only lacked substance, but, more importantly, it lacked the formality required of an affidavit.\u201d Id., 6. The court concluded that it lacked the requisite formality because it contained neither an oath by the plaintiff nor any attestation that the statement was made under oath before a person authorized by law to administer an oath. Id., 6-7. By analogy to <em>Willametz, </em>the Appellate Court in the present case concluded that the definition of an affidavit necessarily includes the jurat and that, without a signed jurat, the search warrant lacked an \u201caffidavit\u201d as required by \u00a7 54-33a (c). <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Even if we were to adopt the rule announced in <em>Wil-lametz, </em>we do not read that ruling so expansively. <em>Wil-lametz </em>was governed by Practice Book \u00a7 366, which provided that \u201c[i]n all actions of contract when damages are to be assessed after entry of default, the plaintiff must <em>file </em>an account, copy, statement, or bill of particulars verified by oath, or duly present evidence in court in support of his claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Willametz </em>v. <em>Susi Contracting Co., </em>supra, 9 Conn. App. 6. The plaintiff in <em>Willametz </em>neither \u201cfiled\u201d the appropriate document verified by oath (i.e., an affidavit) nor presented evidence in court in support of his claim. Because the plaintiff in <em>Willametz </em>had presented neither evidence in support of his claim, nor evidence that his statement had been verified by oath, the filing of a self-proving affidavit was required by \u00a7 366. In the present case, by contrast, there was evidence that Grabowski and Perodeau had sworn to the facts establishing probable cause and that Judge Espinosa had, in fact, administered an oath to Grabowski and Perodeau prior to issuing the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Furthermore, in arriving at its decision that the purported affidavit of debt did not qualify as an affidavit, the Appellate Court in <em>Willametz </em>relied on the generally accepted definition of \u201caffidavit,\u201d stating that an affidavit is \u201c \u2018[a]ny voluntary ex parte statement reduced to writing, <em>and sworn to or affirmed </em>before some person legally authorized to administer an oath or affirmation.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 7; Ballen-tine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed.); see 3 Am. Jur. 2d 380, Affidavits \u00a7 1 (1962). This definition does not preclude extrinsic evidence of the administration of an oath, nor does it mandate a signed jurat in order for a document to fall within its parameters. Therefore extrinsic evidence that Judge Espinosa had administered an oath to Grabowski and Perodeau, if credited, would supply the necessary ingredient to support a finding that there was a valid affidavit as defined in <em>Willametz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The Appellate Court, in reaching its conclusion that \u00a7 54-33a (c) required a signed jurat, also relied on the general rule that criminal statutes are to be construed strictly in the defendant\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 406-407. While we also recognize that criminal statutes are to be construed strictly, the language in a criminal statute need not be given its narrowest possible construction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983); see also <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>213 Conn. 637, 646, 569 A.2d 1112 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>205 Conn. 386, 392, 533 A.2d 866 (1987). Moreover, it is a general principle of statutory construction that words \u201cshall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of language . . . .\" General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra, 151. Section 54-33a (c) requires only an \u201caffidavit sworn to by the complainant or complainants\u201d in order for a warrant to issue. The term \u201caffidavit\u201d is, as previously noted, commonly defined as \u201cany voluntary ex parte statement reduced to writing, and sworn to or affirmed before some person legally authorized to administer an oath or affirmation.\u201d 3 Am. Jur. 2d 380, Affidavits \u00a7 1 (1962); see also 2A C.J.S. 435, Affidavits \u00a7 2 (1972). Neither the commonly approved definition of the term \u201caffidavit\u201d nor \u00a7 54-33a (c) requires a signed jurat. \u201cWe have no warrant for interpolating into a criminal statute a requirement it does not now contain.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> State v. <em>Duhan, </em>194 Conn. 347, 358, 481 A.2d 48 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In suppressing the evidence seized, the trial court stated that it had assumed that Judge Espinosa had administered an oath to the detectives. It found, however, that, because the jurat was not signed, the administration of an oath was not evident from the four corners of the warrant application and, consequently, that there was not a valid affidavit to support the search warrant. The Appellate Court also concluded that a jurat signed by the issuing judge had to appear in the warrant application in order for an affidavit to be valid and that any defect in, or omission of, the jurat could not be remedied by extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>We agree that, in determining the adequacy of an affidavit in support of a search warrant, the information to establish probable cause must be found within the affidavit\u2019s four corners. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Zarick, </em>227 Conn. 207, 216-17, 630 A.2d 565, cert. denied, U.S. , 114 S. Ct. 637, 126 L. Ed. 2d 595 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 536, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985). The purpose of the affidavit, however, is to \u201cenable the issuing authority to weigh the persuasiveness of the facts relied upon by the affiant or complainant and, from them, to determine whether the necessary probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>155 Conn. 385, 391, 232 A.2d 315 (1967). Therefore, although probable cause must be determined from the four corners of the warrant, we are not confined to the four corners of the warrant in determining whether the affidavit in support of probable cause has been validly executed. See <em>Vance </em>v. <em>State, </em>759 S.W.2d 498, 500 (Tex. App. 1988) (\u201cThe \u2018four corners\u2019 doctrine gives us guidance more particularly in determining the sufficiency of the probable cause evidence set out in the affidavit to justify the issuance of the search warrant. The \u2018four corners\u2019 doctrine does not apply to the <em>jurat </em>beneath the affidavit. When the <em>jurat </em>on its face is defective, the fact that it was properly sworn to may be shown by other evidence.\u201d); see also <em>Huff </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 710, 712, 194 S.E.2d 690 (1973); 3 Am. Jur. 2d, Affidavits \u00a7 17 (1962) (\u201comission of a jurat or a signature thereto ... is not fatal to the validity of the affidavit, so long as it appears . . . from evidence aliunde that the affidavit was, in fact, duly sworn to before an authorized officer\u201d). In making the determination that the affidavit in this case was validly executed, we adopt the view that \u201cthe jurat is simply evidence of the fact that the affidavit was duly sworn to by the affiant, and, in the event of its omission, the fact that the affidavit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>properly sworn to may be proven by other evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>White </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 702 P.2d 1061; see also <em>Gossard </em>v. <em>Vawter, </em>supra, 21 N.E.2d 417; <em>American Home Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Heide, </em>supra, 199 Kan. 655; <em>Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority </em>v. <em>Zitko, </em>supra, 386 S.W.2d 78; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 150 App. Div. 2d 622; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zimmer, </em>supra, 112 App. Div. 2d 500; <em>State </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>supra, 33 N.C. App. 494; 3 Am. Jur. 2d 393, Affidavits \u00a7 16 (1962) (\u201cthe jurat is no part of the affidavit, but simply evidence that the affidavit has been duly sworn to by the affiant . . .\u201d); 2A C.J.S. 467, Affidavits \u00a7 31 (1972) (\u201cThe jurat is not such a part of an affidavit that its omission will render the affidavit a nullity, at least where the affidavit is otherwise properly executed. Thus, ordinarily a jurat is not essential to an affidavit if the fact of the due administration of the oath is otherwise shown . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that, although it is preferable that every affidavit contain a completed jurat, the omission of, or a defect in, the jurat does not affect the validity of a warrant issued upon probable cause when it is proven by extrinsic evidence that the supporting affidavit was properly sworn to by the complainants. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunn, </em>supra, 99 Or. App. 506; <em>Vance </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 759 S.W.2d 500. Any other conclusion would impose an undue penalty on law enforcement for an inadvertent omission on the part of the issuing magistrate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Because we conclude that the jurat \u201c \u2018is no part of the oath\u2019 . . . and its absence is a defect curable by subsequent affidavits or testimony\u201d; (citations omitted); <em>People </em>v. <em>Zimmer, </em>supra, 112 App. Div. 2d 501; the only remaining question is whether there was a proper finding that the affidavit had been sworn to by Grabowski and Perodeau. In the present case, extrinsic evidence was presented through the testimony of Grabowski and an affidavit from Judge Espinosa that the affidavit supporting the warrant had been executed under oath. The trial court, however, did not make a specific finding that Judge Espinosa had administered an oath to the detectives prior to issuing the warrant but merely \u201cassumed\u201d that she had. We therefore remand the case to the trial court for a determination of whether Judge Espinosa did, in fact, administer an oath to Grabowski and Perodeau. If the trial court so finds, the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>a jurat signed by Judge Espinosa does not render the search warrant in this case invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., and Borden, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\"> Both the Appellate Court and the defendants relied on the definition of jurat provided in General Statutes \u00a7 3-94a (2): \u201c \u2018Jurat\u2019 means a notarial act in which a notary public certifies that a signatory, whose identity is personally known to the notary public or proven on the basis of satisfactory evidence, has made, in the notary public\u2019s presence, a voluntary signature and taken an oath or affirmation vouching for the truthfulness of the signed document.\u201d We note, however, that the definition of jurat contained in \u00a7 3-94a pertains to the statutory sections on notaries public, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 3-94a to 3-95, and has no specific application to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">A jurat is generally defined as \u201ca certificate added to an affidavit stating when, before whom, and where it was made.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary; see also <em>Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority </em>v. <em>Zitko, </em>386 S.W.2d 69, 78 (Mo. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a (c) provides: \u201cissuance of search warrant. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">\u201c(c) A warrant may issue only on affidavit sworn to by the complainant or complainants before the judge and establishing the grounds for issuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the warrant, which affidavit shall be part of the arrest file.

In <em>Grant, </em>this court considered the statutory requirement that an application for a wiretap warrant be submitted under the oath or affirmation of a state\u2019s attorney. In suppressing the evidence seized as a result of the wiretap, we held that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s mere acknowledgement on the warrant application form failed to satisfy the requirement that the application be supported by oath or affirmation. Id., 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\"><em>Grant </em>is inapposite to the present case. This court\u2019s decision in <em>Grant </em>focused solely on the importance of a sworn affidavit prior to the issuance of the wiretap warrant. In <em>Grant, </em>there was neither a signed attestation nor extrinsic evidence that the state\u2019s attorney had taken an oath that the statements contained in the affidavit were true. In the present case, there was evidence that Grabowski and Perodeau, in fact, had sworn to the statements contained in the application for the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Similarly, <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>210 Conn. 511, 555 A.2d 990 (1989), is inapposite to the present case. <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc., </em>required us to interpret the edict of General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 that a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien be \u201csubscribed and sworn to by the claimant.\u201d In that case, we held that \u201cthe oath must appear in writing on the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien for it to be valid under the statute.\u201d Id. In so holding, we relied on <em>Pendleton </em>v. <em>Button, </em>3 Conn. 406 (1820), wherein we stated: \u201c \u2018It is provided by statute, that no deed shall be accounted complete in law, to convey real estate, but such as is written witnessed, <em>acknowledged, </em>and recorded. Tit. 142, c. 1., s. 7. The acknowledgment, to be recorded, must necessarily, be in writing; and such is the invariable practice.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 517. Our holding in <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc., </em>that a valid certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien contain a written oath, can be attributed to the statutory requirement, contained in \u00a7 49-34, that the lien certificate be recorded. Id. The oath, to be recorded, necessarily must be in writing. Because General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a (c) contains no similar recording requirement, <em>J. C.

See <em>Ex Parte Finance America Corp., </em>507 So. 2d 458, 460 (Ala. 1987); <em>Laurens County </em>v. <em>Keen, </em>214 Ga. 32, 35, 102 S.E.2d 697 (1958); <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>202 Ill.

See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lardo, </em>240 Pa.

In <em>Surowiecki, </em>we held that the signature of the issuing judge on the section of the warrant commanding the search itself was necessary before a valid warrant could issue pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a (c). <em>State </em>v. <em>Surowiecki, </em>supra, 97.

C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 512, 518, although the oath was administered to the lienor, there was, as in this case, no written recital of that fact and the court invalidated the lien. In <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 577, 579, although the mechanic\u2019s lien was signed by the lienor and the notary memorialized the lienor\u2019s oath with a signature, the court held that the failure to conduct a formal ceremony was enough to invalidate the lien. This court in <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>reaffirmed its reasoning in <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc., </em>as follows: \u201cTo validate a mechanic\u2019s lien certificate without any evidence that the claimant performed some act or form of ceremony indicating that the claimant consciously undertook the obligation of an oath \u2018would invite confusion, delay and uncertainty into an area where certainty and complete compliance with the statutory requirements are of paramount importance to inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ested parties and the general public.\u2019 <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 518.\u201d <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">I am unable to understand why this court would apply a more forgiving standard in scrutinizing a defective search warrant than the requirement of strict compliance with the formalities of the oath it has repeatedly applied in cases such as <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc., </em>and <em>Red Rooster Construction Co., </em>where the validity of a mechanic\u2019s lien was challenged. It would seem to me, as Justice Katz points out in her dissenting opinion, that we should be more concerned with the formalities of the oath when the fundamental constitutional right of privacy is implicated, as it is in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Accordingly, I join Justice Katz in her dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\"> I also agree with Justice Katz that a \u201cgood faith exception\u201d to the exclusionary rule is inapplicable to this invalid warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b56-8\">Katz, J., with whom Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIB\">joins, dissenting. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defective jurat did not invalidate the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u201cIt has long been recognized that . . . rules of criminal procedure are to be strictly construed to protect the fundamental constitutional right to liberty. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tedesco, </em>175 Conn. 279, 291, 397 A.2d 1352 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>158 Conn. 461, 465, 262 A.2d 166 (1969); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>37 Conn. 32, 35 (1870).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>183 Conn. 520, 522, 441 A.2d 41 (1981); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Genotti, </em>220 Conn. 796, 807, 601 A.2d 1013 (1992). Additionally, this court has specifically directed that strict construction of statutory provisions pertaining to search warrants is imperative. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Surowiecki, </em>184 Conn. 95, 98, 440 A.2d 798 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 523. Although the majority acknowledges this rule of strict construction, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>nevertheless concludes that \u201c[n]either the commonly approved definition of the term \u2018affidavit\u2019 nor [General Statutes] \u00a7 54-33a (c) requires a signed jurat.\u201d Such a conclusion is inconsistent with our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Surowiecki, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 97, we strictly construed the word \u201cissue\u201d contained in \u00a7 54-33a (c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as requiring a lawful signature on a search warrant in order to ensure its validity. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 523 (holding that arrest warrant signed only by assistant clerk of Superior Court was defective, even though judge, who should have signed warrant, had found probable cause to support it). In that case, the judge reviewed the search warrant application, found that it established probable cause for a search of the areas listed and for a seizure of the items described, administered the oath to the affiant and signed the jurat on the application. <em>State </em>v. <em>Surowiecki, </em>supra, 96. Because of \u201c \u2018a mere oversight,\u2019 \u201d however, the judge inadvertently failed to sign the actual search warrant. Id. Despite the existence of undisputed extrinsic evidence proving the judge\u2019s intention to sign the search warrant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we nevertheless concluded that the judge could not properly have \u201cissued\u201d the search warrant until he had fully performed the act of issuing. Id., 97. We stated that the judge\u2019s signature on the search warrant represented the \u201cidentifiable objective manifestation of his subjective intent to issue the search warrant,\u201d and therefore concluded that in the absence of such a signature, issuance was not complete. Id. We thus strictly construed the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u201cissue\u201d to require a lawful signature on a search warrant by the person authorized to issue it, despite the fact that neither the legal lexicon nor the commonly approved definition of the term \u201cissue\u201d required such a result. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The majority concludes that <em>State </em>v. <em>Surowiecki, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 95, is satisfied in this case because the section of the warrant directing the search was signed by the issuing judge. By so disposing of <em>Sur-owiecki, </em>however, the majority misses the point. That is, the majority fails to explain why in <em>Surowiecki </em>we strictly construed the word \u201cissue\u201d to require a lawful signature, yet decline in this case to construe strictly the terms \u201caffidavit\u201d or \u201csworn to\u201d to require the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that an unsigned jurat does not affect the validity of a warrant when it is proven by extrinsic evidence that the affidavit was properly sworn to is also inconsistent with <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>210 Conn. 511, 555 A.2d 990 (1989). In <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc., </em>we construed General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 (1) (C),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> directing that a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien must be \u201csworn to\u201d by the claimant, to require a written recital of the oath-taking on the certificate. Id. We did so despite both the existence of extrinsic evidence proving that an oath had been administered, and the fact that \u00a7 49-34 did not explicitly require that the oath-taking be memorialized in writing. Id., 512, 518. We reasoned: \u201cIn con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>sidering a statute that authorizes a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien in writing ... we cannot ascribe to the legislature an intent that an essential part of this certificate need not be in writing. ... To validate a certificate without a written oath would invite confusion, delay and uncertainty into an area where certainty and complete compliance with the statutory requirements are of paramount importance to interested parties and the general public.\u201d Id., 518. We further reasoned that \u201c \u2018[t]o hold there need be no [sworn statement] attached would open the door to fraud difficult to detect.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Cook Borden &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>293 Mass. 174, 180, 199 N.E. 551 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">It is significant that in <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 514, we \u201cendorsed a policy favoring <em>liberal </em>construction of claimed inadequacies in certificates of mechanics\u2019 liens in order to achieve the remedial purposes of the mechanics\u2019 lien statutes.\u201d See also <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>185 Conn. 549, 553, 441 A.2d 171 (1981) (\u201c[provisions of mechanics\u2019 lien law should be liberally construed so as to reasonably and fairly implement its remedial intent\u201d). Thus, we held that, even if <em>liberally </em>construed, the words \u201csworn to\u201d contained in \u00a7 49-34 required a writing. <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. v. Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 518. Certainly, a strict construction of the same words as used in a criminal statute should require nothing less.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Indeed, the policies guiding strict construction of criminal statutes are even more compelling than those justifying our liberal construction of \u00a7 49-34.1 can think of no sphere in which \u201ccertainty and complete compliance with the statutory requirements\u201d are of <em>greater </em>\u201cimportance to interested parties and the general public\u201d than in the area of fundamental constitutional rights. Id., 518. To validate a warrant that lacks a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>pleted jurat \u201cwould invite confusion, delay and uncertainty\u201d into that arena. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">These same policies have persuaded other state courts to hold invalid an affidavit supporting a search warrant in the absence of a valid jurat. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dozier, </em>5 Mass. App. 865, 366 N.E.2d 1270 (1977) (motion to suppress evidence seized from defendant\u2019s apartment and automobile pursuant to search warrant supported by affidavit on which jurat was unsigned properly allowed because document was inadequate on its face as basis for warrant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McAfee, </em>230 Pa. Super. 336, 339, 326 A.2d 522 (1974) (provision in Pennsylvania constitution that warrant be \u201csupported by oath or affirmation subscribed to by the affiant\u201d implies that there be some written record of fact that affiant was in fact sworn, to which he can subscribe, and mere oral testimony that affidavit upon which warrant issued was made under oath would not comply with this clause); see also footnote 5 of the majority opinion and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">I conclude that in the absence of a completed jurat, the affidavit signed by Detectives Grabowski and Perodeau was not properly sworn to and that the warrant was therefore invalid. Finally, I do not agree with the state that the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule approved in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984), is applicable to this invalid search warrant. I agree with the Appellate Court that we decided that issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 579 A.2d 58 (1990). Accordingly, I would affirm the. judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Surowiecki, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 97, we construed that portion of General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a (c) which provides that if a judge \u201cis satisfied that grounds for the [warrant] application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, he [or she] shall <em>issue </em>a warrant identifying the property and naming or describing the person, place or thing to be searched.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\"> There was \u201cno dispute that the judge intended to sign the search warrant . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Surowiecki, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 (1) (C) provides: \u201ccertificate of lien to be recorded and notice given to owner.
