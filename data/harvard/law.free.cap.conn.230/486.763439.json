J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6V\">The principal issue in this case is the relationship between a bank\u2019s common law right of setoff and a judgment creditor\u2019s statutory right to enforce a court-issued execution. The plaintiff, Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. (Josef), filed a four count complaint against the defendant, Connecticut National Bank (bank), alleging, in separate counts, that the bank had wrongfully dishonored two orders of execution on the bank account of Josef\u2019s judgment debtor, J.H. Hogan, Inc. (Hogan), that the bank\u2019s wrongful conduct violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.; and that the bank had falsely, fraudulently, intentionally and recklessly misrepresented to Josef that no funds were in the account in question. The trial court, <em>Pellegrino, J., </em>rendered judgment in Josef\u2019s favor on the first three counts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and awarded it attorney\u2019s fees for the CUTPA violation. The bank appealed to the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>from the judgment and the supplemental judgment, and Josef cross appealed from the denial by the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>of its postjudgment motion for attorney\u2019s fees to defend against the bank\u2019s appeal. We transferred the appeal and the cross appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The trial court, <em>Pellegrino, J., </em>made the following findings of fact. On September 24, 1991, Josef obtained a judgment against Hogan for $21,000. The validity of that judgment is not at issue. Because the judgment was not satisfied, Josef obtained an execution issued by the clerk of the court to recover unpaid damages in the amount of the judgment. Josef employed a deputy sheriff to serve the execution upon the bank in order to garnish the proceeds of Hogan\u2019s checking account. The deputy sheriff tried, unsuccessfully, on two occasions, to garnish this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The deputy sheriff first served the execution upon the bank on Friday, October 25, 1991. On that date, Hogan had a checking account balance at the bank in the amount of $5326.97. A check drawn to a third party on Hogan\u2019s account in the amount of $380.15 was honored and cleared the following Monday, October 28. Thereafter, however, relying on a default on Hogan\u2019s commercial loan from the bank, the bank set off $4945.82, the remainder of Hogan\u2019s account, to itself. Although the bank\u2019s \u201cproof ticket\u201d was dated October 28, indicating that the setoff occurred on that date, no commercial loan payment was entered in Hogan\u2019s account until October 29. The bank notified the deputy sheriff who had served the execution that, as of the date of the execution, no funds were available.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Because of subsequent deposits, Hogan\u2019s bank account had a balance of $63,633.62, $54,620.06 and $51,673.23 on October 29, 30 and 31, respectively. The deputy sheriff served the execution for a second time on Wednesday, November 6,1991, when Hogan\u2019s bank account had a balance of $31,304.86. Again relying on Hogan\u2019s defaulted bank loan, the bank repeated its exercise of its right of setoff, this time in the amount of $31,303.86. As had occurred previously, the bank manifested its exercise of that right by a \u201cproof ticket\u201d dated in timely fashion, on November 7, but did not credit the payment to Hogan\u2019s commercial loan account until the following day. The bank notified the deputy sheriff that no funds were available on the date of the second execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The trial court ruled in Josef\u2019s favor on the first two counts of its complaint, concluding that the bank had failed to act within the midnight deadline, the time constraint defined in General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4-104,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that is expressly made applicable to the garnishment of corporate bank accounts by the terms of General Statutes \u00a7 52-367a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That time constraint would have required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the bank to exercise any right of setoff, in the first instance by midnight of October 28, and in the second instance by midnight of November 7. The court specifically found that the proof tickets were unreliable and that the bank had not exercised its setoff rights until October 29 and November 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">With respect to these counts, the trial court also concluded that, regardless of its timing, the bank had no right of setoff in the circumstances of this case. The court determined that, in the absence of an express right of setoff in the Hogan loan agreement, the bank could only invoke a common law right of setoff. No common law right of setoff was available in this case, according to the trial court, because Hogan was not insolvent and because underlying equitable considerations did not support its recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Finally, the trial court ruled in Josefs favor on its CUTPA claim. The court held that CUTPA applies to banks and that the bank\u2019s exercise of its right of setoff was, in both cases, a flagrant violation of \u00a7 52-367a and of the court orders of execution. The court found that the bank had engaged in deceptive conduct in return<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ing the orders of execution on the ground of \u201cno available funds\u201d without mentioning the setoffs. Accordingly, the court held that Josef was entitled not only to its money judgment and interest, but also to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. Thereafter, the court awarded attorney\u2019s fees calculated on an hourly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">On appeal, the bank challenges one of the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and all of its conclusions of law. As a matter of fact, the bank claims that its setoff was timely because it complied with the applicable midnight deadline. As a matter of law, the bank claims that: (1) Josef failed to state an actionable claim, because it alleged only that the bank did not act upon the execution according to General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4-303,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which does not apply to the circumstances of this case despite the cross-reference contained in \u00a7 52-367a; (2) the bank is entitled to a common law right of setoff in the circumstances of this case; (3) CUTPA does not apply to banks; (4) the bank did not violate CUTPA; and (5) the trial court miscalculated recoverable attorney\u2019s fees. The cross appeal filed by Josef challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that, as a matter of law, CUTPA does not autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>rize recovery of anticipatory appellate attorney\u2019s fees. Although we affirm the judgment of the trial court concerning the \u00a7 52-367a violation and agree with its conclusion that CUTPA applies to banks, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the bank\u2019s actions, under the circumstances of this case, violated CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The bank first claims that Josef has failed to state an actionable claim and, therefore, cannot recover on the basis of its pleadings. The bank specifically contends that Josef only alleged a failure by the bank to act upon Josef\u2019s court-issued postjudgment execution, served pursuant to \u00a7 52-367a, in accordance with \u00a7 42a-4-303 before its midnight deadline as defined in \u00a7 42a-4-104. The bank argues that \u00a7 42a-4-303 provides rules for determining the priority between, inter alia, a setoff or judicial execution and an item, and not between an execution and a bank setoff. Because \u00a7 42a-4-303 does not apply to the circumstances of this case, which involve a priority dispute between Josef\u2019s judicial execution and the bank\u2019s setoff, the bank contends that the plaintiff cannot prevail on its cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The first issue before us is whether \u00a7 42a-4-303, which is identical to \u00a7 4-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code, resolves a priority dispute between a judicial execution and a bank\u2019s setoff. The priority disputes that \u00a7 42a-4-303 addresses are those between an \u201citem,\u201d on the one hand, and legal process such as a judicial execution or garnishment, a setoff by the payor bank, a bankruptcy petition or a stop payment order, on the other hand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A.L.I., Uniform Commercial Code (12th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Ed. 1990) \u00a7 4-303 and comments 1 and 2. The term \u201citem\u201d is defined by \u00a7 42a-4-104 (a) (9) as \u201can instrument or a promise or order to pay money handled by a bank for collection or payment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In order to come within \u00a7 42a-4-303, either the bank\u2019s setoff or Josef\u2019s postjudgment judicial execution would, therefore, have to be an \u201citem.\u201d We agree with the bank that neither the setoff nor the execution order is an \u201citem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The right of setoff, although it may arise out of a written instrument, is a common law equitable right that is not itself a written instrument. A setoff involves \u201c[t]he equitable right to cancel or offset mutual debts or cross demands, commonly used by a bank in reducing a customer\u2019s checking or other deposit account in satisfaction of a debt the customer owes the bank.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) p. 1372; see <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Merchants National Bank, </em>108 Conn. 497, 499-500, 144 A. 34 (1928). A setoff is, therefore, not an \u201citem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>A postjudgment judicial execution or garnishment involves an order issued under authority of the court allowing a judgment creditor to obtain satisfaction of a judgment by reaching debts due from a third party, such as a banking institution, to the judgment debtor. General Statutes \u00a7 52-367a; <em>Hospital of St. Raphael </em>v. <em>New Haven Savings Bank, </em>205 Conn. 604, 608, 534 A.2d 1189 (1987); see also 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1970) \u00a7 56 (garnishment permits plaintiff to reach debts owed to defendant, personal property of defendant held by third parties and any benefits owed to defendant from deceased person\u2019s estate). A court-issued legal process, a judicial execution or garnishment is not \u201can instrument, order or promise\u201d and, therefore, is not an \u201citem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Other courts that have considered priority disputes between a postjudgment judicial execution on a bank and a bank\u2019s right of setoff have similarly concluded that Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 4-303 is not applicable to such a dispute. See, e.g., <em>Pittsburgh National Bank </em>v. <em>United States, </em>657 F.2d 36, 39 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>Ebsary Foundation Co. </em>v. <em>Barnett Bank of South Florida, N.A., </em>569 So. 2d 806, 806-807 (Fla. App. 1990); <em>Victor Werlhof Aviation Ins. </em>v. <em>Garlick, </em>237 Mont. 51, 771 P.2d 962, 967 (1989). Leading commentators on the Uniform Commercial Code have taken the same position. See B. Clark, The Law of Bank Deposits, Collections and Credit Cards (3d Ed. 1990) \u00b6 5.04 [7] [c], p. 5-105, \u00b6 14.05 [3], p. 14-17 and n.66, and (Cum. Sup. 1994) \u00b6 5.04 [7] [a], p. S5-19; 1 J. White &amp; R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (3d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 18-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Our determination that \u00a7 42a-4-303 does not apply in the circumstances of this case does not, however, end this matter. The question remains whether the alie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>gations in Josef\u2019s complaint encompass an actionable complaint that survives the inapplicability of \u00a7 42a-4-303. We disagree with the bank\u2019s contention that the complaint stands or falls with \u00a7 42a-4-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u201cIt is fundamental in our law that the right of a plaintiff to recover is limited to the allegations of [its] complaint.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lundberg </em>v. <em>Kovacs, </em>172 Conn. 229, 232, 374 A.2d 201 (1977). However, \u201c[t]he modern trend, which is followed in Connecticut, is to construe pleadings broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Town Oil Co., </em>207 Conn. 575, 587-88, 542 A.2d 1124 (1988); <em>Fuessenich </em>v. <em>DiNardo, </em>195 Conn. 144, 150-51, 487 A.2d 514 (1985). As long as the pleadings provide sufficient notice of the facts claimed and the issues to be tried and do not surprise or prejudice the opposing party, we will not conclude that the complaint is insufficient to allow recovery. <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>215 Conn. 450, 459, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990), on remand, 24 Conn. App. 377, 588 A.2d 656 (1991), rev\u2019d, 222 Conn. 233, 610 A.2d 574 (1992); <em>Giulletti </em>v. <em>Connecticut Ins. Placement Facility, </em>205 Conn. 424, 434, 534 A.2d 213 (1987); see also <em>Web Press Services Corp. </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 342, 359-60, 525 A.2d 57 (1987); see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 109.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Furthermore, \u201ca judgment ordinarily cures pleading defects . . . .\u201d <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 458. \u201cThe absence of a requisite allegation in a complaint that would have justified the granting of a motion to strike, however, is not a sufficient basis for vacating a judgment unless the pleading defect has resulted in prejudice. [I]f parties will insist on going to trial on issues framed in a slovenly manner, they must abide the verdict; judgment will not be arrested for faults in statement when facts sufficient to support the judgment have been substantially put in issue and found. . . . Want of precision in alleging the cause of an injury for which an action is brought, is waived by contesting the case upon its merits without questioning such defect.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The bank would have us focus solely on paragraph ten of the first two counts of Josef\u2019s complaint, which alleges that \u201cthe defendant bank failed to act upon such execution according to \u00a7 42a-4-303 of the Connecticut General Statutes before its midnight deadline as defined in \u00a7 42a-4-104 (a) (10) of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d We decline to read the complaint so narrowly. The gravamen of the first two counts in Josef\u2019s complaint is that the bank improperly dishonored the judicial execution authorized by \u00a7 52-367a because the bank exercised its right of setoff in an untimely manner, namely, after the midnight deadline as defined in \u00a7 42a-4-104 (a) (10).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, the language in paragraph ten of the first two counts of Josef\u2019s complaint mirrors the language contained within \u00a7 52-367a, which specifies the manner in which the bank is required to act upon service of an execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The procedural history of this case demonstrates that it was neither brought nor tried solely on the basis of \u00a7 42a-4-303. The bank never moved to strike either of the first two counts in the complaint, which focused on \u00a7 52-367a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the issue regarding the allegations in Josefs complaint was raised and decided in favor of Josef in the trial court, as evidenced by the trial court\u2019s judgment for Josef on the first two counts, premised, in part, on the finding that the bank had \u201cfailed to act within the midnight deadline.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Notably, the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision contains no mention of \u00a7 42a-4-303. Finally, at oral argument before us, the bank conceded that it was neither surprised nor prejudiced at trial that the issues in this case revolved around \u00a7 52-367a and the application of the midnight deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we reject the bank\u2019s construction of Josef\u2019s complaint. We conclude that Josef raised an actionable claim regarding the bank\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 52-367a and that the bank had sufficient notice of this cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The bank next challenges the finding of the trial court that the setoff was untimely because it occurred after the midnight deadline. The bank\u2019s challenge is twofold. The first question the bank raises is whether, as a matter of law, the midnight deadline defined in \u00a7 42a-4-104 (a) (10) applies to the bank\u2019s exercise of its right of setoff in response to a service of execution under \u00a7 52-367a. The second question the bank raises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>is whether, assuming the applicability of the midnight deadline, the bank, as a matter of fact, exercised its right of setoff in timely fashion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We must first determine the rules that govern the time within which a bank must act on a \u00a7 52-367a service of execution. The relevant portion of \u00a7 52-367a provides: \u201cSuch banking institution [served with an execution and upon which demand is made of any debts from such banking institution to a judgment debtor] shall act upon such execution according to section 42a-4-303 before its midnight deadline, as defined in section 42a-4-104.\u201d The bank maintains that, because \u00a7 42a-4-303 does not apply in the circumstances of this case, the midnight deadline is equally inapplicable. Josef maintains, to the contrary, that \u00a7 52-367a imposes the midnight deadline by its own terms even though \u00a7 42a-4-303 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u201cWe approach this question according to well established principles of statutory construction designed to further our fundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Fahy, </em>227 Conn. 505, 512, 630 A.2d 1328 (1993); <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>228 Conn. 498, 507-508, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994); <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 459-60, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>600 A.2d 310 (1991); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 63-66, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The words of the statute are ambiguous. It is unclear whether the phrase \u201cbefore its midnight deadline\u201d modifies the phrase \u201caccording to section 42a-4-303\u201d or \u201cact upon such execution.\u201d The scant legislative history of \u00a7 52-367a is not specifically helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In resolving this ambiguity, we must turn to the policy advanced by the statute. That policy is to afford judgment creditors an effective method for levying on the bank accounts of their judgment debtors. It is reasonable for us to effectuate this policy by assuming that the legislature intended \u201cbefore its midnight deadline\u201d to modify \u201cact upon such execution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">If, as the bank urges, the midnight deadline is tied to the applicability of \u00a7 42a-4-303, then \u00a7 52-367a would contain no express time constraints within which a bank is required to act upon an execution when the competing priority involves not an \u201citem,\u201d but another legal event such as a bank\u2019s right of setoff. The legislature has, however, at a minimum, manifested its intent that a bank should not have an unlimited time within which to respond to an execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">First, in enacting \u00a7 52-367a the legislature explicitly referred to two Uniform Commercial Code provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 42a-4-303 and 42a-4-104. By including these references, the legislature has made article four of the code the departure point for our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Second, article four of the Uniform Commercial Code governs bank deposits and collections and delineates the duties of a payor bank with regard to various commercial transactions, such as items and other legal events, including executions. See General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4-101 et seq. Under article four, these duties include the requirement of observance of the midnight deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>If \u00a7 52-367a does not incorporate the midnight deadline directly, the statute must be interpreted as requiring a bank to act within a reasonable time. Neither the text of the statute nor its obvious purpose of protecting the rights of a judicial lien creditor suggests that a bank has an unlimited amount of time in which to act upon an execution pursuant to \u00a7 52-367a. The reasonable time requirement, in turn, is informed, by analogy, by the provisions of article four. We have often drawn upon provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code as a source of analogy for the emergent common law. See, e.g., <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>227 Conn. 270, 281-82, 630 A.2d 1010 (1993) (real property); <em>Hospital of St. Raphael </em>v. <em>New Haven Savings Bank, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 610-11 (passbook savings account); <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Home, </em>202 Conn. 106, 114, 520 A.2d 162 (1987) (automobile leasing agreement); <em>New England Yacht Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>198 Conn. 624, 630, 504 A.2d 506 (1986) (transfer of title of personal property); <em>Olean </em>v. <em>Treglia, </em>190 Conn. 756, 762, 463 A.2d 242 (1983) (real property); <em>Conference Center Ltd. </em>v. <em>TRC, </em>189 Conn. 212, 225, 455 A.2d 857 (1983) (real property).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u201cWe proceed, therefore, to a more fundamental principle of adjudication. Just as the legislature is presumed to enact legislation that renders the body of the law coherent and consistent, rather than contradictory and inconsistent . . . courts must discharge their responsibility, in case by case adjudication, to assure that the body of the law\u2014both common and statutory\u2014remains coherent and consistent.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Fahy, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 513-14. \u201cStatutes are now central to the law in the courts, and judicial lawmaking must take statutes into account virtually all of the time. . . .

The code was drafted to simplify, clarify, modernize and unify the law of commercial transactions. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-1-102 (2). In order to achieve certainty and predictability in commercial dealings, \u201cthe drafters of the Code found it necessary to engage in line drawing\u201d; <em>Citizens &amp; Peoples National Bank of Pensacola </em>v. <em>United States, </em>570 F.2d 1279, 1283-84 (5th Cir. 1978); such as by creating deadlines by which commercial actors were required to act upon certain events. Article four of the Uniform Commercial Code states the \u201cprincipal rules of the bank collection process.\u201d A.L.I., Uniform Commercial Code (12th Ed. 1990) \u00a7 4-101, comment 1. The code establishes the midnight deadline<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as the standard time frame within which a payor bank<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> must pay an item.

The midnight deadline arguably was intended by the legislature to apply directly even in transactions not governed by \u00a7 42a-4-303. Alternatively, if \u00a7 52-367a has no express time limitation for transactions that are not governed by \u00a7 42a-4-303, the bank must act within a reasonable time, and that reasonable time period is, by analogy, defined as the midnight deadline that is the baseline generally for article four provisions governing payouts by banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Having determined that the midnight deadline, as defined in \u00a7 42a-4-104 (a) (10), is the applicable time limitation within which a bank must act upon a \u00a7 52-367a execution, the trial court appropriately concluded that the bank was required to exercise its competing right to a setoff before the expiration of that deadline. The bank maintains that the trial court improperly found that the bank had not taken definitive steps to manifest its exercise of a setoff within that prescribed time period.

Although we have not previously addressed this specific question, we are persuaded that the bank must produce evidence of the time when it took some positive act manifesting that a setoff was actually made. This is the rule enunciated by the leading case of <em>Baker </em>v. <em>National City Bank of Cleveland, </em>511 F.2d 1016 (6th Cir. 1975) (applying Ohio law).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That court held that \u201cthe act of setoff is not com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>p\u00edete until three steps have been taken: (1) the decision to exercise the right, (2) some action which accomplishes the setoff and (3) some record which evidences that the right of setoff has been exercised.\u201d Id., 1018. The court quoted approvingly from an official comment to \u00a7 4-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which states that \u201c \u2018[i]n the case of setoff the effective time is when the setoff is actually made.\u2019 \u201d Id.; A.L.I., Uniform Commercial Code (12th Ed. 1990) \u00a7 4-303, comment 5. On the basis of that comment, the court stated: \u201cIt is clear from this language that a setoff does not occur automatically each time a bank holds the matured debt of a depositor. The setoff must be \u2018actually made.\u2019 We do not hold that [Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 4-303], standing alone, disposes of the issue in this case. However, it is a further sign which points to a policy of the State of Ohio, and of all states that have adopted the Uniform Commercial Code, which requires that <em>internal banking transactions involving adverse interests be evidenced by bookkeeping entries or some similarly binding overt act. </em>This policy not only provides criteria for determining conflicting claims, but also assures those who deal with banks that their rights will not be defeated by unsupported internal declarations of a self-serving nature.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Baker </em>v. <em>National City Bank of Cleveland, </em>supra, 1018; see also <em>In re Saugus General Hospital, Inc., </em>698 F.2d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank, </em>538 F.2d 1101, 1107 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 945, 97 S.

Furthermore, we hold that, consistent with the certainty and predictability required by banking operations in the commercial world, the act must be unequivocal, objectively ascertainable and final in order to be overt and binding. Cf. <em>Citizens &amp; Peoples National Bank of Pensacola </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 570 F.2d 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We now address the bank\u2019s challenge to the validity of the trial court\u2019s finding that its effectuation of its right to a setoff was untimely, in light of the standard just articulated. In determining that the setoff had not been effectuated by the midnight deadline, the court stated that it \u201crejected] the self-serving testimony of the bank employees who testified that the proof tickets were sufficient to debit the account. The proof tickets, although prepared by the employees who testified, also have a box marked \u2018Approved by,\u2019 which were signed by [another] bank official who did not appear to testify. The court is not convinced that the proof slips were, in fact, approved on the day noted on the slips, since the statement records the setoff the following day after the midnight deadline in both instances. The court was offered no plausible explanation why the defendant bank could not have debited the Hogan account within the midnight deadline on the statement of their depositor Hogan if, in fact, this is what they intended to do. The court places more credence on the Hogan statement as to the date the account was debited than the statements of the defendant\u2019s employees who tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tified that the accounts were debited on the date they prepared the \u2018proof tickets.\u2019 \u201d The bank has offered no persuasive argument why these findings of the trial court should be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u201cJudgments pertaining to the resolution of conflicting factual claims lie within the province of the trial court.\u201d <em>Edens </em>v. <em>Kole Construction Co., </em>188 Conn. 489, 495, 450 A.2d 1161 (1982). \u201cIt is familiar law that [it] was for the trial court to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of the witnesses. This court cannot and will not weigh the evidence contained in the record before us. . . .If there is sufficient evidence in the record in support of the decision of the trial court such decision must be affirmed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cashman </em>v. <em>Calvo, </em>196 Conn. 509, 513-14, 493 A.2d 891 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We cannot second-guess the trial court\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses produced by the bank. \u201cIt is the trial court which had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and parties; thus, it is best able to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to draw necessary inferences therefrom.\u201d <em>Kukanskis </em>v. <em>Jasut, </em>169 Conn. 29, 32-33, 362 A.2d 898 (1975). \u201cA trier of fact is free to reject testimony even if it is uncontradicted . . . and is equally free to reject part of the testimony of a witness even if other parts have been found credible.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Barrila v. <em>Blake, </em>190 Conn. 631, 639, 461 A.2d 1375 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Our review of the record discloses no basis for disturbing the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly determined that, after having been served with Josef\u2019s execution, the bank failed to effectuate its right of setoff within the applicable midnight deadline as required by \u00a7 52-367a. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>that the bank violated \u00a7 52-367a as alleged in counts one and two of Josef\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The bank next claims that the trial court improperly-concluded that it had violated CUTPA. Again, this challenge is twofold. First, the bank contends that CUTPA does not apply to banks. Second, the bank argues that even if banks are, in principle, subject to CUTPA, its actions in this case after having been served with Josefs \u00a7 52-367a execution did not amount to a CUTPA violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The bank first argues that the trial court improperly determined that CUTPA applies to banks. The bank emphasizes that the legislature has instructed the courts and the commissioner of consumer protection to look to the Federal Trade Commission Act for guidance in the interpretation of CUTPA. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (b);<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>200 Conn. 172, 178-79, 510 A.2d 972 (1986). Because \u00a7 5 (a) (2) of the Federal Trade Commission Act specifically exempts banks from its coverage,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>maintains that we should similarly construe CUTPA as being inapplicable to banks. Furthermore, because banks are regulated by state authorities and by federal authorities other than the Federal Trade Commission, the bank argues that this pattern of pervasive regulation is analogous to the regulation of the securities industry, which we held to be exempt from CUTPA in <em>Russell v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>supra, 172. We disagree with the bank\u2019s arguments and hold that CUTPA does apply to banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">CUTPA provides that \u201c[n]o person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a). Our starting point in interpreting the scope of CUTPA is \u00a7 42-110b (d), which provides that \u201c[i]t is the intention of the legislature that this chapter be remedial and be so construed.\u201d See <em>Web Press Services Corp. </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>supra, 203 Conn. 354; <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>190 Conn. 510, 520, 461 A.2d 938 (1983); <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 615 n.4, 440 A.2d 810 (1981). Furthermore, a party claiming an exemption from CUTPA has the burden of proof. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110c (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">On their face, the definitional sections of CUTPA include banks. A bank is a \u201cperson,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 42-110a (3),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and is engaged in the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201ctrade\u201d or \u201ccommerce,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 42-110a (4).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Unless the bank can establish some extrinsic ground of exemption, its conduct with respect to a judicial execution under \u00a7 52-367a is, therefore, an act or practice that comes within the regulatory ambit of CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Furthermore, CUTPA expressly provides exceptions from its coverage that exclude a variety of commercial transactions but do not provide a blanket exemption for banks. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110c.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We have repeatedly observed that courts should not interpret legislation to enlarge existing statutory exemptions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Turello, </em>183 Conn. 330, 335, 439 A.2d 364 (1981); see also <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 718-20, 513 A.2d 43 (1986); <em>Downer </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>134 Conn. 555, 560, 59 A.2d 290 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The fact that banks are exempt from the Federal Trade Commission Act does not establish their exemption from CUTPA. Read precisely, \u00a7 42-110b (b) urges us to be guided only by \u201cSection 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act . . . .\u201d Banks, however, derive their federal exemption from \u00a7 5 (a) (2) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Federal Trade Commission Act. See footnote 19. It is entirely logical that our legislature would have referred to \u00a7 5 (a) (1), rather than to the Federal Trade Commission Act in its entirety, because \u00a7 5 (a) (1) is the source of the substantive standards that the Federal Trade Commission has established to regulate unfair trade practices.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">It would be inconsistent with the remedial purposes of CUTPA for us to broaden the reference in \u00a7 42-110b (b) to \u00a7 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act to incorporate the blanket exemption for banks that is contained in \u00a7 5 (a) (2) of the federal act. \u201cThe General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them. And it is always presumed to have intended that effect which its action or non-action produces.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 417, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988). This presumption includes knowledge, not only of existing Connecticut statutes, but also of all federal statutes, including the Federal Trade Commission Act. Since CUTPA includes its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>exemption section, \u00a7 42-110c, it is plain that the legislature recognized that some limitations on the scope of CUTPA were desirable. Had it wanted to include banks within those limitations, it knew how to do so. See <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 551, 494 A.2d 564 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 223, 479 A.2d 814 (1984); <em>Edmundson </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>169 Conn. 630, 635, 363 A.2d 1031 (1975). Courts should not create exemptions that the legislature has not enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The bank argues, however, that the banking industry is entitled to an implied exemption from CUTPA by analogy to the implied exemption of the securities industry that this court recognized in <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 172, despite the absence of an express exemption in CUTPA for securities transactions. In <em>Russell, </em>we framed the question of applicability as \u201cnot whether [the suspect] transactions are exempt from CUTPA but whether CUTPA itself can fairly be interpreted to encompass such transactions in the first instance.\u201d Id., 178. In determining that securities transactions were not subject to CUTPA, we engaged in a four part analysis. That analysis was refined and applied in <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 661-63, 509 A.2d 11 (1986), and <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>213 Conn. 354, 361-64, 567 A.2d 1212 (1990). To determine whether the suspect transactions should be exempt from CUTPA, we examine: (1) the applicability of Federal Trade Commission rules to the suspect conduct and the absence of any Federal Trade Commission regulatory activity over industry practices; (2) the existence and scope of an alternate comprehensive regulatory scheme or system; (3) the absence of any activity by the commissioner of consumer protection within this area; and (4) the case law of other jurisdictions. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>supra, 179-84. Applying this four part analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>to the bank\u2019s activities in this case, we conclude that banks are not exempt from CUTPA coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The first part of this analysis asks whether the Federal Trade Commission regulates the banking industry, directly or indirectly. Although banks are not directly subject to the Federal Trade Commission; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45 (a) (2) (1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Philadelphia National Bank, </em>374 U.S. 321, 336 and n.11, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963);<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the banking industry, unlike the securities industry, is affected by Federal Trade Commission rules and regulations. The Federal Trade Commission has the authority to promulgate rules, regulations and policy guidelines that define unfair or deceptive practices and that significantly impact the conduct of banks. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 57a (a) and (f) (1988).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Once the Federal Trade Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>has promulgated a rule, bank boards, which have enforcement authority over banks in order to prevent unfair and deceptive practices, have sixty days to promulgate a substantially similar regulation. Such parallel regulations are required unless the appropriate board finds that the acts or practices are not unfair or deceptive, or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System finds that implementation of similar regulations with respect to banks would \u201cseriously con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>flict with essential monetary and payments systems policies of [the Federal Reserve] Board . . . .\u201d15 U.S.C. \u00a7 57a (f) (1) (1988). Thus, although the Federal Trade Commission is not directly responsible for preventing unfair and deceptive acts or practices with respect to banks, it has been given the leadership role in defining what conduct constitutes unfair or deceptive acts or practices in that industry. In effect, the substance of any rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission applies to banks unless the banks have specifically been exempted under the two narrow exceptions provided in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 57a (f) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">CUTPA\u2019s rule making scheme is similar. Once the commissioner of consumer protection promulgates a regulation pursuant to \u00a7 42-110b (c),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> that regulation applies to the conduct of banks unless the commissioner of banking specifically permits such conduct, thereby making that conduct exempt from CUTPA\u2019s ambit as per \u00a7 42-110c (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The Federal Trade Commission has in fact exercised its authority to promulgate rules and regulations with regard to unfair and deceptive acts or practices that affect the conduct of banks. Compare FTC Preservation of Consumers\u2019 Claims and Defenses Rule, 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 433 (1993) (\u201cHolder in Due Course Rule\u201d or \u201cSeller Rule\u201d), with Comptroller of the Currency, Banking Circular No. 68 [1973-1978 Transfer Binder] Fed.

By contrast, the Federal Trade Commission has never undertaken to define deceptive practices in the sale and purchase of securities. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The second part of our analysis requires us to determine whether banks are so comprehensively regulated by a different regime that CUTPA should not apply. In <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 180, we recognized that securities transactions were comprehensively regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. See Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a et seq., and Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a et seq. We also examined the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act (CUSA); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36-470 through 36-502; and its predecessor acts. We noted that these predecessor laws provided a private cause of action for security transaction violations well before CUTPA had been enacted; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>supra, 181-82; and that CUSA provided not only a private cause of action, but also all of the same remedies that one could obtain by bringing an action under CUTPA, except for punitive damages. Id., 175-76.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We thus determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>existence and scope of a comprehensive regulatory regime under both federal and state law precluded application of CUTPA to securities transactions. Id., 180-84.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">While banks are arguably comprehensively regulated under federal law,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> even national banks, which are instrumentalities of the federal government, have always been subject to the laws of the state in which they do business. State laws are preempted only when their operation expressly conflicts with the laws of the United States. <em>McClellan </em>v. <em>Chipman, </em>164 U.S. 347, 356-57, 17 S. Ct. 85, 41 L.

No claim of preemption has been made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Banks are not so comprehensively regulated under state law<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> as to be exempt from CUTPA. The bank has failed to point to and we have been unable to find any statute or regulation that encompasses the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>type and scope of unfair trade practices that are proscribed by CUTPA. More specifically, we have been unable to find any statute or regulation that regulates a bank\u2019s duties with regard to its right to set off an account when dealing with others, such as garnishers, who have a direct adverse interest in that same account. Unlike <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 172, in which we determined that CUTPA was redundant in light of the pervasive remedial provisions for securities transactions contained in CUSA, we have been unable to locate a comparable remedial scheme within this state\u2019s banking regulatory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The mere existence of generic state and federal banking regulations does not exclude CUTPA coverage. CUTPA is applicable even when its regulatory scheme overlaps that authorized by another statute or regulation. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 662-63; see also <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 510; <em>Perdue </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank, </em>38 Cal. 3d 913, 702 P.2d 503, 216 Cal. Rptr. 345 (1985), appeal dismissed, 475 U.S. 1001, 106 S. Ct. 1170, 89 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1986). CUTPA recognizes the possibility of overlap in its provision that expressly exempts transactions within its ambit only when such transactions or actions are \u201cotherwise <em>permitted </em>under law as administered by any regulatory [regime] acting under statutory authority of the state or of the United States.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 42-110c (a) (1). In <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 361, we held that the actions of a municipal housing authority in leasing and renting apartments were exempt from CUTPA scrutiny because such actions were <em>\u201cexpressly authorized </em>and pervasively regulated by both the state department of housing and [the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development].\u201d (Emphasis added.) No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>banking regulation of which we are aware expressly authorizes a bank to delay its response to a judicial execution under \u00a7 52-367a.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">In the third part of this analysis, we consider whether the commissioner of consumer protection, the state administrator responsible for enforcing CUTPA, has undertaken regulatory activities with respect to the subject area. In <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 182, we determined that the commissioner of consumer protection had never purported to regulate the conduct of securities transactions. By contrast, the commissioner of consumer protection has invoked CUTPA authority to compel Connecticut banks to comply with an investigative demand for information about real estate lending practices within the banking industry. <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank for Savings, </em>1977-1 Trade Cases (CCH) \u00b6 61,311 (Conn. Common Pleas 1977). In 1986, the attorney general, at the request of the commissioner of consumer protection, brought a CUTPA action against, among others, thirty-five banks for involvement in home improvement financing irregularities. See amended complaint, <em>State </em>v. <em>The Dartmouth Plan, Inc., </em>United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, Docket No. H 86-627 (dated March 10, 1987).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Finally, the last part of this analysis consists of an inquiry into the case law of other jurisdictions. Although not unanimous, most state courts have determined that banks are subject to the provisions of their state\u2019s unfair or deceptive trade practices or consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>protection statutes.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Heastie </em>v. <em>Community Bank of Greater Peoria, </em>727 F. Sup. 1133 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (applying Illinois consumer fraud statute); <em>Perdue </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank, </em>supra, 38 Cal. 3d 913; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Security Pacific National Bank, </em>23 Cal. 3d 442, 591 P.2d 51, 153 Cal. Rptr. 28 (1979); <em>First National Bank of Anthony </em>v. <em>Dunning, </em>18 Kan. App. 2d 518, 855 P.2d 493 (1993); <em>Raymer </em>v. <em>Bay State National Bank, </em>384 Mass. 310, 424 N.E.2d 515 (1981); <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Michigan National Bank, </em>110 Mich. App. 106, 312 N.W.2d 405 (1981), rev\u2019d in part, 414 Mich. 948, 325 N.W.2d 777 (1982); <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Norwest Bank, </em>255 Mont. 317, 843 P.2d 327 (1992); <em>Ashlock </em>v. <em>Sunwest Bank of Roswell, N.A., </em>107 N.M. 100, 753 P.2d 346 (1988); <em>Pennsylvania Bankers Assn. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>58 Pa. Commw. 170, 427 A.2d 730 (1981); <em>Vogt </em>v. <em>Seattle-First National Bank, </em>117 Wash. 2d 541, 817 P.2d 1364 (1991). Two of the four state courts that have ruled to the contrary relied on explicit statutory exemptions for banks. See <em>Preferred Investment Corp. </em>v. <em>Neucere, </em>592 So. 2d 889 (La. App. 1991), cert. denied, 597 So. 2d 1028 (La. 1992); <em>First Financial Bank </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>492 So. 2d 503 (La. App. 1986); <em>Little </em>v. <em>Gillette, </em>218 Neb. 271, 354 N.W.2d 147 (1984). The remaining minority of courts either incorporated the exemption in the Federal Trade Commission Act; <em>Idaho First National Bank </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>100 Idaho 256, 596 P.2d 429 (1979); or concluded that banks were sufficiently and pervasively regulated by other regulatory agencies. <em>NCNB National Bank of North Carolina v. Tiller, </em>814 F.2d 931 (4th Cir. 1987) (applying South Carolina law); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank, </em>294 S.C. 387, 365 S.E.2d 26 (1987), overruled in part by <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Dick Dyer &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>304 S.C. 152, 403 S.E.2d 310 (1991) (overruled to extent that <em>Anderson </em>was based on \u201cgeneral activity\u201d test).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Our conclusion to apply CUTPA to banks is particularly bolstered by the fact that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts reached a similar conclusion; <em>Raymer </em>v. <em>Bay State National Bank, </em>supra, 384 Mass. 310; because the \u201cgoverning statutes in Massachusetts are virtually identical to our own.\u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 183. We have, therefore, repeatedly looked to the reasoning and decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts with regard to the scope of CUTPA. Id.; <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Applying this four part analysis to the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the banking industry, unlike the securities industry, is governed by CUTPA. In light of the text of CUTPA and our case law, the bank has failed to establish its right to a blanket exemption from CUTPA\u2019s regulation of unfair trade practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The bank\u2019s final claim is that the trial court, even if it properly concluded that CUTPA applies to banks, improperly concluded that the manner in which the bank responded to Josef\u2019s \u00a7 52-367a execution constituted a CUTPA violation. The trial court found that the bank had violated CUTPA by: (1) failing to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 52-367a after having been served with Josef\u2019s executions; and (2) sending notices that, without mentioning the setoffs, informed the sheriff that there were no available funds in the account. At oral argument in this court, however, Josef restated its CUTPA complaint as focusing not on the bank\u2019s intrinsic right of setoff, but on the bank\u2019s allegedly deceptive disclosures that there were insufficient funds in Hogan\u2019s account to satisfy the executions.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>review of the trial court\u2019s determination of a CUTPA violation by the bank is, thus, limited to whether the bank\u2019s disclosures were deceptive and violated CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u201cIt is well settled that in determining whether [an act or] practice violates CUTPA we have \u2018adopted the criteria set out in the \u201ccigarette rule\u201d by the federal trade commission for determining when [an act or] practice is unfair: \u201c(1) [W]hether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise\u2014whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers [competitors or other businessmen].\u201d <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>[191 Conn. 484, 492-93, 464 A.2d 847 (1983)], quoting FTC v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 244-45 n.5, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972) . . . .\u2019 <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>192 Conn. 558, 567-68, 473 A.2d 1185 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u201c \u2018All three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three. Statement of Basis and Purpose, Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures, 43 Fed. Reg. 59,614, [and] 59,635 (1978).\u2019 (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 569 n.15. \u2018Thus a violation of CUTPA may be established by showing either an actual deceptive practice; see, e.g., <em>Sprayfoam, Inc. </em>v. <em>Durant\u2019s Rental Centers, Inc., </em>39 Conn. Sup. 78, 468 A.2d 951 (1983); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>or a practice amounting to a violation of public policy. See, e.g., <em>Sportmen\u2019s Boating Corporation </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>[192 Conn. 747, 474 A.2d 780 (1984)].\u2019 <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>[supra, 203 Conn. 355]. Furthermore, a party need not prove an intent to deceive to prevail under CUTPA. See id., 363 (knowledge of falsity, either constructive or actual, need not be proven to establish CUTPA violation).\u201d <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 105-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The trial court found that both of the bank\u2019s notifications to the sheriff who had served the bank with Josef\u2019s execution were deceptive and constituted CUTPA violations. The trial court focused on the fact that the bank\u2019s notices stated that there were \u201cno available funds\u201d and did not mention the bank\u2019s setoffs. The trial court stated: \u201cThis response . . . was deceptive and came close to a misrepresentation. The actions of the [bank] in this case were unfair, illegal, they offended public policy and above all, they were an affront to this court.\u201d We disagree with the trial court\u2019s findings and conclude that the bank\u2019s notifications did not violate CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We note, at the outset, that our review of the trial court\u2019s determination is hampered by the ambiguity of the trial court\u2019s finding that each of the bank\u2019s responses \u201ccame close to a misrepresentation.\u201d We will assume that the trial court\u2019s characterization reflects its finding that, while accurate on their face, the notices were misleading because of their failure to disclose that it was the bank\u2019s exercise of its right of setoff that led to the unavailability of funds for Josef, the executing judgment creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">A failure to disclose can be deceptive only if, in light of all the circumstances, there is a duty to disclose. Josef has pointed to no authority that would support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the conclusion that a bank served with an execution has a duty to disclose anything more than that the garnished funds are not available. A bank account may be depleted by any number of competing claimants. If the bank, after having been served with an execution, had properly honored competing checks written on the judgment debtor\u2019s account; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4-303; and the honoring of those checks had left the account with insufficient funds to pay the judgment creditor based on the execution, the bank would be required only to disclose that the funds in the account were insufficient and not the reason for the insufficiency. We see no reason to differentiate, for notice purposes, between a bank\u2019s right of setoff and the bank\u2019s honoring of any other competing claim, such as a check.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Although the bank had no duty to disclose, it acted improperly in failing to exercise its right of setoff in timely fashion as defined by the midnight deadline that, earlier in this opinion, we have held to govern \u00a7 52-367a executions. The bank\u2019s notices that the garnished accounts had no available funds were therefore inaccurate in this respect. The trial court did not, however, find that the bank, by giving notices that improperly assumed that the bank\u2019s setoffs had been timely, had intentionally or fraudulently created a false impression. Moreover, the trial court did not find that the bank had attempted to falsify or backdate its records as to when it had effectuated its setoff. The bank\u2019s failure to comply with the midnight deadline, in the circumstances of this case, was therefore no more than a technical violation of \u00a7 52-367a.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The bank\u2019s notices, in substance, were not immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous. The bank\u2019s technical violation of \u00a7 52-367a and the lack of explanation in its concomitant notice did not offend public policy, implicate the concept of unfairness or cause the type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>of substantial injury that CUTPA was designed to address. <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 105-106; see <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 184 Conn. 617 n.7. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly determined that the bank\u2019s actions violated CUTPA.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The judgment is affirmed with respect to the first and second counts of Josef\u2019s complaint. The judgment is reversed with respect to the third count of Josef\u2019s complaint and with respect to the supplemental judgment awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Josef, and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment in favor of the bank on the third count and to deny Josef\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees. The cross appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\"> Although the trial court\u2019s judgment and the memorandum of decision do not state an explicit finding for the bank on count four, the misrepresentation count, a close reading of the memorandum of decision reveals that the trial court considered and implicitly disposed of the fourth count in the bank\u2019s favor. In its discussion of count three, the alleged CUTPA violation, the trial court determined that the bank\u2019s response to Josef\u2019s execution was \u201cdeceptive and came <em>close to a misrepresentation.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) In concluding the memorandum of decision, the court stated that \u201c[\u00a1judgment shall enter for the plaintiff as against the defendant on <em>counts one, two and three of the complaint only </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Although it is preferable for a trial court to make a formal ruling on each count, we will not elevate form over substance when it is apparent from the memorandum of decision that the trial court did not find that a misrepresentation had been made and that Josef did not prevail on the fourth count. We, thus, determine that the rights of the parties were concluded and a final judgment was rendered in this case.
