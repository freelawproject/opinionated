App. 553, 574, 630 A.2d 119 (1993). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, limited to the issues of whether the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the trial court properly: (1) admitted into evidence a statement made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>defendant to a police officer; and (2) denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a competency examination under General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the afternoon of May 6, 1990, the defendant and his stepbrother, Richard Hinds, Jr., drove in the defendant\u2019s car to a pool hall in Springfield, Massachusetts, where they remained for several hours, steadily consuming beer. During their drive home from the pool hall, at approximately 2 a.m., the defendant and Hinds were involved in a one car accident on Route 83 in Somers. The evidence indicated that the defendant\u2019s car went out of control, skidded across the highway, crashed three times into metal guardrails, rolled over and came to a stop on an embankment off the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">After the accident, emergency crews and Connecticut state trooper Tony Dostanko arrived separately at the scene. Upon his arrival, Dostanko observed the defendant and Hinds lying in the front seat of the car, with their bodies intertwined. Due to the position of the bodies, Dostanko was unable to discern who had been operating the car. While medical attendants extricated the defendant and Hinds from the car, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ant, who appeared intoxicated, was very aggressive and combative. He rejected medical attention, argued aggressively with the medical attendants, attempted to remove the neck brace and restraining belt that were attached to the body board used to remove him from the car, and manifested a desire to leave the accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Although Dostanko initially avoided interfering with the medical attendants\u2019 treatment of the defendant, he was eventually summoned by them to assist in calming the defendant. Dostanko responded by cautioning the defendant that \u201che should lie back and allow the medical personnel to do their job for his own safety.\u201d Additionally, Dostanko stayed close to the defendant and shouted at him as he was being placed into the ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Thereafter, Dostanko followed the ambulance as it transported the defendant and Hinds to Johnson Memorial Hospital. When Dostanko arrived at the hospital, the defendant and Hinds were in separate, adjoining emergency rooms. Dostanko observed that the defendant, who continued aggressively to reject medical attention, was injured. Additionally, Dostanko was told by hospital personnel that the defendant was \u201cprobably going to take off.\u201d Dostanko entered the defendant\u2019s room, identified himself to the defendant and asked him if he had been driving the car, to which the defendant replied \u201cNo.\u201d Dostanko next asked the same question of Hinds, who replied that \u201c[the defendant] was driving.\u201d Dostanko returned to the defendant\u2019s room and told the defendant that Hinds had said that the defendant had been driving, to which the defendant replied \u201cAll right, I was [expletive] driving.\u201d Immediately thereafter, Dostanko placed the defendant under arrest and read him his Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rights from a notice of rights form, which the defendant did not sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>At trial, the defendant\u2019s statement that he had been driving the car was admitted through Dostanko\u2019s testimony, over the defendant\u2019s objection. The Appellate Court upheld the validity of this riding.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The defendant first claims that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the incriminating statement that he had made to Dostanko at the hospital, just prior to his arrest. Specifically, the defendant claims that Dostanko elicited the statement during custodial interrogation, without giving him the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). We conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the defendant was not in custody when he made the statement. Accordingly, we conclude that the statement was not obtained by the police in derogation of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">\u201c \u2018Two threshold conditions must be satisfied in order to invoke the warnings constitutionally required by <em>Miranda: </em>(1) the defendant must have been in custody; and (2) the defendant must have been subjected to police interrogation. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>[supra, 384 U.S. 444].\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>227 Conn. 101, 112, 629 A.2d 402 (1993). \u201cThe term \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019 encompasses both of these requirements, and was defined by the <em>Miranda </em>court as \u2018questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>dom of action in any significant way.\u2019 <em>[Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 444].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 158, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981). What constitutes custody for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>was recently reiterated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Stansbury </em>v. <em>California, </em>U.S. , 114 S. Ct. 1526, 1528-29, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1994): \u201cIn determining whether an individual was in custody, a court must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, but \u2018the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there [was] a \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u201d of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u2019 <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 3520, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275 (1983) (per curiam) (quoting <em>[Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977)]).\u201d Further, the United States Supreme Court has adopted an objective, reasonable person test for determining whether a defendant is in custody. <em>Stansbury </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 1529; <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 442, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1984). Thus, in determining whether <em>Miranda </em>rights are required, the only relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would believe that he or she was in police custody of the degree associated with a formal arrest. See <em>Stansbury </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 1529; 1 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure (Sup. 1991) \u00a7 6.6, p. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">No definitive list of factors governs a determination of whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have believed that he or she was in custody. Because, however, the <em>Miranda </em>court expressed concern with protecting defendants against interrogations that take place in a \u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere,\u201d containing \u201cinherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely\u201d; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 384 U.S. 445, 467; circumstances relating to those kinds of concerns are highly relevant on the custody issue. See generally C. Whitebread &amp; C. Slobogin, Criminal Procedure (3d Ed. 1993) \u00a7 16.03, pp. 385-91; 1 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) \u00a7 6.6, pp. 494-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\u201c \u2018The defendant had the initial burden of proving custodial interrogation. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>738 F.2d 686, 692 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>[200 Conn. 642, 647, 513 A.2d 58 (1986)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>[197 Conn. 396, 409, 497 A.2d 956 (1985)]. The trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was not in custody is a finding of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>186 Conn. 287, 292, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982). That finding of fact by the trial corut will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. Id.; see Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>191 Conn. 636, 652, 469 A.2d 1189 (1983). We will, however, carefully review the record to ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 580, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>197 Conn. 180, 185, 496 A.2d 486 (1985).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>209 Conn. 596, 606, 553 A.2d 155 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court properly found that the defendant had failed to prove that he was in custody when Dostanko asked him if he had been driving the car when the accident occurred. For purposes of this claim, the defendant contends that his custody originated at the accident scene, continued during his ambulance ride to the hospital, and carried over to the questioning that took place at the hospital. In contrast, the state argues that the defendant was not in custody either at the accident scene or at the hospital. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the state contends that Dostanko merely acted for a medical purpose and in the interest of public safety at the accident scene. Additionally, the state argues that when Dostanko elicited the incriminating statement from the defendant at the hospital, the defendant had not been subjected to a formal arrest or restraint on his freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 495. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s assertion that he was in custody at the accident scene. In support of this assertion, the defendant does not argue, and the record does not indicate, that Dostanko himself either physically restrained the defendant in any way or ordered the medical attendants to restrain him physically. The defendant also does not argue that Dostanko took advantage of an inherently coercive situation created by any physical restraint that the medical attendants may have asserted against him for purposes of his treatment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>808 F.2d 688, 689 (8th Cir. 1987) <em>(Miranda </em>might apply even if police officer questions suspect in inherently coercive situation created by ambulance attendants rather than law enforcement officers). Rather, the defendant argues solely that Dostanko\u2019s verbal communications to him and Dostanko\u2019s close physical presence near him as he was being placed into the ambulance subjected him to custody. We disagree and conclude that Dostanko acted solely for a medical purpose and in the interest of public safety. Accordingly, his conduct did not create a \u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere\u201d requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 384 U.S. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Despite the defendant\u2019s assertion to the contrary, Dostanko did not place him in custody by virtue of talking to, shouting at, or standing close to him. As already stated, the defendant was very aggressive, combative, appeared intoxicated, and was interfering with his medical treatment at the accident site. In the face of this behavior, Dostanko told the defendant that \u201che should lie back and allow the medical personnel to do their job <em>for his own safety. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Additionally, Dostanko\u2019s conduct as he was being placed into the ambulance was necessary and reasonable for insuring the defendant\u2019s physical well-being and, under the circumstances, would not be perceived by a reasonable person as creating an inherently coercive, police-dominated environment. Moreover, Dostanko\u2019s conduct occurred in public and in view of witnesses who were not police officers\u2014the medical attendants\u2014thereby \u201creducing] the likelihood that [Dostanko would] use oppressive or abusive tactics and rendering] the situation less \u2018police-dominated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>supra, 808 F.2d 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Our review of the record thus discloses police conduct reasonably calculated to maintain the safety of everyone present at the accident site. Under the circumstances of this case, such conduct, in the presence of witnesses who were not police officers, would not have made a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position believe that he or she was subject to a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest. See <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathia-son, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 495. The record, therefore, supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was not in custody at the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Our consideration of the various factors surrounding Dostanko\u2019s questioning of the defendant in the emergency room persuades us that the defendant also was not in custody at the hospital. Again, Dostanko did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>not physically restrain or confine the defendant in any way when questioning him. Additionally, Dostanko, who was the sole law enforcement officer present, questioned the defendant in the public surroundings of a hospital emergency room and in the presence of witnesses who were not police officers, namely medical staff. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>922 F.2d 1343, 1352 (8th Cir. 1990) (\u201c[officers diminish the public character of, and assert their domination over, an interrogation site by removing a suspect from the presence of third persons who could lend moral support\u201d); <em>Archer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 F.2d 124, 125 (5th Cir. 1968) (statement that defendant made to agent of Federal Bureau of Investigation during interview that took place in familiar surrounding of her own place of business while her husband was present was admissible). There is no evidence indicating that the defendant was unable to converse with these other people, express annoyance or request assistance from them. Moreover, the duration of the questioning was momentary. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>573 F.2d 657, 660 (9th Cir. 1978) (custody when defendant interrogated for forty-five minutes), with <em>Allen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 F.2d 476, 479 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (limited and brief inquiry made as part of an investigation not custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\u201cFidelity to the doctrine announced in <em>Miranda </em>requires that it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated.\u201d <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>supra, 468 U.S. 437. In this case, we are persuaded that Dostanko\u2019s temporary questioning of the defendant in the public setting of a hospital did not create the type of inherently coercive, police-dominated atmosphere with which <em>Miranda </em>is concerned. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant was not taken into custody for the purposes of <em>Miranda </em>until Dostanko arrested him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Consequently, the statement the defendant made to Dostanko prior to that point was properly admissible against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a competency examination under General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in violation of his rights to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The following facts are relevant to the disposition of this claim. On January 18, 1991, the defendant\u2019s counsel filed a motion requesting an examination of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. In support of the motion, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>defendant had exhibited \u201cirrational behavior\u201d during prior discussions about possible plea bargain arrangements, the extent of a possible prison sentence and the possible results of a jury trial. Further, the defendant\u2019s counsel asserted that during a pretrial conference the previous day, the defendant had experienced difficulty forming sentences, comprehending the charges against him or understanding his relationship with the victim who is his stepbrother. The state concurred with the description of the defendant\u2019s behavior on the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The trial court thereafter canvassed the defendant, asking him specific questions about his educational background, past mental health, present understanding of the criminal proceedings and the potential consequences of his impending trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>concluded that the defendant had failed to make an adequate showing under \u00a7 54-56d,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Appellate Court affirmed that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The defendant argues that the Appellate Court incorrectly affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a competency hearing under \u00a7 54-56d. Emphasizing the character of his behavior on the day prior to the \u00a7 54-56d motion and his monosyllabic responses to the trial court during the canvass, the defendant argues that this evidence required the trial court to grant his motion for a competency hearing. We reject this argument and conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 54-56d provides that a defendant shall not be tried, convicted or sentenced while incompetent and permits a competency hearing to be held whenever it appears that the defendant \u2018is unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.\u2019 As a matter of due process, the trial court is required to conduct an independent inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competence whenever he makes \u2018specific factual allegations that, if true, would constitute substantial evidence of mental impairment. <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 21, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 10 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1963). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 is a term of art. \u2018Evidence\u2019 encompasses all information properly before the court, whether it is in the form of testimony or exhibits formally admitted or it is in the form of medical reports or other kinds of reports that have been filed with the court. Evidence is \u2018substantial\u2019 if it raises a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s competency . . . .\" <em>Moore v. United States, </em>464 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>F.2d 663, 666 (9th Cir. 1972). <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>[198 Conn. 598, 605, 504 A.2d 497 (1986)]; see <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 385, 86 S. Ct. 836, 15 L. Ed. 2d 815 (1966); <em>de Kaplany </em>v. <em>Enomoto, </em>540 F.2d 975, 982-83 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1075, 97 S. Ct. 815, 50 L. Ed. 2d 793 (1977); <em>People </em>v. <em>Pennington, </em>66 Cal. 2d 508, 518, 426 P.2d 942, 58 Cal. Rptr. 374 (1967). The trial court should carefully weigh the need for a hearing in each case, but this is not to say that a hearing should be available on demand. The decision whether to grant a hearing requires the exercise of sound judicial discretion. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>523 F.2d 665, 667 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Riccardi </em>v. <em>United States, </em>428 F. Sup. 1059, 1064-65 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 573 F.2d 1294 (2d Cir. 1977). \u2018[Prisoners are not entitled and need not be permitted to make bald charges of mental incompetency to stand trial for the purpose simply of obtaining an excursion from the penitentiary. ... A balance must be struck between the practical and the theoretical, and this can best be done by the [trial court].\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>[437 F.2d 1255, 1258 (2d Cir. 1971)], quoting <em>Nelms </em>v. <em>United States, </em>318 F.2d 150, 154 (4th Cir. 1963).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>199 Conn. 359, 365-66, 507 A.2d 992 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a competency hearing because it reasonably concluded that he had failed to raise a reasonable doubt about his competency. After defendant\u2019s counsel brought his \u00a7 54-56d motion, the trial court listened to the evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s recent conduct, potential communication problems and understanding of the criminal charges. The trial court considered the assertions of the defendant\u2019s counsel and solicited the opinion of the prosecutor. Finally, the trial court canvassed the defendant about his understanding of the proceedings against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>his understanding of the plea bargain and his ability to communicate with his counsel and assist in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">As a result of its inquiry, the trial court reasonably could have found that the defendant: (1) did not suffer from any known or apparent mental illness or defect that would impair the defendant\u2019s ability to understand the criminal proceedings or to assist in his own defense; (2) possessed minimum communication skills such as the ability to read and write; (3) understood the basic charges against him and his rights to accept or reject a plea bargain; and (4) understood the consequences of accepting or rejecting a plea bargain. Further, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant\u2019s occasional response, \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d during the canvassing referred not to the defendant\u2019s comprehension of the substance of the proceedings, but only to his frustration about the apparently lengthy duration of the pretrial proceedings and the time necessary to strike a plea bargain with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Equally important, this is not a case where the trial court disregarded psychiatric, medical or historical testimony relevant to the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. The defendant proffered no evidence to establish or suggest a sufficient pattern of behavior that would raise, in and of itself, a reasonable doubt about his competency. <em>See Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 178-79, 95 S. Ct. 896, 43 L. Ed. 2d 103 (1975) (trial court required to give proper weight to defendant\u2019s recent attempt at suicide and spouse\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s history of disturbed mental state); <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 383 U.S. 385-86 (trial court\u2019s decision not to grant competency hearing on its own motion improperly ignored testimony of defendant\u2019s history of \u201cpronounced irrational behavior\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Auen, </em>846 F.2d 872, 878 (2d Cir. 1988) (consistent exhibition of \u201cbizarre\u201d behavior prior to and during trial requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>further competency hearing); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 605-606 (unsubstantiated references to psychiatric treatment and medication fail to trigger <em>Pate </em>inquiry). Further, the preliminary hearing revealed nothing to indicate that the defendant was under the influence of potentially mind-altering medication or other drugs that might have undermined his competency to stand trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>205 Conn. 673, 687, 535 A.2d 345 (1987) (trial court properly ordered new competency examination after learning defendant had been given antipsychotic drug previous night). Instead, the defendant supported his motion exclusively with limited instances of his prior \u201cirrational behavior\u201d while meeting with his counsel, his apparent communication and comprehension difficulties during a pretrial conference on the prior day and the brevity of his responses during the canvassing. None of these, either alone or in combination, required the trial court to order a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Although we acknowledge the defendant\u2019s contention that the opinion of the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cis unquestionably a factor which should be considered,\u201d we note that the trial court need not accept it without question. <em>Drope </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>supra, 420 U.S. 177 n.13. The trial court reasonably could have afforded little weight to the assertion of the defendant\u2019s counsel about the defendant\u2019s \u201cirrational behavior\u201d during a private conversation because his bare opinion, without any further detail about the date, duration, frequency or actual behavior involved in the conduct, presented only a legal conclusion about the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial and failed to assert facts from which the trial court could make its own legal determination concerning the defendant\u2019s competency. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goines, </em>988 F.2d 750, 782 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, U.S. , 114 S. Ct. 241, 126 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1993) (no abuse of discretion in denying competency hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>where trial court personally observed defendant to be lucid and defense counsel failed to support allegations about defendant\u2019s competency with sufficient facts), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>661 F. Sup. 507, 513 (W.D. Mich. 1987) (granting competency hearing based on defense counsel\u2019s \u201cfour-page, detailed affidavit\u201d outlining prior instances of \u201cbizarre\u201d behavior and psychiatric problems). Thus, by not providing a sufficient description or explanation of the nature of the defendant\u2019s purported past irrationality, the observation of the defendant\u2019s counsel provided no reasonable basis for the trial court to disregard its own, in-court observations about the defendant\u2019s then <em>present </em>competency.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 366-67 (emphasizing defendant must assert grounds of claimed incompetency).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Moreover, the trial court reasonably could have discounted the value of the observations about the defendant\u2019s behavior on the prior day because the defendant failed to make specific factual allegations about how any earlier impairment \u201cmay have affected his competence <em>that day.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>367; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>811 F. Sup. 408, 416 (E.D. Wis. 1993) (defendant must show past mental infirmities \u201cpresently affect\u201d competence). Consequently, the trial court was entitled to rely on its own observations of the defendant\u2019s responses during the canvassing, in light of his demeanor, tone, attitude and other expressive characteristics. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 603-604; <em>State </em>v. <em>Janice, </em>20 Conn. App. 212, 214, 565 A.2d 553, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 811, 568 A.2d 795 (1989). The trial court was in the best position to assess whether the defendant behaved rationally at that time. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 606-607 (emphasizing trial court\u2019s ability to test defendant\u2019s present competency).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The record establishes that the trial court considered the relevant evidence, personally evaluated the defendant\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings and reasonably concluded that the defendant was competent to stand trial. We therefore conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a competency examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60d provides: \u201cassault IN the second degree with a motor vehicle: class d felony, (a) A person is guilty of assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle when, while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both, he causes serious physical injury to another person as a consequence of the effect of such liquor or drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\u201c(b) Assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle is a class D felony and the court shall suspend the motor vehicle operator\u2019s license or nonresident operating privilege of any person found guilty under this section for one year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a provides in relevant part: \u201coperation while UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR OR DRUG OR WHILE IMPAIRED BY LIQUOR.

He rejects the plea bargain apparently which, of course, is his right under our procedure. And I think as far as I can determine he is able to proceed with the case. The request for a 54-56d examination is denied.\u201d We note that although the defendant now cites the canvass as evidence of his incompetency at trial, he never pointed the trial court to any of his responses to its questions as a basis for his challenge; nor did he contradict the trial court\u2019s characterization thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> We do not mean to suggest that the opinion of a defense attorney deserves no weight unless it is accompanied by some minimum amount of specific factual support. We only emphasize that the consideration to be afforded to a defense attorney\u2019s opinion of his client\u2019s competency, like all evidence of a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial, necessarily increases with the greater number of facts presented from which the trial court may draw its own reasonable conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> While we emphasize that in deciding whether to order a General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d competency hearing, a trial court must focus on a defendant\u2019s <em>present </em>competency to stand trial and that evidence, including that of a defendant\u2019s past or current behavior, is relevant only to the extent that it bears on that present competency, we also must underscore that because competency focuses on a particular point in time, a defendant who is found to be competent at the outset of trial later may become incompetent. For that reason, a trial court must order a competency hearing at any time that facts arise to raise a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s competency to continue with the trial. General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d. Thus, whenever a later motion alleges facts that sufficiently indicate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>defendant may be incompetent, the trial court must revisit the issue of competency and consider all relevant evidence, including evidence presented during any earlier motions for a competency hearing.
