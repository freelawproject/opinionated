(Wyatt), a wholesale distributor of petroleum products, sold its products to the Norbert E. Mitchell Company (Mitchell), a retail fuel dealer in Danbury. Mitchell stored the petroleum products on its premises in underground tanks surrounding a vault that housed valves. On February 3, 1983, three employees of Mitchell died from asphyxiation after descending into the vault.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">On January 24, 1985, the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as administrators of the decedents\u2019 estates, brought this action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>against Wyatt, alleging that Wyatt had failed properly to warn the plaintiffs\u2019 decedents of the hazards associated with the storage of petroleum products. Wyatt impleaded its oil suppliers as third party defendants and the plaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint naming the suppliers as defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, all of the defendants filed motions for summary judgment in which they asserted that, as a matter of law, their products were neither defective nor the proximate cause of the decedents\u2019 deaths. The defendants also claimed that the plaintiffs\u2019 action was barred by the sophisticated user doctrine<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the two year statute of limitations provision<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-577c (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and the plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 824, 855, 627 A.2d 1347 (1993). The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had improperly determined that: (1) \u00a7 52-572q requires a threshold showing that the product was defective in order to assess whether warnings were required; (2) the doctrine of foreseeability applies to the causation analysis under \u00a7 52-572q (c);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>and (3) the plaintiffs failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning leakage of the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>petroleum products into the vault. Additionally, the Appellate Court concluded that: (1) pursuant to \u00a7 52-572q (b), the sophisticated user doctrine is a factor to be considered in determining the need for warnings and is not an affirmative defense; and (2) the plaintiffs had raised genuine issues of material fact regarding the applicability of the two year statute of limitations provision contained in \u00a7 52-577c (b). We granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification to appeal regarding these issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>228 Conn. 904, 634 A.2d 298 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">After examining the record on appeal, and after considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court must be affirmed. The issues on which we granted certification were properly resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive opinion of the Appellate Court. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. Cf. <em>Whisper Wind Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>229 Conn. 176, 177, 640 A.2d 100 (1994); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 433, 436, 636 A.2d 378 (1994); <em>Stankiewicz </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>211 Conn. 76, 78, 556 A.2d 1024 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-572q provides: \u201cliability of product seller DUE TO lack of adequate WARNINGS OR instructions, (a) A product seller may be subject to liability for harm caused to a claimant who proves by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the product was defective in that adequate warnings or instructions were not provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">\u201c(b) In determining whether instructions or warnings were required and, if required, whether they were adequate, the trier of fact may consider: (1) The likelihood that the product would cause the harm suffered by the claimant; (2) the ability of the product seller to anticipate at the time of manufacture that the expected product user would be aware of the product risk, and the nature of the potential harm; and (3) the technological feasibility and cost of warnings and instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">\u201c(c) In claims based on this section, the claimant shall prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that if adequate warnings or instructions had been provided, the claimant would not have suffered the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">\u201c(d) A product seller may not be considered to have provided adequate warnings or instructions unless they were devised to communicate with the person best able to take or recommend precautions against the potential harm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b31-13\"> The plaintiffs include Larry Sharp as administrator of the estate of David C.

Wyatt did not raise this defense against the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b32-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-577c (b) provides in relevant part: \u201c[N]o action to recover damages for personal injury or property damage caused by exposure to a hazardous chemical substance or mixture or hazardous pollutant released into the environment shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury or damage complained of is discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b32-11\"><em> </em>The Appellate Court concluded that, for purposes of the causation analysis under the statute, neither subsection (b) nor subsection (c) of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 52-572q implicates the doctrine of foreseeability. We recognize, however, that the Appellate Court did indicate, at least by implication, that foreseeability may be implicated under subsection (b), because it noted that subsection (b) calls on the trier of fact to consider the \u201clikelihood that the product would cause the harm suffered by the plaintiff\u201d as a factor in determining whether a product is defective for failure of its seller to provide adequate warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The parties did not argue, and the Appellate Court did not address, the issue of whether the doctrine of foreseeability is implicated under subsection (a) of the statute for purposes of causation. As we recently noted in <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>229 Conn. 500, 505, 642 A.2d 709 (1994), our product liability act was not patterned after the Model Uniform Product Liability Act (model act); 44 Fed. Reg. 62,714-50 (1979); but rather is based on the Draft Uniform Product Liability Law (draft act), published in 44 Fed. Reg. 2996 et seq. (1979). Section 104 of the draft act, after which \u00a7 52-572q was patterned, states, in part, that \u201c[a] product seller may be subject to liability for harm <em>caused to </em>a claimant . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Draft Uniform Product Liability Law, Department of Commerce, Office of the Secretary, 44 Fed. Reg. 2998 (Jan. 12, 1979). In contrast, \u00a7 104 of the model act states, in part, that \u201c[a] product manufacturer is subject to liability to a claimant who proves . . . that the claimant\u2019s harm was <em>proximately caused . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Model Uniform Product Liability Act, Department of Commerce, Office of the Secretary, 44 Fed. Reg. 62,721 (Oct. 31, 1979). Whether this difference between the draft act and the model act bears on the question of whether the doctrine of foreseeability is implicated under \u00a7 52-572q (a) is an issue we leave for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Even if we were to decide that the doctrine of foreseeability is implicated under \u00a7 52-572q (a), summary judgment would be inappropriate in this case. In their motions for summary judgment, the defendants, as the moving parties, did not raise the issue of whether <em>inadequate warnings </em>proximately caused the harm to the plaintiffs\u2019 decedents. The defendants argued only that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to identify the offending petroleum product prevented them from proving that any alleged defect in the defendants\u2019 products caused the injuries of the plaintiffs\u2019 decedents. The defendants, therefore, failed to sustain their burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact regarding this issue. See <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>224 Conn. 240, 247, 618 A.2d 506 (1992); <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 251, 571 A.2d 116 (1990). Furthermore, because the trial court, sua sponte, raised the issue of whether the doctrine of foreseeability was implicated under \u00a7 52-572q (c), the plaintiffs never had the opportunity to present the evidence set forth to this court that the defendants could have foreseen that their products were stored and transported in many types of confined spaces that created the potential hazard of low oxygen and the danger of asphyxiation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\"> We granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u201c1.
