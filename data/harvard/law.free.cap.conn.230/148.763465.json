General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>constitution does not require a jury trial for CUTPA claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The relevant facts are as follows. The plaintiff, Associated Investment Company Limited Partnership, brought an action against the defendants, Williams Associates IV, Walter J. Lewis, Jr., Norman J. Voog and Victor J. Buselli (Williams Associates), to collect on a promissory note allegedly due and owing in the principal amount of $750,000. The defendants filed an answer, special defenses and a counterclaim alleging a CUTPA violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The counterclaim alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>interest rates and late fees charged by the plaintiff, together with certain of the plaintiffs collection practices and the attachment of various of the defendants\u2019 properties, constituted unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The defendants\u2019 prayer for relief sought rescission, punitive damages, costs, attorney\u2019s fees and such other relief as the court deemed just and proper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The defendants thereafter filed a claim to the jury docket, which the plaintiff moved to strike. The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion concluding that: (1) with respect to the complaint, the defendants had waived their right to a jury trial by failing to make the claim in a timely manner;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) with respect to the counterclaim, the defendants did not have a state constitutional right to a jury trial for actions brought under CUTPA. Prior to trial, the defendants filed a motion for default and other sanctions against the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to attend its duly noticed deposition. The court denied the defendants\u2019 motion, and the case proceeded to trial. At the conclusion of the trial, the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the complaint in the amount of $1,258,180.60, and for the plaintiff on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">On appeal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendants claim that the trial court: (1) improperly determined that the defendants\u2019 counterclaim alleging a CUTPA violation was not triable to a jury; and (2) abused its discretion by denying the defendants\u2019 motion for default and for other sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>because of the plaintiffs alleged failure to attend its deposition. We conclude that the trial court properly granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendants\u2019 counterclaim from the jury docket, and that its denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions did not constitute an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The defendants assert that they are entitled to a jury trial on their counterclaim alleging a CUTPA violation under article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which guarantees the right to a jury trial in all cases for which such a right existed at the time of the adoption of that constitutional provision in 1818.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection </em>v. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co., </em>227 Conn. 175, 182, 629 A.2d 1116 (1993); <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>211 Conn. 370, 373-74, 559 A.2d 701 (1989). \u201cArticle first, \u00a7 19, also provides the right to a jury trial in cases that are substantially similar to cases for which the right to a jury trial existed at common law in 1818.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection </em>v. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co., </em>supra, 182. Because at common law only legal claims were tried to a jury, the state constitutional right to a trial by jury does not extend to equitable claims. <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>supra, 374; <em>Franchi </em>v. <em>Farmholme, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 201, 210, 464 A.2d 35 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Accordingly, in determining whether a party has a right to a trial by jury under the state constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>and General Statutes \u00a7 52-215,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we \u201cmust ascertain whether the action being tried . . . has roots in the common law, and if so, whether the remedy involved was one in law or equity. If the action existed at common law and involved a legal remedy, the right to a jury trial exists and the legislature may not curtail that right either directly or indirectly.\u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 376. \u201cConsequently, statutory actions established since the adoption of the constitution of 1818 ordinarily fall outside the scope of the provision, \u2018unless, perhaps, the new remedy constitutes \u201ca modification of existing remedies, so vital as to unduly limit and violate the right of trial by jury.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Spring Brook Dairy, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>135 Conn. 294, 297, 64 A.2d 39 (1949), quoting <em>Meigs </em>v. <em>Theis, </em>102 Conn. 579, 592, 129 A. 551 (1925).\u201d <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>206 Conn. 608, 618, 539 A.2d 108 (1988); <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 49-50, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990). Because CUTPA creates an essentially equitable cause of action not substantially similar to common law claims triable to a jury prior to 1818, we conclude that a jury trial is not constitutionally required for actions brought under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We have recently reviewed the nature and scope of the broad prohibition of CUTPA against \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a). \u201cIt is well settled that in determining whether a practice violates CUTPA we have adopted the criteria set out in the cigarette rule by the federal trade commission for determining when a practice is unfair: (1) [wjhether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise\u2014whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers [or competitors or other businessmen]. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cheshire Mortgage Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>223 Conn. 80, 105-106, 612 A.2d 1130 (1992).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>noted that\u2019 \u201c[a]ll three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three. . . . Thus a violation of CUTPA may be established by showing either an actual deceptive practice . . . or a practice amounting to a violation of public policy. . . . Furthermore, a party need not prove an intent to deceive to prevail under CUTPA.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The expansive nature of the CUTPA scheme, which we have described as establishing \u201can action more flexible and a remedy more complete than did the common law\u201d; <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 617, 440 A.2d 810 (1981); may be traced directly to \u00a7 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45 (a) (1);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the statutory provision on which CUTPA is modeled and the interpretation of which \u201cserve[s] as a lodestar for interpretation of the open-ended language of CUTPA.\u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>200 Conn. 172, 179, 510 A.2d 972 (1986). The FTCA, enacted in 1914, authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to define, identify and prevent \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d and \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices,\u201d language used by Congress to reach conduct beyond that proscribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>at common law. <em>Federal Trade Commission </em>v. <em>R. F. Keppel &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>291 U.S. 304, 310-12, 54 S. Ct. 423, 78 L. Ed. 814 (1934).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201c[w]hen Congress created the Federal Trade Commission in 1914 and charted its power and responsibility under \u00a7 5 [of the FTCA], it explicitly considered, and rejected, the notion that it reduce the ambiguity of the phrase \u2018unfair methods of competition\u2019 by tying the concept of unfairness to a common-law or statutory standard or by enumerating the particular practices to which it was intended to apply.\u201d <em>Federal Trade Commission </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 239-40, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972). Instead, it adopted a concept that does not \u201cadmit of precise definition but the meaning and application of which must be arrived at by . . . the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Federal Trade Commission </em>v. <em>R. F. Keppel &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>supra, 312.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Likewise, our General Assembly, in adopting the sweeping language of \u00a7 5 (a) (1) of the FTCA, \u201cdeliberately chose not to define the scope of unfair or deceptive acts proscribed by CUTPA so that courts might develop a body of law responsive to the marketplace practices that actually generate such complaints.\u201d <em>Sportsmen\u2019s Boating Corp. </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>192 Conn. 747, 755, 474 A.2d 780 (1984). \u201cPredictably, [therefore,] CUTPA has come to embrace a much broader range of business conduct than does the common law tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>action.\u201d Id., 756. Moreover, \u201c[b]ecause CUTPA is a self-avowed \u2018remedial\u2019 measure, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (d), it is construed liberally in an effort to effectuate its public policy goals.\u201d Id. Indeed, there is \u201cno . . . unfair method of competition, or unfair [or] deceptive act or practice that cannot be reached [under CUTPA].\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 2, 1973 Sess., p. 705, remarks of Attorney Robert Sils, Dept. of Consumer Protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In addition to establishing a standard of conduct more flexible than traditional common law claims, the expansive language of CUTPA prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices without requiring proof of intent to deceive, to defraud or to mislead. See, e.g., <em>Web Press Services Corp. </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 342, 362-63, 525 A.2d 57 (1987) (common law claims for fraud, deceit and misrepresentation require proof that defendant knew of falsity of representation, whereas CUTPA claimant need not prove defendant\u2019s knowledge that representation was false); <em>Sportsmen\u2019s Boating Corp. </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 754-57 (unlike tort claim for interference with business expectancies, which requires proof of malicious or deliberate interference with competitor\u2019s business expectations, CUTPA liability may be based solely on proof of unfair or deceptive acts); <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 184 Conn. 617 (CUTPA proscribes broader range of conduct than common law action for innocent misrepresentation). Moreover, \u201c[t]he CUTPA plaintiff need not prove reliance or that the representation became part of the basis of the bargain.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>191 Conn. 484, 493, 464 A.2d 847 (1983) (collection of rents by landlord prior to obtaining certificate of occupancy, although not prohibited by landlord-tenant statutes, constituted unfair trade practice as violation of public policy). Because CUTPA removes these common law obstacles to recovery; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>supra, 617; the private cause of action created by CUTPA reaches conduct well beyond that proscribed by any common law analogue.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In view of the unique breadth and flexibility of the cause of action created by CUTPA, we conclude that it does not bear substantial similarity to a common law action triable to a jury prior to 1818. We are persuaded that CUTPA has its roots not in the common law, but rather in \u00a7 5 (a) (1) of the FTCA, itself an expression of Congress\u2019 intent to identify and prevent a wide range of business conduct not actionable at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Our conclusion that CUTPA does not give rise to a legal cause of action grounded in the common law comports with the essentially equitable character of the statutory scheme. Equity may be described as \u201ca system of positive jurisprudence founded upon established principles which can be adapted to new circumstances where a court of law is powerless to give relief.\u201d <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Adametz, </em>142 Conn. 218, 223, 113 A.2d 136 (1955). A hallmark of equity is its \u201ccapacity of expansion [beyond the common law], so as to keep abreast of each succeeding generation and age.\u201d 1 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th Ed. 1941) \u00a7 67, p. 89. CUTPA, like equity, reaches beyond traditional common law precepts in establishing a fairness standard designed to \u201cgrow and broaden and mold [itself] to meet circumstances as they arise . . . .\u2019\u2019(Internal quotation marks omitted.) M. Handler, \u201cThe Jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission Over False Advertising,\u201d 31 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 535 (1931). The resolution of claims requiring the application of broadly defined and deeply rooted public values such as the statute\u2019s \u201celusive, but [legislatively] mandated standard of fairness\u201d; <em>Federal Trade Commission </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>supra, 405 U.S. 244; has historically been the function of a court of equity. 1 J. Pomeroy, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 59, 67. Indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>United States Supreme Court has expressly likened the role of the Federal Trade Commission under the FTCA to that of a court of equity. <em>Federal Trade Commission </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>supra, 244 (Federal Trade Commission acts like court of equity when it defines and applies the prohibition of FTCA against unfair or deceptive business practices).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Furthermore, \u201c[t]he plaintiff who establishes CUTPA liability has access to a remedy far more comprehensive than the simple damages recoverable under common law\u201d; <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 184 Conn. 617; including costs and attorney\u2019s fees; General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d); and punitive damages. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a). In addition, if a court determines that a practice is unfair or deceptive under CUTPA, it \u201cmay, in its discretion, order, in addition to damages or in lieu of damages, injunctive or other equitable relief.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d). We have previously acknowledged the importance to the CUTPA scheme of the availability of attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages. <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 617-18. The significance of the broad equitable remedies authorized under CUTPA is underscored by the express language of \u00a7 42-110g (d), which, in affording the court discretion to order injunctive and other equitable relief <em>in lieu </em>of damages, \u201ccontemplates plaintiffs\u2019 judgments which do not include an award of money damages.\u201d Id., 618.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These comprehensive remedies, intended \u201cto create a climate in which private litigants help to enforce the ban on unfair or deceptive trade practices or acts\u201d; id.; are significantly broader than those generally available at common law. Compare <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 666 n.8, 509 A.2d 11 (1986) (CUTPA permits recovery of punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>damages and attorney\u2019s fees not ordinarily available at common law), with <em>Virgo </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>209 Conn. 497, 503, 551 A.2d 1243 (1988) (cost of litigation and attorney\u2019s fees generally not recoverable at common law), and <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>195 Conn. 76, 77-78, 485 A.2d 1305 (1985) (punitive damages recoverable at common law only upon showing of wanton or wilful malicious misconduct).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Finally, there is no suggestion, either in the legislative history of CUTPA or in the language of the statute itself, that the legislature sought to codify or supplant any existing common law claim by enacting the private cause of action under CUTPA. On the contrary, the action established by CUTPA provides a remedy for a wider range of business conduct than does the common law, and CUTPA exists wholly independent of any common law claim. See <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 184 Conn. 617-18; 1 D. Pope, Connecticut Actions and Remedies (1993) \u00a7 22.02. Thus, a claimant retains the right to bring a common law action or actions in conjunction with a CUTPA claim, as well as the right to a jury trial on any such common law actions that were triable to a jury prior to 1818.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that article first, \u00a7 19, of our state constitution does not give rise to a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>to a jury trial for claims brought under CUTPA.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, properly granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendant\u2019s counterclaim from the jury docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The defendants also claim that the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for default and for other sanctions for the plaintiff\u2019s failure to attend its duly noticed deposition constituted an abuse of discretion. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">By notices of deposition dated March 10, 1992, the defendants served notice that they intended to take the depositions of David Einbinder, a general partner of the plaintiff, and of the plaintiff, by and through Ein-binder as its general partner. On the same date, the defendants also served Einbinder with two deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>subpoenas duces tecum,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> one in his individual capacity as a nonparty witness and the other in his representative capacity as the party plaintiff. The first subpoena directed Einbinder to appear at the offices of the New Haven County Bar Association at 10 a.m. on March 31, 1992, to testify and to produce certain documents. The second subpoena instructed the plaintiff, by and through Einbinder, to appear at the New Haven County Bar Association offices at 2 p.m. on the same date, also to be deposed and to provide documents. Neither Einbinder nor any other representative of the plaintiff appeared on March 31, 1992, as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">On April 20, 1992, two days before the trial was scheduled to begin, the defendants filed a motion for default and for other sanctions against the plaintiff for its failure to appear to be deposed on March 31, 1992. The defendants sought the entry of a default and a judgment of dismissal against the plaintiff or, in the alternative, an order precluding the plaintiff from introducing and contesting certain evidence, as well as an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court concluded that the defendants had not filed their motion for default and for other sanctions in a timely manner and, accordingly, denied the defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 231 authorizes the trial court to grant a wide range of relief, including the relief sought by the defendants, for a party\u2019s failure to appear and testify at a duly noticed deposition. The determination of whether to enter sanctions pursuant to \u00a7 231 and, if so, what sanction or sanctions to impose, is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Rullo </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>208 Conn. 74, 78, 543 A.2d 279 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>(1988). \u201cIn reviewing a claim that this discretion has been abused the unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness.....[T]he ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Under the circumstances presented, we are not persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to afford the defendants the relief that they sought. The defendants failed to provide the trial court with any reason or justification for their delay in moving for sanctions until April 20, 1992, just two days before the commencement of trial and three weeks after the date scheduled for the depositions. Because the defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions was filed on the eve of trial, the court\u2019s ability to fashion a remedy designed to vindicate the defendants\u2019 interest in obtaining Einbinder\u2019s testimony prior to trial was seriously and, so far as the record reveals, unnecessarily limited. Moreover, although the unexcused or unexplained failure to comply with a subpoena duces tecum is generally not to be countenanced, no evidence was presented to the trial court tending to prove either that Einbinder had wilfully failed to appear at the deposition, or that the defendants had been prejudiced by his failure to appear. See <em>Pavlinko </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 138, 144, 470 A.2d 246 (1984). The trial court, therefore, acted within its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 motion for default and for other sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

The majority holds that the Connecticut Unfair Trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Practices Act (CUTPA); General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.; creates what is essentially an equitable cause of action not triable to a jury because CUTPA: (1) provides a more flexible and complete remedy than the common law; and (2) has its roots in the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) and not in the common law. The majority concludes that CUTPA does not bear substantial similarity to a common law action triable to a jury prior to 1818 because an action under CUTPA proscribes a broader range of conduct than did the common law and affords greater remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The majority\u2019s conclusion represents a shift from the well established test we have articulated for determining whether the right to a jury trial in a particular case is constitutionally required. As we often have stated, the right to a jury trial \u201c \u2018exists not only in cases in which it existed at common law and at the time of the adoption of the constitutional provisions preserving it, but also exists in cases substantially similar thereto . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>211 Conn. 370, 374, 559 A.2d 701 (1989), quoting 47 Am.

I recognize that there is nothing in either the legislative history or the language of CUTPA to suggest that the legislature was attempting to codify or supplant any existing common law claim when it enacted CUTPA, and that an action under CUTPA exists wholly independent of any common law claim. The separate statutory existence of a CUTPA claim is not, however, determinative of whether a party is entitled to a jury trial. \u201cThe test is not whether the cause of action is statutory. . . . The test is whether the issue raised in the action is substantially of the same nature or is such an issue as prior to 1818 would have been triable to a jury.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Boschen, </em>supra, 164-65. Although CUTPA may reach beyond traditional common law precepts, it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>nature of the action under CUTPA that determines whether the issue in the action is one justiciable at common law with a right to a jury trial. The test \u201crequires an inquiry as to whether the course of action has roots in the common law, and if so, whether the remedy involved was one in law or equity. If the action existed at common law and involved a legal remedy, the right to a jury trial exists and the legislature may not curtail that right either directly or indirectly.\u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>supra, 376.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The right to a jury trial extends beyond the common law forms of action recognized at 1818. As this court recently stated, \u201c[w]e are not implying that the right to a jury trial does not exist in any cause of action that was not specifically recognized at common law in 1818. \u2018The historical test we apply is flexible and may require a jury in a new cause of action, not in existence in [1818], if it involves rights and remedies of the sort traditionally enforced in an action at law or if its nearest historical analogue is an action at common law.\u2019 \u201d Id., 377,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> quoting <em>Goar </em>v. <em>Compania Peruana de Vapores, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>688 F.2d 417, 427 (5th Cir. 1982). \u201cThe cases that have required jury trials for new causes of action have involved legislative enhancement or creation of rights and duties in circumstances where the common law enforced similar rights and duties. See <em>Pernell </em>[v. <em>Southall Realty, </em>416 U.S. 363, 370-76, 94 S. Ct. 1723, 40 L. Ed. 2d 198 (1974)]; <em>Curtis </em>[v. <em>Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 195, 94 S. Ct. 1005, 39 L.

It is clear that statutory adjustments to common law causes of action are not determinative of whether a right to trial by jury is mandated by article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution. This case by case determination of the relationship of the claim to its historical antecedent is consistent with the public policy prong of CUTPA that authorizes other bodies of law, including the common law, to be incorporated by reference in whole or in part. See <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>191 Conn. 484, 492-93, 464 A.2d 847 (1983), quoting <em>Federal Trade Commission </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 244-45 n.5, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972) (in determining if a practice is unfair we look to see: \u201c(1) whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise\u2014whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers [or competitors or other businessmen]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">This case by case analysis is also consistent with the position taken in other jurisdictions. Reference to one of these cases is instructive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Waggener </em>v. <em>Seever Sys</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>tems, Inc., </em>233 Kan. 517, 520-22, 664 P.2d 813 (1983), the Supreme Court of Kansas examined whether the Kansas Consumer Protection Act (Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 50-623 et seq.) provides for a jury trial. Although \u00a7 5 of the Bill of Rights of the Kansas constitution provides that \u201c \u2018[t]he right of trial by jury shall be inviolate,\u2019 \u201d the court acknowledged that the right was not absolute. Because, in Kansas, there is no statute defining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>what issues are triable to a jury as a matter of right, the court applied the well established guiding principles that it routinely follows in assessing whether a jury trial is mandated. The court reasoned: \u201c(1) The right of trial by jury is a substantial and valuable right. The law favors trial by jury and the right should be carefully guarded against infringement. ... (2) The constitutional right to a jury trial guaranteed by Section 5 . . . refers to that right as it existed at common law. ... (3) At common law and under the Kansas constitutional provision in a suit in equity a party is not entitled to a trial by jury as a matter of right. ... (4) In determining whether an action is one in equity the test is whether the essential nature of the action is grounded on equitable rights and is one in which equitable relief is sought. ... (5) The issues raised by the pleadings or as modified by the pretrial order determine the nature of the action, and where the issue is not one justiciable at common law, a jury trial is not available. ... (6) The substance of the pleadings, not the form of the pleadings, determines the character of an action as equitable or legal in nature. . . . (7) Where a court of equity obtains jurisdiction of an action for the purpose of granting some distinctively equitable relief, the court will take jurisdiction for all purposes and determine all issues in the case so that a full, effective, and determinative decree adjusting the rights of the parties may be entered and enforced.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 520-21. Applying these criteria, the court concluded that a claim that an action is unconscionable<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>is a question for the court but that a claim that an action is deceptive is a question for a jury. Id., 522. The court further concluded that because the plaintiff sought rescission of the contract, an equitable remedy inconsistent with a claim for damages under the contract, he was not entitled to a jury trial. Id., 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">This case by case analysis proposed by the <em>Waggener </em>court is both comprehensive and manageable and is, I believe, suitable for our trial courts to implement. A case by case approach considers the common law and statutory roots of CUTPA and also promotes a full analysis of the specific claim in relation to its historical origins. By applying a flexible test we could continue to recognize, consistent with our own case law, that CUTPA reaches a wide range of conduct. For example, an unfair method of competition may include conduct as diverse as actual or incipient violations of the antitrust laws to common law business torts, including interference with business expectancies. <em>Sportsmen\u2019s Boating Corp. </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 755-56; see generally D. Belt, \u201cPrivate Actions Under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\u201d 64 Conn. B.J. SI-3, SI-11-12 (1990); J. Morgan, \u201cThe Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act: Determining Standards of Conduct,\u201d 62 Conn. B.J. 74, 94-95 (1988); A. Neigher, \u201cOn the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\u201d 4 Conn. L. Trib., No. 30, p. 6 (July 24, 1978). I therefore would continue to recognize the distinct and diverse causes of action under the CUTPA umbrella and allow our trial courts to act on a case by case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Accordingly, in determining whether the defendants are entitled to a jury trial the court must review the underlying causes of action. The bases for the unfair trade practices for which the defendants seek relief are: fraud in the inducement, usury, breach of contract, tor-tious interference with a contractual obligation, vexatious litigation, slander and intentional infliction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>emotional distress. All of these are common law actions upon which there was a right to trial by jury before 1818.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In closing, there are two additional points that deserve mention. The first relates to my skepticism regarding the majority\u2019s characterization that CUTPA is essentially equitable in nature. The majority points to two separate parts of CUTPA that provide for equitable relief; General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a) and (d); as support for its position that CUTPA is equitable in nature. This inclusion of provisions addressing equitable relief demonstrates that in certain instances, as when a victimized consumer cannot put a precise dollar figure on his or her loss, a CUTPA remedy will nevertheless be available; <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 617-19, 440 A.2d 810 (1981); and is merely consistent with the remedial purpose of the statute. To state that because CUTPA provides for equitable relief supports the conclusion that CUTPA is primarily equitable in nature is as myopic as stating that because a party who brings an action for breach of contract asks only for specific performance means that no action for breach of contract seeking monetary damages is ever entitled to a trial by jury. Additionally, the majority\u2019s assessment runs contrary to our conclusions regarding other statutes that contain provisions for equitable and legal claims. For example, in <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>68 Conn. 273, 286, 36 A. 55 (1896), we were required to decide whether the statute authorizing an action to quiet title, chapter 66 of the Public Acts of 1893 (Act), was unconstitutional because it denied the right of trial by jury. We stated that \u201c[u]nder section one of the Act, the claims to be tried and determined in proceedings brought under the Act, may plainly include legal claims proper to be tried by a jury, as well as equitable claims proper to be tried by a court of equity; and in the absence of any provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>sions in the Act which either expressly or by necessary implication prohibit trial by jury, the fair presumption is that the right to try the former class of questions to a jury is preserved to the parties.\u201d Id. We further noted that the Act neither expressly provided for, nor expressly, or by implication, prohibited a trial by jury. Id. Accordingly, we concluded that other provisions of existing law, including common law, controlled. Id. We therefore rejected the claim that the Act of 1893 was unconstitutional because it denied parties the right of a trial by jury. Id., 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Finally, I am unpersuaded that CUTPA draws its strength exclusively from the FTCA. Although \u201c[i]n deciding what constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice, courts of this state are encouraged to look to interpretations of the [FTCA]; 15 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 45 (a) (1); rendered by both the federal trade commission and the federal courts\u201d; <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 184 Conn. 617; the historical antecedent is as much the common law of Connecticut. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (b) requires that our interpretation of CUTPA be guided by the FTCA; <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>213 Conn. 354, 363, 567 A.2d 1212 (1990); however, CUTPA provides a private cause of action and therefore achieves the protection of the rights of consumers in a fundamentally different manner than the FTCA. Moreover, the legislature, in its earlier amendments to CUTPA, was attempting \u201cto find methods, acts or practices not heretofore specifically declared unlawful by the [Federal Trade Commission] or the federal courts to be prohibited by . . . CUTPA.\u201d R. Langer &amp; D. Ormstedt, \u201cThe Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\u201d 54 Conn. B.J. 388, 391 (1980). I am therefore unpersuaded by the fact that the \u201cFederal Trade Commission acts like [a] court of equity when it defines and applies the prohibition of FTCA against unfair or deceptive business practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>For all these reasons, I respectfully dissent with the majority\u2019s holding that the state constitution does not give rise to a right to a jury trial for claims brought under CUTPA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-5\"> In <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 378, we held that this flexible approach did not mandate a jury trial for a person asserting a claim against the sovereign because the state had been immune from suit in 1818 under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Therefore, we concluded that the right to a jury trial under General Statutes \u00a7 31-51q would exist only if the legislature provided for it. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\"> \u201cIn determining whether there is a right to jury trial under the seventh amendment, the United States Supreme Court applies a historical test in which it looks to see whether a similar cause of action was triable to a jury when the constitution was adopted in 1791. <em>Pernell </em>v. <em>Southall Realty, </em>416 U.S. 363, 94 S. Ct. 1723, 40 L. Ed. 2d 198 (1974); <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 94 S. Ct. 1005, 39 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1974); <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, </em>301 U.S. 1, 48, 57 S. Ct. 615, 81 L. Ed. 893 (1937). Although the seventh amendment constitutional guarantee of a right to a jury trial applies only in the federal courts; <em>Gluck </em>v. <em>Gluck, </em>181 Conn. 225, 227, 435 A.2d 35 (1980); the similarity between the state and federal tests was recognized by this court in <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Boschen, </em>[supra, 143 Conn. 162-63].\u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 379 n.9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-5\"> This court has applied a similar analysis in evaluating whether a particular statute unconstitutionally deprives a plaintiff of the right to bring actions at common law. See <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 286, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976) (\u201call rights derived by statute and the common law extant at the time of the adoption of article first, \u00a7 10, are incorporated in that provision\u201d). When the legislature crafts \u201ca new remedy in order to displace an old one . . . [i]t is enough if there exists an adequate \u2018remedy by due course of law\u2019 for the underlying injury.\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 197, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). The right to redress under the new statute need not be coextensive with the rights afforded under the old one; the redress must be commensurate. The use of the reasonable alternative test to determine whether the legislature has unconstitutionally abolished a cause of action at common law reflects the same flexibility that we use to ascertain whether the legislature has created a cause of action that is reasonably similar to one that existed at common law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b185-6\"> For example, in <em>Sportsmen\u2019s Boating Corp. </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>192 Conn. 747, 755-57, 474 A.2d 780 (1984), we pointed out the \u201cthe essential difference between a tort claim for interference with business expectancies and a claim under CUTPA is the standard by which the alleged acts are measured. . . . Conduct that might be actionable under CUTPA may not rise to a level sufficient to invoke tort liability. The reverse of that proposition, however, is seldom true. Provided a plaintiff shows that his or her claim is cloaked with the necessary public interest, it is difficult to conceive of a situation where tortious interference would be found but a CUTPA violation would not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Similarly, CUTPA proscribes a broader range of conduct than did the common law action for innocent misrepresentation. Accordingly, proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>knowledge of the falsity and reliance on the misrepresentation are not necessary to prevail under CUTPA although they are required to sustain a cause of action for fraud, deceit or misrepresentation under the common law. <em>Web Press Services Corp. </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 342, 362-63, 525 A.2d 57 (1987). These cases suggest that the plaintiff who prevails under a common law action for tortious interference or misrepresentation will also prevail under CUTPA provided the claim is cloaked with the necessary public interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\"> It also strikes me as incongruous for the court to preclude jury trials under CUTPA in light of the well recognized remedial aims of the statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (d) (\u201c[i]t is the intention of the legislature that this chapter be remedial and be so construed\u201d). The hallmark of CUTPA is the creation of a private cause of action and the encouragement of its use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b187-5\"> As the majority recognizes, there is a split among the jurisdictions as to whether statutory causes of action for unfair or deceptive trade practices give rise to a state constitutional right to a jury trial. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Credit Bureau of Laredo, Inc., </em>530 S.W.2d 288, 291-92 (Tex. 1975), the Texas Supreme Court, relying on a constitutional provision comparable to article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution, held that the plaintiff who claimed civil penalties was entitled to a jury trial for a violation of the Texas Deceptive Practices Act. Because that act is silent about the right to a jury, the court looked to see if the Texas constitution establishes the right. Id. Citing to article I, \u00a7 15, of the Texas constitution, which provides in part \u201cthat \u2018the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate,\u2019 \u201d the court noted that the state has protected the right to a trial by jury in those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>cases where a jury would have been proper at common law. Id., 291. The court further remarked that \u201c[t]he right to a trial by jury is not limited to the precise form of action in which civil penalties were enforceable at common law. The right exists when \u2018the action <em>involves rights and remedies of the sort typically enforced </em>in an action at law.\u2019 <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 94 S. Ct. 1005, 39 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1974); 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7 38.11[7], 128 (2d ed. 1974).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 292. Following that determination, the court looked to article V, \u00a7 10, of the Texas constitution which extended the right to a trial by jury to causes in equity. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">I note that other jurisdictions, although not directly confronting the issue, have allowed jury trials in which state unfair or deceptive trade practices or consumer protection act claims were involved. Although none of these cases directly discuss the issue of whether a right to a jury trial exists,'in each, a jury trial was held, thereby at least arguably implying that a right to a jury is viable. See, e.g., <em>Lexton-Ancira Real Estate Fund </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>826 P.2d 819 (Colo. 1992) (jury trial used under state deceptive practices act where damages were awarded plaintiff on deceptive trade practice claim); <em>Georgia Society of Plastic Surgeons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>257 Ga. 710, 363 S.E.2d 140 (1987) (utilizing jury trial in claim of unfair trade practices under state uniform deceptive trade practices act); <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Motorists Mutual Ins. Co., </em>759 S.W.2d 819 (Ky. 1988) (implied right to jury trial under state consumer protection act for issue of fact dealing with unfair, false, misleading or deceptive act where relief being sought was damages); <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Norwest Bank, </em>255 Mont. 317, 843 P.2d 327 (1992) (using jury trial in case involving state unfair trade practices act claims mixed with common law contract claims); <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Louis Dreyfus Corp., </em>112 N.M. 97, 811 P.2d 1308 (1991) (using jury trial where one of claims involved violation of state unfair trade practices act); <em>State ex rel. James A. Redden </em>v. <em>Discount Fabrics, Inc., </em>289 Or. 375, 615 P.2d 1034 (1980) (jury used in state unfair trade practices act case alleging misrepresentation where relief on second count was for injunction, restitution and attorney\u2019s fees); <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Cornerstone Investments, Inc., </em>115 Wash. 2d 148, 795 P.2d 1143 (1990) (allowing jury trial on state consumer protection act claim in which damages were sought); <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. of the Northwest, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kallevig, </em>114 Wash. 2d 907, 792 P.2d 520 (1990) (jury trial held under state consumer protection act claim, involving unfair trade practice).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b189-4\"> The decision by the court in <em>Waggener </em>v. <em>Seever Systems, Inc., </em>supra, 233 Kan. 522, that a claim that certain conduct was unconscionable is equitable in nature was based on Kansas\u2019 jurisprudence and has little or no bearing on whether in our jurisdiction that is the case. As even the state in its amicus curiae brief acknowledges: \u201cBecause the public policy prong of the unfairness doctrine can include both common law and non-common law claims . . . [ejach unfairness count will require a case by case determination of the relationship of the claim to its historical antecedent . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b193-12\"> As the majority acknowledges, there is authority for the proposition that in some jurisdictions at common law a claimant must, at a minimum, plead and prove either compensatory or nominal damages in order to recover punitive damages. See 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 908, p. 465 (1979); 5 M. Minzer, J. Nates, C. Kimball &amp; D. Axelrod, Damages in Tort Action (1994) \u00a7 40.31; annot., 40 A.L.R.4th 18 (1985). It is unclear under Connecticut common law, however, whether: (1) it is necessary to plead and prove nominal damages in order to recover punitive damages; and (2) nominal damages are the equivalent of \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d In this case, the defendants had to plead an ascertainable loss in their counterclaim in order to state sufficiently a claim under CUTPA. <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 184 Conn. 612-13. Because it is yet unresolved under Connecticut common law whether doing so entitles the defendants to punitive damages, I withhold judgment as to whether the claims for relief in this case have a common law analogue, thereby entitling the defendants to a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
