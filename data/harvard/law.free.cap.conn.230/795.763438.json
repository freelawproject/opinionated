The plaintiffs, Lori Misura and John Bennett,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were injured in an automobile accident with an unidentified hit-and-run driver while they were traveling in Misura\u2019s automobile in New Haven.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They brought this action against the defendant to collect uninsured motorist benefits under Misura\u2019s insurance policy with the defendant. Under the terms of the policy, the defendant was obligated to pay damages for bodily injuries sustained by the occupants of Misura\u2019s vehicle that they would have been legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The policy expressly limited the defendant\u2019s liability, however, to $100,000 for any one accident, regardless of the number of covered persons injured.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The complaint originally filed by the plaintiffs made specific reference to the insurance policy and its limit of $100,000 in uninsured motorist coverage. The defendant filed a request to revise the complaint to delete any reference to the limit of $100,000 uninsured motorist coverage of the policy on the grounds that it was irrelevant to any jury issue and that its disclosure would unduly prejudice the defendant. The plaintiffs did not object to the defendant\u2019s request to revise and, accordingly, filed an amended complaint that contained no reference to the policy\u2019s limits of uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability. The trial court granted the motion, without opposition. Shortly thereafter, the defendant and Bennett agreed to a settlement of his claim against the defendant for $37,115, and Bennett thereupon withdrew his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude Misura from introducing any evidence at trial of the policy limits or the amount of insurance coverage available under the policy. The motion, unopposed by Misura, was granted by the trial court. Misura\u2019s action against the defendant then proceeded to trial on the issue of damages. On May 6, 1992, the jury returned a verdict for her in the amount $92,000, and the trial court accepted the verdict and rendered judgment in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">On May 28, 1992, the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment and for a remittitur pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 325 and 326<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>\u00a7 52-228.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant claimed that the undisputed terms of the policy and General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (b)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> required a reduction of the judgment obtained against it by Misura so that the defendant\u2019s total payments to the plaintiffs under the policy did not exceed $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">After a hearing on the motion on July 7, 1992, the trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s total liability to the plaintiffs under the terms of the policy was $100,000. The court further concluded that because the defendant\u2019s prior payments to the plaintiffs<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> totaled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>$38,598.89,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> only $61,401.11 remained available. Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment and for a remittitur<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in the amount of $38,598.89, and rendered a corrected judgment for the plaintiff of $61,401.11, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Misura appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to that court with direction to reinstate the verdict in full, subject only to a reduction for collateral source payments made to or on behalf of Misura. On appeal to this court, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court was incorrect when it directed the trial court to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> with a review of \u00a7 38a-336 (b). Section 38a-336 (b) requires that an insurer pay its insured up to the limits of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage after the liability limits of all other applicable insurance policies have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements. This statutory subsection, together with the other provisions of the uninsured motorist statute, \u00a7 38a-336, reflects the public policy of this state to afford a personal injury claimant access to insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>protection to compensate for the damages that would have been recoverable if the uninsured motorist had maintained an adequate policy of liability insurance. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>225 Conn. 566, 573, 624 A.2d 892 (1993); <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982). Section 38a-336 (b) also provides, however, that \u201cin no event shall the total amount of recovery from all policies, including any amount recovered under the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, exceed the limits of the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d This limitation on an insured\u2019s recovery to the maximum amount allowed under the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist provisions serves to avoid the anomaly of a greater recovery under those policy provisions than would have been available from a tortfeasor carrying liability insurance equal to the coverage of the insured. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>supra, 573; see also <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 391-92, 392-93 n.6, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Misura acknowledges the general statutory prohibition against a recovery by an insured in excess of the limits of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage. Moreover, she does not dispute the fact that her insurance policy expressly limited recovery for any one accident to a total of $100,000. She contends, however, that the defendant was required to have pleaded as a special defense<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the policy\u2019s $100,000 limit and its settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>ment of Bennett\u2019s claim in order to have limited the plaintiffs\u2019 combined recovery to $100,000. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">As a general rule, facts must be pleaded as a special defense when they are consistent with the allegations of the complaint but demonstrate, nonetheless, that the plaintiff has no cause of action. Practice Book \u00a7 164; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Bassman, </em>221 Conn. 465, 472-73, 604 A.2d 814 (1992). The fundamental purpose of a special defense, like other pleadings, is to apprise the court and opposing counsel of the issues to be tried, so that basic issues are not concealed until the trial is underway. Pawlinski <em>v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 1, 6, 327 A.2d 583 (1973); <em>DuBose </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>161 Conn. 254, 261, 287 A.2d 357 (1971). Whether facts must be specially pleaded depends on the nature of those facts in relation to the contested issues. See <em>Pawlinski </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 6-7; <em>DuBose </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>supra, 259-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In the circumstances presented here, the defendant\u2019s failure to have pleaded the $100,000 policy limit as a special defense did not deprive it of the benefit of that provision. The complaint originally filed by the plaintiffs expressly alleged uninsured motorist coverage \u201cup to a policy limit of $100,000 per accident,\u201d an allegation that the plaintiffs agreed to delete because, as the defendant claimed, the parties had agreed that (1) the policy limit was $100,000, (2) the policy limit did not raise a jury issue,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and (3) its introduction had the potential to prejudice the jury unduly. Because the plaintiffs had already acknowledged the $100,000 policy limit in their complaint, the defendant\u2019s failure to plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>that policy provision as a special defense did not preclude the trial court from reducing the jury award in accordance with \u00a7 38a-336 (b). See <em>Dreier </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>196 Conn. 242, 244, 492 A.2d 164 (1985) (\u201cstatements in withdrawn or superseded pleadings, including complaints, may be considered as evidential admissions by the party making them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Furthermore, the defendant had repeatedly expressed its understanding, both in its written submissions and in oral argument to the trial court, that in the event the jury returned a verdict for Misura which, together with its obligations under the settlement agreement with Bennett, exceeded $100,000, the verdict would be reduced accordingly by the court. Prior to the verdict, Misura had not contested the propriety of that procedure and, indeed, had indicated that it would be the appropriate one to follow if such a reduction of the verdict were necessary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Misura had ample notice, therefore, that the defendant was relying on the undisputed terms of the policy to limit its liability to the plaintiffs. Thus, because there was no dispute that the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery was limited by the express and unambiguous terms of the policy and Mis-ura was on notice that the defendant intended to seek a reduction, by posttrial motion, of any verdict in excess of the policy limit, the trial court properly reduced the award notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s failure to plead the $100,000 limitation as a special defense.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>We also agree with the defendant that its failure to raise as a special defense the settlement agreement that it had entered into with Bennett did not preclude the trial court from granting the defendant\u2019s request for a remittitur. General Statutes \u00a7 52-216a<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> expressly prohibits the introduction of evidence concerning settlement agreements or releases in jury trials. That statute was enacted to \u201censure that jury verdicts will not be influenced by the knowledge of a partial settlement\u201d; <em>Civiello </em>v. <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., </em>208 Conn. 82, 93, 544 A.2d 158 (1988); thereby \u201cremoving whatever possibility for prejudice [that] may exist . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 73, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). Therefore, in view of the fact that Bennett\u2019s settlement agreement with the defendant was not a disputed issue that required determination by the jury, the introduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>at trial of evidence concerning that settlement would have been inappropriate. Furthermore, Misura can claim neither surprise nor prejudice by virtue of the defendant\u2019s failure to have pleaded its settlement of Bennett\u2019s claim, because, as discussed previously, the defendant had fully apprised both the court and Mis-ura of its intention to seek a reduction of any verdict obtained by Misura that, together with the $37,115 it was obligated to pay Bennett, exceeded the policy limit of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s failure to plead as a special defense either the $100,000 limit of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage or its settlement of Bennett\u2019s claim in the amount of $37,115 did not preclude the trial court from granting the relief sought by the defendant. The trial court correctly reduced the jury award as required by the plain and undisputed terms of Misura\u2019s policy in accordance with \u00a7 38a-336 (b), and properly rendered judgment for Mis-ura in that amount.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>In view of the issues raised by this appeal, we take this opportunity, pursuant to our supervisory authority over the administration of justice; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 397-98, 645 A.2d 535 (1994); to hold that henceforth an insurer should raise issues of policy limitation, even when undisputed, by special defense. When a jury determination of the facts raised by special defense is not necessary, the special defense will not be submitted to the jury but, rather, will be resolved by the trial court prior to the rendering of judgment. Compliance with this procedure will place the trial court and the opposing party on proper notice of the policy limitation issue so that it may be resolved in accordance with \u00a7 38a-336 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\"> <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Automobile Ins.

She first claims that because there was no \u201cmistake or clerical error\u201d in the original judgment, the relief sought by the plaintiff was not available under Practice Book \u00a7 325 and General Statutes \u00a7 52-228. Although we acknowledge that the applicability of those provisions to the facts of this case is not beyond doubt, we conclude that they provided a sufficient basis, together with Practice Book \u00a7 326, for the relief sought. As we have discussed, the defendant had repeatedly and without objection expressed its understanding of the procedure to be followed in the event of a jury verdict in excess of the policy limit, and the trial court structured the trial and the posttrial hearings with that same understanding. Although the defendant should have brought the issue of the policy limit to the attention of the trial court before the court had rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict, we believe that the trial court acted within its discretion in rendering a corrected judgment on the defendant\u2019s motion. See <em>Hirtle </em>v. <em>Hirtle, </em>217 Conn. 394, 398, 586 A.2d 578 (1991) (\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 326 vests discretion in the trial court to determine whether there is a good and compelling reason for its modification or vacation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Misura also claims that the defendant should have filed its motion to open the judgment under Practice Book \u00a7 320, not under Practice Book \u00a7 325. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Although a motion under \u00a7 320 might have been preferable, we cannot say that the trial court acted improperly in granting the defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 325 and 326 and General Statutes \u00a7 52-228.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Finally, Misura argues that the defendant\u2019s failure to have tendered payment to Bennett until after the trial of her case constituted a waiver of the defendant\u2019s right under the insurance policy and General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 to a reduction of the verdict in an amount equal to the Bennett settlement. We disagree. At no time did the defendant indicate that it did not intend to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement, and it did so promptly upon the resolution of the dispute over the Misura judgment. Moreover, Misura and Bennett were represented by the same trial counsel, who did not raise this issue until after the trial of Misura\u2019s case. In these circumstances, the trial court properly concluded that the defendant was entitled to a reduction of the verdict for Misura in an amount equal to the difference between the $100,000 policy limit and the amount of the Bennett settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
