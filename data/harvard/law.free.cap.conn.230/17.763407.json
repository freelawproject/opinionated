We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The record reveals the following relevant facts. The petitioner was sentenced on February 24, 1984, to a term of imprisonment of forty months. Subsequently, on August 15, 1985, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years to be served consecutively to his sentence of forty months. Thereafter, on March 18, 1993, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of nine months to be served concurrently with the sentence he was then serving.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The petitioner\u2019s forty month sentence expired on October 18, 1986. He was discharged from his ten year sentence on July 2, 1993. Thereafter, he was serving only the nine month concurrent sentence imposed on March 18, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">While the petitioner was serving his forty month sentence, he had forfeited a substantial amount of good conduct credit because of misconduct in the institution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>See General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While serving his ten year sentence, the petitioner also had forfeited a substantial amount of good conduct credit. His behavior thereafter had improved during that sentence, however, and all the forfeited credit attributable to that sentence had been eventually restored to that sentence. The respondent, however, refused to consider restoration of good conduct credits forfeited during the petitioner\u2019s forty month sentence for application to his subsequent sentences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">On April 12, 1993, the petitioner brought this petition for habeas corpus to require that the respondent consider the good conduct credits forfeited during the petitioner\u2019s expired forty month sentence for application to reduce his remaining sentences. The habeas court concluded that the respondent had denied the petitioner\u2019s request on grounds not authorized by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and 18-7a, and ordered the respondent to reconsider the request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court reasoned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the petitioner\u2019s forty month sentence and his subsequent sentences should be construed as \u201cone continuous term\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 18-7. It determined, therefore, that the petitioner was entitled to have any good conduct credit forfeited during his forty month sentence considered for restoration to reduce his remaining sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Pursuant to the habeas court\u2019s judgment, the respondent considered the petitioner\u2019s request for restoration of good conduct credits and restored to his ten year sentence thirty days of credit that the petitioner had lost while serving his forty month sentence. The respondent, however, refused to apply the restored thirty days of credit to the petitioner\u2019s nine month sentence. When the petitioner was notified on July 29, 1993, that thirty days of good conduct credit had been restored, the petitioner already had been discharged from his ten year sentence. Thereafter, the petitioner continued to serve only the unexpired portion of the nine month concurrent term to which he had been sentenced on March 18, 1993. That term was due to be discharged in September, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In response to the petitioner\u2019s motion requesting enforcement of its judgment, the habeas court ruled that all three sentences in question were required to be treated as one continuous term of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 18-7. The court therefore ordered that the thirty days of restored good conduct credit be applied to that portion of the petitioner\u2019s nine month concurrent sentence that he was still serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The respondent did not appeal the habeas court\u2019s decision insofar as it held that the petitioner was entitled to have his forty month sentence and his consecutive ten year sentence aggregated and construed as one continuous term of imprisonment. Moreover, he does not disagree with the habeas court\u2019s ruling that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the good conduct credits forfeited by the petitioner while serving his forty month sentence properly should have been considered for application to reduce the petitioner\u2019s consecutive ten year sentence, even though the petitioner\u2019s forty month term had expired. The respondent concedes that these aspects of the habeas court\u2019s ruling were reasonable interpretations of <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 568, 574, 587 A.2d 116 (1991) (statutory mandate of \u00a7 18-7 that consecutive terms of imprisonment be aggregated and treated as one consecutive term of imprisonment for purpose of calculating good time credits). See also <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 584, 587 A.2d 124 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The respondent, however, appeals from that part of the habeas court\u2019s judgment that determined that the petitioner\u2019s nine month concurrent sentence was part of a continuous term of imprisonment and that the restoration of thirty days of good conduct credit from the petitioner\u2019s expired forty month sentence had to be applied to his nine month sentence. The respondent did not seek a stay of execution, however, and the restored good conduct credits were applied to the nine month sentence that the petitioner was then serving. He was released from custody on August 30, 1993.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The question posed by this appeal is whether the habeas court properly ordered the respondent to apply the restored thirty days of good conduct credit from the petitioner\u2019s expired forty month sentence to his concurrent nine month sentence. We conclude that the habeas court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Section 18-7 states in pertinent part: \u201cWhen any prisoner is held under more than one conviction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation which he may earn under the provisions of this section.\u201d This statute makes no distinction between convictions that result in consecutive sentences and those that result in concurrent sentences. See <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 439, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981); see also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>34 Conn. App. 503, 506, 642 A.2d 724 (1994). We cannot rewrite the statute to make such a distinction. <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 690, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>205 Conn. 27, 34, 529 A.2d 1302 (1987); <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>204 Conn. 760, 763, 529 A.2d 194 (1987). If the legislature had intended \u00a7 18-7 to apply only to consecutive sentences, it could easily have said so. <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 719, 513 A.2d 43 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 232, 479 A.2d 814 (1984). The fact, therefore, that the petitioner\u2019s sentence was concurrent rather than consecutive does not remove it from the purview of \u00a7 18-7. Consequently, if the petitioner was \u201cheld\u201d under more than one conviction on the imposition of his nine month concurrent sentence on March 18, 1993, he would have been entitled to have all his sentences \u201cconstrued as one continuous term\u201d of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 18-7 for the purpose of the forfeiture, and by implication, the restoration of good conduct credits. <em>Moulthrop </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>129 Conn. 164, 168, 26 A.2d 789 (1942) (for forfeiture of good conduct credit earned, several counts are regarded as one continuous term).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>185 Conn. 540, 548, 441 A.2d 166 (1981), we determined that the execution of the mittimus delivering the petitioner to the custody of the warden of the Somers Correctional Institution \u201cheld\u201d the petitioner for the purposes of \u00a7 18-7, even though the petitioner was then serving another sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>fence. We reasoned that upon the execution of the mittimus by the sheriff, the petitioner was \u201cheld\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-97<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the specific language of the mittimus process. Moreover, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>168 Conn. 395, 409, 363 A.2d 33, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 855, 96 S. Ct. 104, 46 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1975), we concluded that concurrent sentences are separate terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We cannot distinguish <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Clemons </em>from the present case to conclude other than that the petitioner was \u201cheld\u201d under more than one conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The petitioner had not only been committed to the respondent and the warden by the authority of a mit-timus, but, because his March 18, 1993 sentence was concurrent to his previous sentence, he had embarked immediately upon its service. It is clear, consequently, that the petitioner was \u201cheld\u201d under more than one conviction. As a result, his sentences must be \u201cconstrued as one continuous term\u201d of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 18-7 for the purpose of the restoration of any good conduct credit. Therefore, the petitioner was entitled to have the thirty days of restored good conduct credits applied to his overall sentence, that is, the sentence with the longest term to run, in this case, his nine month concurrent sentence. \u201c[T]he legislature explicitly chose to make the \u2018effective sentence\u2019 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>benchmark for \u2018good time\u2019 under \u00a7 18-7 . . . .\u201d <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Moreover, the fact that the petitioner\u2019s forty month sentence had expired prior to the time the petitioner was \u201cheld\u201d pursuant to his nine month sentence does not defeat the petitioner\u2019s claim that he was entitled to the restored good conduct credits attributable to that sentence. Concededly, the petitioner\u2019s forty month sentence was required to be treated as one continuous term with his subsequent ten year sentence. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 568. His forfeited good conduct credits from that sentence were, therefore, applicable to his ten year sentence. Because the nine month concurrent sentence must be construed as one continuous term with his ten year sentence, those credits were also available for application to his nine month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We conclude therefore that the habeas court properly ordered the respondent to apply the thirty days of good conduct credit from the petitioner\u2019s forty month sentence restored to the time remaining on his nine month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 provides in pertinent part: \u201ccalculation OF TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">\u201c(b) A definite sentence of imprisonment commences when the prisoner is received in the custody to which he was sentenced.
