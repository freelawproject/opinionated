In <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>32 Conn. App. 831, 835, 632 A.2d 50 (1993), the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had properly placed the burden on the defendant. We granted the defendant\u2019s petition to appeal the merits of this conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">After examining the record on appeal and considering the briefs and the oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-11\"> We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cWas the Appellate Court correct in finding that a defendant who seeks a new trial based on jury misconduct must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>that he was actually prejudiced by the jury\u2019s use of extrinsic evidence during deliberations?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>228 Conn. 913, 635 A.2d 1231 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Berdon, J., with whom Katz, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AkO\">joins, dissenting. I disagree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that, in order to be entitled to a new trial, a defendant must prove that he or she was actually prejudiced by the jury\u2019s consideration of extrinsic evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>32 Conn. App. 831, 835, 632 A.2d 50 (1993). I would therefore remand this issue to the trial court for reconsideration in light of the appropriate standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">This case involves a \u201ccop in a box\u201d operation in which an informant in a pickup truck purchased narcotics while a police officer in a cardboard box in the bed of the truck surreptitiously witnessed the transaction through holes in the box the size of quarters. The defendant\u2019s principal defense was that the police officer in the box had mistaken him for someone else. Evidence was presented before the trial court that a juror had performed an experiment outside the jury room to assess whether a person could see clearly through a quarter-sized hole in a cardboard box, and had discussed this experiment with other jurors. The trial court denied the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground that there was no evidence that the jurors <em>actually considered </em>the out-of-court experiment in reaching their verdict. The Appellate Court upheld this application of an actual prejudice standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 736, 478 A.2d 227 (1984) <em>(Asherman I), </em>cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985), this court noted that a jury\u2019s \u201c[(\u2018Consideration of extrinsic evidence is presumptively prejudicial because it implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\u201d Accordingly, the court held that a defendant need only prove that there is a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that his or her right to a fair trial has been prejudiced by the alleged juror misconduct in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>be entitled to a new trial. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 739. In determining whether a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d exists, three factors must be considered: (1) \u201cthe magnitude of the juror\u2019s deviation from his proper role\u201d; (2) \u201cthe degree to which the accused was deprived of the benefits of the constitutional and statutory safeguards\u201d regarding the admission of evidence; and (3) \u201cthe likelihood that the impropriety influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Once the defendant proves that there is a reasonable possibility of prejudice, the burden shifts to the state to prove that the juror misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Because I believe that \u201creasonable possibility\u201d is the appropriate standard,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and because the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>make any findings beyond the bare fact that there was no proof of actual prejudice, I would remand this issue to the trial court for reconsideration in light of the appropriate standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> The state relies on <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>202 Conn. 429, 442, 521 A.2d 578 (1987) <em>(Asherman II), </em>to claim that this court has adopted an \u201cactual prejudice\u201d standard. This reliance is misplaced. <em>Asherman II </em>was a habeas corpus proceeding in which the defendant challenged the same juror misconduct that he had challenged in his direct appeal in <em>Asherman I. </em>The <em>Asherman II </em>court refused to consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, holding that the claim was barred by res judicata. <em>Asherman II, </em>supra, 443. The <em>Asherman II </em>court did discuss how the burden of proof depends on whether the trial court is implicated in the juror misconduct. If the trial court is implicated, then the state must prove that the juror misconduct was harmless error; if the trial court is not implicated, then the defendant bears the burden of proof. Id., 442. While the <em>Asherman II </em>court used the words \u201cactual prejudice\u201d to describe what the defendant was required to prove under <em>Asherman I; </em>see id., 442 n.10; there is nothing in <em>Asherman II </em>to suggest that the court intended to change the standard. Indeed, the question of whether the <em>Asherman I </em>standard was appropriate was not even before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Furthermore, it would be unfair to require a defendant to prove actual prejudice. Jurors are instructed at the beginning of every trial that they \u201cmay consider only the evidence properly admitted in the case.\u201d D. Borden &amp; L. Orland, 5 Connecticut Practice, Connecticut Criminal Jury Instructions (1986) \u00a7 1.10, p. 13; see also id., \u00a7\u00a7 1.13 and 1.14, pp. 15, 21-22. They are also instructed, immediately prior to deliberations, that \u201cyour verdict must be based absolutely and solely upon the evidence given to you in the trial of the case.\u201d Id., \u00a7 2.1, pp. 27-28. The jurors know from these instructions that the consideration of extrinsic evidence is not permitted, and that out-of-court experiments are therefore prohibited. In most cases, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>probably be impossible for the defendant to prove actual prejudice because the jurors will have an interest in denying any experimentation, or at least downplaying the effect it had on their deliberations. For this reason, the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d standard of <em>Asherman I </em>is more just and appropriate than an \u201cactual prejudice\u201d standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
