Ullmann (plaintiff), was held in criminal contempt by the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-33<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for refusing to testify in a criminal trial. He later filed a motion to vacate the judgment of contempt, which the trial court denied. The plaintiff subsequently filed this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The plaintiff, the public defender for the judicial district of New Haven, had represented a defendant, Eddie Ford, in a criminal case from approximately July, 1991, until June, 1992, at which time the plaintiff withdrew from the case and a special public defender was appointed. Ford, who originally had been charged in an information with one count each of robbery in the first degree, robbery in the second degree and tampering with a witness, was further charged on August 1, 1992, with an additional count of tampering with a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The additional count of tampering with a witness was occasioned when, on June 1, 1992, a witness in Ford\u2019s case, Carlos Robles, received a collect telephone call in which he was threatened with bodily harm if he testified against Ford. During Ford\u2019s trial, the state intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>duced evidence that the call had been placed at approximately 9:43 p.m. from a telephone located in a cell-block at the New Haven community correctional center. An administrative captain at the correctional center testified that Ford had been incarcerated in that cell-block on June 1, and that he was one of approximately twenty inmates with access to the telephone used to call Robles at the relevant time.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The plaintiff was subpoenaed to testify in Ford\u2019s trial with regard to the tampering charge relating to the telephone call. The trial commenced on August 31, 1992. On September 1, 1992, the plaintiff moved to quash the subpoena. Outside the presence of the jury, the assistant state\u2019s attorney prosecuting Ford\u2019s case made the following offer of proof concerning the information that the state sought to elicit from the plaintiff: \u201cI will ask him where he works for background, who he is and what he does. I will ask him then did you represent Eddie Ford from approximately July 30 of 1991 until June 28, 1992, in this criminal case. On June 1 of 1992 did you meet with me in my office. . . . Did I then give you a copy of several police reports including State\u2019s Exhibit L . . . .\u201d The state continued with its offer of proof as follows: <em>\u201cPrior to my giving you that document did you have the phone number and address of Carlos Robles. The answer to that I believe will be no. </em>And then the last question I would ask, did you meet with Eddie Ford that evening at the Whalley Avenue Correctional Center and I will stop at that point.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The following facts are undisputed. The meeting between the plaintiff and the assistant state\u2019s attorney, wherein the plaintiff received police reports, one of which contained Robles\u2019 telephone number, took place at approximately 4 p.m. on June 1, 1992. The plaintiff met with Ford at the correctional center at approximately 6 p.m. on that same day. Robles\u2019 tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>phone number was not listed in the New Haven telephone directory under \u201cRobles.\u201d Instead, it was listed under \u201cSantos-Robles.\u201d Thus, the number was not readily available to anyone who lacked that information. Because Robles testified that he did not recognize the voice on the telephone to be that of Ford, the state\u2019s theory of Ford\u2019s criminal liability for tampering with a witness was not confined to Ford as a principal but also included Ford as an accessory.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The state claimed that the testimony that it sought to elicit from the plaintiff would permit the jury to infer that Ford had obtained Robles\u2019 telephone number from the plaintiff during their meeting at the correctional center on the evening of June 1, 1992. The plaintiff objected to answering the proposed questions on the ground that to do so would require him to disclose information relating to his representation of his client from which allegedly privileged communications could be inferred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff argued to the trial court that any disclosure of information relating to the representation of his former client was barred by the Rules of Professional Conduct, the attorney-client privilege, and the work product doctrine. He also argued that the information could be obtained through other means, would damage his attorney-client relationship with Ford, and would also damage the relationship of the public defender\u2019s office with other clients. The trial court rejected his claims and denied his motion to quash the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The plaintiff subsequently took the stand at Ford\u2019s trial. In response to the state\u2019s questions, he testified that he had been employed by the office of the public defender since 1977, and that he had represented Ford. When asked, however, whether he had met with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>assistant state\u2019s attorney on June 1, 1992, he refused to answer and further indicated that he would not answer the remainder of the questions proposed by the state. When directed by the court to answer, the plaintiff again refused. When the court inquired of Ford as to whether he would waive the attorney-client privilege, he stated that he would not. The court thereupon held the plaintiff in criminal contempt \u201cfor refusing to answer, to obey the direct order of the court,\u201d and fined him $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Ford was convicted of the robbery charges and the charge of tampering with a witness that involved the telephone call made from the correctional center on June 1, 1992. On appeal, however, the Appellate Court reversed Ford\u2019s conviction of tampering with a witness arising from that telephone call, holding that the state had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that it had been Ford or someone acting at his behest, rather than any of the other inmates with access to the telephone, acting on his own, who had made that call. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>33 Conn. App. 143, 634 A.2d 1188 (1993), cert. granted, 228 Conn. 918, 636 A.2d 849 (1994). We subsequently reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court and reinstated the jury verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 646 A.2d 147 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">After Ford\u2019s trial had concluded, the plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the judgment of contempt against himself on the grounds that the trial court improperly had punished him for criminal rather than civil contempt, and that the trial court had failed to balance the need for this testimony against the possible harm to the attorney-client relationship. The trial court denied the motion to vacate the contempt judgment. The plaintiff then filed this writ of error, claiming that: (1) the exclusive sanction for his refusal to testify is contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>in General Statutes \u00a7 51-35,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a civil contempt statute; (2) the testimony that the state sought to elicit was protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product rule; and (3) the trial court improperly balanced the need for his testimony against the possible harm to the attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">This case comes to us on a writ of error, which is the sole method of reviewing a summary criminal contempt proceeding. <em>Naunchek </em>v. <em>Naunchek, </em>191 Conn. 110, 113, 463 A.2d 603 (1983); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 257, 440 A.2d 969 (1982). This court\u2019s review of summary criminal contempt is limited to three issues: \u201c(1) whether the designated conduct is legally susceptible of constituting a contempt ... (2) whether the punishment imposed was authorized by law . . . and (3) whether the judicial authority was qualified to conduct the hearing.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 257. We are concerned in this instance with only the issue of whether the punishment was authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">The plaintiff initially argues that the trial court improperly held him in criminal contempt pursuant to \u00a7 51-33 for refusing to testify. He contends that his refusal to testify could be addressed only as a civil contempt pursuant to \u00a7 51-35. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Section 51-33, the criminal contempt statute, has its origins in a statute enacted in 1667. 2 J. Hammond, Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut, From 1665-77 (1852) p. 60. As codified in 1796, the statute provided that \u201cif any Person ... in the Presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>any Court, shall, either in Words or Actions behave contemptuously or disorderly, it shall be in the power of the Court ... to inflict such Punishment upon him or them as they shall judge most suitable to the Nature of the Offence.\u201d General Statutes (1796) \u201cAn Act Concerning Delinquents,\u201d \u00b6 8, p. 143. The progenitor of \u00a7 51-35, the civil contempt statute, was enacted in 1711. It provided that \u201cany Person who shall be required to give his evidence upon tryal . . . and shall refuse to make oath to answer to such questions . . . shall be by such court . . . committed to goal, and there remain at his own cost and charge until he shall give evidence as aforesaid.\u201d 5 C. Hoadly, Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut from October, 1706 to October, 1716 (1870) p. 233. By 1887, both statutes approximated their present form. General Statutes (1887 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 842<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 843;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see also General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 508 and 506; General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 5522 and 5520; General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 5407 and 5405; General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 7704 and 7702; General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7\u00a7 51-35 and 51-33. Nowhere in the language of \u00a7 51-35 or its legislative history is there any indication that it was intended to preempt \u00a7 51-33 or that it was to be the exclusive sanction for the refusal of a witness to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The plaintiff contends, however, that the rules of statutory construction compel the conclusion that \u00a7 51-35 governs all contempts involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>a refusal to testify. Specifically, the plaintiff relies on the principle that specific terms addressing a subject matter should prevail over general language covering the same subject matter. See, e.g., <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 417, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988). We note, however, that \u00a7 51-33 and its predecessors merely codify the court\u2019s inherent common law power to punish all contempts committed in its presence, including a refusal to testify. See <em>Middlebrook </em>v. <em>State, </em>43 Conn. 257, 267 (1876). Absent clear intent to do so, a \u201c \u2018statute should not be construed as altering the common law rule . . . and should not be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which the statute does not fairly express.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 764, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nugent, </em>199 Conn. 537, 548, 508 A.2d 728 (1986). In the absence of an explicit declaration, we conclude that, by enacting \u00a7 51-35, the legislature did not intend to eliminate the traditional common law remedies available for a refusal to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The plaintiff cites <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>222 Conn. 591, 610 A.2d 1177 (1992), in support of his position that he could not be held in criminal contempt pursuant to \u00a7 51-33. In <em>Wilson, </em>we upheld the trial court\u2019s imposition of a six month sentence for criminal contempt pursuant to \u00a7 51-33 for a witness\u2019 refusal to testify. In a footnote, we said in dictum, however, that \u201c[t]he conduct for which the trial court held the plaintiff in contempt in this case arguably constituted a civil contempt, in that the plaintiff could have \u2018purged\u2019 himself by agreeing to testify. . . . Because the plaintiff has not challenged the classification of his conduct as criminal contempt, however, we treat his refusal to testify as a criminal contempt in accordance with our precedent.\u201d Id., 596 n.5. The plaintiff argues that this court\u2019s language in <em>Wilson </em>is indicative of our concern over the classification of a refusal to testify as criminal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tempt. <em>Wilson, </em>however, merely reflects our recognition that a refusal to testify may, at the discretion of the trial judge, be the ground for finding either civil or criminal contempt depending on the exigencies of a particular situation, which finding may be challenged by the contemnor on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The plaintiff also cites <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>110 Conn. 482, 148 A. 551 (1930). In <em>McCarthy, </em>we upheld the constitutionality of a statute that authorized a term of imprisonment for a refusal to testify in a grand jury proceeding until the witness had agreed to testify. In its decision, the <em>McCarthy </em>court noted that \u201c[w]hen sitting as a court, justices have always had the power to commit a witness refusing to answer any proper question in any action pending before them ... a power which in criminal proceedings received statutory recognition as early as 1711.\u201d Id., 497. The plaintiff contends that <em>McCarthy </em>stands for the proposition that civil contempt provides the only appropriate remedy for the refusal of a witness to testify.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We read <em>McCarthy </em>as standing for the proposition that civil contempt may provide one applicable and appropriate remedy for the refusal of a witness to testify. We have never held, however, that civil contempt furnishes the only remedy for such refusal. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 258 (plaintiff conceded that unjustifiable refusal of witness to answer proper questions before judicial tribunal constituted criminal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>tempt, so long as punishment kept within six month term provided by \u00a7 51-33).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Our case law classifies civil contempt as conduct directed against the rights of the opposing party; <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>191 Conn. 468, 482, 464 A.2d 837 (1983); <em>McTigue </em>v. <em>New London Education Assn., </em>164 Conn. 348, 352, 321 A.2d 462 (1973); while criminal contempt consists of conduct that is directed against the dignity and authority of the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>189 Conn. 663, 666, 457 A.2d 1072 (1983); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 258. A witness\u2019 refusal to testify in response to an order of the court may, however, be inimical to the rights of the opposing party <em>and </em>simultaneously affront the dignity and authority of the court. As we noted in <em>Wilson, </em>when a witness refuses to testify \u201cthere is an overwhelming necessity for empowering a court to adjudicate the contempt summarily and to impose punishment sufficiently substantial <em>to cause the witness to reconsider and deter such conduct by others. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 604. The form in which the court\u2019s contempt power is exercised depends on the court\u2019s perception of the paramount interest to be vindicated and the least onerous way of vindicating that interest, as dictated by the particular facts and circumstances sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>rounding the witness\u2019 refusal to testify. See <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 228, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984); <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Niles, </em>9 Conn. App. 240, 253, 518 A.2d 932 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Section 51-33 permits the court to impose a definite sentence of not more than six months imprisonment or a fine not greater than $100 for an affront to its dignity and authority, such as noncompliance with a court order. Section 51-35, however, provides the court with an alternate means to address the refusal of a witness to testify when ordered to do so. By authorizing the commitment of a recalcitrant witness until he or she testifies, \u00a7 51-35 provides the court with a method specifically designed to compel the witness\u2019 testimony. Depending on the facts of a particular case, the rights of an opposing party may be the paramount interest implicated by a witness\u2019 refusal to testify, and the compulsion of testimony pursuant to \u00a7 51-35 may be the most effective measure to address and vindicate that interest. The determination of the interest to be addressed and the method of addressing it, however, is left to the sound discretion of the court. \u201cIt is well settled that the imposition of sanctions to compel the observance of its orders rests within the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on review unless there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Fox </em>v. <em>First Bank, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>198 Conn. 34, 39, 501 A.2d 747 (1985); see <em>Thode </em>v. <em>Thode, </em>190 Conn. 694, 462 A.2d 4 (1983); <em>In re Mon-gillo, </em>190 Conn. 686, 461 A.2d 1387 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Although \u201cwhether a contempt is civil or criminal turns on the \u2018character and purpose\u2019 of the sanction involved\u201d;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>International Union, United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Bagwell, </em>U.S. , 114 S. Ct. 2552, 2557, 129 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1994); the United States Supreme Court has indicated that \u201cthe stated purposes of a contempt sanction alone cannot be determinative.\u201d Id. \u201c[C]onclusions about the civil or criminal nature of a contempt sanction are properly drawn, not from \u2018the subjective intent of a State\u2019s laws and its courts\u2019. . . but \u2018from an examination of the character of the relief itself . . . .\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. Accordingly, a court\u2019s power to hold a party in civil or criminal contempt is not limited by the nature of the offense. Rather, it is the nature of the relief itself that is instructive in determining whether a contempt is civil or criminal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>A contempt fine is civil if it either \u201c \u2018coerce[s] the defendant into compliance with the court\u2019s order, [or] . . . compensate^] the complainant for losses sustained.\u2019 . . . Where a fine is not compensatory, it is civil only if the contemnor is afforded an opportunity to purge.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 2558. In the present case, the fine imposed on the plaintiff for refusing to testify was not compensatory and the plaintiff was not afforded an opportunity to purge himself by agreeing to testify. Rather, the trial court imposed a flat, unconditional fine of $100 on the plaintiff. \u201c[A] \u2018flat, unconditional fine\u2019 totalling even as little as $50 announced after a finding of contempt is criminal if the contem-nor has no subsequent opportunity to reduce or avoid the fine through compliance.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we conclude that it was permissible for the trial court to hold the plaintiff in criminal contempt and that the nature of the penalty it imposed properly reflects the imposition of criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the testimony sought by the state was protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product rule and, as a result, the trial court improperly held him in contempt for his refusal to testify. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">At the outset, we note that the attorney-client privilege is strictly construed because it \u201ctends to prevent a full disclosure of the truth in court . . . .\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u00a7 12.5.1; <em>Turner\u2019s Appeal, </em>72 Conn. 305, 318, 44 A. 310 (1899). The attorney-client privilege protects communications between client and attorney when made in confidence for the purpose of seeking or giving legal advice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cascone, </em>195 Conn. 183, 186, 487 A.2d 186 (1985). Statements made in the presence of a third party, on the other hand, \u201care usually not privileged because there is then no reasonable expectation of confidentiality.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In the present case, the state asked the plaintiff whether he had met with the state\u2019s attorney on June 1, 1992. The plaintiff refused to answer. In addition, the state indicated that it intended to ask the plaintiff whether he had known Robles\u2019 address and telephone number prior to meeting with the state\u2019s attorney, whether the state\u2019s attorney gave him a copy of the police report containing Robles\u2019 address and telephone number, and whether he had met with Ford after meeting with the state\u2019s attorney and receiving the police report. The plaintiff also refused to answer those proposed questions, and now contends that they directly implicate matters protected by the attorney-client privilege. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We have previously held that a communication between a defendant\u2019s attorney and a state\u2019s attorney concerning a plea agreement does not fall within the scope of the attorney-client privilege. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burak, </em>201 Conn. 517, 526, 518 A.2d 639 (1986). Such information, we concluded, failed to qualify for the attorney-client privilege because it involved statements made to a third party, with no attendant expectation of confidentiality. See id. Similarly, we fail to see how the fact of a meeting between the plaintiff and the state\u2019s attorney in this case, or what transpired at that meeting, could constitute privileged communications protected by the attorney-client privilege. Requiring the plaintiff to answer the state\u2019s question as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>he had met with the state\u2019s attorney on June 1, therefore, did not violate the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We are equally unpersuaded under the facts of this case that the answer to a question posed to the plaintiff as to whether he had met with his client would have encroached upon the attorney-client privilege. The plaintiff met with his client at the New Haven community correctional center, a public institution. Because of the nature of the institution, the plaintiff\u2019s meeting with his client would have been witnessed and recorded by department of correction personnel, and the fact that a meeting had taken place would not have been, and could not have been, confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Furthermore, the mere fact that a meeting took place between the plaintiff and his client did not constitute a communication and such information is not privileged for that reason. <em>State </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>174 Conn. 16, 19-20, 381 A.2d 536 (1977). \u201cIn its questioning of [the plaintiff], the state did not seek the substance of any communication that [the plaintiff] may have had with his client.\u201d Id. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 120, 291 A.2d 750 (1971), we concluded that the attorney-client privilege had not been violated when the defendant\u2019s previous attorney was asked whether he had had \u201ccertain conversations with [the defendant]\u201d and \u201c[w]here were those conversations held.\u201d Similarly, the attorney-client privilege was not violated in the present case when the state\u2019s attorney sought information as to whether the plaintiff had met with his client on a particular date.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">\u201cThe fact that an attorney may not disclose privileged communications between himself and his client does not affect his capacity and his duty to testify as to other matters when called on to do so. We are in accord with the majority rule that the privilege does not extend beyond communications.\u201d Id. In short, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the plaintiffs meeting with his client was not a confidential communication that fell within the parameters of the attorney-client privilege.

Accordingly it protects only those disclosures\u2014 <em>necessary to obtain informed legal </em>advice\u2014which might not have been made absent the privilege.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 403, 96 S.

A communication from attorney to client solely regarding a matter of fact would not ordinarily be privileged, unless it were shown to be inextricably linked to the giving of legal advice. See <em>Turner\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, 72 Conn. 318 (\u201c[s]uch a request by a client to his attorney, made for the purpose of obtaining information for the former\u2019s benefit, upon a matter of fact, and not for the purpose of asking the attorney\u2019s advice, ought not to be regarded as a privileged communication\u201d); C.

The plaintiff has made no showing, either in the trial court or in this court, that such a communication of fact was inextricably linked to the giving of legal advice by the plaintiff to Ford. Indeed, the plaintiff never asked the trial court to restrict the question so as to exclude any communication between himself and Ford. Because, on its face, the content of the testimony that the state sought to elicit from the plaintiff \u201c[would] not [have] revealfed], either directly or implicitly, legal advice given [to Ford] or any client confidences\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeFazio, </em>supra, 899 F.2d 635; requiring the plaintiff to testify would not have implicated the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the information sought by the state was not subject to disclosure because it came under the work product rule and the Practice Book rules relating to discovery.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The work product rule protects an attorney\u2019s \u201c \u2018interviews, statements, memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions, personal beliefs and countless other tangible and intangible items.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barksdale </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>30 Conn.

The plaintiff does not claim that Robles was a prospective witness for the defense whose identity, address and telephone number the plaintiff had ascertained only as part of his investigation on Ford\u2019s behalf. It is difficult to conceive that questioning the plaintiff as to whether he simply was aware of Robles\u2019 address and telephone number prior to meeting with the state\u2019s attorney would require the disclosure of information procured by the plaintiff\u2019s activities in preparation for trial, i.e., \u201cwith a view to pending or anticipated litigation.\u201d The limited questioning that the state proposed would have revealed only when Robles\u2019 telephone number was obtained by the plaintiff and what was done with it, not what was obtained. What was obtained was already known to the state. Such a factual inquiry was not foreclosed by the work product rule or the rules of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that, even if the questions proposed by the state did not require the disclosure of communications or information protected by either the attorney-client privilege or the work product rule, the trial court abused its discretion by requiring him to testify because it failed to balance properly the state\u2019s need for his testimony against the harm to the attorney-client relationship. The plaintiff, in essence, urges the adoption of a balancing test that weighs the potential injury to the attorney-client relationship against the need for an attorney\u2019s testimony prior to requiring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>attorney, particularly a public defender, to testify in a case involving his or her client.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">At the outset, we note that courts have been reluctant to allow attorneys to be called as witnesses in trials in which they are advocates.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Rudolph </em>v. <em>State, </em>829 P.2d 269, 273 (Wyo. 1992); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Birdman, </em>602 F.2d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1032, 100 S. Ct. 703, 62 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1980). When either party in a criminal case seeks testimony from the prosecuting attorney, the federal courts have applied a \u201ccompelling need\u201d test.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Prantil, </em>764 F.2d 548, 554 (9th Cir. 1985); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dack, </em>747 F.2d 1172, 1176 n.5 (7th Cir. 1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Birdman, </em>supra, 553; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schwartzbaum, </em>527 F.2d 249, 253 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 942, 96 S. Ct. 1410, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>47 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1976). Under this test, the party wishing to call a prosecutor to testify must show that the testimony of the prosecutor is \u201cnecessary and not merely relevant,\u201d and that all other available sources of comparably probative evidence have been exhausted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>20 Conn. App. 290, 297, 567 A.2d 837 (1989); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Prantil, </em>supra, 551; <em>Rudolph </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The policy behind the compelling need test in the context of requiring a prosecutor to testify is fourfold: \u201cFirst, there is the risk that the prosecutor may not be a fully objective witness. <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Birdman, </em>supra, 602 F.2d 553]. Second, there exists the justifiable fear that, when a prosecutor takes the witness stand, \u2018the prestige or prominence of the prosecutor\u2019s office will artificially enhance his credibility as a witness.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>690 F.2d 638, 643 (7th Cir. 1982). Third, the jury may understandably be confused by the prosecutor\u2019s dual role. Id. . . . Finally, a broader concern for public confidence in the administration of justice suggests the maxim that \u2018justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 296; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Birdman, </em>supra, 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Those same or analogous concerns exist if the prospective witness is or had been counsel for the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We believe that the policy concerns under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>lying the compelling need test are valid and adopt that test as the criteria to be applied when either side in a criminal case seeks to call a prosecutor or defense attorney, who is or has been professionally involved in the case, to testify.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The compelling need test strikes the appropriate balance between the need for the information and the potential adverse effects on the attorney-client relationship and the judicial process in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The concern that a prosecutor may not be a fully objective witness applies equally to defense attorneys. The fact that an attorney has withdrawn from the case does not alleviate this concern, particularly where, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>here, the plaintiff withdrew solely because he anticipated being called as a witness in the case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is conceivable that the plaintiff still had an interest in Ford\u2019s defense; see <em>United States </em>v. Birdman, supra, 602 F.2d 553; which had been taken over by one of his colleagues in the public defender\u2019s office. See <em>Jennings Co. </em>v. <em>DiGenova, </em>107 Conn. 491, 498-99, 141 A. 866 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The court in <em>Birdman </em>cited the fear that the prosecutor\u2019s credibility would be enhanced if he or she took the stand as a witness due to the prestige of the prosecutor\u2019s office. A jury is likely to give \u201c \u2018to the evidence of the prosecuting attorney far greater weight than to that of the ordinary witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Birdman, </em>supra, 602 F.2d 554. Similarly, a jury is likely to give to the testimony of a defense attorney, present or former, far greater weight due to the defense attorney\u2019s unique position to assess his or her client\u2019s culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The most significant factor relates to public confidence in our criminal justice system.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cPublic confidence in our criminal justice system may be eroded by even the appearance of impropriety. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Prantil, </em>supra [764 F.2d 553].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 296. \u201c \u2018Especially in criminal liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>gation, where so much is at stake for the defendant, must the Bench and Bar demand adherence to a principle that is designed to ensure objectivity in the presentation of evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Birdman, </em>supra, 602 F.2d 553, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alu, </em>246 F.2d 29, 34 (2d Cir. 1957). A defendant\u2019s former attorney testifying against his or her client might compromise the appearance of justice in our courtrooms, lending credence to the unfortunate belief among some that, rather than being advocates for their clients, defense counsel are \u201cpart of the \u2018system\u2019 R.

We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In the present case, the trial court found that the testimony that the state sought to elicit from the plaintiff was necessary to the state\u2019s case. It is significant that the testimony related to a charge of tampering with a witness, a crime that strikes at the heart of the integrity of our justice system. The trial court specifically found that \u201c[t]he state did make a showing that the evidence was essential.\u201d It also determined that whether the plaintiff had Robles\u2019 address and telephone number prior to meeting with the assistant state\u2019s attorney on June 1,1992, was a fact exclusively within the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge and therefore the state could not secure this information in any manner other than through the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. In so finding, the court weighed the necessity for the plaintiff\u2019s testimony against any harm that might result to the attorney-client relationship by requiring the plaintiff to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The testimony anticipated by the state would have revealed that approximately two hours after the plaintiff first learned of Robles\u2019 telephone number, he met with Ford and that approximately three and one-half hours later on that same day the telephone call in question was made. This testimony, particularly the close time sequence, would have strengthened significantly the inference that Ford had made or had caused to be made the phone call to Robles from the correctional center. Whether the plaintiff had Robles\u2019 telephone number prior to June 1 could possibly have been inferred from other evidence. For example, the prosecutor could have testified that he had not given the plaintiff the telephone number prior to June 1. Such evidence, however, would not have foreclosed the possible inference that the plaintiff had received Robles\u2019 telephone number prior to June 1 in some manner other than through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>his meeting with the prosecutor. Only the plaintiff could have testified that he had first received Robles\u2019 telephone number at the June 1 meeting.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Without the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, it was possible for the jury to discount the fact that the call to Robles was made on June 1 as having no significance in proving that it was Ford who had made the telephone call or had caused the telephone call to be made on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The Appellate Court reversed Ford\u2019s conviction for tampering with a witness on the basis of insufficient proof that it was Ford who had made the telephone call or had caused the telephone call to be made.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 151. Arguably, the result in the Appellate Court would have been different had the plaintiff\u2019s potential testimony been elicited. Although we reversed the Appellate Court and concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support Ford\u2019s conviction, the Appellate Court decision makes clear that it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was \u201cessential\u201d to the state\u2019s case against Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">We recognize the delicate nature of the relationship between a.public defender and his or her client. Trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>and confidentiality are key elements in any attorney-client relationship, and these qualities take on added significance when the attorney is a public defender appointed to represent a client who often enters the relationship with a certain degree of distrust. We conclude nonetheless that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered the plaintiff to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The writ of error is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Swift, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1823) pp. 359-60. Swift cited Blackstone\u2019s treatise on the English common law as authority for this proposition.

In holding the plaintiff in contempt, the trial court stated: \u201cI do not think under the circumstances that in consideration of the fact that I am dealing with a member of the bar, the public defender for this district, it calls for incarceration.\u201d Moreover, it is evident that the trial court was of the opinion that neither the threat of incarceration nor incarceration itself would cause the plaintiff to retreat from his position that he could not, in good conscience, testify. If the plaintiff\u2019s argument, that a refusal to testify must always be addressed by resort to \u00a7 51-35, were accepted, the trial court would have been precluded from considering such circumstances and would have been required to incarcerate the plaintiff. The adoption of such a rule would also emasculate the trial court\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>tempt power if the witness whose testimony was ordered were already incarcerated.

The court noted that \u201c[i]n the absence of the ability to purge herself of the failure to bring her child before the court, the .punishment imposed by the court ceased to be coercive and became wholly punitive, which is not in the character of civil contempt.\u201d Id., 187.

Today the majority makes it fair game for the state's attorney to call a public defender as a witness against his own client, ask questions that are merely relevant to a criminal prosecution, without any compelling need for the testimony, and force the public defender to respond under penalty of criminal contempt. As a result the public defender is faced with the following dilemma: compliance with the court order, thereby giving the appearance that he or she betrayed the client, or refusal to testify, at the risk of being held in contempt and subject to penalty of f\u00edne and imprisonment. Attorney Thomas Ullmann, much to his credit, stood on principle, refusing to testify against his client, and was held in contempt and criminally punished. Through its strained decision, the majority carves that finding of criminal contempt in stone. In my opinion, Ullmann should look upon this conviction not as a badge of disgrace, but rather the unfortunate result of fulfilling his professional obligations to his client, and others he will represent as a public defender in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">It will be helpful to restate the pertinent facts, none of which are disputed. Ullmann, the public defender for the judicial district of New Haven, employed by the state of Connecticut, represented the criminal defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ant Eddie Ford for nearly one year. Ford was originally charged with robbery and one count of witness tampering arising out of an incident unrelated to this appeal. Pursuant to his representation of Ford on these charges, Ullmann met with assistant state\u2019s attorney James G. Clark (prosecutor) on June 1, 1992, at approximately 4 p.m., and the prosecutor gave Ullmann several police reports. One of the police reports (Exhibit L) contained the name, address and telephone numbers of several persons, including a witness to the robbery named Carlos Robles. At approximately 6 p.m., Ullmann met with his client at the New Haven community correctional center where he was being held for trial. At 9:43 p.m. that evening, Robles received an anonymous telephone call from a telephone located at the correctional facility to which Ford and nineteen other inmates had access, threatening him with harm should he testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The next day, which followed two days of jury selection in Ford\u2019s trial, Ullmann filed a motion to withdraw from representing Ford and sought appointment of a special public defender. Ullmann\u2019s withdrawal was compelled by the Rules of Professional Conduct because, as the prosecutor later noted, Ullmann could potentially be called as a witness in the case. See Rules of Professional Conduct 3.7 (\u201c[a] lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness\u201d). It is a fair inference that his withdrawal was the result of the prosecutor putting Ullmann on notice that he intended to call Ullmann as a witness in Ford\u2019s criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The trial court granted Ullmann\u2019s motion, appointed special public defender Michael Moscowitz to represent Ford, and declared a mistrial. Subsequently, the state charged Ford with an additional count of tampering with a witness based on the theory that Ford or an accomplice telephoned Robles on June 1, 1992, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the correctional facility, using the telephone number obtained from Ullmann on that date, and threatened him with harm should he testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">At the subsequent trial, to support the additional count against Ford, the prosecutor subpoenaed Ullmann to testify against his former client. Upon Ullmann\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena and his objections to being called by the state as a witness, the prosecutor represented to the trial court that he would offer to prove through Ullmann the following: \u201cI will ask him where he works for background, who he is and what he does. I will ask him ... did you represent Eddie Ford from approximately July 30 of 1991 until June 28, 1992, in this criminal case. On June 1 of 1992 did you meet with me in my office. ... I will ask what time [it was] and I believe the time was approximately four in the afternoon. Did I then give you a copy of several police reports including State\u2019s Exhibit L . . . . Prior to my giving you that document did you have the phone number and address of Carlos Robles. The answer to that I believe will be no. And then the last question I would ask, did you meet with Eddie Ford that evening at the [correctional facility] and I will stop at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Ullmann\u2019s attorney objected to the proffered testimony. He argued that the facts the state sought to elicit from Ullmann were available from other credible sources, including the prosecutor himself. The prosecutor argued that it would take five witnesses to establish these facts without his testimony, and there was one fact that could be established only through Ullmann\u2019s testimony. This fact was that Ullmann did not know Robles\u2019 telephone number prior to meeting with the prosecutor. The trial court ordered Ullmann to testify. Ullmann refused, and was held in contempt of the court and fined $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The jury found Ford guilty of the June 1, 1992 witness tampering count, notwithstanding Ullmann\u2019s failure to testify and the state\u2019s failure to introduce through the testimony of others the evidence it sought to obtain through Ullmann. Ford appealed to the Appellate Court and a majority of a three member panel of that court held that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>33 Conn. App. 143, 634 A.2d 1188 (1993). The court, over my dissent, subsequently reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court and reinstated the conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 646 A.2d 147 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In deciding this case we need not reach the issue of whether a person who refuses to testify is subject to civil or criminal contempt. Furthermore, we need not decide whether the evidence the prosecutor sought to elicit from the public defender was protected by the attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, the dispositive issue is as follows: under what conditions and circumstances may a prosecutor subpoena and compel a public defender to give testimony that is not privileged against his or her client.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">I recognize that justice may require a public defender, or for that matter a prosecutor, to testify when called by his or her adversary. Nevertheless, any rule that we adopt for the compelled disclosure of nonprivileged testimony that relates to the representation of a criminal defendant must take into account not only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>important interests of the state in enforcing the criminal laws but also the special considerations applicable to the relationship between a public defender and an indigent defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">We must face the reality that an attorney-client relationship characterized by honesty and trust can unfortunately be difficult to maintain between public defenders and their clients. It is true that \u201csystemic, comparative analyses of the impact of defense attorneys on . . . measures of case outcomes such as sentencing\u201d have indicated that \u201cpublic [defender] clients do not fare more poorly in court than their peers who retain private counsel.\u201d R. Flemming, \u201cClient Games: Defense Attorney Perspectives on Their Relationships with Criminal Clients,\u201d 2 Am. B. Found. Res. J. 253, 268 (1986). Nevertheless, \u201c[a] rather substantial body of research agrees that in contrast with their attitudes toward privately retained attorneys, criminal defendants see publicly paid and assigned counsel as part of the \u2018system\u2019\u2014overly eager to plead them guilty, disinclined to give them much time, and little concerned about their welfare.\u201d Id., 254. Indigent criminal defendants, and many other members of society, are cynical about the fairness afforded indigent defendants by the criminal justice system. The specter of a public defender being compelled to testify against his or her client in order to provide an inference to be drawn from a confidential attorney-client meeting would be devastating to the <em>appearance </em>of justice in our courtrooms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Ullmann eloquently testified before the trial court about this delicate relationship as follows: \u201cAs the public defender of the New Haven judicial district, an office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>which handles 250 cases currently pending of which 35 to 50 percent of those cases are incarcerated along with Mr. Ford at the correctional center, and with my firm belief that there are other ways that the state could elicit such information, I believe that I would be violating not only my allegiance to Mr. Ford but to many, many other people and that the damage that would be done by my answering the state\u2019s questions, even in spite of the fact that the court has ordered me to do that, would be far reaching and would affect not only the representation in my office currently with any number of pending cases that exist . . . but with other attorneys in the New Haven judicial district with cases pending whose clients are at the jail for a long period of time. I desire not to be a party to that. I don\u2019t believe I should have been put in this position and I think there are matters, there are times when someone has to make a decision as a matter of principle and conscience in regards to his professional responsibility. I mean no disrespect to the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The compelling need test referred to by the majority, <em>properly </em>applied, would accommodate the competing needs of the state and the defendant in their pursuit of justice. If the state is able to show a compelling need for the testimony, it may call the public defender and, likewise, if the defendant demonstrates a compelling need for the testimony of the prosecutor, he or she may call the prosecutor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority purports to adopt the compelling need test, yet they water down its application so much in the present case that in its diluted form it might as well be referred to as the \u201cconvenient or helpful\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Like the majority, I would adopt the compelling need test. I believe that it is evident, however, that under that test the trial court abused its discretion in the present case. In order to demonstrate a compelling need, the state, or the defendant as the case may be, should be required to demonstrate that (1) there is no feasible alternative for obtaining the information; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Prantil, </em>764 F.2d 548, 551 (9th Cir. 1985); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>503 F.2d 1120, 1126 (2d Cir. 1974) (\u201c[tjhere was no showing that any of the other people who were in the courtroom at the time Ortiz and Torres allegedly conversed, such as marshals, court clerks, court reporters or interpreters, were unavailable to testify\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>20 Conn. App. 290, 297, 567 A.2d 837 (1989); and (2) the evidence is essential, not merely relevant, to the success of the prosecution or the defense, as the case may be. This rule is substantially similar to the guidelines recently adopted by the American Bar Association; A.B.A., Model Rules of Professional Conduct 3.8 (f) (1992); 1 G. Hazard, The Law of Lawyering (2d Ed. 1993) \u00a7 3:100 et seq.;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and by the United States Justice Department. Justice Department Guidelines for United States Attorneys, \u201cPolicy with Regard to the Issuance of Grand Jury or Trial Subpoenas to Attorneys for Information Relating to the Representation of Clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The state did not make the requisite showing in the present case, because there were feasible alternatives for obtaining the information sought. In addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>circumstantial evidence presented at Ford\u2019s trial; see <em>State </em>v. Ford, supra, 230 Conn. 694; the prosecutor, an attorney with no personal ties to the state like the one between the public defender and client, could have withdrawn from his role as advocate and testified as follows. On June 1, 1992, he met with Ullmann at approximately 4 p.m.;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he gave Ullmann the police report containing Robles\u2019 phone number; the prosecutor had never before given this telephone number to Ullmann or to the defendant; Robles was a material witness to the prosecution of the defendant and was scheduled to appear in court several days later; and none of the other nineteen inmates on the defendant\u2019s cellblock who had access to the telephone from which the collect call was placed to Robles had any connection to the prosecution of Ford. A correction official could have testified, on the basis of business records of the institution, that Ullmann had met with Ford in a professional visit at approximately 6 p.m. that same day. The prosecutor and the correction officials likely would be credible witnesses in the eyes of the jury and thus excellent substitutes for Ullmann\u2019s testimony. Finally, evidence could have been presented that Robles\u2019 telephone number was not readily available to the public because it was listed in the telephone directory as \u201cSantos-Robles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">As previously indicated, the prosecutor made two arguments against the use of alternatives to Ullmann\u2019s testimony. First, he argued that it would take \u201cfive witnesses to cover those seven questions so that we won\u2019t have to call Mr. Ullmann.\u201d This argument was sanctioned by the trial court in its decision, although it is unclear why it would take five witnesses. At any rate, a compelling need must consist of something more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>mere inconvenience to the state. Absent the inconvenience argument, the state\u2019s claim, as the majority concedes, is reduced to the following: there is one (and only one) fact\u2014that Ullmann did not know the telephone number before meeting with the prosecutor\u2014 that could only be established through Ullmann\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">First of all, there exist feasible alternatives even with regard to this particular fact, because the prosecutor could have testified that he never made the information available to Ullmann prior to their meeting, and an employee of the telephone company could have testified that Robles\u2019 telephone number was not listed under \u201cRobles\u201d in the telephone directory, allowing the jury to draw the same inference that it could have drawn from the testimony sought from Ullmann.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Even conceding no feasible alternatives, however, the evidence does not meet the second prong of the compelling need test. The fact that Ullmann did not have the information prior to his meeting with the prosecutor, although relevant, has but marginal incremental value to the state\u2019s case considering all the circumstantial evidence available to the state. Indeed, I am troubled by the fact that on this day, the court holds in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 686, that there was sufficient evidence to sustain Ford\u2019s conviction of the June 1,1992 witness tampering charge, the very same charge for which the majority holds that Ullmann\u2019s testimony was compellingly necessary. I am bewildered by how Ullmann\u2019s testimony could possibly be compelling if in fact it was not required to support Ford\u2019s conviction. The majority attempts to explain their conclusion by reference to the trial court\u2019s discretion, and distances themselves from that decision by stating that \u201c \u2018[t]he issue ... is not whether we would reach the same conclusion in the exercise of our own judgment, but only whether the trial court acted rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>sonably.\u2019 \u201d The trial court\u2019s discretion cannot shield the majority from their ultimate decision in this case. Accordingly, I would reverse Ullmann\u2019s conviction of contempt on the ground that there was no showing of a compelling need to require Ullmann to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The majority opinion has the potential to undermine the credibility and integrity of our public defender system. It is well known that public defenders face great institutional difficulties, despite their best efforts, in obtaining the trust and confidence of their indigent, often incarcerated, clients. R. Flemming, supra, 254; J. Casper, American Criminal Justice: The Defendant\u2019s Perspective (1972) pp. 100-25. Casper examined a study of indigent criminal defendants who had gone through the Connecticut criminal system in the late 1960s, and determined that a far greater proportion of defendants represented by private counsel than by public defenders answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cDo you think [your lawyer] was on your side?\u201d J. Casper, supra, p. 105. One criminal defendant reported his belief, unfortunately representative of many of the indigent clients studied, that \u201c \u2018[a] public defender is just like the prosecutor\u2019s assistant. Anything you tell this man, he\u2019s not gonna do anything but relay it back to the [prosecutor]. . . .\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., pp. 107-108. These perceptions undermine the vital attorney-client relationship, without which the fundamental right to assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>counsel for indigent defendants; <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963); is an empty promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Public defenders face their own professional difficulties as well\u2014their calling is difficult on every technical, physical, emotional and moral level. Charles Ogletree, Jr., a Harvard law professor and a former District of Columbia public defender, recently urged that the legal profession strive to strengthen the relationship between public defender and indigent client. C. Ogletree, \u201cBeyond Justifications: Seeking Motivations to Sustain Public Defenders,\u201d 106 Harv. L. Rev. 1239 (1993). The majority, by upholding the compulsion of a public defender to testify against his or her own client under penalty of contempt when there was simply no compelling need shown, will have a devastating effect on this relationship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cIntegrity is the very breath of justice. Confidence in our law, our courts and the administration of justice is our supreme interest. No practice must be permitted to prevail which invites toward the administration of justice a doubt or distrust of its integrity.\u201d <em>Jennings Co. </em>v. <em>DiGenova, </em>107 Conn. 491, 499, 141 A. 866 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\"> Although I do not reach these issues, I note that the implications of the majority\u2019s reasoning are disturbing. I suppose the following can be gleaned from their decision: a person who refuses to testify can be held and punished for both civil and criminal contempt; and although an attorney cannot be compelled to testify as to what he or she told a client, he or she can be compelled to testify as to facts from which the jury could infer the content of the communications with the client. The ramifications of these holdings by the majority are troubling to say the least.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\"> Commentators have pointed to a perception of overreaching by United States attorneys in recent years as evidence of the potential for and reality of prosecutorial abuse of the subpoena power against defense counsel. See, e.g., W. Genego, \u201cRisky Business: The Hazards of Being a Criminal Defense Lawyer,\u201d 1 Crim. Justice 2 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-6\"> In order to do justice, the state <em>or </em>the defendant may have a compelling interest to call the attorney on the other side. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Prantil, </em>764 F.2d 548, 551-54 (9th Cir. 1985) (reversing conviction where participating prosecutor was one of several witnesses to acts underlying crime because defendant had compelling need to call that prosecutor as witness).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\"> Rule 3.8 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct provides in relevant part: \u201cThe prosecutor in a criminal case shall . . . (f) not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client unless: (1) the prosecutor reasonably believes: (i) the information sought is not protected from disclosure by any applicable privilege; (ii) the evidence sought is essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution; (iii) there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the information; and (2) the prosecutor obtains prior judicial approval after an opportunity for an adversarial proceeding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\"> Moseowitz, Ford\u2019s attorney, offered to stipulate that Clark had given the police report to Ullmann, which would have left that crucial piece of evidence uncontroverted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\"> Casper ascribed these perceptions on the part of indigent defendants to the public defender\u2019s peculiar institutional position. Casper points out that many public defenders are beleaguered under heavy caseloads, with the result that they settle many cases through plea negotiations with the state. They appear before the same trial judges and the same state\u2019s attorneys day in and day out. They are assigned to an indigent defendant with no opportunity for the defendant to choose his or her own attorney. Finally, they are paid by the state, not the client. All of these realities combine to create the perception among many indigent clients that public defenders are part of the system, and have no incentive to defend the client vigorously. J. Casper, supra, pp. 103, 105, 106-107, 109, 110-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> Notwithstanding the majority opinion, the chief state\u2019s attorney may desire, out of concern for the fair administration and appearance of justice in this state, to follow the lead of the Justice Department of the United States by adopting guidelines for the issuance of trial subpoenas against defense attorneys. See Justice Department Guidelines for United States Attorneys, \u201cPolicy with Regard to the Issuance of Grand Jury or Trial Subpoenas to Attorneys for Information Relating to the Representation of Clients.\u201d In this regard, rule 3.8 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct would provide an excellent model.
