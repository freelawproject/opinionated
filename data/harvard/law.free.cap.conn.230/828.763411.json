More specifically, we address the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>principal issues: (1) whether the act requires that the respondent be present at any court hearing concerning the appointment of a guardian; (2) whether the respondent may waive his or her presence and, if so, the necessary requirements for such a waiver; and (3) whether, in determining what is in the best interests of the respondent, the judge must ascertain the respondent\u2019s preference as to who should be his or her guardian.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">In 1989, Anne Oiler (defendant) and Walter Oiler sought, by application to the Probate Court for the district of Brookfield, to be named limited guardians of their daughter, Kathleen E. Oiler, the respondent in this case, in order to make decisions about her \u201cphysical and mental care.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The respondent is a thirty-one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>year old woman with mental retardation. The parties agree that she requires a limited guardian to make decisions regarding her medical and dental care and the release of medical records. They disagree, however, over whether the defendant is the proper person to assume such a role.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The Probate Court approved the application and appointed the defendant limited guardian, and the respondent appealed the decision to the Superior Court. After a trial de novo,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Superior Court adopted the findings of the Probate Court, dismissed the appeal and appointed the defendant limited guardian of the respondent, her daughter. The respondent appealed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>judgment of the Superior Court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The trial in the Superior Court lasted almost an entire day. The respondent was not present, although she had been present when the matter was heard by the Probate Court. At the Probate Court hearing, she had expressed her desire not to have the defendant appointed as her guardian. In the Superior Court, the respondent\u2019s attorney attempted to introduce into evidence the statement of her preference that the respondent had made in the Probate Court, but the Superior Court excluded this evidence on the ground that it was hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">It was not until the attorneys offered closing arguments late in the afternoon that the issue of the respondent\u2019s presence was raised. In making his summation, the defendant\u2019s attorney noted that the respondent herself had not attended the hearing. He argued that the court should infer from the respondent\u2019s absence that she would have chosen to have her mother appointed as guardian. In response to a question from the court regarding General Statutes \u00a7 45a-675, which provides that \u201c[t]he respondent shall be present at any hearing for his guardianship,\u201d the respondent\u2019s lead attorney admitted that he did not know why the respondent was not in the courtroom. The respondent\u2019s court-appointed attorney then told the court that \u201cit was a professional opinion that she not be exposed to this.\u201d Subsequently, the attorneys for both sides purported to waive any requirement that she be present for the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Well, I just asked if Counsel for the respondent can represent to the Court that they are authorized to waive what seems to be [the] very strong language of [\u00a7 45a-675] and that the [presence] of the respondent is waived as far as any jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>claim . . . that the respondent had to be present in order for the Court to respond to the issues in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">\u201cMs. Murphy [respondent\u2019s court-appointed attorney]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-6\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Just so we have it for the record and there\u2019s no objection from the defendant as well as far as the waiving the presence of the respondent; is that correct, Mr. Church?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201cMr. Church [defendant\u2019s attorney]: There\u2019s no objection, I waive the presence of the respondent . . . .\u201d In its oral decision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court gave effect to these waivers by stating that the \u201cCourt notes that the parties have waived the presence of the respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">In addition, the attorneys raised questions in their summations about whether the preference for a guardian that the respondent had expressed in the Probate Court had been properly excluded from evidence. In his closing argument, the lead attorney for the respondent noted that the court, in selecting a limited guardian, was to be guided by the best interests of the respondent, \u201cincluding, but not limited to, the preference of the respondent. I might add just [by] way of footnote, there was a preference established for the Probate Court; however, we were unable by virtue of [a] hearsay objection to state that preference.\u201d Later, the attorney noted that \u201c[t]he Court is prevented from learning the [respondent\u2019s] preference by virtue of a proper hearsay objection and we were prepared to tell the Court what that preference was\u2014Defendant properly objected to that and the Court is not informed by vir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>tue of defendant\u2019s objection.\u201d In its oral decision, the court noted that \u201c[t]he Court has heard no evidence [of] the preference of the respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">On appeal, the parties disagree principally over whether the court had sufficient evidence before it to find that the respondent\u2019s mother was a proper person to be named the respondent\u2019s limited guardian. At oral argument, however, counsel for the respondent agreed that the issues initially brought to this court\u2019s attention by the amici curiae in this case are significant and should be decided. These issues arise under the act and require a consideration of whether:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (1) the respondent was required to be present at the hearing, absent a valid waiver of that right; (2) the court improperly allowed the attorneys to waive the respondent\u2019s right to be present; and. (3) the court, after allowing the waiver, failed to ascertain the respondent\u2019s preference or attach adequate weight to it. Because of the importance of these issues, and because critical errors in the procedural aspects of the hearing would render irrelevant the substantive sufficiency of the evidence arguments made by the parties, we now address and decide this case on the basis of the issues raised by the amici<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and adopted by the respondent at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">We review these issues in light of the obvious purpose and policy of the act, which is to provide for the appointment of a guardian to act for the respondent while protecting the constitutional rights of the respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>dent and ensuring that the court makes its determination based on his or her best interests. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-676 (f). Guardians appointed by the court, whether limited<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or plenary,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> can be vested with substantial powers over a respondent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, to the extent that such powers are granted, the appointment of a guardian implicates a respondent\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights to liberty and privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">\u201cHistorically, the notion that a declaration of incompetence is in the best interest of the affected individual has resulted in the parens patriae power being exercised in an atmosphere of procedural informality. . . . Task Panel, President\u2019s Commission on Mental Health, Mental Health and Human Rights: Report of the Task Panel on Legal and Ethical Issues (1978), reprinted in 20 Ariz. L.R. 49 (1978) . . . .The beneficial motives behind guardianship obscured the fact that guardianship necessarily entails a deprivation of the fundamental liberty to go unimpeded about one\u2019s ordinary affairs. ... By contrast, while similar rights are involved in criminal proceedings, there has been no comparable facade of beneficence, and exercise of the police power has always been tempered with strict procedural safeguards.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Link, </em>713 S.W.2d 487, 493 (Mo. 1986). In 1982, our legislature adopted the act in order to protect the rights of individuals with mental retardation when decisions are to be made that are of vital concern to their lives. The legislative history underscores the legislature\u2019s intent. The act was \u201cdrafted to protect the rights of the mentally retarded\u201d; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, 1982 Sess., p. 414, remarks of Linda Dow, assistant to the Probate Court administrator; and its provisions are meant to provide \u201cdue process pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>tections to the person [for] whom guardianship is being sought . . . .\u201d Id., p. 351, remarks of Gareth Thorne, commissioner of the department of mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">As noted above, \u00a7 45a-675, entitled \u201cRight of respondent to be at hearing,\u201d provides in part that a \u201crespondent <em>shall be present </em>at any hearing for his guardianship . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) In light of the respondent\u2019s absence from the Superior Court proceedings in this case, we must decide whether the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 45a-675 mandates that the respondent in a guardianship proceeding must be present at any hearing that is held, absent either a valid waiver or a specific finding that attending the hearing \u201cwould be seriously detrimental to [the respondent\u2019s] emotional or mental condition.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-675.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">We have noted in past decisions that the use of the word \u201cshall,\u201d though significant, does not invariably establish a mandatory duty. <em>Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. 147, 152, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989); see <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>BVD Associates, </em>196 Conn. 270, 278, 492 A.2d 180 (1985). \u201cThe test we have adopted for determining whether such a statutory requirement is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is of the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>to matter material or immaterial\u2014to matters of convenience or of substance. . . . If it is a matter of convenience, the statutory provision is directory; if it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall Manor Owner's Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\"><em>In Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 569 A.2d 518 (1990), we used these canons of construction to interpret a statute addressing the civil rights of persons who are mentally ill.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We noted that the statute, which was part of the patients\u2019 bill of rights, illustrated \u201cthe breadth of the legislative concern for the fair treatment of mental patients.\u201d Id., 556. We therefore held that a statutory provision stating that no person treated in a mental health facility \u201c\u2018shall be deprived of any . . . civil rights\u2019 \u201d was substantive in nature, and that the word \u201cshall\u201d was mandatory. Id., 557 and n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Like the statute at issue in <em>Mahoney, </em>\u00a7 45a-675 is concerned with protecting the rights of individuals with mental difficulties. As discussed above, the legislative history strongly suggests that the act was adopted to protect the constitutional rights and promote the best interests of a respondent. Moreover, the fact that the act requires that clear and convincing evidence support the finding of a need for a guardian demonstrates the legislature\u2019s judgment that \u201c \u2018important individual rights are involved\u2019 \u201d in guardianship proceedings. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 294, 641 A.2d 370 (1994); see also <em>Cookson </em>v. <em>Cookson, </em>201 Conn. 229, 234, 514 A.2d 323 (1986). We therefore conclude that the act\u2019s provisions are mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>The remaining provisions of the act support our conclusion that we must interpret the presence requirement of \u00a7 45a-675 as mandatory. \u201cWe make every effort to construe a statutory scheme as a consistent whole\u201d; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ulichny, </em>185 Conn. 145, 149, 440 A.2d 885 (1981); with a goal of \u201creconciling its separate parts in order to render an overall reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>Shortt </em>v. <em>New Milford Police Dept., </em>212 Conn. 294, 305, 562 A.2d 7 (1989). Section 45a-671 (a) makes clear that the presence of a respondent is an invaluable part of the guardianship proceedings under the act. That section allows the court to \u201chold the hearing on said application at a place within the state other than its usual courtroom <em>if it would facilitate the presence of the respondent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The legislative message of \u00a7 45a-671 (a) is clear\u2014a judge hearing an application for guardianship under the act should make every reasonable effort to include the individual with mental retardation in a proceeding that could significantly affect his or her life. Moreover, \u00a7 45a-676 (f) requires the court to consider a respondent\u2019s preference about who should be his or her limited guardian. Clearly, the presence of a respondent in court would facilitate this determination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Finally, we note that our interpretation of \u00a7 45a-675 corresponds with the holdings of courts in other jurisdictions that have addressed the presence issue in analogous contexts. These courts have held that a guardianship statute providing a respondent with a <em>right </em>to be present means that a respondent <em>must </em>be present, in the absence of a valid waiver or statutory exception. See <em>In re Link, </em>supra, 713 S.W.2d 494 (statutory right to be present at guardianship proceeding \u201creflects a legislative intent to provide greater protection for the rights of incompetents than previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>existed under Missouri law\u201d); <em>Guardianship of B.A.G., </em>794 S.W.2d 510, 513 (Tex. App. 1990) (holding that, in temporary guardianship proceeding for woman with mental retardation, \u201cthe allegedly incapacitated person must appear because that person\u2019s rights are being limited, even if for a short period of time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">We therefore hold that \u00a7 45a-675 requires a respondent to be present at a guardianship proceeding before the Probate Court, and at any appeal of that proceeding to the Superior Court, in the absence of a finding by the court that the respondent\u2019s presence would be seriously detrimental to his or her emotional or mental condition. This holding, however, does not end our inquiry. We next must determine whether the right of a respondent to be present at a hearing under \u00a7 45a-675 can be waived, and if so, the necessary requirements of such a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">We have never addressed the question of waiver of presence in the context of civil guardianship proceedings. Connecticut law on waiver of that right in other proceedings, and the guardianship decisions of courts in other jurisdictions, however, help to define the broad contours of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">We have held that although a defendant in a criminal trial has a right to be present at all critical stages of his trial; <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 125, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986); this right is not absolute. Id., 128. A defendant, in fact, may waive this right. Id., 129. To constitute an effective waiver, a defendant\u2019s decision must be intelligent and competent. Id. Similarly, a probationer may waive his right to be present at a final revocation proceeding by making a knowing and voluntary decision. <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>219 Conn. 629, 636, 595 A.2d 826 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 392, 645 A.2d 535 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Moreover, we have held that a defendant in a civil proceeding may waive his right to be present, but usually only by an affirmative act. \u201c \u2018The law condemns no man unheard. It takes from him no property and deprives him of no right without giving him a day in court. He may waive his opportunity to appear and defend, or forfeit his right to a hearing by negligence, but not ordinarily by inadvertence or misfortune.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 285, 618 A.2d 1 (1992), quoting <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Albertson &amp; Douglass Machine Co., </em>51 Conn. 387, 392 (1884).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Courts in several other jurisdictions have held that the right to be present at a proceeding where one\u2019s rights may be limited can be waived. See <em>In re Link, </em>supra, 713 S.W.2d 494-95; <em>In re Jessee, </em>744 S.W.2d 514, 516-17 (Mo. App. 1988); <em>Guardianship of B.A.G., </em>supra, 794 S.W.2d 512-13. In <em>In re Link, </em>supra, 494-95, for example, the Missouri Supreme Court noted that construing that state\u2019s statute so as to prohibit the respondent from waiving any of her rights \u201cwould deprive an alleged incompetent of her essential right and authority to make decisions regarding trial strategy, and would thereby deny the individual a vital tool for advancing his or her best interest. Though we conclude that the legislature intended to bolster the affected individual\u2019s <em>rights, </em>we believe that it is equally true that the legislature did not intend that this must be done at the expense of the individual\u2019s best <em>interest.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) We choose to follow the course charted by a majority of these jurisdictions and conclude that a respondent may waive his or her right to be present at the hearing before the Probate Court, at a subsequent appeal before the Superior Court, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">We now turn to the more complex question of what constitutes a valid waiver of the right to be present at a guardianship proceeding. The Missouri Court of Appeals has aptly described the dilemma facing courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>confronted with this question: \u201c[The] argument that [the respondent] waived his rights by failing to appear begs the very question at issue\u2014whether he was capable of knowingly and intelligently waiving any right. In a guardianship proceeding the argument has a peculiarly hollow ring. On the one hand, it charges that the respondent is incompetent and on the other hand it demands that we assume his competence to make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver.\u201d <em>In re Jessee, </em>supra, 744 S.W.2d 515-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Despite their agreement that a respondent may waive the right to be present, courts in other jurisdictions have formulated somewhat different standards by which an effective waiver may be accomplished. In <em>Guardianship of B.A.G., </em>supra, 794 S.W.2d 510, for example, the Texas Court of Appeals considered the waivability of the presence requirement in a statute providing for appointment of a guardian of the person.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court held that the respondent in such an action needed to make a knowing and intelligent waiver, and that the respondent could not do so unless he or she first consulted with an attorney. Id., 513. Because the respondent in the case had not consulted with the attorney who had purported to waive her rights in court, there had not been an effective waiver. Id. Similarly, in <em>Doremus </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>407 F. Sup. 509, 515 (D. Neb. 1975), the court held that a person \u201chas a constitutional right to be present at the hearing unless he voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly waives it or his counsel waives it for him after a showing that he is incompetent, or the subject\u2019s conduct is so disruptive as to require his exclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>In <em>In re Link, </em>supra, 713 S.W.2d 495, the Missouri Supreme Court held that any waiver under the statute giving the respondent a right to be present at a guardianship hearing<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> must be accomplished affirmatively. \u201c[W]e believe that the waiver must be made on the record and must also indicate whether the right to be present has been waived because the person is mentally or physically incapable of attending, or whether the right has been waived for some other reason directly related to the individual\u2019s best interest. In the former case there must also be supporting medical evidence placed on the record.\u201d Id. Two years after <em>In re Link, </em>the Missouri Appellate Court interpreted that decision to mean that \u201cwhen a waiver occurs in an incompetency hearing, the trial court is charged with the duty of ascertaining that it is knowingly and intelligently made.\u201d <em>In re Jessee, </em>supra, 744 S.W.2d 516. The court held that because the attorney in the case had not consulted with the respondent prior to the hearing, the attorney\u2019s attempt to waive the respondent\u2019s right to be present had not been effective. Id., 516-17. Other cases involving civil commitments have similarly placed a duty on the court to make certain that the person waiving his or her right to be present is acting in his or her own best interests. See, e.g., <em>Suzuki </em>v. <em>Quisenberry, </em>411 F. Sup. 1113, 1129 (D. Haw. 1976) (waiver \u201cvalid only upon acceptance by the court following a judicial determination that the person understands his rights and is competent to waive them\u201d). A treatise on the law concerning individuals with mental disabilities agrees with this view. See S. Brakel, J. Parry &amp; B. Weiner, The Mentally Disabled and the Law (3d Ed. 1985) p. 381 (\u201cWhere waivers are allowed, the court should confront the proposed incompetent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>person directly to make sure the waiver is knowingly and intelligently made. If a court appearance would seriously disturb the person, then an interview could be arranged in the judge\u2019s chambers or some less threatening environment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">We conclude that, in order to accomplish an effective waiver, a respondent, his or her attorney, and the court must satisfy certain minimum requirements. Although we discuss these minimum requirements, we emphasize that each case must be handled and determined according to its own particular facts. The Probate Court or Superior Court judge, as the case may be, must be satisfied that a respondent has waived his or her presence and that the waiver, to the extent possible in any given case, was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">To ensure that a respondent is acting voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently, the respondent\u2019s attorney must meet with the respondent prior to the hearing to discuss his or her rights. After all, \u201c[f]airness demands that clients be informed, lest they lose the right [to be present] without ever knowing they had it . . . .\u201d S. Herr, S. Arons &amp; R. Wallace, Legal Rights and Mental-Health Care (1983) p. 132. If the respondent indicates to the attorney that he or she wishes to waive the right to be present, or if the attorney believes that the respondent does not have the competence needed to decide whether to waive his or her right to attend or that attending the hearing \u201cwould be seriously detrimental to [the respondent\u2019s] emotional or mental condition\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-675; then the attorney must notify the court prior to the scheduled hearing on the guardianship application so that a preliminary hearing on the issue of the respondent\u2019s presence may be scheduled. At the preliminary hearing, the respondent, if competent to make a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver, may waive his or her right to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>present at the hearing on the guardianship application. If, for any reason, the respondent cannot attend the preliminary hearing, or if the respondent does not have sufficient competence to waive his or her right, the attorney for the respondent must present affidavits from, or the testimony of, mental health professionals or other experts who are familiar with the respondent and can render opinions about whether the respondent is competent to make a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver, or whether attending the guardianship proceedings would be seriously detrimental to the respondent. At the end of the preliminary hearing, if the court concludes that the respondent\u2019s presence is not necessary at the hearing for the guardianship, it must make a finding on the record either that: (1) the respondent has voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his or her right to be present at the guardianship proceedings; (2) the respondent is incompetent to make the decision of whether to be present and it is in the respondent\u2019s best interests to be absent from the proceedings; or (3) the respondent\u2019s presence at the proceedings would be seriously detrimental to his or her emotional or mental health. The court must set forth on the record the specific facts relied on in making its finding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The record in this case reveals that both the attorneys for the respondent and the court failed to take adequate precautions to ensure that the respondent had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>properly waived her right to attend the hearing under \u00a7 45a-675. It is not clear that her attorneys even consulted with the respondent prior to the Superior Court appeal in order to apprise her of her rights. They apparently did not mention the respondent\u2019s absence to the Superior Court prior to the onset of the hearing, and when the court finally asked about her absence, her attorneys did not offer an adequate explanation of why she was not there. The record does not contain any findings concerning whether the respondent wished to waive her presence at the hearing and, if so, whether she was competent to make such a decision. Clearly, there was no proper waiver of the respondent\u2019s rights under \u00a7 45a-675.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The third and final issue that we must consider involves the decision of the Superior Court to appoint the respondent\u2019s mother as her guardian without first hearing any evidence concerning the respondent\u2019s preference. To decide this issue, we therefore must determine whether \u00a7 45a-676 (f) imposes on courts a special duty to determine the preference of a respondent before appointing a guardian based on the respondent\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The Superior Court heard no evidence about the respondent\u2019s apparent preference, even though she had personally informed the Probate Court that she did not want her mother to be named her limited guardian. The respondent neither attended the Superior Court hearing nor testified about her preference. Instead, her attorneys sought to introduce evidence from the probate hearing about her preference that her guardian be someone other than her mother. The Superior Court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to this evidence on the ground that it was hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>In its oral decision, the Superior Court noted that it had \u201cfollowed\u201d the best interests of the respondent, but that it had heard no evidence of her preference. The court explained that even if it had heard testimony about the respondent\u2019s preference, such testimony probably would not have affected the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Section 45a-676 (f) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn selecting a plenary guardian or limited guardian of the mentally retarded person, the court shall be guided by the best interests of the respondent, <em>including, but not limited to, the preference of the respondent as to who should be appointed as plenary guardian or limited guardian.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In interpreting the language of a statute, the words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning and their natural and usual sense unless the context indicates that a different meaning was intended. <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 570, 440 A.2d 767 (1981). When the language is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). Indeed, \u201c[a] basic tenet of statutory construction is that when a statute . . . is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Genotti, </em>220 Conn. 796, 807, 601 A.2d 1013 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The plain meaning of \u00a7 45a-676 (f) requires the court to be guided by the respondent\u2019s best interests, which <em>include, </em>but are <em>not limited to, </em>the respondent\u2019s preference as to who should be appointed guardian. We have held that such language sets out certain categories that <em>shall </em>be considered by the court, but indicates a legislative intent not to limit the field of relevant considerations. <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners for Nursing, </em>177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Conn. 78, 89-90, 411 A.2d 42 (1979). In such a case, a court must consider the specific types of information indicated, but also may consider \u201cother or additional\u201d factors that are relevant to the decision. Id., 90. Under \u00a7 45a-676 (f), therefore, a court selecting a guardian for a respondent <em>must </em>consider the respondent\u2019s preference if he or she has one, but it <em>may also </em>give weight to other factors that bear on the respondent\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We find additional support for this interpretation in the differences in the language used in \u00a7 45a-676 (f) and the language used in General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650, the conservatorship statute. Section 45a-650 (d) provides that in a proceeding for the appointment of a conservator, a respondent <em>\u201cmay, </em>by oral or written request, <em>if at the time of the request he or she has sufficient capacity to form an intelligent preference, </em>nominate a conservator . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute in question in this case, \u00a7 45a-676 (f), makes no such qualification on the right of a respondent to voice a preference or on the duty of the court to consider that preference. Instead, \u00a7 45a-676 (f) states in plain language that the court shall be guided by the respondent\u2019s best interests, and in making that determination, shall take into consideration the respondent\u2019s preference. The difference in wording suggests that although the preference of a respondent in a conservatorship proceeding may be disregarded if he or she lacks sufficient mental capacity, the preference of a respondent in a proceeding under the act must be heard and accorded due weight by the court, regardless of the respondent\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Requiring courts to consider a respondent\u2019s preference is consistent with the views of scholars who have written about the legal rights of individuals with mental retardation. These writers suggest that whenever possible, courts should attempt to include such individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>uals in decisions that will affect their lives. \u201cFor people with mental handicaps, whose liberty interests have long been devalued, the right to make choices must be nurtured and defended.\u201d S. Herr, Rights and Advocacy for Retarded People (1983) p. 248. Moreover, \u201crespect for the choices made by competent individuals with mental retardation is essential for the protection of their autonomy.\u201d J. Ellis, \u201cDecisions By and For People With Mental Retardation: Balancing Considerations of Autonomy and Protection,\u201d 37 Vill. L. Rev. 1779, 1808 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Our construction of \u00a7 45a-676 (f) is in accord with the great weight of authority interpreting guardianship statutes containing similar language. For example, in <em>In re Guardianship of Kowalski, </em>478 N.W.2d 790, 792 (Minn. App. 1991), the Minnesota Appellate Court interpreted a statute that instructed the court to \u201cmake a finding that appointment of the person chosen as guardian or conservator is in the best interests of the ward\u201d; Minn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 525.551 (5); where \u201cbest interests\u201d was defined as \u201call relevant factors . . . including but not limited to: (1) the reasonable preference of the ward or conservatee, if the court determines the ward or conservatee has sufficient capacity to express a preference . . . .\u201d Minn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 525.532 (7). The court held that, \u201cwhen taken as a whole, the statute\u2019s enumerated factors direct that a guardian be someone who is preferred by the ward if possible . . . .\u201d Id., 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Similarly, the Missouri Court of Appeals construed a conservator statute that required the court to \u201cconsider the suitability of appointing any of the following persons who appear to be willing to serve: (1) [i]f the incapacitated or disabled person is, at the time of the hearing, able to make and communicate a reasonable choice, any eligible person . . . nominated by him . . . .\u201d Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 475.050 (1) (Cum. Sup. 1984); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number><em>In re Weissinger, </em>720 S.W.2d 430, 433 (Mo. App. 1986). In apparent disregard of that language, the court had appointed a niece to be conservator for her eighty-one year old uncle, despite the uncle\u2019s expressed preference that his neighbor and best friend be appointed instead. Id., 431-33. The court held that the statute \u201cleaves the selection of a guardian or conservator to the ward whenever possible. . . . While we do not hold that the court is absolutely bound by the choice of the disabled person, if a reasonable choice is made and communicated to the court, the court shall first consider the suitability of appointing the protectee\u2019s nominee before proceeding to the consideration of other persons.\u201d Id., 434-35; see also <em>In re Estate of Johnson, </em>219 Ill. App. 3d 962, 965, 579 N.E.2d 1206 (1991) (\u201c[s]election of a limited guardian is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, which must give due consideration to the preference of the disabled person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We recognize that in some circumstances it may be difficult for a court to fulfill its statutory obligation to ascertain the preference of the respondent. This may be the case, for example, if a respondent cannot understand that he or she may express a preference or cannot effectively communicate that preference. In addition, a court may find it difficult to ascertain the respondent\u2019s preference if the respondent has properly waived his or her right to attend the guardianship hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">We hold that in such a case, the statute requires only that the court take all reasonable measures available to it to determine the respondent\u2019s preference. When the court appoints a guardian under the act without the benefit of knowing the respondent\u2019s preference, it must indicate, on the record, how it has attempted to determine the respondent\u2019s preference. What measures qualify as \u201creasonable\u201d will, no doubt, vary from case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>to case, and we therefore will not attempt to offer an exhaustive list of procedures that a court should or must undertake in order to ascertain the respondent\u2019s preference. Two possible approaches, however\u2014one taken from the act itself, and one from Connecticut case law\u2014bear emphasis.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">First, as noted previously, \u00a7 45a-671 (a) allows the court to hold a guardianship hearing \u201cat a place within the state other than its usual courtroom if it would facilitate the presence of the respondent.\u201d See footnote 17. Although this provision nominally is directed at the court\u2019s duty to encourage the <em>presence </em>of the respondent, we see no reason why it should not apply with equal force to the court\u2019s duty under \u00a7 45a-676 (f) to ascertain the <em>preference </em>of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Second, Connecticut courts have long been receptive toward holding informal meetings with sensitive witnesses, provided the constitutional requirements of due process are satisfied. See <em>Gennarini </em>v. <em>Gennarini, </em>2 Conn. App. 132, 139-40, 477 A.2d 674 (1984). For example, in <em>In re Noel M., </em>23 Conn. App. 410, 421-22, 580 A.2d 996 (1990), a child abuse case, the Appellate Court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to interview the child victim in chambers, rather than in open court. The Appellate Court held that because all interested parties had been present and the judge had posed questions formulated by the attorneys involved, due process had been satisfied. Id. A court may find that such a procedure also is effective in trying to determine the preference of the respondent in a guardianship action.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">In this case, the Superior Court failed to ascertain or even take measures to ascertain the respondent\u2019s preference for a limited guardian. In its oral decision, the court merely noted that it had \u201cheard no evidence of the preference of the respondent\u201d and that even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>it <em>had </em>ascertained the respondent\u2019s preference, its decision probably would not have been different. These findings fail to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 45a-676 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">We hold that the procedures utilized by the Superior Court in this case were deficient in two respects. First, the court allowed the attorneys to waive the respondent\u2019s presence at the hearing, without making any finding on the record concerning whether she had made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent decision to waive that right. Second, the court failed to determine, or to take reasonable steps to determine, the respondent\u2019s preference before appointing the defendant as her limited guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for a new hearing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-11\"> The portions of the act that arc relevant to this appeal provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-12\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 45a-669.

Nevertheless, we hold that this rule is inapplicable to an appeal of the appointment of a guardian under the act because the statute directs that the best interests of the respondent must be determined when deciding whether to appoint a guardian and who should be appointed. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-676 (f); see <em>Cappetta </em>v. <em>Cappetta, </em>196 Conn. 10, 17, 490 A.2d 996 (1985) (upon reversing an order granting custody of a minor child to the paternal grandmother, this court directed the trial court to consider, on remand, \u201cfurther information about the parents\u2019 relationship to the child during the pendency of this appeal\u201d in determining what would be in the child\u2019s best interests). In this case, the Superior Court hearing on the guardianship application occurred three years after the Probate Court\u2019s appointment of the defendant as limited guardian, and the Superior Court confined its consideration to events that predated the Probate Court hearing. On remand, the Superior Court, in making its determination as to who shall be selected the limited guardian, should receive all relevant evidence pertaining to the best interests of the respondent without regard to the date of the Probate Court hearing. Parenthetically, we note that the three years it took to resolve this matter in the Superior Court was an unusually long time, especially in view of the fact that appeals from Probate Court are privileged.

Although this statute is directed at the Probate Court, it applies to the Superior Court as well when that court is sitting as the Probate Court. See <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Balboni, </em>218 Conn. 220, 225, 588 A.2d 634 (1991). Therefore, a Superior Court judge hearing an appeal from probate may, in his or her broad discretion, hold the hearing at any place within the state, not only to facilitate the respondent\u2019s presence, but also to determine whether the respondent has validly waived his or her right to be present.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
