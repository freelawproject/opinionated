The plaintiff, the Waterbury Teachers Association, appeals upon our grant of certification,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the Appellate Court. <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, 228 Conn. 904, 634 A.2d 300 (1993). The Appellate Court dismissed, for lack of a final judgment, the plaintiffs appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a stay pending the resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s administrative appeal. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The facts are undisputed. In May, 1992, the defendants complained to the commission that the board of education committee on grievances (committee) had illegally excluded the defendants from its April 29, 1992 and May 6, 1992 meetings, and that those meetings had not been properly noticed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 1-21 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The committee and the plaintiff, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>had been made a party to the administrative proceeding, claimed that what had occurred on those two dates constituted \u201cstrategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1-18a (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>and that, therefore, the committee had acted properly. More specifically, the committee argued that the discussion of grievances under a collective bargaining agreement constitutes strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining within the meaning of \u00a7 1-18a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">After a contested case hearing, the commission rendered its final decision on April 30, 1993. The commission found that, during the sessions at issue: (1) the committee had discussed certain grievances; (2) the committee, in accordance with its usual practice, had identified the grievances by numbers without the use of names or subject matter; (3) a collective bargaining agreement had been in effect; (4) the discussions of the grievances had included inquiries regarding possible violations of the collective bargaining agreement, and also had included the receipt of evidence from witnesses regarding the grievances; and (5) the committee had discussed matters other than strategy or negotiation regarding collective bargaining, particularly when receiving evidence with respect to grievances. On the basis of these findings, the commission concluded that the April and May sessions of the committee had been public meetings within the meaning of \u00a7 1-18a (b), and that the committee had violated \u00a7 1-21 (a) by failing to give proper notice thereof. The commission issued the following order: \u201cThe [committee] shall henceforth strictly comply with the provisions of \u00a7 1-21 (a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The plaintiff appealed from this decision to the trial court. During the pendency of this appeal, the plaintiff moved, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (f),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>for a stay of \u201cany proceedings by [the] defendants to enforce the final decision of the [commission] until further order of the court.\u201d The trial court, treating the motion for a stay as analogous to a motion for a temporary injunction, applied a four part test. The court determined that, in order for a stay to issue, it must determine that: (1) the plaintiff had no adequate legal remedy; (2) the plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury absent a stay; (3) the plaintiff was likely to prevail on appeal; and (4) the balance of the equities favored a stay. Applying this test, the trial court denied the plaintiffs motion for a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s denial of a stay. The defendants moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of a final judgment. The Appellate Court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The plaintiff claims that the denial of the stay by the trial court, though an interlocutory order, is a final judgment for purposes of appeal because \u201cthe order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Curcio, 191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that this part of the <em>Curdo </em>test applies because: (1) the effect of the commission\u2019s order is to require that grievance hearings be treated as open meetings, at least until the merits of the plaintiffs appeal are determined by the trial court; (2) the plaintiff will thereby be deprived of its right to appeal from the commission\u2019s decision regarding grievance hearings held during the period between the commission\u2019s order and the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision on the merits; and (3) if the plaintiff is not permitted to appeal at this time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>it \u201cwill have been forced to abide by an illegal order during the pendency of its administrative appeal.\u201d Thus, the core of the plaintiffs argument is that, as a result of the trial court\u2019s decision, the plaintiff will irreparably lose its right to conduct grievance hearings during the pendency of the appeal in private. We are not persuaded that these considerations transform this interlocutory order into a final judgment for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">It is axiomatic that, except insofar as the constitution bestows upon this court jurisdiction to hear certain cases; see <em>Fonfarra </em>v. <em>Reapportionment Commission, </em>222 Conn. 166, 610 A.2d 153 (1992);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the subject matter jurisdiction of the Appellate Court and of this court is governed by statute. <em>Grieco </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>226 Conn. 230, 231, 627 A.2d 432 (1993). It is equally axiomatic that, except insofar as the legislature has specifically provided for an interlocutory appeal or other form of interlocutory appellate review; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-278l </em>(prejudgment remedies); General Statutes \u00a7 54-63g (petition for review of bail); General Statutes \u00a7 51-164x (court closure orders); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 340, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992); appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments of the trial court. General Statutes \u00a7 52-263;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 30. The doctrine that an interlocutory order may nonetheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>be a \u201cfinal [judgment] for purposes of appeal\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31; is not an exception to but simply an application of the final judgment rule embodied in \u00a7 52-263. See footnote 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s attempt to bring the trial court\u2019s order denying a stay within <em>Curcio </em>founders on our further explication of that doctrine in <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>192 Conn. 85, 91-93, 469 A.2d 1220 (1984). In <em>Longo, </em>this court held that the trial court\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s application for youthful offender status was not an appealable final judgment. We so held, moreover, despite the fact that \u201c[o]nce the defendant undergoes a public trial or is detained with the general jail population, his privacy cannot be restored by a subsequent private trial or by subsequent segregation detention.\u201d Id., 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We held, nonetheless, that the order was interlocutory and did not satisfy the <em>Curcio </em>test. \u201cIn order to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Curcio </em>test the [plaintiff] must do more than show that the trial court\u2019s decision threatens [it] with irreparable harm. The [plaintiff] must show that that decision threatens to abrogate a right that [it] <em>then </em>holds.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 91. Furthermore, \u201cwhen a statute vests the trial court with discretion to determine if a particular [party] is to be accorded a certain status, the [party] may not invoke the rights that attend the status as a basis for claiming that the court\u2019s decision not to confer that status deprives the [party] of protections to which [it] is entitled. For an interlocutory order to be an appealable final judgment it must threaten the preservation of a right that the [party] already holds. The right itself must exist independently of the order from which the appeal is taken. Where a decision has the effect of not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>granting a particular right, that decision, even if erroneous, does not threaten the [party\u2019s] already existing rights.\u201d Id., 92-93. Application of these principles of finality of judgments to this case forecloses the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention that as a result of the trial court\u2019s action it must hold its grievance hearings in public during the pendency of this appeal devolves into a claim of irreparable harm. The plaintiff cannot show that it <em>now </em>holds the right to have such hearings conducted in private. That question will be determined by the administrative appeal. As in <em>Longo, </em>the right of privacy that the plaintiff asserts in this case does not yet \u201cexist independently of the order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The conclusion that the trial court\u2019s denial of a stay in this case is not a final judgment is consistent, moreover, with prior cases holding that similar claims of privacy rights may be lost pending an appeal. In <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>202 Conn. 252, 254, 520 A.2d 605 (1987), we held that a trial court order of disclosure and production was not a final judgment for purposes of appeal, despite the defendant\u2019s claim that the material ordered to be produced was protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine, and that the order therefore fell within the second prong of <em>Curdo. </em>We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the order must be deemed final because its rights would be \u201cinalterably concluded if it must, without appellate review, comply with the order by making the requested documents available to the plaintiff.\u201d Id. We recognized that \u201ca remand for a new trial resulting from an erroneous order to disclose information protected by the privilege cannot wholly undo the consequences of its violation . . . .\u201d Id., 257. Nonetheless, we stated: \u201c \u2018Vindication at the appellate level can seldom regain all that has been lost by an erroneous deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>mination of a cause in the trial court.\u2019 <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>195 Conn. 303, 311, 488 A.2d 778 (1985).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">We further noted: \u201cOur concern for the efficient operation of the judicial system, which is the practical consideration behind the policy against piecemeal litigation inherent in the final judgment rule, has induced us to dismiss appeals where statutorily created rights of privacy, no less significant than the right of confidentiality for attorney-client communications, have been at stake. Where those accused of crimes have claimed entitlement to treatment as juveniles or youthful offenders, we have recognized that our decree after a successful appeal from a conviction cannot restore the protection the legislature intended against publicity and other consequences attending an adult criminal proceeding. <em>[In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>supra, 195 Conn. 311]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>[supra, 192 Conn. 91], We have concluded, nevertheless, that the harm caused by delay in the disposition of criminal cases likely to result from allowing interlocutory appeals where trial courts have denied youthful offender or juvenile treatment far outweighs the need to provide additional appellate remedies to implement the legislative purpose more effectively. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>supra, 312.\u201d Id., 258. In addition, we made clear that the same considerations applied to civil, as well as criminal, cases. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The same reasoning applies to this case. The efficient operation of the judicial system, which depends upon the policy against piecemeal litigation inherent in the final judgment rule, strongly counsels against characterizing a denial of a stay pending appeal as a final judgment for purposes of appeal. Indeed, the plaintiff conceded at oral argument in this court that it was claiming, in essence, that the judicial denial of a stay of any freedom of information commission order requiring disclosure of material or opening of meetings is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>always an appealable final judgment. Although the legislature could certainly enlarge appellate review of freedom of information orders, it has not done so in either the Freedom of Information Act or General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (f). See footnote 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We have previously analogized the process of granting or denying a stay under \u00a7 4-183 pending the outcome of the administrative appeal to the process of granting or denying a temporary injunction to preserve the status quo pending the full hearing on the merits of a case. <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>196 Conn. 451, 457, 493 A.2d 229 (1985). Just as a temporary injunction generally is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal; see <em>Doublewal Corp. </em>v. <em>Toffolon, </em>195 Conn. 384, 389, 488 A.2d 444 (1985); the decision on a motion for stay pending appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (f) is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We note the existence of a narrow category of cases in which certain temporary orders have been held to be appealable final judgments because they so conclude the rights of a party that further proceedings could not affect them. See, e.g., <em>Goodson v. State, </em>228 Conn. 106, 114, 635 A.2d 285 (1993) (order of reinstatement to employment pending arbitration); <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>224 Conn. 749, 620 A.2d 1276 (1993) (temporary custody order in dissolution case); <em>Litvaitis </em>v. <em>Litvaitis, </em>162 Conn. 540, 548, 295 A.2d 519 (1972) (temporary order of child support in dissolution case); <em>Hiss </em>v. <em>Hiss, </em>135 Conn. 333, 336, 64 A.2d 173 (1949) (pendente lite order of support in equitable action for support).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The denial of the plaintiffs motion for a stay in the present case, however, does not fall within this category of cases. First, these precedents are less anala-gous to the facts of this case than is our law regarding the temporary loss of privacy rights. See, e.g., <em>Melia </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 252. Second, those cases generally involved payments of money that could not be recouped on a subsequent plenary appeal. See, e.g., <em>Litvaitis </em>v. <em>Litvaitis, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 540. Third, the special circumstances of family cases have persuaded us that there is a compelling need for immediate review of pendente lite visitation orders, which do not involve the payment of money. See, e.g., <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\"> The other defendants are the Waterbury board of education committee on grievances, the Waterbury Republican American newspaper, and Marc S. Ryan and James B. Craig, an editorial writer and reporter, respectively, for the newspaper. In the trial court, the board of education committee did not file an appearance. Furthermore, in the trial court only the newspaper, Ryan and Craig opposed the plaintiffs motion for a stay; the commission did not oppose the motion. Moreover, neither the commission nor the board of education committee has participated in this appeal. We refer herein, therefore, to the newspaper, Ryan and Craig as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\"> We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, limited to the following issue: \u201cWas the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs motion for a stay of the defendant Freedom of Information Commission\u2019s decision a final judgment for purposes of appeal to the Appellate Court?\u201d <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 904, 634 A.2d 300 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-21 provides in relevant part: \u201cmeetings of GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO BE PUBLIC.
