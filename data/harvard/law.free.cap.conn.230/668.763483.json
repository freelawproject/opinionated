Shluger, an attorney, appeals from the judgment of the trial court suspending him from the practice of law for a period of three years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) considered certain criminal misconduct by the defendant not charged in the presentment; (2) considered prior ethical misconduct by the defendant for which he had been disciplined; and (3) concluded that the defendant\u2019s federal felony conviction warranted his suspension from the practice of law for three years. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">The facts are undisputed. After the defendant\u2019s graduation from law school and admission to the bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>of this state in 1981, he joined the law offices of Michael A. Peck,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where he was employed until 1990. While employed by Peck, the defendant filed personal federal income tax returns for the calendar years 1986 and 1988 wherein he intentionally understated his taxable income.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On May 25, 1993, the defendant was charged in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut with one felony count of willfully making and subscribing to a false income tax return for the calendar year 1988<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206 (1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant entered a plea of guilty to that offense, and acknowledged that he had reported $22,782 in taxable income for 1988, knowing that he had taxable income for that year in the amount of $76,398. On August 23, 1993, he was sentenced to a two year period of probation and ordered to pay any sums due and owing to the Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On October 28, 1993, the plaintiff, the statewide grievance committee, filed a presentment and petition for interim suspension against the defendant in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Superior Court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 28B.1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The presentment alleged that the defendant had been convicted of subscribing to a false tax return for the calendar year 1988 in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206 (1), a felony, and that he had been sentenced to a term of probation of two years. On December 7, 1993, the trial court conducted a hearing on the presentment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>and petition. At the hearing, the defendant testified on direct examination that he had twice been reprimanded, once by a local grievance committee and once by the plaintiff,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for improper communications with parties whom the defendant knew to be represented by other counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant further testified on direct examination that his filing of a false income tax return for the calendar year 1988 had been an isolated instance of the use of poor judgment. Prior to the hearing, however, the defendant had filed with the court an affidavit in which he stated that he had \u201ccommit[ted] the act of falsely reporting [his] actual income for the years <em>1986 </em>and 1988.\u201d (Emphasis added.) On cross-examination, the defendant acknowledged that although he had only been charged with filing a false tax return for 1988, he had also filed a false return for 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The trial court concluded that a \u201creprimand [of the defendant] would not adequately protect the public and the administration of justice from an attorney who is unlikely properly to discharge his professional duties to clients, the public, the legal system, and the legal profession. [The defendant] has been reprimanded twice previously. He is convicted of a serious crime and admits to a like violation for which he was not charged. The [defendant] is accordingly suspended from the prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tice of law for a period of three years commencing on February 15, 1994.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court, in formulating its judgment, improperly considered his filing of a false 1986 federal income tax return. Specifically, he argues that the court\u2019s consideration of his filing of a false 1986 return deprived him of his right to fair notice of the charges against him because the presentment contained no reference to that conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim with a review of the well established principles that govern disciplinary actions against attorneys.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Attorney disciplinary proceedings \u201care for the purpose of preserving the courts from the official ministration of persons unfit to practise in them.\u201d <em>Ex parte Wall, </em>107 U.S. 265, 288, 2 S. Ct. 569, 27 L. Ed. 552 (1883); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 238, 558 A.2d 986 (1989). An attorney \u201cas an officer of the court in the administration of justice, is continually accountable to it for the manner in which he exercises the privilege which has been accorded him. His admission is upon the implied condition that his continued enjoyment of the right conferred is dependent upon his remaining a fit and safe person to exercise it, so that when he, by misconduct in any capacity, discloses that he has become or is an unfit or unsafe person to be entrusted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>with the responsibilities and obligations of an attorney, his right to continue in the enjoyment of his professional privilege may and ought to be declared forfeited.\u201d <em>In re Peck, </em>88 Conn. 447, 450, 91 A. 274 (1914). Therefore, \u201c[i]f a court disciplines an attorney, it does so not to mete out punishment to an offender, but [so] that the administration of justice may be safeguarded and the courts and the public protected from the misconduct or unfitness of those who are licensed to perform the important functions of the legal profession.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>226 Conn. 299, 307, 627 A.2d 901 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Because a license to practice law is a vested property interest, an attorney subject to discipline is entitled to due process of law. <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 551, 88 S. Ct. 1222, 20 L. Ed. 2d 117, reh. denied, 391 U.S. 961, 88 S. Ct. 1833, 20 L. Ed. 2d 874, modified on other grounds, 392 U.S. 919, 88 S. Ct. 2257, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1380 (1968); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 306. Accordingly, \u201c[bjefore discipline may be imposed, an attorney is entitled to notice of the charges, a fair hearing and an appeal to court for a determination of whether he or she has been deprived of these rights \u2018in some substantial manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>supra, 308, quoting <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Sinn, </em>128 Conn. 419, 422, 23 A.2d 516 (1941). With respect to the required notice, the presentment must \u201cbe sufficiently intelligible and informing to advise the court of the matter complained of, and the attorney of the accusation or accusations made against him, to the end that . . . the latter may prepare to meet the charges against him . . . <em>.\" In re Peck, </em>supra, 88 Conn. 453; <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>supra, 310. Conduct not charged in a presentment, therefore, may not provide the ground for the suspension of an attorney. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>supra, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Contrary to the claim of the defendant, the presentment need not have included any reference to the defendant\u2019s filing of a false 1986 tax return. The presentment filed against the defendant, in full compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 28B.1, properly set forth the ground for the disciplinary action against him, namely, his conviction for filing a false federal income tax return for the calendar year 1988. Because the sole ground for disciplinary action initiated under \u00a7 28B.1 is an attorney\u2019s criminal <em>conviction,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nothing more than the defendant\u2019s federal tax conviction was required to have been included in the presentment. The trial court, however, was also free to consider other evidence relevant to the defendant\u2019s character, integrity and professional standing; see General Statutes \u00a7 51-94;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> so that it could determine what sanction to impose against the defendant in light of his felony conviction. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>227 Conn. 829, 837-38 n.13, 633 A.2d 296 (1993); <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Sinn, </em>supra, 128 Conn. 426. Because the trial court reasonably concluded that the defendant's filing of a false tax return for 1986 was relevant to those issues, it properly considered that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The defendant cannot complain that he had not received adequate notice of the issue of his false 1986 tax return, because the defendant himself had brought that fact to the attention of the trial court in his prehearing submission.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>repeated characterization of his felony tax conviction as having resulted from \u201cone isolated act of very poor judgment\u201d prompted the plaintiffs fair cross-examination of the defendant concerning his filing of a false 1986 return, which the defendant again acknowledged. Finally, in view of the fact that the defendant was given a full and fair opportunity to address the trial court\u2019s concerns about the false 1986 return, both at the hearing and again in his posttrial brief, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that he was unfairly prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s consideration of the 1986 return.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>219 Conn. 473, 484, 595 A.2d 819 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1094, 112 S. Ct. 1170, 117 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant\u2019s prior ethical misconduct was relevant to its determination of an appropriate sanction. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Because the defendant had been properly presented for discipline on the basis of his federal felony conviction, the trial court was responsible for evaluating the defendant\u2019s character, integrity and fitness to practice law in order to determine the sanction to impose against him. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior ethical misconduct, because of its relevance to those issues, was admissible at the disciplinary proceeding. <em>Statewide </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 837-38 n.13; see General Statutes \u00a7 51-94.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The trial court acted within its discretion in concluding that the defendant\u2019s prior reprimands bore a reasonable relation to the issues before it. Although the defendant claimed that the reprimands were merely the result of unintentional lapses and, as such, were not sufficiently serious to warrant the trial court\u2019s consideration, the court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant\u2019s repeated failure to comport himself as required by the rules governing professional conduct demonstrated a knowing disregard of his ethical responsibilities. Moreover, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that because the defendant had committed these ethical improprieties in close temporal proximity to the criminal tax offenses, the defendant\u2019s criminal and ethical breaches were not, as he contended, isolated occurrences resulting from unrelated lapses in judgment but, instead, a series of violations that together constituted a pattern of misconduct. The trial court reasonably concluded, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s disciplinary history warranted consideration as an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The defendant further contends that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that he was unfit to practice law and in suspending him from the practice of law for three years. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">\u201cThe trial court had inherent judicial power, derived from judicial responsibility for the administration of justice, to exercise sound discretion to determine what sanction to impose in light of the entire record before it. <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Sinn, </em>[supra, 128 Conn. 422]; <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Broder, </em>112 Conn. 263, 266, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>152 A. 292 (1930); <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Ennis, </em>84 Conn. 594, 602, 80 A.2d 767 (1911); <em>In re Durant, </em>80 Conn. 140, 147-48, 67 A. 497 (1907).\u201d <em>In re Weissman, </em>203 Conn. 380, 384, 524 A.2d 1141 (1987). \u201cLong ago, we stated that \u2018courts are, as they should be, left free to act as may in each case seem best in this matter of most important concern to them and to the administration of justice.\u2019 <em>In re Peck, </em>[supra, 88 Conn. 457]; see also <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>[supra, 219 Conn. 483].\u201d <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 307-308. However, \u201c[although our review of grievance proceedings is restricted, we recognize the seriousness of the interests that we must safeguard. We have a continuing duty \u2018to make it entirely clear that the standards of conduct, nonprofessional as well as professional, of the members of the profession of the law in Connecticut have not changed, and that those standards will be applied under our rules of law, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion . . . .'\" <em>In re Application of Pagano, </em>207 Conn. 336, 345, 541 A.2d 104 (1988), quoting <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Broder, </em>supra, 112 Conn. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision reflects the court\u2019s careful consideration of the facts relevant to its determination of an appropriate sanction. With respect to mitigating circumstances, the trial court acknowledged that the defendant had presented evidence \u201cwhich certainly redounds to his credit as a citizen and member of the bar,\u201d including pro bono, charitable and bar association activities. The trial court also concluded that the defendant had enjoyed a good reputation in the community and at the bar, and that he appeared to be remorseful for his illegal conduct. Finally, the trial court considered as a mitigating circumstance the fact that the defendant, since his gradu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>ation from law school, had practiced in \u201can unsavory work environment created by [his] employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The trial court also reviewed the facts that warranted consideration as aggravating circumstances. The defendant had been convicted of filing a materially false federal income tax return for 1988, a serious federal felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to three years. This offense was not an isolated occurrence, the defendant having also filed a false tax return for 1986. The defendant did not dispute the fact that he had engaged in this conduct knowingly and willfully, with the specific intent to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s substantial understatement of his taxable income for both 1986 and 1988 had been motivated solely by greed. Finally, the defendant had been reprimanded for professional misconduct on two separate occasions, each involving ethical improprieties. The trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s repeated criminal and ethical violations constituted a pattern of misconduct for which simply another reprimand would not have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">On the basis of the serious and repeated nature of the defendant\u2019s misconduct, the trial court could reasonably have concluded that he was unfit to practice law and, consequently, that a sanction more severe than a reprimand was necessary. Indeed, the conduct that gave rise to the defendant\u2019s federal felony conviction occurred after he had already received at least one reprimand, a sanction that, regrettably, proved insufficient to deter the defendant from future wrongdoing. Moreover, because the crime of subscribing to a false tax return for the purpose of evading taxes is an offense that involves fraud, deceit and dishonesty, the defendant\u2019s conviction for that offense bears directly on his fitness to practice law. See Rules of Professional Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>duct 8.4 and comment thereto.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s determination, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s criminal and ethical misconduct indicated a deficiency of character and integrity incompatible with the high ethical standards required of attorneys who practice before the courts of this state.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Finally, we are not persuaded that the trial court acted unreasonably in imposing a three year suspension of the defendant\u2019s license to practice law. Although a three year suspension will undoubtedly result in hardship to the defendant, of paramount importance in attorney disciplinary matters is \u201cthe protection of the court, the profession of the law and of the public against offenses of attorneys which involve their character, integrity and professional standing.\u201d <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Broder, </em>supra, 112 Conn. 265. The record before the trial court supports its conclusion that the imposition of a suspension of significant duration was necessary in this case to accomplish that end. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in suspending the defendant from the practice of law for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">In this opinion Callahan, Borden and Katz, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-12\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> That firm later became Peck, Shluger, Coombs and O\u2019Neill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\"> During the period of his employment with the law offices of Michael A.

Offenses involving violence, dishonesty, breach of trust, or serious interference with the administration of justice are in that category. A pattern of repeated offenses, even ones of minor significance when considered separately, can indicate indifference to legal obligation.\u201d Rules of Professional Conduct 8.4, comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\"> See footnote 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-94 provides: \u201cevidence in proceedings to suspend, displace OR remove attorneys-at-law.

The defendant, however, has cited no authority for that proposition. Moreover, the trial court, which had broad discretion to evaluate the evidence properly before it, reasonably concluded that the defendant\u2019s filing of a false 1986 tax return constituted an aggravating factor warranting an increase in the degree of discipline to be imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\"> The defendant did not seek a continuance of the hearing for the purpose of introducing additional evidence about the false 1986 tax return.

So it is that we, in common with other courts, hold . . . that misconduct, indicative of moral unfitness for the profession, whether it be professional or nonprofessional, justifies dismissal as well as exclusion from the bar.\u201d <em>In re Peck, </em>supra, 88 Conn. 450-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\"> As we stated many years ago, \u201c[a]s important as it is that an attorney be competent to deal with the oftentimes intricate matters which may be entrusted to him, it is infinitely more so that he be upright and trustworthy.\u201d <em>In re Peck, </em>supra, 88 Conn. 450.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AfL\">dissenting. I disagree with the majority because I believe that the trial court abused its discretion in suspending the defendant, Robert Shluger, from the practice of law for three years. Although it was within the discretion of the court to discipline the defendant by suspending him from the practice of law, I believe that the suspension is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The conduct that precipitated the disciplinary proceedings was the defendant\u2019s filing of a false federal income tax return for the year 1988. Although the defendant had also filed a false tax return for the year 1986, a fact that the trial court took into consideration, the federal government only prosecuted him for the false 1988 tax return. The defendant pleaded guilty to the felony offense and was sentenced to two years probation. He was also ordered to pay all sums due to the Internal Revenue Service, the costs of prosecution and a special assessment of $50. In addition to these facts, the trial court considered the two prior reprimands the defendant had received from the local grievance committee for engaging in improper communications with parties represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Of course, the defendant\u2019s conduct is not to be condoned and surely requires some type of sanction. Their \u201cunique position as officers and commissioners of the court . . . casts attorneys in a special relationship with the judiciary and subjects them to its discipline. . . . Because of this special relationship, [w]e have a continuing duty to make it entirely clear that the standards of conduct ... of the members of the profession of the law in Connecticut have not changed, and that those standards will be applied under our rules of law, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion .... This court will neither neglect nor attempt to avoid that responsibility.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Roz-bicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 238, 558 A.2d 986 (1989). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Nevertheless, as the plaintiff, the statewide grievance committee, concedes, disciplinary proceedings are instituted <em>not to punish, </em>but rather \u201cfor the purpose of preserving the courts from the official ministration of persons unfit to practice in them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">There are three factors that should be taken into account in this case in determining the nature and extent of the discipline that is needed in order to protect the judiciary and the legal profession from the attorney misconduct. First, of course, is the nature of the attorney misconduct. It is particularly significant in this case that the defendant\u2019s misconduct did not involve a client. See <em>In re Weissman, </em>203 Conn. 380, 383, 524 A.2d 1141 (1987) (\u201c[t]he court considered the seriousness of the respondent\u2019s misconduct, as well as the relative lack of harm thereby caused to his clients\u201d); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Donnarumma, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. 111253 (8 Conn. L. Rptr. 447, 448, March 4, 1993) (\u201cthe court notes that this transgression neither involves a client nor the court\u201d); A.B.A., Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991) p. 5 (\u201cin determining the nature of the ethical duty violated, the standards assume that the most important ethical duties are those obligations which a lawyer owes to <em>clients\u201d </em>[emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">It becomes clear that the defendant\u2019s three year suspension is excessive when it is compared with the sanctions that have been imposed on attorneys who mishandled their clients\u2019 funds\u2014acts of misconduct that involve the attorney-client relationship. In <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Van Kirk, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV-90-0384679-S (3 Conn. L. Rptr. 789, 792, March 28, 1991), an attorney who had mishandled more than $26,000 worth of one client\u2019s funds, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>engaged in dishonest and deceitful behavior regarding another client, and had been reprimanded seven times previously, was suspended for only <em>one year. </em>In <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 32 23 37 (5 Conn. L. Rptr. 748, December 26, 1991), an attorney was suspended for <em>one year </em>after investing roughly $94,000 of a client\u2019s funds in his own company and representing to another attorney that the funds, which were intended to pay off a mortgage held by the client, would be held in escrow until the client had signed a release. The court stated that this conduct, which violated rule 8.4 (c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \u201cstrikes at the very essence of the practice of law and threatens one of the basic tenets of the profession. If one lawyer cannot rely on the written promise of another, we are not a profession of lawyers.\u201d Id., 749. The attorney was also reprimanded for \u201centering into a business transaction with ... his client\u201d in violation of rule 1.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Id., 748.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The second factor that should be considered in this case is the defendant\u2019s professional background. See <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Donnarumma, </em>supra, 8 Conn. L. Rptr. 448. As the majority concedes, the defendant participated in pro bono, charitable and bar association activities, \u201cenjoyed a good reputation in the community and [as a member of] the bar, and . . . appeared to be remorseful for his illegal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The third factor that should be considered is how the sanction imposed on the attorney compares with the discipline that has been imposed on other attorneys who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>have engaged in similar or more serious misconduct. In the recent case of <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Donnarumma, </em>supra, 8 Conn. L. Rptr. 447, the attorney had pleaded guilty to income tax evasion. The seriousness of his offense is underscored by the federal district court\u2019s sentence of imprisonment of seven months and one year supervised release. As pointed out by the trial court, the attorney\u2019s transgressions were \u201caggravated by the circumstances involved in the Waterbury municipal corruption case . . . .\" Id., 448. Nevertheless, the trial court suspended him from the practice of law for only <em>nine and one-half months. </em>Id. In <em>In re Weissman, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 381, the attorney had pleaded guilty to the crime of wilfully failing to <em>file </em>a federal income tax return and had been sentenced to one year imprisonment, but execution of the sentence was later suspended and the attorney was placed on probation for two years. This court upheld the attorney\u2019s suspension from the practice of law for <em>one month, </em>a sanction that is remarkably lenient in light of the fact that the attorney had been suspended from federal practice for one year. Id.; see also <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Sablone, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV92 506144 (9 C.S.C.R. 256, February 17, 1994) (attorney suspended for <em>two years </em>after being convicted of criminal conspiracy and fifty-nine counts of securities fraud); <em>In re Horton, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 357441 (8 C.S.C.R. 376, March 11, 1993) (attorney effectively suspended for <em>three years </em>after conviction of two felony counts of possession of cocaine with <em>intent to sell).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Although the trial court has a broad discretion in these matters; <em>In re Application of Pagano, </em>207 Conn. 336, 344, 541 A.2d 104 (1988); its judgment must be reversed if there is a \u201cmanifest abuse\u201d of discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>and \u201cinjustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Nevas, </em>139 Conn. 660, 666, 96 A.2d 802 (1953). Because I conclude that there has been an abuse of discretion resulting in injustice, I would vacate the three year suspension. During oral argument in this case, even the plaintiff conceded that there was \u201cno precedent for the three year\u201d suspension, and that it was \u201cnot the norm\u201d and was \u201cunusual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In taking corrective action in this case, our inquiry should focus on the fitness of the attorney to practice law. \u201cCharacter is not measured in the crucible of a single instance and the assessment for reentry appropriately centers on the question of present fitness.\u201d <em>In re Application of Pagano, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 345. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant is not now fit to practice law. Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment to the extent that it provides for a three year suspension and remand this case for reconsideration of the sanction to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\"> The respondent in <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>supra, 5 Conn. L. Rptr. 748, appealed to this court. In <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>226 Conn. 299, 311, 627 A.2d 901 (1993), this court reversed the trial court\u2019s finding of a rule 8.4 (c) violation because the defendant had not been \u201cfully and fairly apprised of the charge . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
