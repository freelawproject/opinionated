The plaintiff, Lenae Henderson, was born on December 21, 1961, and is the daughter of the defendant, James Morely Woolley. Both the plaintiff and the defendant resided in Connecticut from 1965 until 1976. The plaintiff alleges that when she was four years old, the defendant began having sexual relations with her. She further alleges that the defendant forced her to engage in sexual acts, and that he dominated her through mental and physical coercion and duress so that she would engage in those sexual acts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>It is alleged by the plaintiff that the acts included digital intercourse, oral sex and, from the age of twelve, sexual intercourse. This abuse allegedly persisted until the plaintiff reached the age of fourteen. The plaintiff, who is now approximately thirty-three years old, claims that all her memories of the abuse were repressed until they were recalled during psychological therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The plaintiff claims that she has sustained permanent, severe and continuing mental trauma and emotional distress as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct. She brought an action against the defendant, who presently resides in Georgia, in the District Court seeking to recover damages from the defendant for her alleged injuries and for past and future medical expenses. The defendant claims that the doctrine of parental immunity bars any such action in tort, and that because Connecticut\u2019s long arm statute<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> does not extend in personam jurisdiction without prima facie evidence that a tort has been committed, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint must be dismissed. The District Court sought certification to this court because the question whether the parental immunity doctrine extends to parental sexual abuse is unresolved in Connecticut. We agree with the plaintiff that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The parental immunity doctrine was first recognized by the Mississippi Supreme Court in <em>Hewlett </em>v. George, 68 Miss. 703, 9 So. 885 (1891), in which a daughter sought to sue her mother for wrongfully having confined her to an insane asylum when she was a minor. The court held that the daughter\u2019s action was barred, reasoning: \u201cThe peace of society, and of the families composing society, and a sound public policy, designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>to subserve the repose of families and the best interests of society, forbid to the minor child a right to appear in court in the assertion of a claim to civil redress for personal injuries suffered at the hands of the parent. The state, through its criminal laws, will give the minor child protection from parental violence and wrong-doing, and this is all the child can be heard to demand.\u201d Id., 711. In two subsequent cases, the courts extended the doctrine to bar a tort action for cruel and unusual treatment of a child by a parent; <em>McKelvey </em>v. <em>McKelvey, </em>111 Tenn. 388, 77 S.W. 664 (1903), overruled, <em>Broadwell </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>871 S.W.2d 471 (Tenn. 1994); and the rape of a minor daughter by her father. <em>Roller </em>v. <em>Roller, </em>37 Wash. 242, 79 P. 788 (1905); see generally <em>Dzenutis </em>v. <em>Dzenutis, </em>200 Conn. 290, 295, 512 A.2d 130 (1986). Although the <em>Roller </em>case involved intentional conduct, this decision, more recently, has been criticized severely by several courts; see <em>Foldi </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>93 N.J. 533, 537, 461 A.2d 1145 (1983) (labeling the result absurd); <em>Felderhoff </em>v. <em>Felderhoff, </em>473 S.W.2d 928, 930 (Tex. 1971) (finding <em>Roller </em>and <em>McKelvey </em>to be primitive and now abandoned applications of the doctrine); including the Supreme Court of Washington. See <em>Borst </em>v. <em>Borst, </em>41 Wash. 2d 642, 647, 251 P.2d 149 (1952) (referring to the <em>Roller </em>analysis of the state of the common law as clearly erroneous).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The parental immunity doctrine was eventually adopted in varying degrees by most states. Although some states initially adopted the doctrine as an absolute bar to any action in tort by an unemancipated minor child against a parent, many states either limited parental immunity to suits alleging parental negligence or were unwilling to extend it to acts of willful, intentional or wanton parental misconduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1963, Wisconsin became the first state generally to abrogate the doctrine,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and several other states have subsequently done the same.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The American Law Institute rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>parental immunity entirely in 1977. See 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 895G.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even states that extend the doctrine to simple negligence have created exceptions for certain negligent acts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have found only four states that continue to extend parental immunity to all torts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Parental immunity was first recognized by Connecticut in <em>Mesite </em>v. <em>Kirchenstein, </em>109 Conn. 77, 145 A. 753 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>(1929). The plaintiff, an unemancipated minor who was injured in an automobile driven by her father, sought to sue her father for negligence. In holding that parental immunity shielded her father from liability, this court found particularly persuasive the fact that the doctrine of parental immunity had been adopted in all eleven states in which the question had arisen. The rationale for the doctrine was described by the court as follows: \u201cAuthority in the parent to require obedience in the child is indispensable to the maintenance of unity in the family. Anything which undermines this authority, brings discord into the family, weakens its government and disturbs its peace, is an injury to society and to the State. New things could bring about this unhappy condition more quickly or widen the breach between parent and child further than the bringing of an action at law for personal injuries by a minor child against the parent. Such unseemly family discord is injurious to the public welfare, to such a degree that all the courts of this country, which have had occasion to express their opinion upon the right of the minor to maintain such an action, have declared that the exercise of this right is against sound public policy.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 84. The court reasoned that a child is generally protected from the infliction of injury by the \u201cstrong and almost universal bond of parental affection,\u201d and that in the rare instance where such is not the case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>child\u2019s recourse is to the criminal justice system and the power of the state to remove the child from the parent\u2019s home. Id., 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">At the outset, we note that the defendant has not cited, and our research has not revealed, any case in which this court has extended the parental immunity doctrine to bar an action alleging intentional or willful parental misconduct. In <em>Dzenutis </em>v. <em>Dzenutis, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 295-96, however, we recognized by way of dicta that \u201c[f]or intentional torts involving malicious or even criminal conduct . . . [parental immunity] has now been generally repudiated.\u201d More specifically, we have never considered whether the parental immunity doctrine should be extended to bar an action by a child against his or her parent for personal injuries arising out of sexual abuse, sexual assault or sexual exploitation of the child when he or she was a minor. See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Caton, </em>224 Conn. 483, 491, 619 A.2d 844 (1993) (declining to decide this issue). We are confronted, therefore, with an issue of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">This court has indicated its reluctance to abandon parental immunity in regard to the performance of acts involving parental care, supervision and discretion. <em>Dubay </em>v. <em>Irish, </em>207 Conn. 518, 527, 542 A.2d 711 (1988). In <em>Dubay, </em>a seventeen year old unemancipated child overdosed on prescription medications that belonged to her mother. The conservator of the child\u2019s estate brought an action charging the mother with negligence. The facts revealed that the mother had attempted to hide the medications from her daughter and had reacted in a reasonable manner once the child became ill. Id., 520-21. In holding that the parental immunity doctrine barred the plaintiff's claim, we reasoned that \u201c[c]ourts should not unnecessarily involve themselves in the day-to-day exercise of parental discretion regarding the upbringing and care of chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>dren.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id., 527. Although the Restatement (Second) of Torts recommends the abrogation of parental immunity; see footnote 10; it cautions against imposing liability when the parental conduct involves acts of supervision or discretion that are necessitated by the nature of the familial relationship between the parent and the unemancipated minor child.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Nonetheless, Connecticut is among the states that have refused to extend the doctrine to cases of parental negligence at the parent\u2019s place of business. In <em>Dze-nutis </em>v. <em>Dzenutis, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 290, we held that the doctrine did not bar an action for injuries sustained by an unemancipated minor that resulted from a negligent act of his parent occurring in the course of a business activity conducted by the parent away from the home. Id., 299-300. We reasoned that it would be incongruous to deny recovery \u201cbecause of a familial relationship between the [child] victim and the [parent] tortfeasor for injuries caused by the breach of a duty owed to the general public upon which the relationship has no bearing.\u201d Id., 297, citing <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>57 Ill. App. 3d 68, 372 N.E.2d 1127 (1978). We additionally stated that because allowing the child to bring suit in such a case would be unlikely to disrupt family harmony, the purpose of the doctrine would not be served.by applying it to those circumstances. Id.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Similarly, we do not believe that the purpose of the doctrine would be served by extending it to shield a parent from a civil action alleging sexual abuse. Familial discord or dysfunction obviously exists where parental sexual abuse occurs. Therefore, the purpose of the preservation of family harmony cannot justify immunity in the case of sexual abuse of a child by a parent. <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>Capitell, </em>539 So. 2d 264, 266 (Ala. 1989) (\u201c[t]o leave children who are victims of such wrongful, intentional, heinous acts without a right to redress those wrongs in a civil action is unconscionable, especially where the harm to the family fabric has already occurred through that abuse . . . [and, therefore,] the purpose for that immunity is no longer served\u201d); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>332 N.C. 90, 96-97, 418 S.E.2d 511 (1992) (\u201cWhere a parent has injured his or her child through a willful and malicious act, any concept of family harmony has been destroyed. Thus, the foremost public purpose supporting the parent-child immunity doctrine is absent, and there is no reason to extend the doctrine\u2019s protection to such acts.\u201d); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>742 F.2d 1004, 1005 (6th Cir. 1984) (\u201c[s]uch an act of gross misconduct [such as parental sexual abuse] would be so destructive of a family\u2019s parental relations as to eliminate the . . . public policy behind the parental immunity rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Furthermore, there is a point at which parental conduct properly becomes a matter of public concern, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>sexual abuse, assault and exploitation are well within that realm. When a parent perpetrates such a crime upon his or her child, that act constitutes a breach of duty owed not only to the child, but to the public at large, and there is no reason to immunize such conduct from a civil action in damages merely because of the familial relationship. We conclude that the public policy of this state requires that the parental immunity doctrine not preclude a child victim of parental sexual abuse from vindicating his or her rights by bringing an action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Contrary to the opinions expressed in <em>Mesite </em>v. <em>Kirchenstein, </em>supra, 109 Conn. 77, and <em>Hewlett </em>v. <em>George, </em>supra, 68 Miss. 703, redress is not necessarily available for this type of misconduct through the criminal justice system. The conduct may not be brought to the attention of the state within the time limits of the criminal statute of limitations<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> because of the child\u2019s continued dependency on the parent. Also, the child may not recognize the wrong for many years because children often accept unquestioningly the actions of their parents. Finally, as in the present case, the plaintiff may allege facts that are claimed to have been blocked from conscious memory for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The Connecticut legislature has recently recognized that child victims of sexual assault often do not come forward with a complaint until well after they have reached their majority. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1991 Sess., pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>1125-29, 1132-47; 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 13, 1991 Sess., pp. 4702-708; 34 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1991 Sess., pp. 2494-97. By enacting No. 91-240 of the 1991 Public Acts (P.A. 91-240), the legislature extended the statute of limitations for civil actions in which persons seek damages for injuries caused by childhood sexual abuse, exploitation or assault. General Statutes \u00a7 52-577dhad previously limited the commencement of an action in damages for such abuse to not later than two years from the date the victim had attained the age of majority, except that no action could be brought more than seven years from the date of the act complained of. The statute, by virtue of the enactment of P.A. 91-240, now permits a cause of action to be commenced up to seventeen years after the victim reaches majority.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The defendant argues that if the legislature wanted to remove the shield of parental immunity from acts of sexual abuse, it would have done so in P.A. 91-240. We note, however, that the testimony before the Judiciary Committee in a hearing concerning P.A. 91-240 included the testimony of victims of parental sexual abuse who clearly assumed that the extension of the statute of limitations would apply to individuals such as themselves, an assumption that was never questioned by any committee member. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1991 Sess., pp. 1125-29, 1132-47. During those hearings, Representative William Varese specifically indicated to a survivor of parental sexual abuse who testified at the hearings that she would not be covered under the proposed bill because she had not remembered the sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>abuse she had suffered as a child until she was forty-five years old, well beyond even the extended statute of limitations. Id., p. 1136. Nothing was mentioned by any committee member regarding lack of legal recourse for a child who was the victim of parental sexual abuse because of the parental immunity doctrine. Therefore, the legislative history indicates that at least some legislators considered victims of parental sexual abuse to be within the group covered by the expanded statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Furthermore, in enacting P.A. 91-240, the legislature could reasonably have believed that the common law of the state would not shield a parent from an action based on an intentional tort because parental immunity had never been applied to such an act. This is underscored in <em>Dubay </em>and <em>Dzenutis </em>where, in dicta, we stated that the doctrine has been rejected generally in cases of willful, wanton or reckless parental misconduct. <em>Dubay </em>v. <em>Irish, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 532 n.7; <em>Dze-nutis </em>v. <em>Dzenutis, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 295-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Other than <em>Roller </em>v. <em>Roller, </em>supra, 37 Wash. 242, which has been effectively overruled,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the defendant has cited only one case that extended parental immunity to bar a child\u2019s action for parental sexual abuse and that case was voluntarily dismissed upon appeal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We find more persuasive the reasoning of cases from other jurisdictions that have concluded that the purpose of the doctrine would not be served by extending it to intentional acts of sexual abuse because there is no harmony to preserve in a family that harbors an abusive parent. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 742 F.2d 1004; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>603 N.E.2d 1337 (Ind. 1992); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>supra, 332 N.C. 90; <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>Capitell, </em>supra, 539 So. 2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Accordingly, the certified question is answered: \u201cNo; the parental immunity doctrine does not bar an action by a minor child against his or her parent for personal injuries arising out of sexual abuse, sexual assault or sexual exploitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> The specific question is as follows: \u201cDoes the doctrine of parental immunity bar an action by a minor child against his or her parent for personal injuries arising out of sexual abuse, sexual assault or sexual exploitation?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\"> We have defined the parental immunity doctrine as barring a child from suing his or her parent for negligent acts or omissions that occurred while the child was an unemancipated minor, regardless of whether the child has reached majority at the time of the action. <em>Dubay </em>v. <em>Irish, </em>207 Conn. 518, 523, 542 A.2d 711 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199a, entitled the \u201cUniform Certification of Questions of Law Act,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) The supreme court may answer questions of law certified to it by the Supreme Court of the United States, a court of appeals of the United States or a United States district court when requested by the certifying court if there are involved in any proceeding before it questions of law of this state which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the supreme court of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u201c(c) This section may be invoked by an order of any of the courts referred to in subsection (b) of this section upon the court\u2019s own motion or upon the motion of any party to the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u201c(d) A certification order shall set forth: (1) The questions of law to be answered; and (2) a statement of all facts relevant to the questions certified and showing fully the nature of the controversy in which the questions arose.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4168 provides: \u201cThe supreme court may answer questions of law certified to it by the supreme court of the United States, a court of appeals of the United States or a United States district court when requested by the certifying court if there are involved in any proceeding before it questions of law of this state which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the supreme court of this state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) As to a cause of action arising from any of the acts enumerated in this section, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nonresident individual . . . who in person or through an agent ... (2) commits a tortious act within the state . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b494-4\"> The defendant contends that the parental immunity doctrine was founded on cases that involved claims of willful and malicious conduct. Neither the facts nor the opinions in <em>Hewlett </em>v. <em>George, </em>supra, 68 Miss. 703, and <em>McKelvey </em>v. <em>McKelvey, </em>supra, 111 Tenn. 388, indicates, however, whether the parental conduct involved was negligent, intentional, willful or otherwise. Moreover, it is noteworthy that in <em>Borst </em>v. <em>Borst, </em>supra, 41 Wash. 2d 647, the Washington Supreme Court stated that if the tort of the parent is intentional or willful, \u201crecent decisions uniformly allow the child a cause of action.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Snohomish County Public Utility District, </em>105 Wash. 2d 99, 713 P.2d 79 (1986), the court stated in dicta that the parental immunity doctrine does not extend to willful or wanton parental misconduct. The court defined willful or wanton misconduct as falling between simple negligence and an intentional tort. These cases have effectively overruled <em>Roller </em>v. <em>Roller, </em>supra, 37 Wash. 242, and anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>constituting an intentional tort, such as sexual assault, would arguably be unprotected in Washington by the parental immunity doctrine. See also <em>Talarico </em>v. <em>Foremost Ins. Co., </em>105 Wash. 2d 114, 712 P.2d 294 (1986) (stating in dicta that a parental act rising to the level of willful and wanton misconduct is actionable in tort). Additionally, <em>McKelvey </em>was overruled by <em>Broadwell </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>supra, 871 S.W.2d 471, and a recent decision in Mississippi has substantially limited the doctrine in that state.
