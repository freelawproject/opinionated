We conclude that the trial court had no such jurisdiction and that it, therefore, improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, which reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal and remanded the case with direction to reinstate the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The relevant procedural facts are undisputed. On March 31, 1992, the defendant, Dennis Luzietti, was convicted, after a jury trial, of reckless driving in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and operating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>motor vehicle while his license was under suspension in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced the defendant as follows: (1) on the charge of operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension, one year imprisonment, execution suspended after nine months, two years probation, 200 hours of community service and a $750 fine; and (2) on the charge of reckless driving, thirty days imprisonment, one year probation and a $300 fine. The second sentence was to run consecutive to the first, resulting in a total effective sentence of one year and thirty days imprisonment, execution suspended after ten months, two years probation, 200 hours of community service and $1050 in fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The execution of the defendant\u2019s sentence was stayed pending the trial court\u2019s disposition of the defendant\u2019s posttrial motions, including a motion for judgment of acquittal that the court denied on April 7, 1992. Thereafter, the defendant was committed to the custody of the department of correction by way of a judgment mittimus dated April 7, 1992, and he began serving his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On May 19, 1992, the defendant filed a motion to reargue the motion for judgment of acquittal that previously had been denied. The trial court granted rear-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>gument and held a hearing on May 22, 1992. The defendant argued, on the basis of a case that he had recently discovered, that there had been insufficient evidence before the jury to support its verdict on the count of operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state opposed the motion, claiming that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to vacate the judgment of conviction because the defendant had already begun serving his sentence. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that it had jurisdiction and that the defendant had been convicted on insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the state appealed to the Appellate Court, contesting both the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant the motion and its decision on the merits. The Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment concluding: \u201cThe trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motion [for judgment] of acquittal after the start of his sentence violated the common law rule that a court is without jurisdiction to modify its judgment in the absence of appropriate enabling legislation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>32 Conn. App. 1, 5, 628 A.2d 8 (1993). Because this conclusion disposed of the case, the court did not reach the state\u2019s claim that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict. Id., 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f, limited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>following question: \u201cDoes the trial court have jurisdiction to reconsider the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal after the defendant had begun serving his sentence?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>227 Conn. 919, 632 A.2d 697 (1993). We now affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the inherent power of a trial court over its judgments conferred jurisdiction on the trial court to grant his judgment of acquittal six weeks after he had begun serving his sentence. The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 455, 423 A.2d 118, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1979), in which we held that a trial court has the inherent authority to set aside an unreasonable jury verdict as part of its supervisory power. Id. The state contends to the contrary that a trial court\u2019s inherent authority over its criminal judgments ends when the defendant begins serving the sentence. Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s authority to set aside a jury verdict before rendering judgment in a criminal case, we conclude that once judgment has been rendered and the defendant has begun serving the sentence imposed, the trial court lacks jurisdiction to modify its judgment in the absence of a legislative or constitutional grant of continuing jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The Superior Court is a constitutional<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> court of general jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>222 Conn. 299, 305-306, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992). In the absence of statutory or constitutional provisions, the limits of its jurisdiction are delineated by the common law. <em>Cichy </em>v. <em>Kostyk, </em>143 Conn. 688, 690, 125 A.2d 483 (1956). It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>well established that under the common law a trial court has the discretionary power to modify or vacate a criminal judgment before the sentence has been executed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 426-28, 545 A.2d 559 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 123, 445 A.2d 304 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pallotti, </em>119 Conn. 70, 74, 174 A. 74 (1934); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>71 Conn. 457, 460-61, 42 A. 640 (1899).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is so because the court loses jurisdiction over the case when the defendant is committed to the custody of the commissioner of correction and begins serving the sentence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>supra, 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on May 22, 1992, six weeks after he had begun serving his sentence. The trial court heard and denied all of the defendant\u2019s posttrial motions on April 7, 1992. A judgment mittimus was issued immediately and custody of the defendant was transferred thereby to the department of correction. At that time, the court lost jurisdiction over the case and, in the absence of a statutory grant of jurisdiction, it had no power to set aside the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> conferred continuing jurisdiction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the trial court to grant the motion for judgment of acquittal six weeks after he had begun serving his sentence. He argues that \u00a7 53a-39 manifests a legislative intent that trial courts retain continuing jurisdiction to set aside their judgments when the sentence imposed is for less than three years. Specifically, the defendant contends that because the statute allows the sentencing judge to reduce the sentence to time served and \u201cdischarge\u201d the defendant, the trial court\u2019s action in this case served \u201cto effectuate the intent of the legislature.\u201d In response, the state argues that although \u00a7 53a-39 grants continuing jurisdiction to modify or reduce the sentence resulting in the defendant\u2019s discharge, the plain language of the statute applies only to the sentence and does not authorize the trial court to change the underlying judgment of conviction. We agree with the state and accordingly decline to adopt the defendant\u2019s unduly broad reading of \u00a7 53a-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u201cThe objective of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 521, 441 A.2d 158 (1981). It is axiomatic that, where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, construction of the statute by reference to its history and purpose is unnecessary. <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 538, 582 A.2d 1184 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>226 Conn. 818, 828, 629 A.2d 379 (1993). Furthermore, \u201c[n]o statute is to be construed as altering the common law, farther than its words import [and ... a statute] is not to be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which it does not fairly express.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>204 Conn. 472, 479, 528 A.2d 373 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The plain language of \u00a7 53a-39 allows the sentencing court or judge to \u201creduce the sentence, order the defendant discharged, or order the defendant dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>charged on probation or conditional discharge . . . The statute refers only to the reduction of the term of imprisonment of the defendant. It does not refer to the underlying judgment of conviction. The defendant\u2019s broad reading would alter the common law rule that a trial court may not vacate a criminal judgment after the sentence has been executed. Moreover, such a construction would go beyond the words of the statute in contravention of well established rules of statutory construction. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 53a-39 did not confer continuing jurisdiction on the trial court to entertain the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The defendant finally claims that a rule of continuing jurisdiction is necessary in this case in order to avoid an injustice, namely, his conviction on insufficient evidence. Implicit in the defendant\u2019s argument is the premise that without this rule he would be left without a remedy. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the case discovered by the defendant subsequent to trial would have rendered the jury verdict without a valid foundation, the defendant\u2019s claim lacks merit because he has alternative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">For example, General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> authorizes the Superior Court to grant a new trial upon peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tion by the defendant showing \u201creasonable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A meritorious claim that a verdict is against the evidence may constitute reasonable cause for the grant of a new trial. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Bishop Apartments, Inc., </em>144 Conn. 389, 391, 132 A.2d 573 (1957); <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>64 Conn. 61, 66, 29 A. 226 (1894). A petition for a new trial must be \u201cbrought but within three years next after the rendition of the judgment or decree complained of.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-582. The judgment of the court in this case was rendered on March 31, 1992. The defendant thus has until March 31, 1995, to file a petition for new trial on the basis that the jury verdict was unreasonable in light of the evidence presented at trial. Any claimed injustice could be avoided thereby. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim that continuing jurisdiction is necessary in this case in order to avoid an injustice is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

I agree with the defendant\u2019s claim that the inherent power of a trial court over its judgments conferred jurisdiction on the trial court to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal six weeks after he had begun serving his sentence. Therefore, I would reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment and remand the case to that court for its consideration of the state\u2019s claim that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The decision by the majority cannot be reconciled with this court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 437, 513 A.2d 620 (1986), that a criminal judgment will be treated like a civil judgment for purposes of deciding whether the trial court has jurisdiction to modify the judgment. In <em>Wilson, </em>the court concluded that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to modify its decision more than four months after judgment had been rendered. At issue in <em>Wilson </em>were the trial court\u2019s three separate decisions regarding the introduction into evidence of the defendant\u2019s two incul-patory statements made to the police upon his arrest for homicide. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress both statements. At the conclusion of the eviden-tiary hearing concerning one of those statements, the trial court ruled from the bench that the defendant had waived his right to counsel, pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), before making any statements to the police. As part of that decision, the court specifically rejected the defendant\u2019s testimony that he had requested a military lawyer. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 429. Following the evidentiary hearing regarding the defendant\u2019s second statement, the trial court, again ruling from the bench, found that the defendant\u2019s failure to request counsel constituted a waiver of his right to remain silent. Sometime thereafter, the trial court filed an undated and unstamped written memorandum of decision encompassing both claims that implied a finding that the defendant had requested military counsel. That written finding clearly contradicted the earlier rulings from the bench that the defendant had not requested counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">More than three years after the judgment of conviction and sentencing, and while the defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, the state filed a motion for articulation with the trial court, seeking a definitive ruling on the issue of whether the defendant had indeed requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>counsel. The trial court responded by amending its original memorandum of decision. It concluded that the defendant\u2019s testimony was not credible and that he had not requested counsel during the police interrogation at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Following a lengthy discussion of the circumstances in which an articulation is useful for meaningful appellate review, the <em>Wilson </em>court focused on the timing of the articulation at issue. Because \u201c[t]he trial court was without jurisdiction to amend in matters of substance its original memorandum of decision more than four months after sentence had been imposed,\u201d this court ordered the last memorandum of decision stricken. Id., 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Before reaching the ultimate decision of whether the last memorandum of decision could stand, this court traced the history of the trial court\u2019s power to modify its own judgment. Id. At common law, the trial court possessed the inherent power to modify its own judgments during the term at which they were rendered. <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 710, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983). The distinction was drawn between matters of substance and clerical errors, the latter being subject to correction at any time. <em>Morici </em>v. <em>Jarvie, </em>137 Conn. 97, 104, 75 A.2d 47 (1950). It was well established that \u201c[i]n the absence of waiver or consent of the parties, a court is without jurisdiction to modify or correct a judgment in other than clerical respects after the expiration of the term of the court in which it was rendered.\u201d <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Calise, </em>174 Conn. 567, 571, 392 A.2d 440 (1978). At common law the word \u201cterm\u201d meant \u201csessions\u201d of court as that period had been defined in earlier enactments of General Statutes \u00a7 51-181. Id., 571-72; <em>Cichy </em>v. <em>Kostyk, </em>143 Conn. 688, 695-96, 125 A.2d 483 (1956). Section 51-181, no longer makes reference to \u201csessions\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>court, however, because the court sits continuously throughout the year for periods set by the chief court administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In 1978, Practice Book \u00a7 326 was adopted. It provides that \"within four months succeeding the date on which it was rendered or passed,\u201d any civil judgment or decree may be opened or set aside. See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 437, we held that there was no reason to distinguish between civil and criminal judgments in this regard and concluded that \"for purposes of the common law rule, a criminal judgment may not be modified in matters of substance beyond a period of four months after the judgment has become final.\u201d We did not resolve the issue based on whether the defendant had been committed to the custody of the commissioner of correction or whether he had begun serving his sentence. Indeed, there is no reference whatsoever to those considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Both the majority and this dissent acknowledge that, in the absence of statutory or constitutional provisions, the limits of jurisdiction of the Superior Court are delineated by the common law. <em>Cichy </em>v. <em>Kostyk, </em>supra, 143 Conn. 690. We part company, however, in determining what those limits are. The majority clings to the general rule that the trial court may not alter the judgment once the sentence has been executed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>reasons for this rule, however, have not clearly been stated other than to say that the court loses jurisdiction at that magical moment. See <em>Kohlfuss </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>149 Conn. 692, 695, 183 A.2d 626, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 928, 83 S. Ct. 298, 9 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1962). Some courts follow the rule because an increase in sentence by the trial court could run counter to the constitutional protections afforded against double jeopardy, while others follow the rule because a decrease in sentence could invade the executive or legislative pardoning powers or powers of commutation. See generally annot., 168 A.L.R. 709 (1947). None of those concerns are at issue here; nor should they be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The protections against double jeopardy survive by virtue of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, regardless of what limitations we set on our inherent authority to open a judgment. <em>See State v. Palmer, </em>206 Conn. 40, 51, 536 A.2d 936 (1988). Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 18-26 et seq., authorizing the board of pardons to grant commutations of punishment or releases, conditioned or absolute, provide unfettered discretion in the board to grant what is purely an act of clemency with no right of judicial review to anyone denied. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>206 Conn. 267, 271, 537 A.2d 1004 (1988). The factors traditionally considered, including the length of time elapsed since the commission of the crime, the institutional record of the inmate, the extent of the petitioner\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation, and the results of his efforts; <em>Connecticut Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Dumschat, </em>452 U.S. 458, 463, 101 S. Ct. 2460, 69 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Ed. 2d 158 (1981); generally arise long after the defendant has been sentenced. Therefore, the ability of the board of pardons to act would be undisturbed by any attempt by the trial court, provided it acted within a reasonable time period, to open a sentence it had imposed in order to correct an injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The legislature has deemed four months as a reasonable time period within which to allow judgments to be opened in the civil arena. General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a. We have followed suit. Practice Book \u00a7 326. As this court acknowledged in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 437, this time period imposes reasonable demands on the trial attorneys to discover and disclose problems they perceive with the judgment. We should not impose greater demands on the criminal bar and bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">By wedding itself to the outdated rigid rule rejected by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 417, the majority ignores the modem day reality of the crash of business plaguing our courtrooms, the fallout of which is to create great stress and place unrealistic expectations on our judges to behave in god-like fashion. Examples of how this rule operates provide the best evidence of its shortcomings. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>14 Conn. App. 119, 133, 539 A.2d 1022 (1988), in deciding that the trial court had acted within its discretion when it decided to open the sentence it had imposed three hours earlier and resentence the defendant, the Appellate Court focused on the fact that the defendant had not yet left the courthouse lockup for the prison. Leaving the courthouse should not be the standard; rather, we should recognize the trial court\u2019s inherent power to correct errors of substance within a reasonable time in order to do justice. As of April, 1994, 17,659 cases were pending in our criminal courts. State of Connecticut, Judicial Branch; Superior Court Case Management Report; Court Operations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Division. I think it is reasonable to allow a trial judge more time than it takes to eat a jailhouse lunch to recognize a problem with a sentence it has just imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">This court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 438, held that \u201c[t]he trial court was without jurisdiction to amend in matters of substance its original memorandum of decision more than four months after sentence had been imposed.\u201d I would affirm that decision and hold that four months is a reasonable period to apply to criminal cases as well as civil cases for purposes of limiting the jurisdiction of a trial court to modify its own judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> A recent pronouncement of this rule can be found in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 425-28, 545 A.2d 559 (1988), in which we held that the trial court was without jurisdiction to modify the defendant\u2019s sentence because \u201che passed into the jurisdiction of the commissioner of correction at the time of the original sentence because a judgment mittimus had been issued at that time transferring.his custody to the commissioner of correction subject to completion of his federal sentence. . . . [W]here a mittimus has been issued following a sentence, the stay incident to the posting of an appeal bond does not leave the sentence unexecuted and thus does not confer upon the trial court residual jurisdiction to modify the sentence that has been imposed.\u201d Because the mittimus has come to be regarded only as a clerical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>document by virtue of which a person is transported to and rightly held in prison; <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>228 Conn. 384, 392, 636 A.2d 799 (1994); I assume that the majority relies on the imposition of sentence, the judgment of the court, to strip the trial court of its jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
