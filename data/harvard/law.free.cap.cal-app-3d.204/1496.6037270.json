The matter was certified to the superior court pursuant to section 859a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>Thereafter, the superior court granted appellant\u2019s motion to remand his case to the municipal court because of the magistrate\u2019s failure to advise appellant of the mental condition report proceedings authorized by section 288.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">The magistrate denied appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea and recertified the case to the superior court for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">The superior court denied probation and imposed the upper prison term of eight years for violation of section 288, subdivision (a) and a consecutive two-year midterm for violation of section 288a, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">Appellant makes two contentions on appeal: First, the magistrate erred in denying the motion to withdraw the nolo contendere plea. Second, when sentencing appellant, the superior court erroneously failed to consider factors in mitigation and considered improper factors in aggravation. We reject both contentions and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">Between January 28, 1987, and February 4, 1987, appellant forced his 10-year-old daughter to orally copulate him. Afterward, he touched her vaginal area with his tongue and then placed his erect penis either on or inside her vagina. The daughter had not reported these incidents because appellant had threatened to beat her \u201chalf to death.\u201d She believed the threat because appellant \u201chad hit her before when \u2018he was doing it.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">I. <em>The magistrate properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">The record shows appellant was fully advised of his <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>rights before entering his plea. <em>(Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 238 [23 L.Ed.2d 274, 89 S.Ct. 1709]; <em>In re Tahl </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 122 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449].) He also was advised of the primary and direct consequences of his plea including the permissible range of sentences. <em>(In re Birch </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 314, 319-320 [110 Cal.Rptr. 212, 515 P.2d 12]; <em>Bunnell </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 592, 605 [119 Cal.Rptr. 302, 531 P.2d 1086].) Appellant was further advised that, although his case would be referred to the probation department, no decision had yet been made as to the sentence, and the court would not be bound by the recommendation of the probation department, the district attorney or defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Although the court did not mention the mental condition report authorized by section 288.1, the evaluation under this statute must be deemed a \u201ccollateral. . . procedural consequence[]\u201d which does not \u201cdirectly impact on the fundamental implications\u201d of the plea. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kunkel </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 46, 53 [221 Cal.Rptr. 359].) In other words, advising appellant that his sentence could not be suspended without first obtaining a report from a reputable psychiatrist or psychologist concerning his mental condition would not have assisted appellant in understanding the permissible extent of his punishment, i.e., the nature of the penalties and sanctions resulting from his plea. <em>(In re Yurko </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 857, 864 [112 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519 P.2d 561].) Regardless of the contents of such a mental report, the court would have been free to grant or deny probation at its discretion under section 1203.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, there is no basis to conclude that appellant would not have entered his plea if he had been informed of the section 288.1 requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">II. <em>The trial court acted within its discretion in imposing the upper base term. </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1245-13\"> Before Franson, P.
