J</author>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Appellant, Stephen Knox, asserts numerous instances of error in connection with both his conviction of multiple sex crimes and related offenses and his sentence. We shall affirm the judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">By an information filed December 20, 1984, the District Attorney of Contra Costa County charged appellant with a total of fifty-five counts, comprised of the following separate counts: ten counts of forcible rape (Pen. Code \u00a7 261, subd. (2));<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sixteen counts of forcible oral copulation (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)); four counts of forcible sodomy (\u00a7 286, subd. (c)); fourteen counts of false imprisonment (\u00a7 237); five counts of kidnapping and four counts of kidnapping by force (\u00a7\u00a7 207 and 207, subd. (a)); one count of attempted forcible rape (\u00a7\u00a7 261, subd. (2) and 664); and one count of child endangering (\u00a7 273, subd. (a)(1).) Each count alleged use of a gun. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.3, 12022.5.) There were eight sets of victims, seven of which contained both the woman victim and a companion. Appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the use allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">A jury found appellant guilty of all counts except six charged in connection with one set of victims. It found the use allegations true for all but one other set of victims. The counts on which appellant was not convicted were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">On July 19, 1985, the court sentenced appellant to 142 years and 4 months in prison. A timely notice of appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">Appellant committed the numerous offenses for which he was convicted during seven separate incidents over a period of approximately four years. In each instance the victims were a young couple found by appellant, usually in a parked car, at night, in a remote area of Contra Costa County. In all but one case appellant used a sawed-off shotgun or automatic handgun, and sometimes a knife as well, to accomplish his crimes. Where the jury found no use enhancement, the woman thought appellant had a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>because he threatened to shoot and broke the car window with what she thought was a gun. Before the sexual assaults, appellant forced all but one of the female victim\u2019s companions into the trunk of the car. In two instances, appellant fired the gun to force the companions to comply; in others he threatened to shoot or held the gun to the head of one of the victims. The only companion not forced into the car trunk was a woman; appellant held the gun to her head and ordered the other woman to drive to an extremely isolated dirt road close to his former residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Appellant forcibly raped or used force to sodomize or orally copulate the principal victim. Except for one victim, who was sodomized twice after she said she had a disease, the women were raped at least once and as many as three times, in addition to acts of sodomy and oral copulation. One was bound and gagged and left in a bedroom for a night and day. One struggled with appellant and a bullet passed close to her head when the gun discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In most cases appellant wore a ski mask. He blindfolded several of the women. Appellant took four of them to houses and the others to remote areas where witnesses would be unlikely. He mentioned his children and marital problems, the details of which his ex-wife confirmed, to a number of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">All but one woman positively identified appellant at or before trial. The one who was unable to do so identified distinctive features of the house to which appellant took her. Other women identified this house; it belonged to appellant\u2019s longtime friend, who had given him the key and permission to stay there. Another victim identified appellant\u2019s house, where she had seen pictures of his children. Many victims identified various vehicles appellant used.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">During the search of appellant\u2019s house the police found a ski mask, weapons and ammunition of the type used in each incident, and rolls of the type of tape used to make blindfolds. An expert testified that some of the blindfolds were fashioned of continuous strips from one of these rolls. Search of appellant\u2019s vehicles uncovered the thumb print of one victim, tape with hair strands stuck to it and a spent bullet cartridge. Laboratory analysis of vaginal or anal smears from the victims disclosed semen which, in many cases, could have been produced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Detailed Statement of Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">I.-III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\n<em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Rape Convictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Pursuant to the definition of forcible rape given in the 1980 revision to section 261, subdivision (2) [hereinafter section 261(2)], the trial court instructed the jury that rape could be accomplished by means of force or by fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury. (CALJIC No. 10.00 (1982 rev.).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   Appellant concedes there was sufficient evidence of fear of injury, but argues there was not enough evidence of force. He then claims we must reverse the rape convictions because it is unclear which theory the jury used to convict him\u2014that is, they might have convicted him of rape by force, for which, according to appellant, there is insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Appellant misses the point of section 261(2), or perhaps he overlooks the logical result of his argument. Section 261 provides two distinct ways in which rape may be accomplished\u2014force or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury. The Supreme Court analyzed the adoption of this definition, noting that the Legislature eliminated the resistance requirement from the definition of forcible rape so that a victim could decide whether to physically resist, and risk provoking greater injury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 296-303 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110].) The court explained that under the previous version of section 261, victims who responded to a sexual assault with \u201cfrozen fright\u201d sometimes were mistakenly thought to have cooperated with the attacker, thereby making it impossible to obtain a rape conviction. The amendment acknowledges that the failure to resist is not probative on the issue of force or consent. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 299.) As section 261 now reads, fear of bodily injury alone will support a rape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>conviction. Thus, appellant\u2019s conviction could stand regardless whether he used force. By claiming his conviction must fail since it is not clear whether the jury found force or fear, and at the same time conceding the fear test was met, appellant asks for a conjunctive finding. In essence, he argues fear of injury is not enough to convict him of rape, there must be sufficient evidence of force as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the rape convictions must be reversed because it is unclear whether the jury relied upon force or fear is based upon the recent decision of the Fifth District in <em>People </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 248 [235 Cal.Rptr. 361].</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The opinion in <em>Young </em>is confusing and its meaning unclear. The case involved a defendant convicted of raping his six-year-old daughter. The conviction was reversed despite the appellate court\u2019s finding of substantial evidence of forced sexual intercourse against the child\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The court appears to ackowledge that the 1980 amendment to section 261(2), which used the disjunctive word \u201cor,\u201d introduced two distinct ways in which this rape offense could occur: by \u201cforce\u201d or \u201cfear.\u201d <em>(Young, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 259.) By eliminating the resistance requirement, the <em>Young </em>court observed, \u201cthe Legislature clearly intended to change prior law with regard to the use of force in rape.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court did not find any such legislative intent, however, \u201cwith regard to the fear element.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the court suggests that, <em>independent of the defendant's use of force, </em>the prosecution must always prove that the victim feared \u201cimmediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u201d Stated differently, the court seems to be saying that a defendant can be convicted under section 261(2) on the basis only of fear but not on the basis only of force. The fear element is indispensable, <em>Young </em>indicates, because under the statute, \u201cit is not enough for the prosecution to show that sexual intercourse was accomplished against the will of the victim by means of fear. There is a further requirement that the victim fear \u2018immediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d The court also thought it important that \u201c[ejven an unreasonable fear may suffice . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The rape conviction was reversed in <em>Young </em>because the record rendered the court \u201cunable to state with any degree of certainty which theory the jury may have used to find defendant guilty of rape.\u201d (190 Cal.App.3d at p. 259, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 69 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court indicates that the evidence would be insufficient if fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>was the basis of the verdict because the defendant \u201cdid not do or say anything that could induce fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u201d (190 Cal.App.3d at p. 259.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Although <em>Young </em>is factually distinguishable from the present case in a number of critical particulars (e.g., the defendant did not concede evidence of fear, as does defendant here), the case warrants discussion because of the mischief it can cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The analysis and holding in <em>Young </em>is in our view insupportable. In the first place, and most obviously, the opinion cannot be reconciled with the language of section 261(2): force \u201cor\u201d fear does not mean force \u201cand\u201d fear. The theory of the <em>Young </em>court that the fear element must always be proved because the statute requires not merely an unfocused fear but fear of \u201cimmediate and unlawful bodily injury,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which may even be an unreasonable fear, just does not make sense. The <em>Young </em>court provides no good reason, nor are we aware of any, why the judiciary should interfere with the legislative judgment that a defendant can be convicted of the crime of rape defined in section 261(2) where it is satisfactorily established, without more, that an act of sexual intercourse was accomplished against a person\u2019s will by means of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\"><em>Young </em>is additionally untenable for the related reason that it effectively prohibits the finder of fact from inferring the victim\u2019s fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury from the fact of the defendant\u2019s use of force. Perhaps a situation could be hypothesized in which a woman forced to submit to an act of sexual intercourse against her will did not fear immediate and unlawful bodily injury, but we do not think it easy to do so. In any event, we do not think it proper to make such a natural inference legally ineffectual. The statutory specification of fear of \u201cimmediate and unlawful bodily injury\u201d simply clarifies that the offense includes rapes initiated by forms of intimidation that do not involve direct physical compulsion, such as threats; it could not have been intended to prohibit a trier of fact from inferring the necessary fear from the use of force, as <em>Young </em>suggests. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 299.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Lastly, we think <em>Young\u2019s </em>reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>is misplaced, because <em>Green </em>dealt with situations in which the prosecution relied on different and distinct legal theories; <em>Green </em>did not consider a single jury instruction that properly posited two alternate methods of committing a crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at pp. 67-71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In any event, and entirely apart from the legal theory set forth in <em>Young, </em>there is no shortage of evidence to support the rape convictions in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">To evaluate a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim \u201c \u2018 \u201c[W]e must judge whether the evidence of each of the essential elements ... is <em>substantial.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People </em>v. <em>Barnes, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 303, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d at 557, 577, [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255] italics in the original.) Where evidence of forcible rape is at issue, \u201cthe reviewing court. . . looks to the circumstances of the case, including the presence of verbal or nonverbal threats, or the kind of force that might reasonably induce fear in the mind of the victim .... Additionally, the complainant\u2019s conduct must be measured against the degree of force manifested or in light of whether her fears were genuine and reasonably grounded.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The record in this case is replete with evidence of both force and fear of bodily injury. Appellant accosted all the victims in remote areas, late at night. He either brandished a gun, threatened to shoot, or, in two cases, fired the gun to force the boyfriends into the car trunks. Five victims were pulled to appellant\u2019s vehicle and driven away. Appellant hit two victims, blindfolded three, handcuffed and bound another. Due to the extensive evidence of both force and fear, we would be compelled to affirm the rape convictions even if\u2014as is not the case\u2014we agreed that such dual evidence were legally necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">V.-VIII.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
