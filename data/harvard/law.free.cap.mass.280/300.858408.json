Proceedings for the same cause as that set out in the petition above reported were had respecting the district attorney of the Suffolk district as reported, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooley, </em>1 Allen, 358; and in a case, hitherto not reported, respecting the register of probate and insolvency for the county of Middlesex in 1904. It has seemed best now to make a report of the proceedings in 1904. They were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Catharine A. Folsom &amp; others <em>vs. </em>Samuel H. Folsom.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Present: Knowlton, C.J., Morton, Baker, Hammond, &amp; Boring, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Petition, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Middlesex on November 18, 1904, by the wife and two daughters of the register of probate and insolvency for the county of Middlesex, in which the petitioners averred that, by reason of a derangement and enfeebling of the intellect, the respondent had been rendered unable to perform any of the duties of his office for the space of more than eight months; that there was no reasonable ground to hope that he ever would be restored to such a condition as would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>enable him to perform such duties; that his longer continuance in office was likely to embarrass the administration of public justice; and that, therefore, the public good required his removal from office. The prayer of the petition was for such removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">An order of notice to show cause was issued on November 18, 1904, returnable on November 28, and was duly served upon the respondent on November 21, 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">On the return day of the order of notice, a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>was appointed, who on the same day filed an answer stating: \u201cThe said petition having been read by me and personally knowing the several allegations thereof to be true, I admit the truth of the facts set forth in said petition and consent to the allowance of the prayer of said petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The court then heard evidence, took the matter under advisement, and later on the same day caused the following judgment to be entered:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">\u201cPresent: <em>Knowlton, </em>C.J., <em>Morton, Barker, Hammond, &amp; Boring, </em>JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">\u201cAt Boston, November 28, 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">\u201cThe petition of Catharine A.

S. Clemons, Esq., appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>of said Folsom, having filed an answer, admitting the truth of the facts set forth in the petition and consenting to the allowance of the prayer thereof:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">\u201cIt appearing, upon the hearing of evidence, that sufficient cause is shown therefor, and that the public good so requires, it is ordered by the above named justices, they being a majority of the justices of said Court, under the authority conferred by the Revised Laws, chapter 156, \u00a7 4, that the said Samuel H. Folsom be and he hereby is removed from the office of Register of Probate and Insolvency for the County of Middlesex.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">\u201cBy the Court,</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">C. H.

Oral testimony of experts in mental diseases also was heard. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>taking the matter under advisement, the following judgment was entered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-3\">\u201cAt Springfield in the County of Hampden, September 22, 1932.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">\u201cPresent: <em>Rugg, </em>C.J., <em>Crosby, Wait, Donahue, &amp; Lummus, </em>JJ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201cThe petition of the Attorney General for the removal of John D.
