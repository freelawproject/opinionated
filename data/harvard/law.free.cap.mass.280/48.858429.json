[It appears from the record that all sums due under this order have been-paid.] It is further alleged that, in the preparation for hearings, upon those petitions and in the hearings she has expended various sums of money and incurred attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. The prayer is that he be ordered to pay her forthwith \u201cas an additional allowance a sum sufficient to cover the reasonable counsel fees and expenses\u201d thus incurred by her. The decree on this petition, after reciting its prayer and notice to interested parties and a hearing, orders that, \u201cin addition to the allowance heretofore made for the support of the petitioner and the minor children of the parties, the said John J. Densten pay to the petitioner the sum of $1,200.\u201d The respondent\u2019s appeal brings the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The petitions described in the present petition were brought in the Probate Court by virtue of jurisdiction conferred by G. L. c. 209, \u00a7\u00a7 30-34.. It is provided by \u00a7 32 that, if \u201ca husband fails, without just cause, to provide suitable support for his wife ... or if the wife, for justifiable cause, is actually living apart from her husband, the probate court may, upon her petition . . . make . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>orders relative to the support of the wife and the . . . maintenance of the minor children of the parties . . . and may, from time to time . . . revise and alter such order or make a new order or decree . . . .\u201d The utmost scope of this section is to provide for the support of the wife and the maintenance of the children. It makes no provision for attorneys\u2019 fees or expenses incurred in prosecuting the petition. Provision touching that subject is found in the following section. It is provided by \u00a7 33 that upon such petition and proceedings thereunder G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 17, shall apply so far as appropriate. The terms of that section are that the \u201ccourt may require the husband to pay into court for the use of the wife during the pendency of the libel an amount to enable her to maintain or defend the libel.\u201d Petitions for separate support bear such close analogy to libels for divorce that beyond doubt said \u00a7 17 is applicable to petitions for separate support, This provision seems to exclude from cases of this nature the operation of G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 45, as amended by St. 1931, c. 120. That section relates to costs and expenses in contested cases in probate courts, but is not so manifestly relevant to proceedings under G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 32, as is G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 17, imported into those proceedings by said \u00a7 33. Moreover, by St. 1879, c. 31, this provision, now found in \u00a7 17, for expenses was made applicable to proceedings for separate support, while the first antecedent of the pertinent provision of said \u00a7 45 was St. 1884, c. 131. However that may be, the effect of G. L. c. 209, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 33, and c. 208, \u00a7 17, is that the costs and expenses for counsel fees must be determined as an item separate and distinct from the amount found to be necessary for the support and maintenance of the wife and children, but that they are part of a single proceeding. This is in accord with the general policy of the law pertaining to probate courts as well as to common law courts that all claims arising out of a cause of action in process of determination ought to be settled by one adjudication covering the whole field. <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>139 Mass. 59. <em>Canning </em>v. <em>Shippee, </em>246 Mass. 338. <em>Mulloney </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>266 Mass. 50, 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The petition in the ease at bar, fairly construed, is applicable to counsel fees and expenses and not to an additional allowance. Moreover, it was filed before the entry of the decrees dismissing those petitions. The conclusion follows that the decree appealed from must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
