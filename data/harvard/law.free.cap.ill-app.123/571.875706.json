This is an action to recover on a promissory note for \u00a7333 made by appellants payable originally to the Witte Iron Works Company, said to be a Missouri corporation, by which the note was subsequently endorsed to appellee, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Illinois. The original declaration was demurred to. Thereupon appellee filed an amended declaration setting forth the circumstances under which the note was made and delivered. The declaration as first filed was in the usual printed form in a suit of an endorsee against a maker with the common counts and affidavit to the plaint^Fs claim. To the amended declaration appellants filed a plea of general issue, with notice of special defense.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-12\" pgmap=\"591(40) 592(149)\">The amended declaration set out the circumstances of a controversy in settlement of which the note was given, and the special defense set forth in the notice attached to appellants\u2019 plea was that Witte Iron Works Company was a corporation organized under the laws of Missouri which had transacted business in Illinois prior to and at the time of the execution of the note without being licensed to do business in this State, and that said note was endorsed and delivered to appellee by said \"Witte Iron Works after maturity. The plea was not accompanied by an affidavit of merits, and appellee moved to strike the plea and notice of defendants from the file for want of such affidavit, which motion was allowed. Thereupon appellants moved for leave to file an affidavit of merits, and were given leave to present such affidavit. When subsequently the affidavit was presented and read to the court, leave to file was denied. Defendants\u2019 plea and notice were then stricken out for want of an affidavit of merits, default entered and judgr ment rendered upon evidence of the amount due on the note.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-4\" pgmap=\"592\">Hamilton &amp; Hamilton, for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-5\" pgmap=\"592\">Bayley &amp; Webster, for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b592-6\" pgmap=\"592\">Mb. Justice Freeman</author> <p id=\"AWV\" pgmap=\"592\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b592-7\" pgmap=\"592\">It is claimed by appellants that they were not obliged to file an affidavit of merits with their plea, because appellee did not file with its amended declaration a new affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s claim. (R. S. chap. 110, sec. 37.) The point is not well taken. Appellee had filed the required affidavit \u201c with his declaration,\u201d as the statute required, and there was nothing in the amendment which made it necessary that such affidavit should be refiled.</p> <p id=\"b592-8\" pgmap=\"592(91) 593(396) 594(157)\">It is further contended that the court erred in entering O appellants\u2019 default and rendering judgment after appellants had disclosed what is claimed to be a meritorious defense by affidavits then presented by leave of court, jfhe motion by appellants for leave to file affidavit of merits -was made after appellee had moved to strike the plea and notice from the files for want of such an affidavit, and for default and judgment. We find no abuse of discretion in the Circuit Court\u2019s refusal to allow the affidavits presented by appellants to be filed. The defense therein set up is that the Witte Iron Works, payee in the note, by which it was endorsed to appellee, is a Missouri corporation not authorized to do business in this State, and that said corporation transferred the note to appellee after maturity. It is not shown or pretended, so far as appears from appellants\u2019 affidavits, that the latter have or had any meritorious defense to the note whether before or after its maturity. Mo effort is made to disprove the averments of the declaration that the note was made payable to the Missouri corporation in consideration of the assignment by it to appellants of a lease of premises in Chicago taken in said foreign corporation\u2019s name merely for temporary convenience and because appellee\u2019s organization as an Illinois corporation for which the lease was taken was not then entirely completed, the intention being to transfer the lease to appellee when the latter was duly organized. Mor is it denied that the note was given in settlement of a controversy over said lease. The whole sum and substance of appellants\u2019 defense is that the Missouri corporation had no right or power to hold the lease or accept a note or do any business in this State. Section 4 of the Statute of 1899 (R. S. chap. 32, sec. 67,) provides that a foreign corporation not having complied with requirements of that statute cannot \u201c maintain any suit or action either legal or equitable in any of the courts of this State upon any demand whether arising out of contract or tort.\u201d The act does not purport to vitiate all contracts made by such corporations, and should not be so construed. Smith v. Local Branch, 77 Ill. App. 469-472; Cooper Mfg. Co. v. Ferguson, 113 U. S. 727-734. It does prevent the enforcement of a contract demand in this State by suit. In the present case the foreign corporation has no connection with the suit and under the averments of the declaration has not now and never has had anything but a nominal interest in the note sued upon. In Havens &amp; Geddes Co. v. Diamond, 93 Ill. App. 557-561, will be found a review of authorities as to what constitutes doing business in this State by a foreign corporation within the statute referred to. We regard it as immaterial in this case whether the Missouri corporation had or had not technically, done business in this State by taking the note in controversy. The question is not before us. That corporation is not seeking to maintain the action. The facts set up in the amended declaration are not denied. By the settlement, of which the note sued upon constituted a part, appellants obtained undisputed possession of the premises covered by the lease then in controversy.' Such settlement was so far as appears a valid consideration for the note. The Missouri corporation at the most did no more than a single act of business in this State, and that merely nominal. The actual beneficiary was the appellee and- the latter is entitled to maintain the action in its own behalf. It had when the suit was commenced both the legal and beneficial title to the note.</p> <p id=\"b594-5\" pgmap=\"594\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b594-6\" pgmap=\"594\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
