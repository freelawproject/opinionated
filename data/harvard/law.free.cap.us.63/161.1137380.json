A clause in the grant, naming quantity and reserving surplus, in such a case, is an unmeaning formula. The utmost effect that could be given to the clause would be to reserve the right to the Government, on proper proceedings, to divest the title as to the surplus; but, in the mean time, the title to th &gt; whole land is vested in the grantee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-12\">This land is not claimed by any adverse claimant. The Government never interfered with Gonzales in any way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>It will be seen, by the testimony of Manuel Jimeno, that Gonzales had occupied the land from 1833. If the Government had the right to resume the ownership of the surplus, its non-action for so long a period raises a presumption of a relinquishment of the right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">The quantity named in the grant is a clerical error. It was taken from the marginal note on the map, written by some illiterate 'person, and which the court will perceive, by inspection of the traced copy in the record, is such as would readily mislead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">It describes the land as one league from north to south. We cannot make out the word which professes to give the distance from east to west.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-7\">The map was made as part of the petition of Gonzales to Figueroa for the land, and it was presented to Figuei\u2019oa with the petition. Gonzales,- in that petition, refers to the map, and says that the ranch delineated on it includes <em>\u201c a square of about four leagues, </em>extending from the coast to the sierra, and from the rancho of San Gregorio (rancho occupied by the citizen Antonio Buelna) to the rancho Punta de A\u00f1o Nuevo,\u201d and asks for the whole tract, without any limitation of quantity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-8\">' It may be remarked here that Gonzales states, in his petition to Figueroa, that he had a family of thirteen persons, and the grant recites that it is for his benefit and that of his family. He also states that he had five hundred head of cattle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-9\">The rancho is pasture land. Four leagues was little enough to provide for Gonzales\u2019s family and the increase of his stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-10\">There can be no doubt the Governor would have granted him that quantity, or much more, if he had asked for quantity. The land had been abandoned by the mission of Santa'Cruz, and it was a benefit to the country to have it occupied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-11\">Witnesses were examined, by order of Figueroa, before he made the decree of concession. Salvio Pacheco says the rancho is one league to a league aud a half from east to west. Manuel Larios says that it is two leagues from the beach to \u2019be hills.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-12\">We may presume that the marginal'note' had no; then been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>v\u00f1tten on the paap, or, if! written, it' wa\u00e9 not properly read by the clerk who made out the grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">The decree of concession evidently' intended to invest Gonzales with the title to the whole tract, and it calls upon the interested party again to \u201cpresent his title, that it may be re-validated.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-6\">If the party is to get only the' quantity named in the grant, he will be deprived by it, practically, of the greater part of his property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-7\">The decree, of concession gave him the whole tract. Does the grant, which was made by virtue of the decree, and in order to \u201c revalidate \u201d it, take away the greater portion of the land given by the decree ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-8\">The grant refers to the map, to ascertain the land, and the map exhibits the natural objects which are its boundaries. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-9\">\u201c When a deed of land describes the subject matter by monuments clearly defined, such as a river, a spring, a mountain, a marked tree, or other natural object, and courses, distances, and quantity, are'likewise inserted, which disagree with the monuments, the description by monuments shall, in general, prevail; for it is more likely that a party purchasing or selling land should make mistakes in respect to course, distance, and quantity/ than in respect to natural objects, which latter, from being mentioned in the deed, are presumed to have been examined at the time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-10\">. \u201c The monuments which shall control course, distance, etc., under such circumstances, may be any objects which are visible and clearly ascertained, as lands of other individuals or their corners.\u201d,</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-11\">4 Phillips on Evidence, Cow\u00e9n and Hill\u2019s notes, page 548, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-12\">It is evident that the land commissioners thought that the extent of the land from east to west, as delineated on the map, was no more than three-quarters of a league, otherwise they would have confirmed the claim to a greater extent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-13\">They have followed the phraseology of the grant, and added the words, \u201c a little more or less,\u201d to the designation of quantity, and perhaps these words give the claimant the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>land; but as they would not enlarge the tract beyond three-quarters of a league, under the present ruling of those having charge of the making of surveys and the issuance of patents, a decision of this court is asked, to establish the rights of the claimant as to the extent of land to be confirmed to him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aga\">Mr. Justice McLEAN</author>\n<p id=\"A04\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">This is an appeal from the District Court of the United States for the northern district of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">[Translation of Title.]</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Provisionally authorized by the Administration of the Maritime Custom-House of Monterey, for the years 1832 and \u2022 1833.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Jose Figueroa, General of Brigade of the National Armies of Mexico, Commander General, Inspector, and Superior Political Chief of Upper California.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u2022 Whereas Juan Jose Gonzales, a Mexican by birth, has, for his own personal benefit, and that of his family, petitioned for the land known by the- name of San Antonio, or El Pescadero, bounded by the rancho Antonia Buelnos Sierra, the coast, and the Arroyo of Buntano, the proper measures and examinations being previously made, as required by laws and regulations, using the powers which are conferred on me in decree of the seventh of this month, in the name of the Mexican nation, I have granted him the aforesaid land, declaring to him the ownership of it by these presents \u2014 said grant being understood to be in entire conformity with the provisions <em>oi </em>the laws, subject to the approval or disapproval of the most excellent territorial deputation and of the supreme Government, under the following conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">1. That he will submit to those which may be established by the regulation which is to be made for the distribution of vacant lands; and, in the mean time, neither the grantee not his heirs can divide of alienate that which is granted to them, subject to any tax, entail, pledge, mortgage, or other encumbrance, even for pious purposes, nor convey it in mortmain.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">2. He may enclose it, without prejudice to the crossings, roads, and servitudes; he will enjoy it freely and exclusively, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>making such use or cultivation of it as may best suit; but within one year, at furthest, he shall build a house, and it shall be inhabited.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">3. When the ownership is confirmed to him, he will request the proper magistrate to give him juridical possession in virtue of this title, by whom the boundaries will be marked out \u2014 in which, besides the bounds, he will place some fruit or forest trees, of a useful character. .</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">4. The laud of which donation is made him is one league in length by three-quarters of a league in breadth, a little more or less, as shown by the map which goes in the ex-pediente; the magistrate who may give the possession will cause it' to be in conformity with the ordinance, in order to mark out the boundaries, leaving the surplus which may result to the nation, for its convenient uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">5. If he contravene these conditions, he will lose his right to the land, and it will be subject to denouncement by another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">In consequence I order, that the present serving him for a title, and being held as firm and valid, note be made of it in the corresponding book, and it be delivered to the person interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Given in Monterey, on the 24th December, 1833.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Jose Figueroa.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">(Signed) Agust\u00edn Y.

The grant describes the land as that known by the name of San Antonio, or El Pescadero, bounded by the rancho of Antonio Bnelna, the sierra, the coast, and the Arroyo de Butano. The fourth condition states that the land of which donation is made is one league in length and three-quarters of a league in breadth, a little more or less, as shown by the map which goes with the expediente, with the usual reservations of the sobrante or overplus to the use of the nation. The boundaries are distinctly marked out on the map; and although there is no scale on the map, by which the extent of the boundaries can be ascertained, yet there is a note made upon it, stating that they extend one league from north to south, and three-quarters of a league from east to west. This description, taken in connection with that contained in the grant, shows very clearly that it. is a grant by metes and bounds, and that consequently no sobrante can result.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The original grant is in evidence, and the genuineness of the signatures of the Governor and Secretary appearing thereon are duly proved by the deposition of David Spence.

The description of the land in their decree is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u2018Being the same which has been held and occupied by the present claimant since-the year 1833 to the present time, and is bounded as follows: Beginning at the mouth of the Arroyo de Butano, and running along the sea coast, and bordering, thereon, to the boundary line of Antonio Buelna, the distance being one league, a little more-or less; thence with the line \u00f3f said Buelna east three-quarters of a league; thence a line southerly parallel with the sea coast until it intersects the Arroyo del Butano, at the distance of three-quarters of a league from the coast; thence along said arroyo and bordering thereon to its mouth, the place of beginning; the same being in extent three-fourths of a square league, a little more or less. For a more particular description, reference being had to the original grant and map contained in the expediente from \"the archives now in the custody of the United States surveyor general for California, the first of which and a traced copy of the latter are filed in the ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The parties appealed to the District Court, and, upon the hearing of the cause, the decree of the commissioners was afiSrmed, and it was further ordered, that the claim of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>said Juan Jose Gonzales is a good and valid claim to the land known by the name of San Antonio,' or Pescadero, to the extent and within the boundaries mentioned in the grant and map, the original of the former and copy of the latter being-on file in the records of this ease. From this decree the plaintiff appealed. The only question presented on the appeal is, whether the grant is to be located according to the natura calls in the grant, or whether the claimant is to be confined to the quantity specified in the 4th condition of the grant. But the decision of this question is reserved in the decree of the District Court, and will properly arise after the location. The failure to direct the precise manner of the location is not erroneous. The result therefore is, that the decree must be affirmed. . ~</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
