Budhani appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeals, claiming (among other things) that the indictment was void and that his statements to police were involuntary and therefore should not have been admitted at trial. The Court of Appeals rejected Budhani's claims and affirmed his convictions.\n   <em>\n    Budhani v.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12652578\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/820/640/\">\n    304 Ga. 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12652578\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/820/640/\">\n    820 S.E.2d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). We granted certiorari to consider (1) whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the indictment was not fatally defective; and (2) whether a promise of no additional charges constitutes a \"slightest hope of benefit\" under OCGA \u00a7 24-8-824. For the reasons that follow, we affirm-but for reasons that differ from those offered by the Court of Appeals. Specifically, we hold that (1) Budhani's indictment was not void and (2) a promise made by law enforcement to bring no additional charges against a defendant does constitute the \"slightest hope of benefit\" under OCGA \u00a7 24-8-824, although such a promise may not always render a subsequent confession inadmissible. We further conclude that although investigators' promises of no additional charges during Budhani's recorded, custodial interview constituted a hope of benefit under\n   OCGA \u00a7 24-8-824, any error the trial court made by admitting the portions of Budhani's interview after investigators' promises of no additional charges was harmless based on this record in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The record here shows that Mahemood Budhani worked as a cashier at a gas station in Newton County, Georgia. In late 2014, law enforcement officers arranged three controlled buys of XLR11, a type of synthetic marijuana, from Budhani at the gas station.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For each purchase, investigators met with an informant at a pre-designated location to provide audio and video surveillance equipment, thus allowing investigators to listen to the transactions in real time and review the video\n   recordings thereafter. Investigators also provided the informant with cash to purchase the XLR11 and recorded the serial numbers of the bills they provided. The informant then drove to the gas station on each date and purchased XLR11 from Budhani with the cash provided, all while under surveillance by investigators. After each sale, the informant met investigators at the same pre-designated location and turned over the packets of XLR11 purchased from Budhani. On the same date as the last sale, officers obtained and executed a warrant to search the gas station. During the search, they seized additional packets of XLR11, at least some of which were labeled \"not for human consumption.\" They also arrested Budhani, who had marked bills from the last controlled buy in his pocket and several hundred dollars in cash behind the counter and in his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After law enforcement transported Budhani to the police station, and after being advised of his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), Budhani waived his rights and spoke with Investigators Al Miller and Mike Tinsley in a recorded interview. In the interview, Budhani immediately admitted to selling \"the synthetic\" for \"like a couple weeks,\" then said he started selling \"two, three weeks ago.\" After being pressed further by the investigators, who indicated that they had been investigating him for about two months, Budhani admitted that it had been \"like month, three weeks, month.\" Because investigators had been monitoring Budhani for almost two months before the interview, they conveyed to Budhani that they knew he was being dishonest about how long he had been selling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In continued efforts to convince\n   Budhani to admit with accuracy how long he had been selling XLR11, investigators then said, \"[i]f you said, Lieutenant Miller, I've been selling for five years ... Just, there aren't anymore charges ... What you're charged with now ... [i]s what you're charged with ... I'm not going back and charging you.\" Budhani continued to claim that he had started selling \"not even like weeks [ago],\" and after investigators again told Budhani that they knew \"for a fact\" that he had been selling for longer than a couple of weeks, Budhani said that he had been selling for \"a month, maybe longer,\" and then responded \"Yeah,\" when asked if it had been \"[l]onger than a month.\" Shortly afterward, Investigator Tinsley again told Budhani to be honest and said, \"there aren't any more charges coming. If you was to say I've been selling for ten years .... You're not going to get any more charges, okay.\" Investigators continued, \"we've got to prove you a credible person here ... we can't sit here and promise you a hope or give you a hint that you're going to get out .... But we want people to be honest with us, and tell us the truth about stuff.\" After being asked again when he started selling, Budhani responded, \"I just started maybe month, couple month, okay. That's the most you know. The longest .... Longest, maybe now a couple months.\" Investigators told Budhani that if he said he had \"been doing that for six months[,] if that's what the truth is then tell us. We're not giving you more charges ... I'm not going to charge with it.\" Budhani then claimed that he had been selling \"[j]ust a month, month and a half .... Most longest was two months maybe.\" The investigators, apparently unsatisfied with that answer, ended the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Budhani was thereafter indicted for three counts of unlawful sale of a Schedule I Controlled Substance, XLR11, in violation of OCGA \u00a7 16-13-30 (b), and one count of unlawful possession of a Schedule I Controlled Substance with the intent to distribute in violation of OCGA \u00a7 16-13-30 (b). At trial, the State played video recordings of the three controlled buys and the video recording of the interview for the jury. The parties stipulated that the contents of the seized packets were submitted to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) for scientific evaluation, and that a GBI expert in forensic chemistry found that each packet contained a substance identified as XLR11. Investigators and the confidential informant testified at trial and identified Budhani as the person who sold XLR11 to the informant on the dates of the controlled buys as alleged and as depicted in\n   the video recordings. The jury found Budhani guilty of all four counts for which he was indicted. Budhani appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed his convictions.\n   <em>\n    Budhani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=345%20Ga.%20App.%2034\">\n    345 Ga.

As described above, the indictment alleged in three counts that Budhani did \"unlawfully sell [1-(5-fluoropentyl)indole-3yl]-(2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclo-propyl) methanone (XLR11), a Schedule I Controlled Substance, in violation of OCGA \u00a7 16-13-30 (b)\" and in one count that he \"did unlawfully possess with the intent to distribute [1-(5-fluoropentyl)indole-3yl]-(2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclo-propyl) methanone (XLR11), a Schedule I Controlled Substance, in violation of OCGA \u00a7 16-13-30 (b).\" Each of these four counts cited and tracked the\n    language of the relevant statute, OCGA \u00a7 16-13-30 (b). They also identified XLR11-by both its common and scientific names listed in former OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 (12) (N) -as the \"Schedule I Controlled Substance\" that Budhani unlawfully possessed and sold.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The indictment withstands a general demurrer and satisfies due process here because it alleges the essential elements of the offenses-that Budhani sold, or possessed with intent to distribute, a specific Schedule I controlled substance-under OCGA \u00a7 16-13-30 (b), and put Budhani \"on notice of the crimes with which he is charged and against which he must defend.\"\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461299\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/301/137/#p139\">\n     301 Ga. at 141\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461299\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/301/137/#p139\">\n     800 S.E.2d 356\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Put simply, if Budhani admitted to the allegations contained in each of the four counts of the indictment, \"the admission of the facts alleged would lead necessarily to the conclusion that the accused is guilty of a crime.\"\n    <em>\n     Kimbrough\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453851\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/300/878/#p880\">\n     300 Ga. at 880\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453851\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/300/878/#p880\">\n     799 S.E.2d 229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That is because Budhani would have to admit to \"sell[ing]\" or \"possess[ing] with intent to distribute [XLR11], a Schedule I Controlled Substanc[e], in violation of O.C.G.A 16-13-30 (b),\" and XLR11 was, at the relevant time, included in OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 as a Schedule I controlled substance. See former OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 (12) (N).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Budhani contends this is not so, because it is not illegal to possess or sell XLR11 in all circumstances. Arguing that the three exceptions contained in OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 (12) are themselves \"material element[s]\" of the charged offenses, and that the State must allege in the indictment that the exceptions do not apply, Budhani contends that the indictment is void here because the State did not allege that the XLR11 at issue was \"intended for human consumption.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    But a plain reading of the indictment, particularly against the statutory backdrop of OCGA \u00a7\u00a7 16-13-25 and 16-13-30 (b), shows that Budhani's argument fails. To begin, OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 creates a default presumption that the controlled substances listed in subsection 12 \"are included in Schedule I.\" Thus, by specifically naming in the indictment a substance listed in former OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 (12) (N), and by alleging that it is \"a Schedule I Controlled Substance,\" the indictment necessarily alleges that Budhani possessed and sold a Schedule I controlled substance to which an exception to OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 (12) did not apply. Indeed, if an exception to OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 (12)\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    apply, then the \"unless\" clause in OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 (12) would exempt the substance from the list of controlled substances \"included in Schedule I.\" See OCGA \u00a7 16-13-25 (12) (\"The controlled substances listed in this Code section are included in Schedule I: ... Any of the following ...\n    <em>\n     unless\n    </em>\n    specifically utilized as part of the manufacturing process by a commercial industry of a substance or material not intended for human ingestion or consumption, as a prescription administered under medical supervision, or research at\n    a recognized institution.\") (emphasis supplied). Because the indictment specifically named XLR11 and characterized it as a Schedule I controlled substance, Budhani cannot admit to the allegations in the indictment and be\n    innocent of the crimes for which he was charged.

Budhani argues that our holding in\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n    controls here, but that\n    <em>\n     Sosniak\n    </em>\n    is not incompatible with\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n    because the promise of no additional charges in\n    <em>\n     Sosniak\n    </em>\n    , unlike the promises made here and in\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n    , pertained to charges that did not \"relate to, or have a nexus to, the charge under investigation.\" The State, for its part, argues that\n    <em>\n     Sosniak\n    </em>\n    controls and is not incompatible with\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n    because the investigators here, like the detective in\n    <em>\n     Sosniak\n    </em>\n    , \"never promised Appellant that he would receive a lesser punishment or no punishment at all for the charges he was facing.\" And in any event, the State argues, the investigator's promise here did not induce the statements Budhani sought to suppress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    As an initial matter, we reject the State's argument that\n    <em>\n     Sosniak\n    </em>\n    controls the facts of this case. Although investigators made a number of statements during Budhani's recorded interview that did\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    provide a hope of benefit, we cannot say that investigators' comments such as \"there aren't anymore charges .... What you're charged with now .... Is what you're charged with ... I'm not going back and charging you\" were anything other than a promise not to bring additional charges-and thus a hope of benefit-if Budhani gave police information about how long he had been selling XLR11. And that information was important, because at the time investigators promised no additional charges, Budhani had admitted to selling XLR11 for at most one month-a length of time that would have covered the third controlled buy, but not the first two.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    But we also decline to adopt Budhani's reading of\n    <em>\n     Sosniak\n    </em>\n    , which characterizes the promise of \"no further charges\" on a potential drug-related crime as unrelated to the murder charge for which the defendant was being investigated. Indeed, that interpretation of\n    <em>\n     Sosniak\n    </em>\n    ignores our acknowledgement that the potential drug offenses for which \"no further charges\" were offered related to the defendant's\n    \"activities leading up to the time of the crimes\" for which the defendant was charged.\n    <em>\n     Sosniak\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3636395\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/287/279/#p287\">\n     287 Ga. at 287\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3636395\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/287/279/#p287\">\n     695 S.E.2d 604\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    In sum, we are not convinced by either party's argument.

Indeed, the record authorizes the conclusion that just as Foster made statements to police \"in the hope of receiving no punishment for crimes related to his possession of the weapon,\"\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3631565\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/283/484/#p488\">\n     283 Ga. at 488\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3631565\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/283/484/#p488\">\n     660 S.E.2d 521\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , Budhani made\n    statements to police in the hope of minimizing his exposure to further drug charges. Thus, to the extent\n    <em>\n     Sosniak\n    </em>\n    can be read as contravening the rule we announced in\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n    -including to the extent it can be read for the proposition that a promise of no additional charges does not constitute a hope of benefit if the charges do not directly relate to the crimes for which the defendant has already been charged-it is hereby disapproved.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    We therefore conclude that, under the totality of the circumstances here, promises made by law enforcement to bring no additional charges against Budhani constituted an impermissible hope of benefit under OCGA \u00a7 24-8-824. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals, much like the trial court, erred by characterizing the investigators' recorded statements as \"simply [telling Budhani] that [police] would not charge him with additional crimes\" in a manner that could not violate OCGA \u00a7 24-8-824.\n    <em>\n     Budhani\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=345%20Ga.%20App.%2034\">\n     345 Ga.

Therefore, although we disagree with the Court of Appeals', and the trial court's, failure to acknowledge that the promise of \"additional charges\" can constitute \"hope of benefit\" under OCGA \u00a7 24-8-824, we conclude that any error the trial court made by admitting the portions of Budhani's recorded, custodial interview after investigators' promises of no additional charges was harmless.

Thus, even apart from Budhani's arguments about investigators' statements\n     <em>\n      during\n     </em>\n     his recorded interview, he also argued that investigators' various promises of no charges and a lesser sentence\n     <em>\n      before\n     </em>\n     the recorded interview amounted to an impermissible hope of benefit and that his statements to police should be suppressed under OCGA \u00a7 24-8-824. With respect to the statements investigators allegedly made to Budhani before his recorded interview, the trial court credited testimony from two police officers that they did not discuss the case with Budhani until the recorded interview and discredited Budhani's testimony to the contrary. The Court of Appeals later reviewed and upheld that ruling.\n     <em>\n      Budhani,\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=345%20Ga.%20App.%2034\">\n      345 Ga.

We therefore accept the trial court's factual finding that \"there is no evidence to corroborate the allegations made by [Budhani] that he was questioned before the audio recordings began and officers made promises that induced hope of benefit\" and review only the statements made during Budhani's recorded interview.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-55\">\n     The new Evidence Code carried forward former OCGA \u00a7 24-3-50 as OCGA \u00a7 24-8-824 without any substantive change, and that Code section does not have a federal counterpart.
