Subdivision (f) of this statute provides that if the insurer and the insured cannot agree whether the insured is legally entitled to recover damages from an uninsured motorist and the amount of such damages, those issues shall be determined by arbitration. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">We granted review in these consolidated cases to decide two related issues. The insurer in <em>Bouton </em>v. <em>USAA Casualty Insurance Company </em>opposed a demand for arbitration on the ground that the claimant was not covered by the insurance policy. We held in <em>Van Tassel v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 624, 627 [116 Cal.Rptr. 505, 526 P.2d 969] <em>(Van Tassel) </em>that \u201cjurisdictional facts,\u201d such as whether a claimant is insured under an uninsured motorist provision, are subject to arbitration. But we retreated from this holding the next year, saying in <em>Freeman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 473, 485 [121 Cal.Rptr. 477, 535 P.2d 341] <em>(Freeman), </em>that we \u201cloosely and unfortunately\u201d termed the issue in <em>Van Tassel </em>\u201cjurisdictional.\u201d We explained in <em>Freeman </em>that Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f), \u201cread literally, requires arbitration of two issues only: (1) whether the insured is entitled to recover against the uninsured motorist and (2) if so, the amount of the damages.\u201d <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 480.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">We conclude that our holding in <em>Van Tassel </em>cannot be reconciled with our subsequent holding in <em>Freeman </em>and must be overruled. Determining whether a claimant is insured under an uninsured motorist provision is not a question of the underinsured tortfeasor\u2019s liability or damages owed to the insured, and is therefore not subject to arbitration under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number><em>O\u2019Hanesian v. State Farm Mutual Insurance Company </em>raises the related question whether an arbitrator or a court should decide if a default judgment obtained by the insured against the underinsured tortfeasor binds the insurer. We conclude that this issue is subject to arbitration, because Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f) requires an insured and his or her insurer to arbitrate the tortfeasor\u2019s liability and damages owed to the insured, and the binding nature of a default judgment obtained against that tortfeasor falls squarely within those questions of liability and damages statutorily subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">\n<em>Bouton v. USAA Casualty Insurance Company</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">Plaintiff Lloyd Bouton was injured in an automobile accident, and settled his claim against Kevin Daniels, the driver of the other vehicle, for Daniels\u2019s automobile insurance policy limit of $15,000. Bouton formally demanded arbitration with defendant USAA Casualty Insurance Company, his sister\u2019s insurer, seeking damages exceeding the $15,000 policy limit payment he received from Daniels\u2019s insurer. USAA denied coverage, claiming that Bouton was not a resident of his sister\u2019s household, and was therefore not covered under her insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">Consistent with Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the policy\u2019s underinsured motorist<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provision defines a \u201ccovered person\u201d as the named insured \u201cor any family member.\u201d The policy defines a \u201cfamily member\u201d as \u201ca person related to [the named insured] by blood, marriage, or adoption who is a resident of [the named insured\u2019s] household.\u201d Bouton contends that he constituted a family member of the named insured, his sister, Samela Bouton, because they were blood relatives permanently residing in the same household. The underinsured motorist provision of the policy provided that USAA would \u201cpay compensatory damages which a covered person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an . . . underinsured motor vehicle because of [bodily injury] sustained by a covered person and caused by an auto accident.\u201d Consistent with section 11580.2, subdivision (p)(3), the policy provided that no payment would be made until \u201cthe limits of liability under any applicable motor vehicle bodily injury liability bonds or policies have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements, and proof of such is submitted to [USAA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>The underinsured motorist provision of the policy contained an arbitration agreement, which stated: \u201cIf [USAA] and a covered person disagree as to: [][] 1. Whether a covered person is legally entitled to recover [bodily injury] or [property damage] damages from the owner or operator of an . . . underinsured motor vehicle; or [][] 2. The amount of [bodily injury] damages that the covered person is legally entitled to collect from that owner; [\u2018\u00a1Q then, that disagreement shall be arbitrated .... This arbitration shall be limited to the two aforementioned factual issues and shall not address any other issues, including but not limited to, coverage questions. Any arbitration finding that goes beyond the two aforementioned factual issues shall be voidable by [USAA] or a covered person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">USAA opposed Bouton\u2019s demand for arbitration, arguing that Bouton was not covered under his sister\u2019s policy, The trial court denied Bouton\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, finding that because the arbitration provision of the insurance policy was no broader than section 11580.2, subdivision (f), the parties were only bound to arbitrate the issues of liability and damages, not coverage. Bouton appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to compel arbitration. The Court of Appeal held that the trial court erred in denying Bouton\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, and that the parties were required to arbitrate coverage as part of their agreement to arbitrate the liability and damages issues, consistent with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Van Tassel. </em>USAA sought review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">\n<em>O\u2019Hanesian v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">Plaintiff Charles Michael O\u2019Hanesian was insured by defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company under a general insurance policy with a $100,000 limit for bodily injury, and under an umbrella policy with a $1 million limit for bodily injury. The underinsured motorist provision of the policies covered \u201cdamages for bodily injury an insured is legally entitled to collect from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d Following an accident, the policies required that the insured provide \u201call the details about the death, injury, treatment and other information\u201d necessary to \u201cdetermine the amount payable,\u201d and \u201cbe examined by physicians chosen and paid by\u201d the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">The policies contained an arbitration provision as required by section 11580.2, subdivision (f), which stated: \u201cTwo questions must be decided by agreement between the insured and us: [][] 1. Is the insured legally entitled to collect damages from the owner or driver of the uninsured motor vehicle; and [1] 2. If so, in what amount? [][] If there is no agreement, upon written request of the insured or us, these questions shall be decided by arbitration as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>provided by section 11580.2 of the California Insurance Code. ... [ft] We are not bound by any judgment against any person or organization obtained without our written consent.\u201d The term \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d was defined by the policy to include underinsured motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">Consistent with section 11580.2, subdivision (p)(3), the policies provided that \u201cif the damages are caused by an underinsured motor vehicle, there is no coverage until; [ft] 1. The limits of liability of all bodily injury liability bonds and policies that apply have been used up by payment of judgments or settlements to other persons; or [ft] 2. Such limits of liability or remaining part of them have been offered to the insured in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">O\u2019Hanesian was injured when his car was rear-ended by Curtis Gray Thurlow\u2019s car. O\u2019Hanesian filed an action against Thurlow, who failed to appear after being properly served by publication. O\u2019Hanesian submitted evidence at a bench trial regarding the extent of his injuries, and the court awarded him $2,751,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. O\u2019Hanesian made a demand on Thurlow\u2019s insurer, and received the policy limit of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">O\u2019Hanesian demanded payment of $900,000 from State Farm, the maximum benefit available under his underinsured motorist coverage. O\u2019Hanesian asserted that the default judgment entered against Thurlow conclusively established damages. State Farm refused to tender the requested payment, seeking instead to informally evaluate O\u2019Hanesian\u2019s damages prior to tendering any money under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">O\u2019Hanesian sued State Farm for declaratory relief, breach of contract, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, arguing that the default judgment obtained against Thurlow established his damages and he was not required to submit to State Farm\u2019s evaluation of the dispute. State Farm demurred to O\u2019Hanesian\u2019s complaint, arguing that it was not bound by the declaratory judgment against Thurlow, and that O\u2019Hanesian\u2019s action was premature because no arbitration had occurred as required by the policies and by section 11580.2, subdivision (f). The trial court granted State Farm\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action. O\u2019Hanesian appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">The Court of Appeal held that O\u2019Hanesian must arbitrate the issues of liability and damages with State Farm, and that the arbitrator is free to consider whether O\u2019Hanesian\u2019s default judgment against Thurlow conclusively established his damages. O\u2019Hanesian sought review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AuY\">We have interpreted the scope of section 11580.2, subdivision (f) on three occasions, explaining the types of issues that should be determined by arbitration. (See <em>Orpustan </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 988 [103 Cal.Rptr. 919, 500 P.2d 1119] (Orpustan); <em>Van Tassel, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 624; <em>Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 473.) Numerous Court of Appeal decisions similarly have examined the scope of arbitral issues under section 11580.2, subdivision (f). (See, e.g., <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1297 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 711] [whether insured could arbitrate issues of liability and damages under uninsured motorist provision of insurance policy where tortfeasor\u2019s insurer became insolvent more than one year following accident]; <em>Furlough v. Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 40 [249 Cal.Rptr. 703] [whether arbitration provision mirroring \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (f) permitted arbitration of the extent of coverage and amount insurer must pay, in addition to issues of liability and damages]; <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Jackson </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 111 [197 Cal.Rptr. 477] [whether issues of liability and damages arising out of a vehicle collision with a riderless horse were arbitrable].) Two common themes emerge from this line of cases: (1) arbitration of issues other than liability and damages is appropriate if the parties have contractually agreed to arbitrate more than is required by section 11580.2, subdivision (f); and, (2) only issues of liability and damages may be decided in an arbitral forum if the parties did not agree to arbitrate more than is required by section 11580.2, subdivision (f). <em>(Orpustan, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 991; <em>Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">In <em>Orpustan, </em>we held that whether the plaintiff had been injured by an uninsured vehicle within the meaning of section 11580.2 and the plaintiff\u2019s insurance policy should be determined by arbitration. The plaintiff in <em>Orpustan </em>was injured when he swerved to avoid hitting another vehicle, and his truck went off the highway. <em>(Orpustan, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 990.) The plaintiff filed a claim with his insurer, arguing that he had been involved in an accident with an uninsured vehicle. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Section 11580.2 defines an uninsured vehicle to include a hit-and-run vehicle causing bodily injury arising out of physical contact between the insured\u2019s vehicle and the hit-and-run vehicle. The plaintiff\u2019s insurer concluded that the accident did not involve physical contact with the hit-and-run vehicle, and denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The plaintiff then sought arbitration, and the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. <em>(Orpustan, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 990.) The defendant prevailed on its motion for summary judgment, arguing that the absence of the statutorily necessary physical contact between the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle and the hit-and-run vehicle precluded coverage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 991.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>The arbitration provision of the insurance policy contained the language mandated by section 11580.2, subdivision (f), and further stated that if the parties \u201c \u2018do not agree as to the amount payable hereunder,\u2019 \u201d the parties may demand arbitration. <em>(Orpustan, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 991.) We held that the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate the issue of \u201cwhether the insured \u2018is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile\u2019 \u201d was sufficiently broad to encompass arbitration of whether the hit-and-run vehicle was an uninsured vehicle within the meaning of the statute and the plaintiff\u2019s policy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 991-992.) We reasoned that requiring a court to decide \u201cjurisdictional facts\u201d when the parties had agreed to arbitrate the questions in dispute would transform a procedure intended to result in prompt resolution \u201c \u2018into one carrying all the burdens and delays of civil litigation, overlaid by jurisdictional uncertainty between successive tribunals.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 992, quoting <em>Felner </em>v. <em>Meritplan Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 540, 546 [86 Cal.Rptr. 178].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">Relying on this rationale, we held in <em>Van Tassel </em>that \u201c[u]nder the statute and the provisions for arbitration contained in an uninsured motorist provision such as that in the present case, . . . jurisdictional facts, including the status of the claimant as an insured, are subject to determination by the arbitrator.\u201d <em>(Van Tassel, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 627.) In <em>Van Tassel, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s daughter was killed in an accident involving an uninsured vehicle. Consistent with section 11580.2, subdivision (b), the plaintiff\u2019s husband\u2019s insurance policy provided that an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy included the spouse and relatives of the named insured while residing in the same household as the named insured. <em>(Van Tassel, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 625.) The arbitration provision of the insurance policy provided that \u201c \u2018whether the insured is legally entitled to recover . . . damages, and (if so entitled) the amount thereof, shall be made ... in the event of disagreement, by arbitration ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 626, italics omitted.) There was a factual dispute about whether the plaintiff\u2019s deceased daughter had been a resident of the plaintiff\u2019s household and was therefore covered under the insurance policy. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We held that whether a claimant constituted a covered person under the uninsured motorist policy was a \u201cjurisdictional fact\u201d to be resolved by arbitration. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 627.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Less than one year later, we were again called upon to consider the appropriate forum for the resolution of \u201cjurisdictional facts.\u201d <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 473.) In <em>Freeman, </em>the insured plaintiff was involved in a three-car accident. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 478.) The plaintiff was hit by a vehicle, and the driver of that vehicle testified that he had been hit by a convertible, which had forced him to collide with the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle. Within one year of the accident, the plaintiff filed a civil action against the driver of the vehicle that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>had collided with his car, and against several \u201cDoe\u201d defendants. After a jury trial, a judgment was issued in favor of the defendant who had hit the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nearly three years after filing his civil action, the plaintiff demanded arbitration under the uninsured motorist provision of his insurance policy, and filed a motion to compel arbitration. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 479.) The plaintiff\u2019s insurance policy contained an arbitration provision as required by section 11580.2, subdivision (f). <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 478.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">Section 11580.2, subdivision (i) then required that, within one year following an injury, an insured had to agree with his or her insurer as to the amount due under the policy, formally demand arbitration, or commence litigation against an uninsured motorist. Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 governs a trial court\u2019s discretion to order arbitration, and provides that if a valid written arbitration agreement exists and one party refuses to arbitrate, the court must order the parties to arbitrate the dispute unless the petitioner forfeited the right to compel arbitration. The issue in <em>Freeman </em>was whether the trial court was entitled to consider the forfeiture/statute of limitations issue, or whether an arbitrator should decide whether the plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel arbitration was time-barred and his right to arbitration therefore forfeited. <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">We held that \u201c[t]he issue of whether the right to compel arbitration has been waived by failure to comply with the [former] one-year [statute of] limitation is clearly one for the determination of the court pursuant to the provisions of section 1281.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 485.) Preliminarily, we noted that Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 requires a court to examine an arbitration agreement to determine whether there is a duty to arbitrate the controversy. <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 480.) We concluded that section 11580.2, subdivision (f) requires the parties to arbitrate the narrow issues of whether the insured is entitled to recover damages from the uninsured or underinsured motorist, and if so, the amount of those damages. <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 480.) We acknowledged the strong public policy favoring arbitration, but stated that \u201cthere is no policy compelling persons to accept arbitration of controversies which they have not agreed to arbitrate and which no statute has made arbitrable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">We distinguished our earlier holding in <em>Orpustan, </em>concluding that the holding permitting arbitration in that case was \u201cbased upon the language of the insurance policy\u201d and was consistent with prior Court of Appeal decisions regarding the physical contact rule. <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 482.) However, we noted that <em>Orpustan </em>contained broad language regarding \u201cjurisdictional facts,\u201d which we subsequently relied upon in <em>Van Tassel </em>to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>that the issue of whether an insured was covered by an uninsured motorist policy was arbitrable. <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 482.) \u201cUnfortunately, our holding [in Orpustan] was stated in language whose breadth was an invitation to misinterpretation .... We here must correct that misinterpretation.\u201d <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\"><em>Freeman </em>clarified the concept of \u201cjurisdictional facts,\u201d reasoning that the statute of limitations issue, \u201cas opposed to others which we loosely and unfortunately termed \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 in <em>Orpustan </em>and in our later <em>Van Tassel </em>decision, is logically and legally prior to any consideration by the arbitrator of those other issues which, in the circumstances of the particular case, are a part of \u2018the entirety of the controversy\u2019 and whose determination may have the effect of precluding him from reaching the merits of the dispute. It was in this latter sense that we used the term \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 in describing those other issues\u2014i.e., in the sense that the arbitrator\u2019s consideration of the merits of the controversy must await his determination of them. In using this terminology, however, we in no way intended to indicate that the prior issue of waiver of the right to compel arbitration, which under the relevant statutes and the long line of decisions we have adverted to is a matter for the determination of the court upon a motion to compel arbitration, was to be swept along with those other issues into the area of arbitrative determination. While as we indicated in <em>Orpustan </em>and <em>Van Tassel </em>we favor full and complete determination by the arbitrator of matters properly submitted to him, we cannot allow our enthusiasm for the expeditious and economical disposition of such matters to intrude upon our responsibility to determine whether the right to compel arbitration has been waived through failure to seek it in a timely manner.\u201d <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at pp. 485-486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">Our holding in <em>Freeman </em>cannot be harmonized with our earlier holding in <em>Van Tassel. </em>In <em>Van Tassel, </em>we relied on the broad language in <em>Orpustan </em>to conclude that whether an individual was covered under her stepfather\u2019s insurance policy constituted a \u201cjurisdictional fact\u201d to be arbitrated despite the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate only whether an uninsured motorist was liable to the insured, and the extent of the damages, if any. <em>(Van Tassel, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at pp. 625, 627.) We indicated in <em>Freeman </em>that our holding in <em>Orpustan </em>\u201cwas an invitation to misinterpretation,\u201d but we did not expressly overrule <em>Van Tassel\u2019s </em>overly broad interpretation of the <em>Orpustan </em>decision. <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 485.) We do so now. To the extent that <em>Van Tassel </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 624, 627 improperly permitted an arbitrator to determine issues other than liability and damages\u2014the issues mandated by section 11580.2, subdivision (f) to be arbitrable, and the only issues the parties agreed to arbitrate\u2014it is overruled. (See <em>Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>We recognize that the Court of Appeal in <em>Bouton </em>was bound by <em>Van Tassel-, </em>its holding therefore necessarily applied the broad language of <em>Orpustan </em>to the parties\u2019 narrow arbitration agreement, requiring an arbitrator to determine whether Bouton was covered under his sister\u2019s insurance policy. We, of course, are not similarly bound, and hold, consistent with our decision in <em>Freeman, </em>that section 11580.2, subdivision (f), \u201cread literally, requires arbitration of two issues only: (1) whether the insured is entitled to recover against the uninsured motorist and (2) if so, the amount of the damages.\u201d <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 480.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Applying this rule to the <em>Bouton </em>controversy, we hold that a court, not an arbitrator, must determine whether Bouton is insured under his sister\u2019s policy. Whether Bouton is a covered person under the insurance policy is not a question regarding the underinsured tortfeasor\u2019s liability to the insured, or the amount of damages. Questions of coverage\u2014that is, whether the claimant is insured and therefore entitled to take advantage of the protection provided by the policy at issue\u2014must be resolved before an arbitrator reaches the two arbitrable questions pursuant to section 11580.2, subdivision (f). Here, the policy acknowledges as much, providing that \u201carbitration . . . shall not address any other issues, including but not limited to, coverage questions.\u201d Coverage questions fall outside of the two issues necessarily arbitrable under section 11580.2, subdivision (f), and must therefore be decided by a court, not an arbitrator, if the parties have not agreed to arbitrate more than the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Applying this rule to the <em>O\u2019Hanesian </em>controversy, we hold that it is for an arbitrator, and not a court, to decide whether the default judgment O\u2019Hanesian obtained against the underinsured tortfeasor binds State Farm. As previously explained, O\u2019Hanesian submitted evidence regarding the extent of his injuries arising out of his accident with an underinsured motorist at a bench trial, and the court awarded him $2,751,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. The judgment pertains directly to the underinsured tortfeasor\u2019s liability to the insured, and the amount of damages owed to the insured. The parties agreed to arbitrate, consistent with section 11580.2, subdivision (f), whether \u201cthe insured [is] legally entitled to collect damages from the owner or driver of the uninsured motor vehicle; and . . . [i]f so, in what amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">The parties do not and cannot dispute that the policy and section 11580.2, subdivision (f) provide that arbitration is the appropriate forum in which to address whether the underinsured tortfeasor is liable to O\u2019Hanesian for the injuries he sustained in the automobile accident between the two, and, if so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>the amount of damages. The parties dispute that arbitration is the appropriate forum in which to address whether State Farm is bound by the default judgment obtained against the underinsured tortfeasor. However, that question\u2014whether State Farm is bound\u2014is subsumed within the arbitrable issues of liability and damages. The entire controversy\u2014whether O\u2019Hanesian is entitled to damages arising out of his accident with the underinsured tortfeasor, and the amount thereof\u2014is arbitrable. Whether the default judgment binds State Farm is a part of the controversy between the parties regarding liability and damages, and must be resolved by the arbitrator in the course of addressing the two statutorily mandated arbitrable issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">An unusual feature of the <em>O\u2019Hanesian </em>controversy is that both State Farm and O\u2019Hanesian disagree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding that arbitration is appropriate to determine whether State Farm is bound by the default judgment obtained against the underinsured tortfeasor. O\u2019Hanesian argues that a court should interpret an insurance contract and section 11580.2, that he did not agree to have this issue arbitrated, that having a court decide this significant issue of statewide importance would promote uniformity of decisions, and that it would be impractical to require him to engage in costly discovery only to have an arbitrator conclude that State Farm is bound by the default judgment obtained against the tortfeasor. Along similar lines, State Farm also argues that a court should determine whether State Farm is bound by the default judgment because the parties did not agree to arbitrate this issue, that a court decision will promote uniformity and consistency of decisions, and that the default judgment against the tortfeasor does not bind State Farm as a matter of law. O\u2019Hanesian essentially argues that a court will conclude that State Farm is bound by the default judgment, obviating the need for arbitration, while State Farm argues that a court will conclude State Farm cannot be bound by the default judgment, necessitating arbitration to assess whether O\u2019Hanesian is entitled to damages, and, if so, in what amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">It is certainly true, as O\u2019Hanesian and State Farm argue, that parties cannot be compelled to arbitrate a dispute if they have not agreed to do so, and no statute compels them to arbitrate. <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 481.) Indeed, a trial court has no power to order parties to arbitrate a dispute that they did not agree to arbitrate. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.2.) However, State Farm and O\u2019Hanesian did agree\u2014as section 11580.2, subdivision (f) requires\u2014to arbitrate \u201cwhether the insured is entitled to recover against the uninsured motorist and ... if so, the amount of the damages.\u201d <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 480.) As discussed above, the effect of the default judgment is an issue the arbitrator necessarily will address in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>resolving the arbitrable controversy concerning the tortfeasor\u2019s liability to the insured, and the amount of damages. Accordingly, the parties\u2019 argument that they did not agree to arbitrate whether State Farm is bound by the default judgment O\u2019Hanesian obtained against the tortfeasor is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">State Farm and O\u2019Hanesian both also argue that permitting an arbitrator to determine whether the default judgment obtained against the underinsured motorist binds State Farm does not promote uniformity of decisions because arbitrators are free to \u201c \u2018base their decision upon broad principles of justice and equity, and in doing so may expressly or impliedly reject a claim that a party might successfully have asserted in a judicial action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moncharsh </em>v. <em>Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 10-11 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899].) This concern, however, must be balanced against the statutory requirement to arbitrate disputes between insureds and insurers concerning the damages an insured is entitled to recover based on an injury suffered as a result of an accident with an uninsured or underinsured motorist. (See \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (f); <em>Quintano </em>v. <em>Mercury Casualty Co. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1049, 1053 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 906 P.2d 1057] [\u201cThe provisions of [section 11580.2] are deemed part of every uninsured and underinsured motorist policy.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">Concerns about uniformity must also be balanced against the strong public policy favoring arbitration of disputes when the parties so agree. The \u201cLegislature has expressed a \u2018strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.\u2019 [Citations.] . . . Indeed, more than 70 years ago this court explained: \u2018The policy of the law in recognizing arbitration agreements and in providing by statute for their enforcement is to encourage persons who wish to avoid delays incident to a civil action to obtain an adjustment of their differences by a tribunal of their own choosing.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Typically, those who enter into arbitration agreements expect that their dispute will be resolved without necessity for any contact with the courts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Moncharsh v. Heily &amp; Blase, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">Finally, O\u2019Hanesian argues that the default judgment obtained against the underinsured tortfeasor binds State Farm at least with respect to O\u2019Hanesian\u2019s umbrella policy, if not his general liability policy. O\u2019Hanesian\u2019s argument is unavailing. The umbrella policy stated that \u201c[t]his coverage will apply in accordance with the terms and conditions of [O\u2019Hanesian\u2019s] underlying Uninsured Motorist Coverage.\u201d The uninsured motorist policy included an arbitration section pursuant to 11580.2, subdivision (f). Thus, under both policies, O\u2019Hanesian and State Farm must arbitrate all disputes concerning liability and damages arising out of an accident between O\u2019Hanesian and an underinsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <em>Bouton v.
