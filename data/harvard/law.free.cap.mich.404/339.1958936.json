Three issues are raised by plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">1) Whether the conduct of defendants\u2019 counsel, in interjecting improper innuendos of a conspiracy between plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and expert witnesses to render untrue and collusive testimony, deprived plaintiffs of a fair trial and required granting of a mistrial or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">2) Whether the sudden interruption of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s closing argument by someone seeking emergency medical attention from defendant physicians, and the subsequent viewing by some of the jurors of defendant physicians\u2019 administering medical treatment to a woman lying on the floor of a nearby courtroom resulted in denial to plaintiffs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>a fair trial and required the granting of a mistrial or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">3) Whether the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury that defendant hospital was negligent as a matter of law in allowing an intern, not licensed to practice medicine in Michigan, to provide medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The Court of Appeals answered these questions in the negative and affirmed the jury verdict of no cause of action. We disagree on the first issue and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Plaintiffs in this medical malpractice case are the parents and guardian of a now permanently and irreversibly brain-damaged child, Kyle Kern. Defendants are the hospital and physicians who took part in the child\u2019s care when he was brought to them for diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">On August 14, 1969, Kyle, whose age was then 14 months, became sick at his stomach and began to vomit. The child\u2019s father came home from work around 6 p.m., and his mother called defendant firm of pediatricians. One of the firm\u2019s physician employees advised Mrs. Kern to take the child to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">At the hospital emergency room the child was examined by defendant Dr. James Adams, a medical school graduate who had just begun his internship in July of 1969. Dr. Adams took a history of the child which indicated that the child had been vomiting repeatedly with the vomitus becoming greenish. Dr. Adams performed an examination of the child and concluded that the child had gastroenteritis, an irritation of the stomach and intestines. The child was given a Compazine supposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>tory and prescribed a light diet of skim milk and baby aspirin every four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Mr. and Mrs. Kern took their child home, and the child slept in their room throughout the night. When Mr. Kern got up and went to work at 7 a.m. on the following day, the child was still sleeping. However, at 11 a.m., after being fed some skim milk, the child began vomiting again. Mrs. Kern called defendant firm of pediatricians and received further dietary instructions. In a later call, made after the child could not keep down either skim milk or cola, Mrs. Kern was told to bring the child to the pediatricians\u2019 office. He was there examined by defendant Dr. Jarvi and defendant Dr. Heaven-rich. A mass seemed to be present in the child\u2019s abdomen, and a possible bowel blockage by intussusception<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was diagnosed. Arrangements were then made for the child\u2019s immediate admission to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">At the time of admission, the admitting intern, Dr. James O\u2019Brien, had a telephone consultation with Dr. Jarvi and sent Kyle to St. Luke\u2019s Department of Radiology for a barium enema. The barium enema and X-rays were done by defendant Dr. Caumartin. Dr. Caumartin felt an abdominal mass before the barium enema but could not detect a mass afterwards. The X-rays and barium enema did not indicate an intussusception or bowel blockage, although Dr. Caumartin saw a small rounded shadow which he perceived to be a polyp.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Caumartin reported these findings by telephone to Dr. Jarvi.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>On the evening of August 15, 1969, Dr. Jarvi visited Kyle in the hospital and brought in defendant Dr. Rice, a surgeon, to join in the child\u2019s care. Dr. Rice felt a round mass in the child\u2019s abdomen and recommended that the barium enema be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">On the following morning, Saturday, August 16, 1969, Dr. Rice found that the barium enema had not been repeated, but due to what he perceived to be the child\u2019s improved condition, he no longer thought it was necessary. However, Mr. and Mrs. Kern testified that they were at the hospital from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday and that the child was listless, sick, and vomiting. Kyle\u2019s parents further testified that during this eight-hour period, their son was not seen by a physician. Dr. Rice indicated that he thought he saw the child on Saturday night, when he performed an appendectomy at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, but the hospital\u2019s operating room records showed that no such surgery was performed on the evening of August 16, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">On Sunday morning, Kyle\u2019s condition became worse, and at noon Dr. Rice operated. He found a bowel blockage by intussusception with about six inches of intestine gangrenous, which he removed and then rejoined the bowel. Kyle\u2019s postoperative recovery appeared to be normal, and his parents went home, but were called back when the child\u2019s temperature became extremely high due to the gangrene. As a result, Kyle suffered permanent and irreversible brain damage and is now totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Plaintiffs filed suit against defendants claiming that defendants were negligent in not diagnosing and treating Kyle in a timely manner and that such negligence was the cause of Kyle\u2019s permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and irreversible brain damage. During the trial, which lasted from May 29, 1974 to June 26, 1974, plaintiffs introduced testimony of two physicians from Philadelphia and one physician from New York to support their claim that defendants failed to diagnose and treat the bowel blockage in a timely manner. A fourth physician, Dr. Feltoon, assisted plaintiffs in the preparation of the case, but was not called as a witness. Defendants\u2019 experts, who were from Saginaw, Midland and Detroit, testified that there was no negligence in the diagnosis and treatment. The jury returned a verdict of no cause of action. On September 17, 1974, the trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed on August 25, 1976 (unpublished per curiam, Docket No. 21789). Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on April 29, 1977. 399 Mich 893 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">II. Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Plaintiffs argue that they were denied a fair trial by the conduct of defendants\u2019 counsel in interjecting improper innuendos, not based in the evidence, of a conspiracy between plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and expert witnesses to render untrue and collusive testimony. The Court of Appeals held that in view of the length of the trial and the volume of the record (almost 2,500 pages), the remarks about which plaintiffs complain did not constitute reversible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Throughout the trial defendants\u2019 counsel attempted to show that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and plaintiffs\u2019 medical advisor, Dr. Feltoon, had conspired with three out-of-state physicians to provide \"bought and paid for\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Defendants\u2019 counsel repetitively probed for evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>dence of a conspiracy to render untrue and collusive testimony during cross-examination of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, but were unable to elicit any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">On May 31, 1974, the third day of the trial, plaintiffs called the first of their three medical experts, Dr. Kaplan, a neurologist from New York City. On cross-examination, Dr. Kaplan was questioned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Is this the first time you had met Mr. Dean was a conference in New York?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\"><em>\"Q. </em>How did Mr. Dean happen to come to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\"A. Originally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">\"A. I have no idea, I think you better ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>I would like to ask you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">\"A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-13\"><em>\"Q. </em>Did you inquire of him out of all the neurologists in the world he happened to walk into your office in New York City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-14\"><em>\u2019\u2019A. </em>I did ask him \u2014 I may have asked him, I don\u2019t recall. Sometime ago. I will say this, that I have seen over the past 25 years a large number of problems that have medical-legal aspects in terms of injuries to the nervous system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-15\">\"I am a consultant for the City of New York in this kind of problem although I don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-16\"><em>\"Q. </em>We will get into your medical-legal experience, Doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-17\">\"Did anyone else contact you before Mr. Dejan contacted you to arrange this conference with Mr. Dean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-18\">\"A. Not that I recall, not that I recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-19\">\"Q. Did Mr. Dean call you personally to ask for an appointment or did he merely call your nurse or receptionist and ask for an appointment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-20\">\"A. I don\u2019t recall that. I think perhaps most likely he spoke to me initially to discuss the case and problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>and whether I would be willing to review the medical records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">\"That is usually what might happen. This is not the first time I reviewed medical records of problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\"I think thereafter on the basis of my review of the medical records arrangements were made to examine the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Do you know when you had this conference with Mr. Dean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\"><em>\"A. </em>I don\u2019t recall the exact date, I don\u2019t have it here, but within the last two or three months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\"><em>\"Q. </em>Is the first time you had a conference with Mr. Dean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\"A. A physical confrontation, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\"><em>\"Q. </em>Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">\"A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Have you talked to any other medical personnel . about this case before meeting with Mr. Dean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-13\">\"A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-14\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>I notice you discussing something with a gentleman in the back, do you know who that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-15\">\"A. Dr. Feltoon. I met him last night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-16\"><em>\"Q. </em>Dr. Feltoon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-17\">\"A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-18\"><em>\"Q. </em>You did not know Dr. Feltoon before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-19\">\"A. Before last evening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-20\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Last night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-21\">\"A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-22\">\"Q. Did you stay in one of the local motels?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-23\">\"A. I did, at the Holiday Inn East, I think it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-24\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Dr. Feltoon stayed at that motel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-25\">\"A. I believe so, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-26\">After detailed questioning about the amount of testimony Dr. Kaplan had provided in malpractice cases and his experience in medical-legal matters, defense counsel returned to the subject as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-27\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Doctor, once again, you have no idea how Mr. Dean happened to contact you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>\"A. </em>No, I don\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">On the next day of trial, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, anticipating a continuation of this defense strategy, sought to confine defense counsel to proper impeachment questions and moved in chambers that \"counsel for the defense be instructed not to ask irrelevant and immaterial questions regarding the relationship of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses, namely Dr. Chodoff and Dr. Edeiken, as to any \u2014 in such a way as to reflect any impropriety or conspiracy or improper actions; that Dr. Feltoon is not going to be with us <em>[sic, </em>a witness] in this case\u201d. The court reserved ruling on this objection and allowed defendants\u2019 counsel to continue along their line of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">On the same day plaintiffs presented the testimony of Dr. Chodoff, a general surgeon from Philadelphia. On cross-examination defense counsel continued their inquiry as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\"><em>\"Q. </em>Doctor, when did you first receive notification of this lawsuit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\"><em>\u201dA. </em>Couple years ago, I don\u2019t remember the exact date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>How did you become aware of this lawsuit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">\"A. Frankly, I do not remember now, it has been so long ago, I think Mr. Dean contacted me but I am not 100 percent certain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>How did it happen Mr. Dean contacted you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">'The <em>Court: </em>If you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">\"A. If I know, no, I don\u2019t know. I can speculate, but I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-14\">\"Q. Has he contacted you in the past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-15\">\"A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-16\">\"Q. This was the first time he had ever contacted you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-17\">\"A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-18\">\"Q. Do you know Dr. Feltoon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\"A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Have you worked with Dr. Feltoon on numerous malpractice lawsuits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">\"A. No, I know him socially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>You know him socially?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">\"A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Might it be Dr. Feltoon arranged for you to meet with Mr. Dean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-11\">\"A. As I said, I don\u2019t know, it may be possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-12\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>You have no memory one way or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-13\">\"A. No, I haven\u2019t, really, it\u2019s too long ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-14\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Two years ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-15\">\"A. At least two years ago.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">It is clear that despite the zeal and persistence of defense counsel in their search for a conspiracy among plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, medical advisor, and expert witnesses to render collusive and untrue testimony, all that was revealed by cross-examination was that some of these physicians had known each other in the past or presently knew each other casually or by reputation. However, defense counsel did not abandon this strategy for want of a reasonable basis in evidence, but instead, during their final argument, continued to inject this false issue for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">Returning to the question of why plaintiffs had happened to consult with Dr. Kaplan, defense counsel rhetorically asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-18\">\"How did Mr. Dean find you, of all the neurologists in the United States; of all the neurologists in Grand Rapids, in Detroit, Highland Park, any place in Michigan, any place in the United States? How did Mr. Dean suddenly call up one day, on Sixth Avenue in New York City, and say, 'Dr. Kaplan, come testify for me, come examine this baby. Don\u2019t do a darned thing for the baby; don\u2019t talk to the doctor, don\u2019t find out what\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>being done for him, just get on that stand and say the baby is going to live forever.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">\"I asked him, and I made this big gesture (indicating) 'How in the whole world did Mr. Dean know to call you,\u2019 and his answer was, 'I don\u2019t know. Ask Mr. Dean.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In reference to Dr. Edeiken\u2019s testimony, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">\u201cNow, first of all, why did he come here? He\u2019s head of the Department of Radiology. He\u2019s the Chief of the Department. This isn\u2019t his field of radiology, although he is a competent, trained radiologist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\"He says, 'In my hospital we have a specific pediatrics radiologist who does this kind of thing.\u2019 Well, if he\u2019s the Chief, if he\u2019s the head, and he really thought something was wrong or that pediatric radiologist \u2014 why didn\u2019t he tell that pediatric radiologist to come on down? Maybe it has something to do with the strange Dr. Feltoon in the courtroom, his social friend who he went to medical school with; the same Dr. Feltoon that Dr. Chodoff knew.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Defense counsel also referred to plaintiffs\u2019 expert medical witnesses as \"those three cohorts\u201d who had come to court to testify against their clients. Similarly, defense counsel referred to plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Chodoff as \"the fellow that came in here to do my client in. That\u2019s kind of blunt but that\u2019s what he is here for. * * * Now I\u2019m not going to knock anybody but he came all the way here from Philadelphia to do Dr. Rice in * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">After defendants\u2019 closing argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel moved for a mistrial because of defense counsel\u2019s reference to the \"strange Dr. Feltoon\u201d, or in the alternative a curative instruction. In declining to grant a mistrial, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>\"The Court: </em>Yes, I\u2019m doubtful that that\u2019s legitimate argument to a jury. To permit a jury to speculate on something like that would, in the opinion of the court, be improper, but I\u2019ll let you answer it any way you like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\"If you had objected at the time, the court could have ruled on it at that time and told the jury to disregard it. To revive it at this stage of the proceedings is, in the opinion of the court, not necessary or warranted by the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">During his final summation, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attempted to respond to the unsubstantiated insinuations of defense counsel relating to the testimony of out-of-state physicians by discussing the difficulty in obtaining the assistance of local physicians in the preparation of a malpractice case. Defense counsel objected to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel arguing the \"conspiracy of silence\u201d on the basis that there was no evidence in the record of such a conspiracy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court agreed, stating that it \"would not permit an argument of that kind\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The record discloses that, by the time the jury retired to deliberate upon a verdict, defendants\u2019 counsel had succeeded in conveying the message that plaintiffs would not have relied entirely on out-of-state physicians to testify for them had their case been a meritorious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In <em>Wayne County Board of Road Commissioners v GLS LeasCo, </em>394 Mich 126; 229 NW2d 797 (1975), a condemnation case involving a similar \"battle of experts\u201d, this Court reversed a verdict for plaintiff upon finding that the improper con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>duct of plaintiffs counsel, in attacking defendant\u2019s witnesses by \"innuendo and unfounded accusation\u201d of rendering collusive and untrue testimony, had deprived defendant of a fair trial on the merits. With respect to plaintiff Wayne County\u2019s strategy of attacking defendant\u2019s expert witnesses, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">\"These comments represent more than the mere reproof of recalcitrant witnesses. They constitute unjustified, direct attacks on the integrity and honesty of LeasCo\u2019s witnesses. There is no evidence that these witnesses testified falsely, withheld information when stating that they did not know the answer to counsel\u2019s questions, or manufactured false evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">\"Witnesses should not be subjected to personal attacks and unsubstantiated insinuations. Each party is entitled to present its case on the merits, free from remarks of opposing counsel which may prejudice the jury and divert its attention from the real issues.\u201d 394 Mich 126, 134.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Defendants rely on <em>Firchau v Foster, </em>371 Mich 75; 123 NW2d 151 (1963), which involved an appeal from a trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial because plaintiffs counsel had referred to defendant as a \"leech and a parasite\u201d, to support their argument that their remarks concerning plaintiffs\u2019 experts were within the limits of proper argument. However, we find that defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Firchau </em>is misplaced. While this Court acknowledged that \"common experience seems to be that such breaches of good manners are more detrimental to the actor than the accused\u201d, we went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">\" 'Counsel may, acting on their own judgment as to propriety and good taste, discuss the character of witnesses, the probability of the truth of testimony given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>on the stand, and may, <em>when there is any reasonable basis for it, </em>characterize testimony.\u2019 [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aee\">\"But where language is such as evinces a <em>studied purpose to in\u00f1ame or prejudice the jury, based upon facts not in the case, </em>this Court has not hesitated to reverse.\u201d 371 Mich 75, 78-79. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In the instant case, we do not view defendants\u2019 remarks concerning plaintiffs\u2019 experts as being merely \"breaches of good manners\u201d; we perceive a studied purpose to prejudice the jury and divert thegurors\u2019 attention from the merits of the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We are not confident that the verdict in the case at bar would have been the same had defendants\u2019 counsel not continuously raised the groundless charge, by direct attack and innuendo, that the \"bought\u201d testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 out-of-state expert witnesses was collusive and untrue. In a case as close and sharply contested as the instant one, we cannot believe that plaintiffs had a fair trial where defendants\u2019 counsel succeeded in characterizing plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses as \"professional experts\u201d who made their living traveling around the country as a trio providing \"bought\u201d testimony. We find that this accusation, which had no basis in evidence, was so prejudicial as to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Since we reverse and remand for a new trial on the basis of the first issue raised by plaintiffs, we find it unnecessary to address the issue of whether the sudden interruption of plaintiffs\u2019 closing argument by a person seeking emergency medical treatment denied plaintiffs a fair trial. The likelihood of a recurrence during a new trial of the type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of interruption which was visited upon the trial proceedings is remote in the extreme.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The last issue on appeal is whether the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury that defendant hospital was negligent as a matter of law in allowing an intern, not licensed to practice medicine, to provide medical care. The Court of Appeals held that an intern working in a hospital emergency room is not \"practicing medicine\u201d within the meaning of the then-applicable medical licensing statute,* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but is participating in a postgraduate training program.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree. The fact that the completion of a one-year internship is itself a prerequisite to licensure negates a contrary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We reverse and remand for a new trial.
