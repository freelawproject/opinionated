He was treated for serious lacerations on the back and neck at the emergency room of Highland Park General Hospital, a municipal hospital operated by the City of Highland Park. In 1972, Vincent Parker and his father, Casey Parker, filed a malprac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>tice suit against the hospital; Physicians Emergency Service, the corporation which operated the emergency room; and the doctor who had treated Vincent Parker.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In their complaint plaintiffs alleged that the treating physician had failed to take X-rays, that Vincent Parker had continued to feel pain in his back after treatment at Highland Park General Hospital, and that in 1972 treatment at another hospital revealed that a large piece of glass had remained lodged underneath the skin of Vincent Parker\u2019s back since his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The city moved for summary judgment, contending that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, because the city, as a governmental agency engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, was immune from tort liability under MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.

As was stated in the Kavanagh-Fitzgerald dissenting opinion in <em>Thomas v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 1, 17, fn 4; 247 NW2d 530 (1976), to read the second sentence of MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as \"preserving for all time state governmental immunity heretofore recognized by case law\u201d would be to \"assume that the Legislature failed to recognize that the evolution of case-law precedent is exclusively committed to the judicial branch of government\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Determining whether or not a certain activity is or is not a \"governmental function\u201d is a matter of statutory interpretation. In the absence of a legislative definition of the term, statutory interpretation is a function committed to the judiciary. The term \"governmental function\u201d is particularly subject to judicial interpretation because the phrase is of judicial origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">It is time we recognize that our case-law precedent, as it attempts to distinguish between a governmental and a proprietary function, is \"inher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ently unsound\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In abrogating common-law judge-made immunity <em>(Pittman v Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41, 49; 247 NW2d 512 [1976]), we recognized the appropriateness of the analysis used to overrule a hospital\u2019s charitable immunity to the governmental immunity area of the law. By substituting \"definition of governmental function\u201d and \"governmental function\u201d for \"charitable\u201d and \"charities\u201d in <em>Parker v Port Huron Hospital, </em>361 Mich 1, 25; 105 NW2d 1 (1960), we said about charitable immunity then what we wish to say about governmental immunity today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">\"The old rule of charitable immunity [definition of governmental function] was justified in its time, on its own facts. Today we have a new set of facts. It is true that the new facts are still described by the same word in our English language \u2014 \"charities\u201d [governmental function] \u2014 but that is because our language has not changed as the facts of our life have changed. <em>We have new facts described by old nomenclature. </em>To say that the old rule of law still applies is to reach a result on the basis of nomenclature, not of facts; it is to apply a rule, proper in its time, to completely new facts, and to justify doing so by reference to language merely without regard to the facts.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Again, we reject the rigid dichotomy of the past. Because an activity is not proprietary, it does not necessarily follow that the activity is governmental. We would limit the term \"governmental function\u201d to those activities <em>sui generis </em>governmental \u2014of essence to governing. This principle was rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>ognized in <em>Lykins v Peoples Community Hospital, </em>355 F Supp 52, 53 (ED Mich, 1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\">\"This court does not believe the statutory scheme contemplates immunity for the day-to-day operations of a hospital.

Governmental functions more properly refer to the tasks of governing. There is, for example, a governmental character to activities such as the collection of taxes or the operation of a court system.

Plaintiffs decedent was a carpenter who contracted smallpox when employed by the City of Detroit in the construction of a new hospital on the site of an existing hospital. Plaintiff alleged that the old building and the grounds were infected with smallpox germs and the city was negligent in exposing the carpenter to the germs. Nonliability was based on the city\u2019s performing a \"governmental function\u201d. To the <em>Nicholson </em>Court, performing a governmental function meant that the city was acting as an agent of the state rather than for its own private purposes.

Nurse Madeleine Martinson fell into the elevator shaft. She sued the city, alleging negligence because of a faulty safety catch which allowed the guard door to open when the elevator was at another floor. The Court relied on <em>Nicholson, </em>finding a general hospital \"within the same category\u201d as a contagious hospital. The Court also applied the \"common good of all\u201d test for distinguishing between a governmental and a proprietary function.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\" 'The underlying test is whether the act is for the common good of all without the element of special corporate benefit or pecuniary profit.

The Court believed the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the 1872 statute was to \"state the basic rule of negligence together with the defense of contributory negligence modified by the emerging doctrine of last clear chance\u201d.

In <em>Martinson, supra, </em>p 597, although the city hospital apparently accepted indigent patients, the county welfare board paid the bill of those patients.

Therefore, this opinion concurs with the result reached by Justice Fitzgerald. However, the reasons for reaching this conclusion differ to some extent from the analysis of my colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Governmental tort immunity in Michigan was originally created by court decision. Early in the state\u2019s history, this Court began a slow process of extending protection from tort liability to municipal and state governing units. Often, contrary to strong indications from the Legislature to allow governmental liability, this Court enlarged the scope of governmental immunity. It fashioned the present theory of protection embodied in the \"governmental function\u201d concept.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The momentum of these protective decisions continued unabated until the relatively recent case of <em>Williams v </em>Detroit, 364 Mich 231; 111 NW2d 1 (1961). The Court in <em>Williams </em>held that \"the judicial doctrine of governmental immunity\u201d was henceforth abolished in Michigan. However, this Court later restricted the broad sweep of <em>Williams </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>to apply only to municipal corporations. <em>McDowell v State Highway </em>Commissioner, 365 Mich 268; 112 NW2d 491 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In response to the <em>Williams </em>initiative, the Legislature passed 1964 PA 170. That statute, as amended by 1970 PA 155, included a general provision for immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\"Except as in this act otherwise provided, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise and discharge of a governmental function. Except as otherwise provided herein, this act shall not be construed as modifying or restricting the immunity of the state from tort liability as it existed heretofore, which immunity is affirmed.\u201d MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Although not defining the term \"governmental function\u201d, the Legislature did define the concept of \"proprietary function\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">\"The immunity of the state shall not apply to actions to recover for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the performance of a proprietary function as herein defined. Proprietary function shall mean any activity which is conducted primarily for the purpose of producing a pecuniary profit for the state, excluding, however, any activity normally supported by taxes or fees.\u201d MCL 691.1413; MSA 3.996(113).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The evolution of common-law precedent is committed to the judicial branch of the government. No more striking example of judicial alteration in order to accommodate the needs and responsibilities of the times exists than the ringing pronouncement by this Court in <em>Pittman v City of Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41; 247 NW2d 512 (1976). In <em>Pittman, </em>this Court expressly abrogated the an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>cient and maligned common-law doctrine of state governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Likewise, the concepts of governmental and proprietary functions have evolved different meanings over the years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These terms have been judicially manipulated to fit contemporary requirements. In <em>Thomas v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 1; 247 NW2d 530 (1976), this Court interpreted the present governmental immunity statute. It was fully recognized that the concept of governmental function was dependent for its meaning upon judicial interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Several of my colleagues hold the position that the second sentence of the immunity provision requires past precedent to bind our present response to the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\"Obviously this language must be construed as an 'affirmation\u2019 of case-law precedent on the subject of the state\u2019s immunity.\u201d <em>Thomas, supra, </em>11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Thus, since this Court previously held the operation of a general hospital to be a governmental function, the Court would be statutorily bound by the old law. See <em>Martinson v Alpena, </em>328 Mich 595; 44 NW2d 148 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Rather than adopt this position, particularly in the face of <em>Pittman, supra, </em>which erased all common-law immunity precedent, this Court should begin anew its analysis of what a governmental function means under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Although the Legislature saw fit to statutorily define the term \"proprietary\u201d, significantly it did not define \"governmental\u201d function. Further, it may be discerned that there are actually three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>categories of activities: proprietary, governmental and an area wherein activities are neither clearly governmental nor proprietary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is within this presently undifferentiated area that this Court must chart a modern course.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">This conclusion was aptly stated by the minority in <em>Thomas:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\"We do not, however, construe this sentence [the second sentence of the statutory immunity provision] to be an 'affirmation\u2019 of case-law precedent preserving for all time state governmental immunity heretofore recognized by case law. To read it in such a manner would be to assume that the Legislature failed to recognize that the evolution of case-law precedent is exclusively committed to the judicial branch of government.\u201d 398 Mich 17, fn 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Participation of modern government in our everyday existence is so pervasive that any presumption must rightly run to government responsibility and consequent liability rather than to immunity. Present realities dictate viewing immunity as a privilege, limited to those activities uniquely associated with governmental enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">It is held today that activity conducted in a general hospital operated by a municipality is not a governmental function for immunity purposes. This conclusion is predicated on the basis that the term \"governmental function\u201d is limited to those activities <em>sui generis </em>governmental \u2014 of essence to governing.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">In <em>Thomas, </em>it was suggested that this test meant that a function is not governmental unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>particular activity involved has \"no common analogy in the private sector\u201d. Furthermore, it was observed that the perimeter of governmental function will most often \"run along the line of distinction between decisional and planning aspects of governmental duties on the one hand, and operational aspects on the other\u201d. 398 Mich 21, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Although these concepts may have some significance in given cases when applying the \"governmental essence\u201d test, in other instances they could be misleading or inapplicable. For instance, it would be incongruous to find that the operational activities of some public agencies are other than governmental. Likewise, conceivably there could be essential governmental activity which would have some common analogy in the private sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">To delineate a complete and balanced definition of governmental function within a simplistic format would be presumptuous. However, as a basic guideline, the crux of the governmental essence test should be founded upon the inquiry whether the purpose, planning and carrying out of the activity, due to its unique character or governmental mandate,, can be effectively accomplished only by the government. Unless liability would be an unacceptable interference with government\u2019s ability to govern, activities that fall outside this perimeter, although performed by a government agency, are not governmental functions and therefore not immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The municipal ownership and operation of a general hospital clearly indicates government participation. The question is whether this participation is uniquely associated with governmental enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Although not necessarily decisive, the number of private general hospitals is far greater than the number of governmental hospitals in this state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This statistic alone would indicate that the function performed by municipal general hospitals is not uniquely served by government, however much the need for public participation remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Further, though the purpose of maintaining public general hospitals is to enhance the health of the citizens of Michigan, the purpose is not one which can only be effectively accomplished in society by the government. It is recognized that public general hospitals in most instances are maintained substantially by patient user charges. The fiscal involvement of government is significantly displaced by private payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Moreover, a significant consideration is the fact that government has little direct responsibility for placing patients in public general hospitals. Admitting and discharging patients there is usually a matter of private concern. This situation may be contrasted with public mental hospitals where patients are committed into an institution, often by court order, to fulfill the clear governmental responsibility of caring for those who cannot care for themselves or who present a danger to society. See the Mental Health Code, MCL 330.1001 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 14.800(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The day-to-day care afforded to the substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>majority of patients in general hospitals is not of a unique character or precipitated by governmental mandate. Activities conducted by the staff of general hospitals are not such as can effectively be accomplished only through government participation. The medical practice performed in the emergency room of a municipal general hospital falls outside the scope of a governmental function contemplated by the statute. See <em>Lykins v Peoples Community Hospital, </em>355 F Supp 52 (ED Mich, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Further, holding negligent activities of hospital personnel in general hospitals subject to liability is not an unacceptable interference with government\u2019s ability to govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">It also should be noted that a full trial is still forthcoming. At trial, plaintiffs will be required to prove their allegations of malpractice by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant will have a full day in court. Therefore, though the defense of governmental immunity for public general hospitals is removed, all the safeguards of a trial remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Since defendant Highland Park General Hospital was improperly granted summary judgment in this case, I concur in reversing the trial court and remanding the matter for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> See, generally, Cooperrider, <em>The Court, the Legislature, and Governmental Tort Liability in Michigan, </em>72 Mich L Rev 187 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> See, generally, Anno: <em>Immunity from liability for damages in tort of state or governmental unit or agency in operating hospital, </em>25 ALR2d 203, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14.

In my view it does, and I would affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant city\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\"Except as in this act otherwise provided, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. Except as otherwise provided herein, this act shall not be construed as modifying or restricting the immunity of the state from tort liability as it existed heretofore, which immunity is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">In <em>Thomas v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 1, 10; 247 NW2d 530 (1976), the majority noted that the historical context in which the foregoing statute was enacted suggests that the Legislature intended to codify the state\u2019s existing common-law or judge-made immunity and to restore the immunity of municipalities as it existed prior to the 1961 decision of <em>Williams v Detroit, </em>364 Mich 231; 111 NW2d 1 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">At common law, the expression \"governmental function\u201d was the term of art which both described the nature and defined the limits of state and municipal immunity from tort liability. By employing that same term of art in creating statutory immunity, the Legislature appears to have directed the courts to look to the common law for guidance in determining whether, in a given case, a governmental agency is exercising or discharging a \"governmental function\u201d for purposes of the immunity statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Reference to the pre-statutory immunity cases discloses that in <em>Martinson v Alpena, </em>328 Mich 595; 44 NW2d 148 (1950), this Court held that the operation of a public hospital to promote the general public health is indeed a governmental function. Moreover, it seems evident that the operation of a public hospital is within the frequently cited \"common good of all\u201d definition of a \u201cgovernmental function\u201d. See <em>Martinson, </em>and <em>Gunther v Che</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>boygan County Road Commissioners, </em>225 Mich 619, 621; 196 NW 386 (1923), citing <em>Bolster v City of Lawrence, </em>225 Mass 387; 114 NE 722 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">I conclude, therefore, that the operation of a public hospital is a governmental function at common law in Michigan and is a governmental function for purposes of the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">It remains to be determined whether the plaintiffs in this case have alleged in their complaint such specific tortious activity against the City of Highland Park as is within the scope of the immunity the city enjoys.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The complaint alleges that the defendant city, through its agents, servants and employees at the Highland Park General Hospital, was negligent in the examination, diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff, Vincent Oshee Parker, in failing to discover and remove a piece of glass which was lodged beneath the skin of his back and which remained there for several months after he was treated at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Manifestly, the examination, diagnosis and treatment of patients at a public hospital are activities intended to promote the general public health and are exercised for \"the common good of all\u201d. Consequently, the alleged tortious activity of the defendant city is within the governmental function of operating its municipal hospital. The defendant is immune, therefore, from liability for its negligence, if any, in performing that function in this case by reason of the provisions of MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The trial court was correct in granting the defendant city\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">I vote to affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-11\">Williams and Coleman, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
