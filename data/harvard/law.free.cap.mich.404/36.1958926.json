Defendant admitted the transfer but denied the reason ascribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">On December 6, 1974, plaintiff was informed that there was no work, and laid off, although the complaint states that he continued to work a few days each month following the layoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">Plaintiff filed a charge of age discrimination with the Michigan Civil Rights Commission on June 9, 1975, approximately 184 days after the layoff. On March 11, 1976, the commission dismissed the complaint because it was not filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>within the 90 days required by \u00a7 7(b) of the Michigan State Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Subsequently, on April 9, 1976, plaintiff filed a complaint in Wayne Circuit Court against defendant alleging that age discrimination motivated plaintiff\u2019s transfer and layoff. Claiming that the administrative remedy contained in the FEPA was plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy for age discrimination in private employment, defendant-employer filed a motion to quash service of process and for accelerated judgment of dismissal. The trial judge, reasoning that material distinctions in law exist between racial and age discrimination, declined to extend our holding in <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537; 189 NW2d 243 (1971), in which this Court held that a black plaintiff who had not filed a timely complaint with the Michigan Civil Rights Commission was not precluded from maintaining a civil suit against his employer. The trial court entered a judgment of dismissal with prejudice on July 28, 1976. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that <em>Pompey </em>was equally applicable to age discrimination. 75 Mich App 198; 255 NW2d 6 (1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We affirm. In <em>Pompey, supra, </em>we acknowledged that plaintiff\u2019s complaint to the Civil Rights Commission was properly dismissed as being untimely filed. We noted, however, that plaintiff in his complaint did not assert entitlement to the statutory remedy provided in the FEPA, but rather asserted his right to a cumulative judicial remedy for redress of his civil right to be free from discrimination in private employment. We held that such a cumulative judicial remedy could be main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tained in addition to the remedial machinery provided by the statute for vindication of the statutorily created right to be free from discrimination in private employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">While we recognized that there had been no common-law remedy for race discrimination in private employment and that the absence of such a remedy was ordinarily significant in determining the exclusiveness of the statutory remedy, we nevertheless forged an exception. Looking to prior Michigan case law we found support in civil rights cases for an exception to the general rule that where a new right is created or a duty is imposed by statute, the statutory remedy provided for enforcement is exclusive. In <em>Pompey </em>we continued the exception to that rule. We additionally predicated our decision upon our conviction that the constitutional delegates did not intend, in creating the Civil Rights Commission, to vest it with exclusive jurisdiction over civil rights cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">There is nothing in our decision in <em>Pompey </em>which suggests that the holding is to be limited to the securing of one\u2019s civil right to be free from racial discrimination in private employment. The legislation which proscribed such racial discrimination, also proscribed discrimination on the basis of age, sex, color, religion, national origin or ancestry. MCL 423.301 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.458(1) <em>et seq. </em>There is no reason to conclude that the Legislature, in drafting the FEPA, now part of the Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(101), <em>et seq., </em>intended that distinctive treatment be accorded violation of the specific civil right to be free from racial discrimination as opposed to violation of any of the other statutorily protected civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>rights. The right to be free from racial discrimination and the right to be free from age discrimination in private employment are both statutory civil rights created by the FEPA and continued in Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><em>Pompey </em>does not permit, and we do not perceive, a basis that prompts us to accord age discrimination lesser treatment. Therefore, our decision to extend a cumulative judicial remedy to <em>Pompey </em>for racial discrimination in private employment must likewise be extended to the age discrimination complainant in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Accordingly we affirm the Court of Appeals and remand to the circuit court for a hearing on the merits. No costs, a public question involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-7\">Williams, Fitzgerald, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Kavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\"> MCLA 423.307(b); MSA 17.458(7)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\"> Another panel of the Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in <em>Hernden v Consumers Power Co, </em>72 Mich App 349; 249 NW2d 419 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\"> <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537, 558-559, fn 19; 189 NW2d 243 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b107-11\"> Also persuasive in arriving at a determination in the instant matter that an aggrieved party may pursue a cumulative judicial remedy for the violation of any civil right is the fact that the FEPA, reenacted in the Civil Rights Act, MCLA 37.2101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq., </em>now expressly provides for direct access to the circuit court. MCLA 37.2801; MSA 3.548(801).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b107-8\">Blair Moody, Jr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALP\"><em>(concurring). </em>I concur with the analysis and result reached by Chief Justice Kavanagh.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537; 189 NW2d 243 (1971), and the result we reach today are clearly distinguishable from our decision in <em>Lamphere Schools v Lamphere Federation of Teachers, </em>400 Mich 104; 252 NW2d 818 (1977). In <em>Lamphere </em>we adhered to the general rule that where a new right is created by statute the remedy for enforcement of that right is exclusive. <em>Pompey </em>and today\u2019s extension of <em>Pompey </em>represent a narrow exception to this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The reason for framing the <em>Pompey </em>exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>focuses on the type of rights involved. Anticipating future cases, we noted in <em>Lamphere:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">\"[Wjhile for purposes of discussion here, we accept <em>Pompey </em>for the general proposition cited, that case is easily distinguished from the case at bar. <em>Pompey </em>dealt with the exclusive-cumulative dichotomy regarding statutory remedies in the context of fundamental or <em>civil </em>rights. The instant case involves damages arising out of the alleged violation of <em>proprietary </em>rights.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Lamphere, supra, </em>126, fn 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">It is, therefore, the fundamental nature of the right involved, <em>i.e., </em>that a person be free from discrimination whether the discrimination be based on race or age, that compels us to conclude a cumulative remedy is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">There are other cogent reasons for amplifying <em>Pompey. </em>We are cognizant of the fact that the Legislature in reenacting the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq., </em>codified this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pompey </em>by expressly providing for direct access to circuit court for an aggrieved party. MCL 37.2801; MSA 3.548(801). Not only was direct access granted for claims of race discrimination, but also for age, sex, national origin, religion, handicap and marital status claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In examining the legislative history of the reenactment, we are persuaded the Legislature felt strongly that a \"direct access\u201d provision was essential to the act. While the original bill in the House, House Bill 4055, contained no provision granting direct access, the direct access provision appeared in the first substitute to House Bill 4055. In all, six substitute bills were presented to the Legislature and while numerous changes and deletions were made in the original bill and all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>substitutes, the direct access provision remained intact with only minor procedural revisions. The direct access provision in the Michigan act aligns Michigan with other jurisdictions which have similar provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The import of the new Michigan direct access provision was emphasized by Chief Judge Cornelia G. Kennedy in her decision in <em>Schroeder v Dayton-Hudson Corp, </em>448 F Supp 910 (ED Mich, 1977), <em>rev\u2019d in part on rev'd, </em>456 F Supp 650 (ED Mich, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\"><em>Schroeder, </em>much like the case before us, involved an age discrimination claim where plaintiff sought direct access to the courts without having filed a complaint with the Michigan Civil Rights Commission within 90 days after the alleged act of discrimination. In granting direct access, the <em>Schroeder </em>court, applying precedent of this Court, persuasively reasoned that the reenacted Civil Rights Act should be given retroactive application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Additionally, we see no merit in the suggestion that by extending <em>Pompey </em>we are adding to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>already overcrowded court docket. While we must be concerned with the high volume of cases being filed with the courts, we note that since <em>Pompey </em>there has been no significant increase in the number of civil rights cases being heard by the appellate courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">But more importantly, we find the overcrowded court docket argument pales in contrast with the essential issues to be addressed in civil rights matters. As the United States Supreme Court has recognized congressional intent to give the \"highest priority\u201d to civil rights claims, <em>Alexander v Gardner-Denver Co, </em>415 US 36, 47; 94 S Ct 1011; 39 L Ed 2d 147 (1974); <em>Newman v Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc, </em>390 US 400, 402; 88 S Ct 964; 19 L Ed 2d 1263 (1968), this Court should do no less.</p>\n<author id=\"b110-7\">Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbB\"><em>(to reverse). </em>In this appeal we are asked to decide whether the holding in <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537; 189 NW2d 243 (1971) (that there existed initial jurisdiction in the circuit court which derived from a private cause of action for racial discrimination in private employment), should be extended to claims of age discrimination. We would determine that <em>Pompey </em>was erroneously decided and hold that plaintiffs administrative remedy was exclusive under the act then in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Plaintiff was employed as an elevator mechanic by defendant from 1967 to December of 1974. On December 6, 1974, following a transfer from the maintenance to the service department, plaintiff was told that there was no work and was laid off. Plaintiff was 55 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">On June 9, 1975, 184 days after his layoff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>plaintiff filed a claim of age discrimination with the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. The complaint was dismissed as untimely because \u00a7 7(b) of the Michigan State Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA) required such a charge to be filed within 90 days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Belatedly, plaintiff filed a complaint in circuit court on April 9, 1976 alleging age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The trial court determined that the administrative remedy provided in FEPA was exclusive and saw sufficient material distinctions between age and racial discrimination to decline to extend <em>Pompey. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed with prejudice. The Court of Appeals, seeing no basis for distinguishing age and racial discrimination, reversed. 75 Mich App 198; 255 NW2d 6 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Finding <em>Pompey </em>to have been wrongly decided, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court. When the Legislature creates a remedy unknown to the common law and provides an administrative agency to administer grievances, then exclusive jurisdiction to hear such claims lies with that administrative body, unless otherwise provided by the Legislature. However, because of the subsequently enacted Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq., </em>which expressly provides for direct access to the circuit court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this opinion is of little juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>prudential value other than as a reflection upon the purpose of legislatively provided administrative hearings and the foreseeable effects of adherence to and expansion of <em>Pompey. </em>Therefore, our views will be set forth with some brevity.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Essentially, plaintiff\u2019s argument that age should be treated the same as racial discrimination has merit if we are to abide by what we believe to have been an erroneous conclusion in <em>Pompey. </em>In that decision, the Court excised from the FEPA the requirement that race discrimination cases be heard before the Civil Rights Commission. The same legislation contained prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age, sex, religion, color, national origin or marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We agree with the Chief Justice that the statute treated each category of discrimination as equally onerous. Race should be treated no differently than age. Applying <em>Pompey, </em>Justice Kavanagh finds that all discrimination cases under FEPA could go either to the commission or the circuit court. It is here that we part.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The act in effect at the time of this action charged the commission with hearing civil rights complaints. The appeals came to the courts. Because we made a judicial exception for one of the proscribed discriminatory acts, we find ourselves in the position of either condoning an absurd result by saying other bases of prohibited discrimination are to be treated differently from that of race, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>compounding the initial mistake by saying, in effect, that the Legislature did not mean what it said. If complainants missed the time requirements for administrative review, the jurisdictional provision meant nothing. Complainants always could go directly to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The fact that the statute later was changed to provide for primary jurisdiction in the circuit court (possibly because <em>Pompey </em>placed the commission in an anomalous position and rendered the statutory limitations meaningless) does not change Mr. Holmes\u2019 legal position in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The problem with permitting <em>Pompey </em>to continue (and expand) as precedent lies in its application to other legislative provisions and concomitant administrative agencies regarding their jurisdiction, operation and powers. This Court rejected such an attempt to utilize <em>Pompey </em>in <em>Lamphere Schools v Lamphere Federation of Teachers, </em>400 Mich 104; 252 NW2d 818 (1977). We find the underlying policies of <em>Lamphere </em>and <em>Pompey </em>irreconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Philosophically, administrative hearing panels are intended to provide expertise in a given field and, hopefully, speedier resolutions in areas of the multitudinous problems of citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Importantly, they also are intended to relieve the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">The courts at this time in history are inundated with litigation involving almost every societal and individual concern. Learned judges and the practicing bar addressing nationwide court congestion have recommended <em>inter alia </em>expanded use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>administrative hearings, arbitration, mediation, etc., with access to the courts on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">If we leave standing in Michigan the <em>Pompey </em>precedent, we leave open the door to judicial manipulation of other statutes relating to administrative law. We can extract or subtract from or enlarge jurisdiction as we personally wish. These are exclusively legislative matters and correctly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">For these reasons, among many others, we would overrule <em>Pompey </em>and reverse the Court of Appeals below. The judgment of the trial court should be reinstated. The holding necessarily would be prospective as to all other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b114-7\">Levin, J., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\"> For example, District of Columbia Human Rights Act, D C Code \u00a7 6-2296 (Supp V, 1978); N Y Exec Law, art 15, \u00a7 297, paragraph 9.

A person must choose either to go directly to court or to the administrative agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\"> Chief Judge Kennedy cites a series of cases from this Court to support her position regarding retroactive application.
