On August 24, 1968, a petition for workers\u2019 compensation was filed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">2. Hearings were held before Referee George Huber on May 6 and 27, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">3. On July 14, 1969, the referee held that plaintiff was not entitled to compensation because he had not been peddling papers or acting as an employee of the newspaper at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">4. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (the board) affirmed the referee\u2019s decision on November 10,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">5. The Court of Appeals, in an opinion authored by the now Justice Levin, reversed the board\u2019s decision and remanded for further hearing before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>another referee. 42 Mich App 301; 201 NW2d 665 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">6. On July 25, 1973, the new hearing was held before Referee Ray R. Ravary.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">7. In a decision filed July 28, 1973, Referee Ravary opined that the plaintiff had suffered a compensable injury and ordered the defendant, Monroe Evening News, to pay compensation at the rate of $54 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">8. On March 12, 1975, the board, in a 4-to-l decision, affirmed the awarding of compensation but reduced the amount to $27 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">9. The Court of Appeals, in a 2-to-l decision, reversed the board\u2019s decision, holding, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff was not employed by either the defendant or the substitute newsboy within the meaning of MCL 418.161(l)(b); MSA 17.237(161)(l)(b). 70 Mich App 407; 245 NW2d 769 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">10. We granted leave to appeal on March 24, 1977. 399 Mich 869 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">This much-litigated and -appealed case stems from a simple fact situation. On February 4, 1966, Frank Handler was delivering the Monroe Evening News. Frank Handler was not the regular newspaper boy, but he substituted for Robert Edwards, the \"owner\u201d of the route, when Edwards participated in school athletic activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Two five-year-old youngsters, Daniel Higgins, the plaintiff, and Frank Handler\u2019s younger brother, Nicholas, accompanied Frank on a part of the newspaper route that day. While accompanying Frank Handler, the plaintiff sustained serious injuries when struck by a motor vehicle while crossing Elm Street in the City of Monroe.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">Throughout this litigation, two major fact questions surfaced: whether the plaintiff was actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>delivering defendant\u2019s newspapers when the accident occurred and whether he was promised remuneration for his efforts. Within the conceptual framework that defendant\u2019s newspaper carriers are independent contractors,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the second Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board opinion answered these questions with specific findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">\"Under a contractual arrangement which had existed for approximately one (1) year prior to the injury involved herein, Frank Handler had agreed to act as a regular substitute for Bobby Edwards, a newsboy for defendant. For this service, Handler was paid approximately one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) per day. In performing his end of the bargain, Handler had made use of the services of others, including his little brother and plaintiff, on a number of occasions as helpers in return for which he would buy them pop, candy or give them a dime. This use and hiring of substitutes and helpers by regular newsboys and substitutes was committed to and left within the absolute discretion of the carriers and substitutes by defendant. Indeed, the practice was not only well known to defendant but expected and required. Defendant neither claimed nor assumed any responsibility or control over the manner in which the newspapers were delivered or who delivered them. <em>On the occasion of plaintiffs injury, February 4, 1966, plaintiff was helping Handler deliver newspapers, as he had in the past, for which assistance he had been promised remuneration in the form of either a bottle of pop, candy or a dime. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Findings of fact in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are conclusive in the absence of fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>thus, we are bound by the board\u2019s factual determination. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 and MCL 418.861; MSA 17.237(861).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The dispositive issue in this case is whether a contract of hire existed between plaintiff and Frank Handler, the substitute newsboy. However, several related issues have been presented and considered by the board and the Court of Appeals; therefore, before reaching the dispositive question, four other issues will be addressed:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">1. Is the applicability of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (the act) to an employment relationship dependent upon a minimum age requirement?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">2. Is the applicability of the act to an employment relationship dependent upon a minimum wage requirement?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">3. Assuming an employment relationship between plaintiff and defendant, was there a basis for concluding that plaintiff\u2019s employment was illegal under the Hittle Juvenile Employment Act and, therefore, for awarding double compensation?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">4. If the employment was not illegal because of the statutory exception created by MCL 409.14; MSA 17.714, is that provision of the Hittle Juvenile Employment Act unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">We answer all four questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act defines employee as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">\"Every person in the service of another, under any contract of hire, express or implied, including aliens, a person regularly employed on a full-time basis by his spouse having specified hours of employment at a specified rate of pay, working members of partnerships receiving therefrom wages irrespective of profits[,] a person insured for whom and to the extent premiums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>are paid based on wages, earnings, or profits, <em>and minors, who shall be considered the same as and have the same power to contract as adult </em>employees(Emphasis added.) MCL 418.161(l)(b); MSA 17.237(161)(l)(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Thus, the statute expressly provides that minors (without age limitation) are to be considered employees and have the legal power to contract. If the Legislature intended to impose age barriers to compensability it could have expressly inserted such limitations in the appropriate statutory provisions. Nowhere in the act is there even a hint of age limitation, nor is there any judicial authority for such a proposition. Age may be considered as one factor among many when determining whether an employment relationship exists. However, once an employer-employee relationship is established, an employee may not be barred from compensation recovery because of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Nor can the triviality of the consideration or remuneration to an employee be used as a barrier to receiving compensation. Neither the statutory provisions nor case law supports such a proposition. In fact, \u00a7418.371 which specifically provides for calculation of wage loss compensation for part-time employees refutes any allegation that a minimum wage or number of hours worked per week are necessary in order to receive compensation. MCL 418.371; MSA 17.237(371). The statutory provisions dealing with computation of compensation use a sliding scale based upon weekly wage loss with minimum and maximum rates, the maximum rates to be adjusted on an annual basis. MCL 418.351; MSA 17.237(351) and MCL 418.355; MSA 17.237(355). Therefore, we specifically hold that the amount of employee remuneration alone cannot act as a bar to disability compensation payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Hearing Referee Ray Ravary found that the defendant was liable for double compensation because the plaintiff was too young to secure a work permit, thereby making his employment illegal. The act requires that the employment \"be shown to be illegal\u201d at the time of the injury for the employee to receive double compensation. MCL 418.161(l)(b); MSA 17.237(161)(l)(b). The board reversed the double compensation award after examining the existing statutes defining illegal juvenile employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We agree with the reasoning of the board. Our statutes, MCL 409.14; MSA 17.714<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3and MCL 409.28; MSA 17.728,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> create a \"street trade\u201d exemption for newspaper distribution from the gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>eral rule that it is illegal to employ a minor who is too young to obtain a work permit. Since the employment of minors in \"street trades\u201d is not illegal, and the distribution of newspapers is a \"street trade\u201d, work permit requirements do not apply to paperboys.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Plaintiff argues that this \"street trade\u201d exemption of the Hittle Juvenile Employment Act is an unconstitutional denial of equal protection. We adopt Court of Appeals Judge T. M. Burns\u2019 succinct and accurate refutation of this argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\"Legislation is invalid on equal protection grounds if it creates classifications which are without reasonable bases and are purely arbitrary. <em>Manistee Bank &amp; Trust Co v McGowan, </em>394 Mich 655; 232 NW2d 636 (1975). It is clear to me that there are rational bases for permitting children under the age of 14 to work as paperboys while generally prohibiting their employment in other occupations. The working hours and conditions of children who deliver newspapers are sufficiently distinct from those in other industries in which children were historically employed, and the perceived benefit of this type of work experience for children properly supports its encouragement. It is also reasonable to assume that the health risks and employment abuses which existed in other areas of child labor were considerably different in both kind and degree from that of newspaper distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\"The legislative decision to permit children to deliver newspapers while generally prohibiting their employment in other businesses is reasonably related to the legislative goal of preventing child labor abuses. It was certainly not unreasonable for the Legislature to effectuate the distinction by making it an exception to a general rule of prohibition. MCL 409.14; MSA 17.714 is valid.\u201d <em>Higgins v Monroe Evening News, </em>70 Mich App 407, 418-419; 245 NW2d 769 (1976) (dissent).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The final, dispositive issue in this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>whether the plaintiff was acting under a contract of hire with Frank Handler and, thus, an employee for purposes of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, at the time he was struck by the automobile and seriously injured. Factually, it was established that Frank Handler promised reward of a dime, bottle of pop, or candy to the plaintiff if he helped deliver the newspapers. Other testimony indicated that the plaintiff had actually delivered at least one newspaper to a house on the day of the accident and that it was not the first occasion on which plaintiff had assisted in delivering defendant\u2019s newspapers. Based upon these facts, both Referee Ravary and the board found an assigned task (delivery of newspapers) and consideration offered (a dime, bottle of pop, or candy) amounting to a contract of hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">However, the Court of Appeals majority reversed the compensation award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\"Certainly a literal reading of the statute in relation to the facts found by the board would incline us to find plaintiff an employee. However, we cannot follow this course where a literal interpretation would lead us to a result clearly contrary to the legislative intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\"On balance, we are convinced that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was never intended to provide compensation for a person in the position of this plaintiff. Consequently, we hold, as a matter of law, that plaintiff was not employed by either the defendant or the substitute newsboy within the meaning of MCL 418.161(1)(b); MSA 17.237(161)(1)(b).\u201d <em>Higgins, supra, </em>413, 415.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">We agree that under the circumstances of this case, an employment relationship did not exist between the parties. Although findings of ordinary facts are binding upon the Court if supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>any evidence, finding the requisite contract of hire in the instant case involves reaching a legal conclusion. Therefore, the board\u2019s finding that a contract of hire existed between Handler and the plaintiff is reviewable by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The existence or non-existence of the requisite contract of hire can be gleaned from only one source \u2014 Frank Handler, the substitute newsboy. The following testimony is representative of Handler\u2019s explanation, on cross-examination, of plaintiff\u2019s participation in delivering newspapers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>And before you went out on the route, you didn\u2019t make any kind of an arrangement with him or make any kind of a deal where you said if you come on and help me with the papers, I\u2019ll pay you so much, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">\"A. Let\u2019s see. I was at the house. Nicky and Danny were there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>What were they doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">\"A. I guess they were playing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">\"A. And I asked them if they wanted to go on the paper route with me. I asked them if they wanted to go and I told them that if they wanted to \u2014 I mean I told them I\u2019d give them a dime or something or I\u2019d buy them something if they went and helped me. That was down by the landing, just by the side door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">\n<em>\u201dQ. Now the reason that they were coming along with you is because your mother wanted to get them out of the house, isn\u2019t that true?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">\n<em>\"A. Yes, I believe that, yes.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-13\">\"Q. Do you know why she wanted to get them out of the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-14\">\"A. Yes, I think Robin was sick or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-15\"><em>\"Q. </em>And who is Robin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-16\">\"A. My little sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-17\"><em>\"Q. </em>So was that your mother\u2019s \u2014 it was at your mother\u2019s suggestion then that you asked them to get out of the house and come along, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-18\">\"A. Well, no. I don\u2019t think so. <em>She was going to get </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>them out of the house and it was </em>\u2014 you <em>know, I\u2019d give them something to do. </em>She never told me, you know, why don\u2019t you take the kids with you, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Now what specifically did you tell them you were going to give them at the time, if anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\"><em>\"A. </em>I told them I\u2019d give them a dime or buy them a pop or something, candy bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\"><em>\"Q. </em>Did you list all these alternatives or are you saying that you might have offered or discussed one of these things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\"><em>\u2019A. </em>Do you mean I just asked them? You mean just told them I\u2019d give them a dime or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>What did you say? Did you give them a whole list of things that you might do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">\n<em>\u2019A. I told them if they wanted to go and help me I\u2019d give them a dime or buy them a pop or a candy bar.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">\n<em>\u201dQ. And did you then buy a candy bar for Nicky?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">\n<em>\u2019A. Afterwards?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">\n<em>\"Q. Yes.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">\n<em>\u2019A. No.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">\n<em>\u201dQ. Did you give Nicky a dime afterwards?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">\"A <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-16\">\n<em>\"Q. You didn\u2019t give him anything, did you?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-17\">'A <em>No. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">As previously stated, the referee and the board majority found an assigned task (delivery of newspapers) and consideration offered (a dime, bottle of pop, or candy). From those two fact findings, the board concluded that a contract of hire existed between Handler and the plaintiff. This legal conclusion ignores a major principle of contract law. Valid consideration for a contract cannot be presumed merely because two parties receive benefit from each other. Rather, a bargained-for exchange is required. The essence of consideration, therefore, is legal detriment that has been bargained for and exchanged for the promise. Calamari, Contracts (1st ed), \u00a7 53, p 105. The two parties must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>have agreed and intended that the benefits each derived be the consideration for a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Thus, to reach the conclusion that a contract of hire existed, we must be able to state that each of the two parties, Handler and the plaintiff, intended to suffer a detriment to receive a benefit, and that they agreed to exchange those detriments and benefits. It must be found that Frank Handler promised payment to the boys in exchange for their help in delivering papers, and that the plaintiff agreed to help deliver the papers because in exchange he would receive a dime, bottle of pop, or candy.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We cannot reach the legal conclusion that a contract of hire existed between Handler and the plaintiff upon accepting the factual findings of the board and reviewing all the testimony. To the contrary, Frank Handler\u2019s testimony illustrates a social relationship, wherein he gratuitously promised to give the plaintiff a dime, bottle of pop, or candy if he helped Handler in delivering the papers. Handler stated that the boys went along to deliver the papers because his mother wanted the children out of the house. Handler repeatedly used the gratuitous term \"give\u201d when referring to the boys. \"I\u2019d give them something to do.\u201d \"I\u2019d give them a dime or buy them a pop or a candy bar.\u201d Handler did not \"give\u201d his little brother Nicky anything after delivering the papers on the day of the accident, illustrating a gratuitous promise rather than a contract of hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Arthur Larson\u2019s classic treatise on workers\u2019 compensation law explains that normally the performance and acceptance of valuable service raises the implication that payment for services is expected and a contract of hire is formulated, however, in at least three common situations, circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>negate the implication. 1A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 47.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The. present facts fit within the framework of the second category: \"minor children helping their parents or others without an express contract of hire\u201d. 1A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 47.41(b). This distinction is not predicated upon a bias against children but upon a common sense recognition of the nature of the relationship. The rationale for this category is understandable. Children frequently \"help\u201d neighbors and relatives run errands and do odd jobs, while receiving minor <em>gratuitous </em>rewards. Usually these associations are not based upon an employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Although we view this unfortunate injury to the plaintiff sympathetically, we do not find the requisite contract of hire. The Court of Appeals is affirmed. Costs to appellee.</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-6\">Williams and Coleman, JJ., concurred with Blair Moody, Jr., J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b86-7\">Ryan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASQ\"><em>(to affirm). </em>I agree with both Justices Moody and Kavanagh that the \"street trade\u201d exemption of the Hittle Juvenile Employment Act, MCL 409.14; MSA 17.714, does not constitute an unconstitutional denial of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In addition, I agree with Justice Moody that the Court of Appeals decision in this case, which found as a matter of law that plaintiff was not employed by either defendant or the substitute newsboy, must be affirmed. I reach that conclusion for a different reason, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">While this Court is bound by the factual findings of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, Const 1963, art 6, \u00a728 and MCL 418.861; MSA 17.237(861), there is no evidence in the record of this case, or the facts found by the board, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>sustain the legal conclusion that plaintiff was \"* * * in the service of another, under any contract of hire, express or implied * * MCL 418.161(l)(b); MSA 17.237(161)(l)(b). Consequently, notwithstanding our compassion for this seriously injured child, there is no entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b87-5\">Kavanagh, C.J. <em>(to reverse).</em></judges>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">This is a workers\u2019 compensation case in which plaintiff appeals to this Court from an adverse ruling in the Court of Appeals. 70 Mich App 407; 245 NW2d 769 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">On February 4, 1966, Robert Edwards, the regular newscarrier for defendant Monroe Evening News, arranged for his substitute, Frank Handler, to complete a portion of his paper route. Accompanied by his five-year-old brother, Nicholas, and his brother\u2019s five-year-old friend, plaintiff Daniel Higgins, Frank Handler set out to deliver papers. While on the paper route five-year-old plaintiff Higgins was struck by a car and is now, as a result of his serious injuries, a paraplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">On August 24, 1968, plaintiff filed a petition for benefits under the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. After the initial hearing, the referee held that plaintiff was not entitled to compensation because he had not been peddling papers and hence was not an employee of the News at the time of the accident. This decision was affirmed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for further consideration. <em>Higgins v Monroe Evening News, </em>42 Mich App 301; 201 NW2d 665 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">After hearing on remand, the referee held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>plaintiff had suffered a compensable injury as an employee of the News and awarded him benefits of $54 per week. On appeal, the board affirmed but limited plaintiff\u2019s benefits to $27 per week. Testimony taken during the hearing conflicted with respect to certain critical facts: (1) whether plaintiff Higgins at the time of the accident or at any other time had actually delivered papers for substitute Handler and (2) whether Handler had promised plaintiff compensation for his assistance. The board found affirmatively on both counts and said in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">\"The testimony establishes that a promise of consideration in the form of remuneration by way of a dime, bottle of pop or some candy was made to plaintiff in return for his help in delivering newspapers and that this had not been the first time that plaintiff had helped.\u201d 1975 WCABO 456, 470.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The Court of Appeals again reversed, holding that the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act \"was never intended to provide compensation for a person in the position of this plaintiff\u201d. <em>Higgins v Monroe Evening News, supra, </em>70 Mich App 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">This Court granted leave to appeal to consider the following three issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\n<em>Are factual f\u00edndings of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board binding on a reviewing court?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Michigan appellate courts will not disturb the factual findings of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board unless there is an absence of record support for those findings. <em>Carter v Kelsey-Hayes Co, </em>386 Mich 610; 194 NW2d 326 (1972), <em>Braxton v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>Chevrolet Grey Iron Foundry Division of General Motors Corp, </em>396 Mich 685; 242 NW2d 420 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 provides that \"[findings of fact in workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud unless otherwise provided by law\u201d.

Since there was evidence in the record to support these factual findings we will not disturb them.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\n<em>Is the \"street trade\u201d exemption provision of the Hittle Juvenile Employment Act unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The hearing referee agreed with plaintiff\u2019s contention that because plaintiff was too young to secure a work permit, his employment was illegal and he was therefore entitled to double compensation under MCL 418.161(l)(b); MSA 17.237(161)(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board reversed that determination, finding plaintiff\u2019s em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ployment legal under the \"street trade\u201d exemption for newscarriers.

Since the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals found as a matter of law no employment relationship between plaintiff and defendant, the remaining issues, including the instant one, were not addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We agree with the appeal board\u2019s disposition that plaintiff\u2019s employment was legal because it falls within the \"street trades\u201d exemption to the Hittle Juvenile Employment Act. Further, we find no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the \"street trades\u201d provision works a denial of equal protection by denying all newscarriers the protection afforded other minors under the Hittle Juvenile Employment Act. Because we find his reasoning cogent, we adopt the position taken by Court of Appeals Judge T. M. Burns in his dissenting opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">\"Legislation is invalid on equal protection grounds if it creates classifications which are without reasonable bases and are purely arbitrary. <em>Manistee Bank &amp; Trust Co v </em>McGowan, 394 Mich 655; 232 NW2d 636 (1975). It is clear to me that there are rational bases for permitting children under the age of 14 to work as paperboys while generally prohibiting their employment in other occupations. The working hours and conditions of children who deliver newspapers are sufficiently distinct from those in other industries in which children were historically employed, and the perceived benefit of this type of work experience for children properly supports its encouragement. It is also reasonable to assume that the health risks and employment abuses which existed in other areas of child labor were considerably different in both kind and degree from that of newspaper distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\"The legislative decision to permit children to deliver newspapers while generally prohibiting their employment in other businesses is reasonably related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>legislative goal of preventing child labor abuses. It was certainly not unreasonable for the Legislature to effectuate the distinction by making it an exception to a general rule of prohibition. MCL 409.14; MSA 17.714 is valid.\u201d 70 Mich App 407, 418-419; 245 NW2d 769 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>Did the Court of Appeals err in holding as a matter of law there was no employment contract between plaintiff and defendant?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed an award of compensation ordered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, finding as a matter of law no employment relationship between the parties to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Whether a contract of hire may be inferred from the conduct, language or other pertinent circumstances of a relationship is a matter of fact which may not be prescinded from the factfinder if any of the facts are in dispute. See <em>Chaffee v Stenger, </em>361 Mich 57; 104 NW2d 805 (1960); <em>Holcomb v Bullock, </em>353 Mich 514; 91 NW2d 869 (1958); and <em>Erickson v Goodell Oil Co, Inc, </em>384 Mich 207; 180 NW2d 798 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The facts and legitimate inferences were in dispute here and the board resolved the dispute, finding a contract of employment existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The Court of Appeals majority refused to give effect to the literal language of the statute, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">\"Certainly a literal reading of the statute in relation to the facts found by the board would incline us to find plaintiff an employee. However, we cannot follow this course where a literal interpretation would lead us to a result clearly contrary to the legislative intent.\u201d (Citations omitted.) 70 Mich App 413.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Without the assignment of any ambiguity in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>portion of the act they construe, the Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that the Legislature could not have intended coverage of the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">As a general rule, statutory language is construed consistent with its plain meaning. Only when statutory language is found to be ambiguous are reviewing courts free to look to legislative intent in an effort to understand and give effect to the words used.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Here the Court of Appeals majority did not state what the \"legislative intent\u201d was nor how they determined it. Neither did they point out a basis for their conclusion that the finding of a contract of employment would be clearly contrary to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">We have carefully considered <em>People v McFarlin, </em>389 Mich 557, 563; 208 NW2d 504 .(1973), cited by th\u00e9 Court of Appeals, and find it inapposite. We do not find the statute\u2019s definition of employee ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">\"Every person in the service of another, under any contract of hire, express or implied, including * * * minors, <em>who shall be considered the same as </em>and have the same power to contract as adult employees.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) MCL 418.161(l)(b); MSA 17.237(161X1)0\u00bb).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Neither do we find it necessary to consider some unstated legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">An employment relationship does not turn on whether an employee depends upon the contract for his livelihood or whether his motive in entering into it was to obtain remuneration. Accordingly we reject defendant\u2019s argument that because plaintiff here was supported by his parents and was motivated by social rather than monetary considerations no contract of employment existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The tender age of plaintiff here should not influence the determination of employment, for the statutory direction that minors be considered the s\u00e1me as adult employees with the same power to contract makes age irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the promise of \"a dime, bottle of pop, or candy bar\u201d cannot constitute consideration for a contract is also unpersuasive. Carriers delivering newspapers deal in pennies. Handler, the substitute carrier, was paid approximately $1.50 a day by Edwards for delivering papers. It is consistent with that scale of compensation that Handler\u2019s helpers would be paid smaller amounts for their less responsible and less time-consuming efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">There are other facts in the record which provide support for the board\u2019s finding that plaintiff is an \"employee\u201d within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The newspaper business relies primarily upon youngsters for door to door delivery. Testimony given at the hearing by the individual who acted as its treasurer, secretary and business manager established that the defendant, Monroe Evening News, required its regular carriers to find substitutes when they were unable to work.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\"><em>\"Q. </em>So you do know that Bobbie Edwards is permitted to hire substitutes to go out and take care of his job for him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">\"A. It is his responsibility to find somebody else to carry his route if he is not there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>You do not exercise any supervision over that activity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\"><em>\"A. </em>That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">\"Q. He can have whoever he wants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\"><em>\"A. </em>That is right, he can have his grandmother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-14\"><em>\"Q. </em>And age is no bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-15\"><em>\u2019A. </em>No, because we have no responsibility as to who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>carries the paper. We go into a contract with whoever and it is up to him to find a substitute.\u201d 1975 WCABO 472-473.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The board properly found that the substitute carriers and helpers, such as Higgins, were part of defendant newspaper\u2019s distribution system. Defendant could have guarded against the use of very young helpers by limiting or supervising the carrier\u2019s authority to hire substitutes and helpers. The board observed:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\"It is not our function to engage in an exercise in apologetics for the realities of the relationship created between defendant and its carriers. This looseness in method of operation is the creation and responsibility of defendant. Different rules could have been established but were not. Having, created the system, defendant must assume responsibility for the legal consequences.\u201d 1975 WCABO 471-472.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We do not share the fear expressed by both defendant and the Court of Appeals that affirmance of the award in the instant matter will dangerously extend the act into an \"entirely new dimension\u201d. 70 Mich App 414. We share the conviction expressed by the appeal board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\"Given the facts there is nothing astonishing or earthshaking about the result reached herein.\u201d 1975 WCABO 472.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The board\u2019s factual determination that a contract of employment existed between plaintiff and defendant warrants the award to plaintiff of benefits for injuries sustained in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>versed and the award of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Costs to appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-5\">Levin and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Kav-ANAGH, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b95-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5D\"><em>(to reverse). </em>The act defines the term \"employee\u201d as meaning</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">\"[e]very person in the service of another, under any contract of hire, express or implied, <em>including </em>* * * <em>minors, </em>who <em>shall be considered the same as </em>and have the same power to contract as adult employees.\u201d MCL 418.161(l)(b); MSA 17.237(161)(l)(b) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Imposing on youngsters a higher burden of proof or persuasion and applying a more stringent standard of appellate review than for adults, as would</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">the lead opinion, conflicts with the legislative directive that minors \"shall be considered <em>the same </em>as\u201d adult employees. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Although the claimant in the instant case was not an adult, the question is \"the same\u201d: was the claimant in the service of another under a \"contract of hire\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">Age may not be considered as a factor \"when determining whether an employment relationship exists\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">The lead opinion states that there could be no \"contract of hire\u201d unless the substitute newsboy and Higgins \"agreed\u201d to an exchange of intended benefits and detriments, and unless Higgins so agreed \"because\u201d in exchange he would receive a dime, bottle of pop, or candy.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>A workers\u2019 compensation claimant, adult or minor, need not, however, show either an \"agreement\u201d with his employer or that but for promised compensation he would not have performed the work. A contract of hire need not be bilateral, it may be unilateral: an offer of compensation which may be accepted by doing the expected work.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">If such an offer is made and. the expected work is performed, there is a contract of hire although there was no bilateral agreement and although the worker might have performed the work gratuitously, if asked to do so, out of a desire to be helpful or to satisfy some personal desire of participation in the enterprise or other motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">An employer who has offered compensation may not refuse to pay benefits to an injured worker who performed expected work because there was no bilateral agreement, nor may he seek to prove that the worker might have performed the work gratuitously if the employer had asked him to do so and had not offered or promised compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Moreover, Higgins proved to the satisfaction of the WCAB that compensation was offered dr promised, from which it would be reasonable to infer i) that it was thereby sought to induce him to work, ii) that he was thereby so induced, iii) that he worked \"because\u201d of such inducement, and iv) that such inducement and work were an intended exchange of \"benefits\u201d and \"detriments\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Assuming that Higgins must show that he worked \"because\u201d of the offer or promise of compensation, it was for the WCAB, not this Court as a matter of law, to resolve that factual issue and in so doing draw the inferences in the application of the principles adverted to in the lead opinion to the evidence produced by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The sense of the act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is that where the work of the principal (Monroe Evening News) is contracted out to an exempt or uninsured employer it is as responsible as if the injured worker has been \"immediately employed\u201d by it. Therefore to focus on the Handler-Higgins relationship is too narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Newspaper publishing is a business that extensively employs youngsters to deliver to the door. Newscarriers indisputably are entitled to the benefits of the workers\u2019 compensation act; it is a question of fact, not of law, whether, at the time of injury, Higgins was engaged in such work under a contract of hire as part of the distribution system of the Monroe Evening News.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">A newspaper employee testified that if a carrier was absent for a day, \"[t]hey would ask him to either get a substitute or they would replace him\u201d. He also said \"when they can\u2019t deliver the papers, it is up to them to find a substitute\u201d. \"[H]e can have his grandmother.\u201d A practice developed of using helpers. The newspaper did not limit carrier authority to hire substitutes and helpers, nor did it supervise the hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In the situations adverted to in the lead opinion, where claimants who contributed their services were denied compensation, the entire class of workers to which the injured worker belonged were regarded as volunteers who worked gratuitously.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Higgins, in contrast, was doing the same work that others who would be entitled to benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>were doing. It is not appropriate to deny benefits as a matter of law because Higgins was younger and what he was to receive was of lesser value or because there would be no coverage had he been doing like work for a friend or neighbor rather than as part of the newspaper\u2019s distribution system.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The expressed concern about workers\u2019 compensation liability being imposed upon parents or neighbors for household chores performed by youngsters is misplaced; under the act \"no private employer\u201d is liable to any person who is employed by him as a \"household domestic servant for less than 35 hours per week for 13 weeks or longer during the preceding 52 weeks\u201d and a \"wife, child or other member of the employer\u2019s family residing in the home\u201d is specifically excluded from the definition of \"household domestic servant\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The question whether exceptions should be made to the general scope of coverage for service at charitable or patriotic institutions has been the subject of legislation in a number of states and of judicial opinions reaching varying results in the same and differing factual situations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The Court need not today intimate a view regarding the scope or legitimacy of exceptions for social situations, or where the service is rendered to a charitable or patriotic organization. The implication of broad and undefined exceptions into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation jurisprudence of this state is inappropriate. The business of publishing a newspaper has none of the earmarks of a social, charitable or patriotic undertaking. It is not expected that anyone, even if young or very young, will deliver newspapers gratuitously.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\"> This conceptual framework is adopted in the instant case for two reasons: (1) Throughout the litigation the relationship between the defendant and its newsboys has been treated factually as one of principal \u2014 independent contractor. (2) The issue presented is not the nature of this relationship, the distinction between employees and independent contractors, but the existence of the employment relationship itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\"> \"Nothing in this act shall apply to or prohibit any minor from engaging in:</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u201c(a) Street trades, except as prohibited under section 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\"(b) Domestic work or chores in connection with private residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\"(c) Farm work.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">\"(d) Employment in a trade in which the parent or duly appointed guardian of such minor is self-employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">\u201c(e) Employment in a business owned and operated by such parent or guardian.
