Second, we affirm the trial court on different grounds and remand in accordance with our holding that since plaintiff is not eligible for a governmental Medicaid benefit \"provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state\u201d, any set-off pursuant to \u00a7 3109(1) is impermissible as no cognizable governmental benefit exists to be subtracted. We express no opinion with respect to the propriety of a set-off of redundant, accident-related, <em>ex gratia </em>governmental transfer coverage. Finally, we hold that the seemingly absolute language of \u00a7 3116 which permits subtraction of tort recoveries from personal injury protection no-fault benefits must be read in connection with \u00a7 3135, which allows tort recovery for \"noneconomic loss\u201d, to the effect that there may be subtraction for tort recoveries when the tort recovery includes damages for losses for which personal injury protection benefits were paid, but not for noneconomic recoveries permitted under \u00a7 3135.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Plaintiff Deborah Workman was injured and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>rendered a paraplegic in a one-vehicle automobile accident on August 22, 1974, in Newaygo County, while an occupant of an automobile owned and being operated by her sister, Nancy Jo Fessenden (now Nancy Jo Magoon). As a consequence of the accident plaintiff sustained severe and disabling injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In early August, 1974, plaintiff, her husband James Workman, Jr., and their child moved from an apartment into a travel trailer owned by plaintiff\u2019s father-in-law, James Workman, Sr. The trailer was located on James Workman, Sr.\u2019s property, approximately 40 to 50 feet from his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In mid-August, 1974, either three or four days prior to the accident, plaintiff, her husband, and child went to stay with plaintiff\u2019s younger sister, Jody Fessenden, at the residence of her mother, Mrs. Joann Fessenden, so the younger sister would not be alone while her mother was away on vacation. When the accident occurred on August 22, 1974, plaintiff, her husband, and child were still staying at Mrs. Fessenden\u2019s residence. However, they planned to return to the trailer as soon as Mr. Workman\u2019s parents returned from a vacation they were to take when their son and his family went to Mrs. Fessenden\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">When the accident occurred, neither plaintiff nor her husband owned a motor vehicle. Because of this fact, on November 29, 1974, plaintiff filed suit to obtain declaratory judgment in Kent Circuit Court to determine which of three insurance companies was responsible for providing her personal injury protection insurance benefits under Michigan\u2019s No-Fault Insurance Act, 1972 PA 294 as amended, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq. </em>(hereinafter referred to as the \"No-Fault Act\u201d or \"the act\u201d). Because neither plaintiff nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>her husband owned a motor vehicle themselves, the relevant statutory provision for determining which insurer was responsible to her for personal injury protection insurance benefits is \u00a7 3114. Under \u00a7 3114(1), as amended by 1975 PA 137, \"a personal protection insurance policy applies to accidental bodily injury to the person named in the policy, his spouse <em>and a relative of either domiciled in the same </em>householdThus, arguably, plaintiffs mother\u2019s insurer, Wolverine Insurance Company, was responsible for providing plaintiffs personal injury benefits if plaintiff was \"domiciled in the same household\u201d as her mother. Or, arguably, plaintiffs father-in-law\u2019s insurer, Community Services Insurance Company, was responsible for providing plaintiffs personal injury benefits if plaintiff was \"a relative\u201d to him and was \"domiciled in the same household\u201d. However, if neither of the above situations were applicable, i.e., \u00a7 3114(1) was not applicable to this case, then \u00a73114(4)(a) would come into effect. This provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">\"(4) Except as provided in subsections (1) to (3), a person suffering accidental bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle shall claim personal protection insurance benefits from insurers in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\"(a) The insurer of the owner or registrant of the vehicle occupied.\u201d MCL 500.3114(4); MSA 24.13114(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">If \u00a7 3114(4)(a) were applicable, plaintiffs sister Nancy Jo Fessenden\u2019s insurer, Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange, would be responsible for providing her personal injury benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">On May 5, 1975, the trial court granted a summary judgment of no cause of action to Wolverine Insurance Company on the . insurance policy cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ing plaintiffs mother, Mrs. Joann Fessenden, on the basis that plaintiff was not domiciled at her mother\u2019s residence when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On September 19, 1975, after trial between plaintiff and the remaining two defendants, Community Services Insurance Company and Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange, the court held defendant Community Services Insurance Company (plaintiffs father-in-law\u2019s insurer) responsible for providing plaintiff personal injury protection insurance benefits under the No-Fault Act. In addition, the court held there was no cause of action as to defendant Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange (plaintiffs sister\u2019s insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The proceedings at this point become factually complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">On October 2, 1975, plaintiff made a motion to reopen proofs and for summary judgment with respect to the following relief she prayed for in the first amended complaint of April 18, 1975:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">\"Comes now the above named plaintiff and amends her complaint by addition to the prayer for relief as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">\"(e) determine that benefits payable to plaintiff under the No-Fault Automobile Insurance Statute are not subject to reduction by benefits paid or payable to plaintiff by Michigan Department of Social Services under its Medicaid program; that is [MCL 500.3109(1); MSA 24.13109(1)] does not apply to benefits paid or payable under the Medicaid program operated by Michigan Department of Social Services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">On October 10, 1975, defendant Community Services Insurance Company appealed the judgment in favor of Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange to the Court of Appeals. On October 14, 1975, plaintiff cross-appealed. On this same date, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the court also granted plaintiffs October 2 motion to reopen proofs with respect to the issue stated in her April 18 amended complaint. On November 28, 1975, plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, and the court granted leave to further amend her complaint, this time to include the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\"Comes now the above named plaintiff and further amends her complaint as amended on April 18, 1975, by addition to the prayer for relief as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\"(f) determine that the defendant adjudged by this court to be liable to plaintiff for no-fault benefits is not entitled to subtraction from no-fault benefits accrued nor reimbursement for no-fault benefits paid, in respect to plaintiffs recovery from the third-party tortfeasor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Importantly, while the above proceedings were taking place, plaintiff and her husband had brought suit in tort for the injuries she sustained in the accident. The elements of damages claimed in their complaint were limited to \"noneconomic loss\u201d as provided for by \u00a7 3135 of the No-Fault Act (quoted part IV, p 505 <em>infra </em>and see fn 1 <em>infra). </em>In December, 1975, the case was settled for $17,500, and plaintiff received the entire amount of the settlement proceeds (the above facts relating to this tort suit and the subsequent settlement are acknowledged in the record in a \"Concise Statement of Proceedings and Facts\u201d filed by the parties on February 17, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">On December 22, 1975, the trial court entered an opinion as to the two issues \"reopened\u201d at trial. On January 9, 1976, the trial court entered the following supplemental judgment as to the two \"reopened\u201d issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">\"Now, therefore, it is ordered and adjudged, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>court does hereby determine, that \u00a7 3109(1) of the Michigan No-Fault Automobile Insurance Law [MCL 500.3109(1); MSA 24.13109(1)] does not apply to benefits paid or payable to plaintiff by or through the Michigan Department of Social Services as Medicaid, and that no subtraction shall be made on that account from benefits otherwise payable to or for the benefit of plaintiff under said no-fault law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">\"It is further ordered and adjudged, and the court does hereby determine, that \u00a7 3116 of said no-fault law violates the equal protection provision, article 1, \u00a7 2, and the due process provision, article 1, \u00a7 17, of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, and is therefore unconstitutional, to the extent that it directs subtraction from no-fault benefits otherwise payable to plaintiff for the recovery obtained by her in Kent Circuit Court Case No. 75-17844-NI, <em>Workman v Magoon, </em>and to the extent that it grants the no-fault insurance carrier a lien upon said recovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">(See \u00a7 3116 quoted in part IV, p 506 <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Defendant Community Services Insurance Company then filed an appeal to the Court of Appeals with respect to this supplemental judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">On February 17, 1976, both plaintiff and defendant Community Services Insurance Company joined in application for leave to appeal to this Court prior to decision of the Court of Appeals. Defendant Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange filed a brief in support of this application for leave to appeal. The parties in their \"Concise Statement of Proceedings and Facts\u201d stipulated that the \"issues presented on appeal are these\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\"(a) Which defendant is liable to plaintiff for no-fault benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\"(b) Does \u00a7 3109(1) of the No-Fault Act entitle the liable carrier to subtract from no-fault benefits otherwise due plaintiff the amount paid by Medicaid on plaintiffs medical expense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\"(c) Does \u00a7 3116 of the No-Fault Act entitle the liable carrier to subtract from no-fault benefits otherwise due plaintiff the amount of her recovery from the tortfeasor?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">On June 1, 1976, this Court granted by-pass leave as to these issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">II. Which Defendant Is Responsible to Plaintiff for Payment of Personal Injury Protection Insurance Benefits Under the No-Fault Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The first issue before us is the determination of which defendant, Community Services Insurance Company (hereinafter referred to as Community Services) or Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Exchange (hereinafter referred to as DAIIE), is responsible to plaintiff for payment of personal injury protection insurance benefits under the No-Fault Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">This question arises because neither plaintiff nor her spouse owned a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because of this fact, the relevant statutory scheme for determining which insurance carrier is responsible to plaintiff for payment of personal injury protection insurance benefits is \u00a7 3114 of the act, in particular subsections (1) and (4)(a). Section 3114 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">\"(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), a personal protection insurance policy applies to accidental bodily injury to the person named in the policy, his spouse, and a relative of either domiciled in the same household. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\"(4) Except as provided in subsections (1) to (3), a person suffering accidental bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle shall claim personal protection insurance benefits from insurers in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\"(a) The insurer of the owner or registrant of the vehicle occupied.\u201d MCL 500.3114; MSA 24.13114.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">As our statement of facts indicates, defendant Community Services is the insurer of James Workman, Sr., plaintiff\u2019s father-in-law. Defendant DAIIE is the insurer of Nancy Jo Fessenden, the owner and registrant of the motor vehicle in which plaintiff was an occupant (or passenger) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>when she was injured. At trial, and before us, Community Services argues that it is not responsible to plaintiff for payment of personal injury insurance benefits pursuant to \u00a7 3114(1) because plaintiff was not \"a relative of [and] domiciled in the same household\u201d as its insured, her father-in-law James Workman, Sr. If Community Services is correct in its argument, it is undisputed that DAIIE is responsible to plaintiff for payment of personal injury protection insurance benefits, because its insured, Nancy Jo Fessenden, was, under \u00a7 3114(4)(a), owner and registrant of the motor vehicle in which plaintiff was an occupant when she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Therefore, for purposes of analysis, the dispositive question is whether plaintiff was a \"relative of [and] domiciled in the same household\u201d as her father-in-law James Workman, Sr. If the answer to this is yes, Community Services is responsible to plaintiff for payment of personal injury protection insurance benefits. If the answer is no, DAIIE is responsible to plaintiff for these benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">We agree with the trial court that the answer to this question is yes: plaintiff was a \"relative of [and] domiciled in the same household\u201d as her father-in-law, James Workman, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">In reaching this conclusion, it is necessary to address, analytically, two considerations: (1) whether plaintiff was a \"relative\u201d of Community Services\u2019 insured, plaintiff\u2019s father-in-law, James Workman, Sr.; and (2) whether plaintiff was \"domiciled in the same household\u201d as James Workman, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The consideration of whether plaintiff was a \"relative\u201d of her father-in-law, James Workman, Sr., need not detain us long. Community Services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>in its brief, concedes the fact that as a matter of law \"plaintiff is a relative of Mr. Workman, Sr.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Whether plaintiff was \"domiciled in the same household\u201d as James Workman, Sr., is, analytically, a more complicated consideration. It has not been brought to our attention, nor have we been able to find a case which deals specifically with the interpretation of an insurance policy or statute containing the language \"domiciled in the same household\u201d. However, the parties to this case have brought to our attention a body of law which deals with the question of whether a person is a \"resident\u201d of an insured\u2019s \"household\u201d under particular insurance policies. Although the statutory language of \u00a7 3114(1) refers to persons <em>\"domiciled </em>in the same household\u201d as an insured, we believe this body of law is analytically applicable to the consideration before us. We conclude this because, in this state, the terms \"domicile\u201d and \"residence\u201d are legally synonymous (except in special circumstances).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Our review of both Michigan opinions and opinions of our sister state courts first reveals the general principle that the terms \"resident\u201d of an insured\u2019s \"household\u201d or, to the same effect, \"domiciled in the same household\u201d as an insured, have \"no absolute meaning\u201d, and that their meaning \"may vary according to the circumstances\u201d. <em>Cal-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Farm Ins Co v Boisseranc, </em>151 Cal App 2d 775, 781; 312 P2d 401, 404 (1957). The \"legal meaning\u201d of these terms must be viewed flexibly, \"only within the context of the numerous factual settings possible\u201d. <em>Montgomery v Hawkeye Security Ins Co, </em>52 Mich App 457, 461; 217 NW2d 449 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Accordingly, both our courts and our sister state courts, in determining whether a person is a \"resident\u201d of an insured\u2019s \"household\u201d or, to the same analytical effect, \"domiciled in the same household\u201d as an insured, have articulated a number of factors relevant to this determination. In considering these factors, no one factor is, in itself, determinative; instead, each factor must be balanced and weighed with the others.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among the relevant factors are the following: (1) the subjective or declared intent of the person of remaining, either permanently or for an indefinite or unlimited length of time, in the place he contends is his \"domicile\u201d or \"household\u201d; <em>Hartzler v Radeka, </em>265 Mich 451; 251 NW 554 (1933); <em>Henry v Henry, </em>362 Mich 85, 101; 106 NW2d 570 (1960); <em>Iowa National Mutual Ins Co v Boatright, </em>33 Colo App 124, 127; 516 P2d 439, 440 (1973); <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co v Home Indemnity Co, </em>241 Cal App 2d 303; 50 Cal Rptr 508 (1966); (2) the formality or informality of the relationship between the person and the members of the household; <em>Iowa National Mutual Ins Co v Boatright, supra; Pamperin v Milwaukee Mutual Ins Co, </em>55 Wis 2d 27, 33; 197 NW2d 783, 788 (1972); (3) whether the place where the person lives is in the same house, within the same curtilage or upon the same premises, <em>Mazzilli v Accident &amp; Casualty Ins Co of Winterthur, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Switzerland, </em>35 NJ 1; 170 A2d 800, 804 (1961);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (4) the existence of another place of lodging by the person alleging \"residence\u201d or \"domicile\u201d in the household; <em>Iowa National Mutual Ins Co v Boatright, supra; </em>see also <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co v Holloway, </em>423 F2d 1281 (CA 10, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">When the above factors are tested against the facts in the record in this case, it is overwhelmingly clear, as the trial court held, that plaintiff was \"domiciled in the same household\u201d as her father-in-law, James Workman, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">First, the record reveals facts indicating it was plaintiffs intention to remain living in the trailer on the property of James Workman, Sr., for at least an indefinite length of time. Plaintiff testified that although she, her husband and child were temporarily staying with her younger sister in her mother\u2019s home when the accident occurred, if the accident had not happened, it was her family\u2019s intention to have gone back to the trailer and remain living there \"for an indefinite period of time\u201d. Plaintiff further testified that she and her husband were not looking for any other place to live and that she considered the trailer as her home. In addition, she testified that her family\u2019s mailing address was the same as her father-in-law\u2019s. Second, the record reveals facts indicating that the relationship between plaintiff, her hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>band and child, and her father-in-law\u2019s family was informal and friendly. Plaintiff testified that she was welcome to use and did use all of the facilities of the house <em>(i.e., </em>telephone, washers and dryers, and electricity, by cord from the house to the trailer), that her family ate meals with the senior Workman\u2019s family, and that during the day she and her child were \"in and out\u201d of the house. Third, the record reveals that the trailer in which plaintiff and her family lived was unquestionably on the same premises, or property, as her father-in-law\u2019s house, and that the trailer belonged to her father-in-law. The trailer was located 40 to 50 feet from the house. The electrical power for the trailer was supplied by a cord attached to the house and water for the trailer was provided by means of a hose connected to the house. Furthermore, testimony established there was no fence or physical barrier of any type between the house and the trailer. Fourth, the record reveals that plaintiff and her family had left the apartment they were living in prior to moving into the trailer and had no intention of returning there (or to any other lodging).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">For these reasons, we hold that plaintiff was, under \u00a7 3114(1) of the No-Fault Act, \"a relative of [and] domiciled in the same household\u201d as her father-in-law, James Workman, Sr. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Community Services Insurance Company is responsible to plaintiff for personal injury protection insurance \u2022 benefits under the No-Fault Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">III. Whether \u00a7 3109(1) of the No-Fault Act Applies to Medicaid Benefits Authorized by the Social Welfare Act and Administered by the Michigan Department of Social Services</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">In 1974, plaintiff was rendered a paraplegic as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>consequence of an automobile accident. Plaintiff claimed state \"Medicaid\u201d benefits, MCL 400.105 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 16.490(15) <em>et seq., </em>as a \"medically indigent individual\u201d, MCL 400.106; MSA 16.490(16),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> under the Michigan Social Welfare Act, 1939 PA 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Section 3109(1) of the No-Fault Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\"Benefits <em>provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state </em>or the federal government shall be subtracted from the personal protection insurance benefits otherwise payable for the injury.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)

Any consideration of the propriety of a \u00a7 3109(1) governmental benefit set-off is thereby rendered unnecessary; there exist no \"benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of\u2019 Michigan to be arguably set off by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The Social Welfare Act, 1939 PA 280, was enacted by the Michigan Legislature \" * * * to protect the welfare of the people of this state; to provide general relief, hospitalization, infirmary and medical care to poor or unfortunate persons * * * \u201d, long title of 1939 PA 280. \"Medicaid\u201d is a \"program for medical assistance for the medically indigent\u201d, MCL 400.105; MSA 16.490(15), authorized by the Social Welfare Act and administered by the Michigan Department of Social Services, MCL 400.105; MSA 16.490(15). The Medicaid program is required to be administered pursuant to subchapter XIX, 42 USC 1396 <em>et seq., </em>of the Federal Social Security Act, MCL 400.105; MSA 16.490(15). Subchapter XIX was enacted by the United States Congress</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\"For the purpose of enabling each State, * * * to furnish (1) medical assistance on behalf of * * * disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, * * * 42 USC 1396.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">It is clear from the sense of the above provisions as well as the express language of \u00a7 105 of the Social Welfare Act that eligibility for Medicaid is contingent upon the finding that a claimant is \"medically indigent\u201d insofar as that individual\u2019s income or collateral resources are concerned. In fact, \u00a7 106 of the Social Welfare Act specifically defines a \"medically indigent individual\u201d in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\"(b) His need for the type of medical assistance available under this act for which application has been made has been professionally established <em>and no payment for it is available through the legal obligation of a contractor, public or private, to pay or provide for the care without regard to the income or resources of the patient. </em>The department shall be subrogated to any right of recovery which a patient may have for the cost of hospitalization, pharmaceutical services, physician services, and nursing services not to. exceed the amount of funds expended by the department for such care and treatment of the patient.

This finding requires us to conclude that Medicaid benefits are not in the nature of \u00a7 3109(1) benefits \"required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government\u201d; any attempted set-off of plaintiff\u2019s Medicaid benefits would, therefore, not only be unnecessary but absurd since no \"benefits\u201d exist to be set off.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Further, the fact that plaintiff has been \"provided\u201d Medicaid benefits covering injuries sustained in her accident does not alter this result.

As such, we are not here confronted with a state governmental benefit \"provided or required to be provided under the laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>any state or the federal government\u201d, an element requisite to the operation of \u00a7 3109(1). Accordingly, absent this pivotal element, we need not reach the \u00a7 3109(1) set-off urged by the parties and adjudicated by the trial court as there exists no cognizable governmental benefit for the insurer to subtract from plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 3107(a) personal protection insurance benefits under the mandates of \u00a7 3109(1). We, therefore, affirm on different grounds the trial court\u2019s order disallowing the set-off and remand this issue for disposition consistent with this opinion. We express no opinion with respect to the propriety of setting off other redundant, accident-related, <em>ex gratia </em>governmental transfer benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">IV.

See discussion part I, <em>supra, </em>p 488. Also, the record indicates that before the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>entered its supplemental judgment as to this issue, plaintiff settled a tort suit against Nancy Jo Fessenden, the operator of the motor vehicle in which she was injured, for $17,500. This suit was brought pursuant to \u00a7 3135 of the No-Fault Act, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">\"(1) A person remains <em>subject to tort liability for noneconomic loss </em>caused by his ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle <em>only if the injured person has suffered </em>death, serious <em>impairment of body function or permanent serious dis\u00f1gurement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\"(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, <em>tort liability </em>arising from the ownership, maintenance or use within this state of a motor vehicle with respect to which the security required by subsections (3) and (4) of section 3101 was in effect <em>is abolished except as to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\"(a) Intentionally caused harm to persons or property.

(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Plaintiff contends that she is entitled to the full amount of her tort recovery against Nancy Jo Fessenden (subject to attorney fees and costs). Community Services argues that \u00a7 3116 of the No-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Fault Act entitles it to subtract this amount (exclusive of reasonable attorney fees and costs) from the personal injury protection insurance benefits it must pay plaintiff. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\"(1) A subtraction from personal protection insurance benefits shall not be made because of the value of a claim in tort based on the same accidental bodily injury. However, after recovery is realized upon a tort claim, a subtraction shall be made to the extent of the recovery, exclusive of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other reasonable expenses incurred in effecting the recovery. If personal protection insurance benefits have already been received, the claimant shall repay to the insurers out of the recovery a sum equal to the benefits received, but not more than the recovery exclusive of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other reasonable expenses incurred in effecting the recovery. The insurer shall have a lien on the recovery to this extent. A recovery by an injured person or his estate for loss suffered by him shall not be subtracted in calculating benefits due a dependent after the death and a recovery by a dependent for loss suffered by the dependent after the death shall not be subtracted in calculating benefits due the injured person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\"(2) A personal protection insurer with a right of reimbursement under subsection (1), if suffering loss from inability to collect reimbursement out of a payment received by a claimant upon a tort claim is entitled to indemnity from a person who, with notice of the insurer\u2019s interest, made such a payment to the claimant without making the claimant and the insurer joint payees as their interests may appear or without obtaining the insurer\u2019s consent to a different method of payment.\u201d MCL 500.3116; MSA 24.13116.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The trial court, in its supplemental judgment, declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">\"It is further ordered and adjudged, and the court does hereby determine, that \u00a7 3116 of said no-fault law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>violates the equal protection provision, art 1, \u00a7 2, and the due process provision, art 1, \u00a7 17, of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, and is therefore unconstitutional, to the extent that it directs subtraction from no-fault benefits otherwise payable to plaintiff for the recovery obtained by her in Kent Circuit Court Case No. 75-17844-NI, <em>Workman v Magoon, </em>and to the extent that it grants the no-fault insurance carrier a lien upon said recovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Although we agree with the <em>effect </em>of the trial court\u2019s judgment, i.e., Community Services may <em>not </em>subtract the amount of plaintiffs tort recovery (exclusive of reasonable attorney fees and costs) pursuant to \u00a7 3116, we disagree with its disposition of this issue on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">It is a well-established, cardinal rule of statutory construction that provisions of a statute must be construed in light of the other provisions of the statute, in such a manner as to carry out the apparent purpose of the Legislature and to permit its constitutional validity to be sustained. <em>In re Petition of </em>Bryant, 323 Mich 424, 437; 35 NW2d 371 (1949).

Accordingly, in light of \u00a7 3135, we construe \u00a7 3116 to mean that an insurance carrier paying personal injury protection benefits is entitled to reimbursement from the tort recovery of a person injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident only if, and to the extent that, the tort recovery includes damages for losses for which personal injury protection benefits were paid. Thus, since \u00a7 3135 abolishes tort remedy for losses covered under the personal injury protection insurance provisions of the act, an injured plaintiff should recover nothing for which the insurance carrier will have a right of reimbursement under \u00a73116. We believe this interpretation of \u00a7 3116 not only gives full effect to \u00a7 3135, but it also effectuates the essential purposes of this section, namely, to prevent <em>double recovery </em>of economic loss by those persons who retain their right to sue in tort for economic loss under the act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Defendant Community Services citing <em>Pelkey v Elsea Realty &amp; Investment Co, </em>394 Mich 485; 232 NW2d 154 (1975), raises the thoughtful and interesting point that under the law of workers\u2019 compensation, subtraction from benefits to the extent of total third-party tort recovery minus reasonable expenses and attorney fees is authorized. However, the analogy of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act to the No-Fault Act is not exact and <em>Pelkey </em>is not controlling. As plaintiff correctly points out, the tort recovery under the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act is for all damages, economic and noneconomic, MCL 418.827; MSA 17.237(827), whereas a \u00a7 3135 recovery is only for \"noneconomic loss\u201d which by definition excludes all benefits payable under no-fault. This comparison is useful, however, because it does indicate that the Legislature, although by different methods, in both acts provided against double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Therefore, we hold, on the basis of statutory construction, that \u00a7 3116 of the No-Fault Act does not entitle Community Services to subtract plaintiff\u2019s tort recovery from the personal injury protection benefits it must pay plaintiff, because plaintiff\u2019s tort recovery was made pursuant to \u00a7 3135 of the act and included damages for losses for which personal injury protection benefits are not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">For the reasons set out above, we therefore hold (1) that plaintiff was \"domiciled in the same house<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>hold\u201d as her father-in-law and affirm the trial judge on this issue; (2) that Medicaid benefits are not subject to a \u00a7 3109(1) set-off, affirm on different grounds the trial judge\u2019s order disallowing the set-off and remand for a disposition of this issue consistent with this opinion, expressing no opinion as to the propriety of a \u00a7 3109(1) set-off of redundant, accident-related, <em>ex gratia </em>governmental transfer coverage; and (3) that the language of \u00a7 3116 permitting subtraction from no-fault benefits of tort recoveries must be read in connection with \u00a7 3135 allowing tort recoveries for \"noneconomic loss\u201d, thereby excluding plaintiff\u2019s tort recovery of noneconomic loss under \u00a7 3135, and, accordingly affirm the trial judge, but on the basis of statutory construction rather than unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded in part.

See <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">The fact that plaintiff has standing pursuant to this rule with respect to the issues raised is undisputed. We wish to note, however, that in <em>Shavers v Attorney General, supra, </em>we held that the plaintiffs in that case lacked standing to seek declaratory relief with respect to the question of whether \u00a7 3116 of the No-Fault Act entitles an insurance carrier to subtract from personal injury protection insurance benefits otherwise due a person injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident the amount the injured person recovered from a tortfeasor. Our holding was based on the fact that \"[tjhere is no proof on the record that any plaintiff had realized a tort claim which an insurer subtracted from the personal injury protection benefits which he received or to which he was entitled.\u201d 402 Mich 592, fn 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">We clearly have no such problem here with respect to this issue.

The question is whether the trailer and the house or those there residing constitute a single household so as to require the father-in-law\u2019s insurer to pay no-fault benefits to her. We would hold that Workman was not domiciled, within the meaning of the act, in her father-in-law\u2019s household and therefore the insurer of the vehicle in which she was a passenger is obliged to pay no-fault benefits to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The second issue concerns the application of the set-off provisions of \u00a7 3109(1) to Medicaid payments received by Workman. We concur in the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The third issue concerns reimbursement to an insurer for no-fault benefits it has paid out of a third-party tort recovery. Section 3116 originally provided that \"after recovery is realized upon a tort claim, a subtraction [from first-party benefits] shall be made to the extent of the recovery * * *. If personal protection insurance benefits have already been received, the claimant shall repay to the insurers out of the recovery a sum equal to the benefits received, but not more than the recovery exclusive of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other reasonable expenses incurred in effecting the recovery\u201d. Recently, on October 16, 1978, \u00a7 3116 was amended to limit reimbursement of the no-fault insurer to situations where the defendant was uninsured, or the accident occurred out of state or the injury was intentionally inflicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because it appears that the Legislature intended to clarify the statute, we concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that the insurer is not entitled to reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Neither Workman nor her husband owned an automobile or had a no-fault policy at the time of the accident. The question is which of three no-fault insurers was required to pay no-fault benefits to her. Wolverine Insurance Company insured her mother (with whom she was temporarily residing); Community Services Insurance Company insured her father-in-law (who owned the trailer and property where she was permanently residing); Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange insured her sister (the owner and driver of the automobile in which she was injured).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">We all agree that Workman was not domiciled in her mother\u2019s household at the time of the accident. She was merely visiting for a week to keep her little sister company.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The circuit court concluded that Workman was a relative domiciled in her father-in-law\u2019s household and held that his insurer was responsible for payment of her no-fault benefits. In so holding, the court stressed the freedom of movement between the two houses, the electric and water connections to the main house, and that the trailer was a travel trailer not permanently affixed to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">This Court affirms that decision, applying a four-factor test to determine if Workman was domiciled in the same household as her father-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Workman, a daughter-in-law, is clearly a relative of the insured. She had no permanent residence other than the trailer and intended to continue to live there for an indefinite period. The question, therefore, is not whether she was a \"relative\u201d or \"domiciled\u201d in the trailer but, rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>whether the trailer and the house or those there residing constituted a single <em>household.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Factors (1) and (4) of the Court\u2019s test, \"the subjective or declared intent of the person of remaining * * * in the place he contends is his 'domicile\u2019 or 'household\u2019 \u201d, and \"the existence of another place of lodging by the person alleging 'residence\u2019 or 'domicile\u2019 in the household\u201d, would be appropriate to a determination of which of several sometime abodes is the domicile,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but have no bearing on whether the trailer and the house constituted a single <em>household.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Also of little assistance is factor (2), \"the formality or informality of the relationship between the person and the members of the household\u201d, and, as it is stated, factor (3), \"whether the place where the person lives is in the same house, within the same curtilage, or upon the same premises\u201d. If the senior and junior Workmans lived in a two-family dwelling (\"in the same house\u201d) or side-by-side in an apartment house (\"upon the same premises\u201d) and enjoyed a close relationship they would still be members of separate households, notwithstanding an informal relationship, the shared house or premises and curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In concluding that there was a single household the Court points to several factors: shared mailing address, close relationship, access to facilities, occasional shared meals, and shared grounds. Two families in a two-family or apartment house could have the same relationship, but would not constitute one household.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">A number of factors point to the opposite conclusion, and indicate that Workman was not a member of her father-in-law\u2019s household. The junior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Workmans had been married for four years and had a child. They had always lived apart from the senior Workmans except for three or four months in 1972, and had been living in a different town for about a year before moving into the trailer. They moved to the trailer to be within walking distance of the son\u2019s new job, not to maximize the relationship with the in-laws. The junior Work-mans did their own grocery shopping, prepared their own meals (except for an occasional dinner with the parents), had their own bath and toilet facilities, refrigerator and television.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The question then becomes whether the statutory language, \"domiciled in the same household\u201d, should be construed to include a married son\u2019s separate abode simply because he enjoys a close relationship with his parents and has access to their house and draws water and electricity from their house.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">We construe this clause in the context in which it is found, a provision of the statute allocating responsibility between insurers, not one creating entitlements. If the question were whether Workman is eligible to recover no-fault benefits there would be a reason \u2014 to effectuate the legislative purpose of providing no-fault benefits \u2014 to opt for a liberal construction of the word \"household\u201d to afford maximum coverage. Here, we decide not whether no-fault benefits are payable at all but which of two insurers will pay them. A liberal construction will not effectuate the purpose to provide benefits, and may distort another legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Sections 3114 and 3115 establish the order in which no-fault insurers are required to pay benefits. An injured person looks first to his own insurer, then to the insurer of a relative in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>household, then to the insurer of the owner of the vehicle occupied when the accident occurred, and then to the driver\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Persons who live in the same household with an insured but who are not themselves insured are a little like insureds and a little like those not insured. They stand in a close relationship both to an insured and, by reason of the accident, to a covered vehicle. The Legislature has chosen to treat an uninsured person as a unit with an insured relative provided they are \"domiciled in the same household\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Sections 3114 and 3115 appear to be a carefully considered division of responsibility between the insurer of the relative of an uninsured person and the insurer of the vehicle in the accident. A member of the same household looks to the relative\u2019s insurer, a member of a different household looks to the vehicle\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Because the construction placed on the word \"household\u201d completely determines liability and the Legislature appears to have had a neutral purpose and to have attempted to draw the line down the middle between the two insurers, we should accord that word as exact a meaning as possible. Doing so will deny no-fault benefits to no one.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Too liberal a construction of \"domiciled in the same household\u201d does violence to the statute\u2019s allocation of the burden of providing first-party benefits by imposing additional insureds on the householder\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Insurers should be able to calculate their risks. Knowledge of the approximate number of persons covered by the policies they issue may be crucial in such calculations, and therefore the persons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>whom they are responsible should be readily identifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Because a liberal construction of \"household\u201d does potential harm to the system\u2019s priorities, and a strict construction does not, we would hold that members of the same household must live in the same dwelling unit. Workman was not a member of her father-in-law\u2019s household. We would hold that DAIIE, the insurer of the vehicle, is required to provide Workman with no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">We concur with the Court\u2019s disposition of the Medicaid set-off issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">We are unable to join in Part IV of the Court\u2019s opinion because we would not have reached the same result but for the recent amendatory legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The Court concludes, independently of the recent amendment, that \u00a7 3116 as originally enacted had the meaning given it by the amendment and therefore the no-fault insurer is not entitled to reimbursement from the tort settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The original language of \u00a73116 was unconditional: \" * * * after recovery is realized upon a tort claim, a subtraction shall be made to the extent of the recovery * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">There is no indication in \u00a7 3116 as enacted that it was to apply only in cases of double recovery. Many were struck by the seeming unfairness of the provision, but that perception does not authorize a court to rewrite it in the Legislature\u2019s name. While the Court\u2019s arguments are plausible, they seem to us to assume too much \u2014 that the sole purpose of reimbursement is to prevent double recovery \u2014 and to ignore other possible purposes. There are other ways in which unconditional reimbursement would further the goals of the no-fault system: there would be less litigation because an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>injured person would have to anticipate a tort recovery large enough to pay attorneys\u2019 fees and reimburse the no-fault insurer and still yield a net recovery sufficient to make the effort worthwhile; less litigation would mean less of the premium dollar would be expended on attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs and more would be available to pay insurance benefits to injured persons; court congestion should be relieved; the cost of insurance should be reduced as money is plowed back into the system through reimbursement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">These alternative rationales prevent us from saying that a statute requiring reimbursement whether or not the recovery is duplicative is unconstitutional or that the Legislature originally must have intended that reimbursement be required only where there is duplicative recovery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">1978 PA 461 has become law, and it is necessary to reconsider Workman\u2019s claim in its light.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The no-fault act was passed six years ago and the meaning and constitutionality of \u00a7 3116 have been in dispute ever since.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>While this litigation was pending and the insurance industry and consumers were awaiting our construction of the section, the Legislature spoke to the issue, apparently in response to the uncertainty regarding its proper construction and validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Whether legislation is to be applied retroactively depends on legislative intent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An enactment need not be made explicitly retroactive; legislative intent may be evidenced in other ways. When amendments are passed in the midst of controversy over a provision\u2019s meaning, the usual presumption that an amendatory act declares new law is overcome and a legislative intent to clarify rather than to change the law may be inferred.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">This principle was accepted by this Court in <em>Detroit Edison Co v Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>320 Mich 506, 520; 31 NW2d 809 (1948), where an amendment to a taxing statute, passed after the tax years in question, resolved a dispute concerning the construction of the statute between the Department of Revenue and the State Board of Tax Appeals.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The amendment to \u00a7 3116 began as House Bill 5925.
