Pursuant to GCR 1963, 932.24, Judge Laster, the respondent, has petitioned this Court to reject the recommendation of the Commission claiming that:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">1. A <em>de novo </em>review of the entire record does not support the Commission\u2019s recommendation of a reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">2. He acted in \"good faith\u201d at all times as a recorder\u2019s court judge and \"good faith\u201d stands as an absolute defense to any allegation of judicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">3. The existence of appellate review to remedy a judge\u2019s conduct divests the Commission of its jurisdiction to review that same conduct for the existence of judicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">We have reviewed the entire record <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and conclude that the conduct attributed to Judge Laster, and found by the Commission, is established. Furthermore, we do not find that either Judge Laster\u2019s \"good faith\u201d intentions or the existence of an appellate avenue for review of Judge Laster\u2019s conduct negates the Commission\u2019s unanimous conclusion that he should be reprimanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">There is no dispute regarding the essential facts in this case. Only the conclusion to be drawn from those facts is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Beginning in December, 1973, the respondent entered a series of 58 orders directing payment to bail bondsman Charles Goldfarb of amounts totaling $35,640 in bond money previously forfeited and paid to Wayne County. In all 58 cases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>which the respondent ordered forfeitures set aside and penalties remitted, the bond had originally been forfeited by another recorder\u2019s court judge. All of the orders were on photocopied forms and were based upon photocopied form petitions with only the names, dates and amounts written in individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Most of the remissions took place on Sunday, but only on those Sundays Judge Laster was sitting as Sunday judge. No notices of any of the petitions of remission were served on the prosecuting attorney or corporation counsel for Wayne County. The respondent acted on petitions in open court, but no stenographic records were made of these proceedings. In two or three instances the judge who had ordered the bond forfeiture had denied a previous motion for refund. No judge of recorder\u2019s court, other than the respondent and suspended Judge Del Rio,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> repeatedly ordered refunds on forfeited bonds that were more than four years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Judge Laster testified that, before acting on the bond remissions in question, he read the statute on bond remission<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and discussed the matter with two former presiding judges of recorder\u2019s court, the court\u2019s judicial assistant and a member of the Supreme Court\u2019s staff. The respondent also testified that he did not believe he was usurping the power of other judges in granting such remissions. Evidently, the practice in recorder\u2019s court concerning bond remissions, as distinguished from other bond procedures, was shrouded in uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Respondent testified that the late Chief Judge Murphy told him that he was empowered to remit forfeitures. He also testified- that the late Chief Judge Leonard had even considered proposing a court rule to clarify matters. The judicial assistant apparently recognized that confusion existed, and still exists, concerning these procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The respondent instructed that copies of the remission orders be given by the Goldfarb Bonding Agency to the prosecuting attorney upon disposition. It is unclear whether copies of the orders were ever delivered to the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office. No member of the prosecuting attorney\u2019s staff ever requested a rehearing in the cases involved in these proceedings. It was the view of the respondent that bond remission was a ministerial action, involving judicial discretion, and as such given no attention by the prosecuting attorney. Respondent testified that, as a prosecuting attorney for 17 years, he never was consulted by a recorder\u2019s court judge on bond remissions. Thus, he believed the absence of prior notice immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The bondsman, Charles Goldfarb, was a longtime acquaintance of the respondent. There is no evidence of record that the respondent was motivated by a scheme to promote the interests of the Goldfarb Bonding Agency. The examiner also acknowledges that there is no evidence of record<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which shows any personal enrichment of Judge Laster. Judge Laster testified that he was not a social friend of Mr. Goldfarb, and he never solicited Mr. Goldfarb for campaign contributions. Judge Laster did admit that Mr. Goldfarb \"judge shopped\u201d him in order to obtain the remissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>It appears, however, that no judges other than the respondent and Judge Del Rio entered multiple refund orders on a group or wholesale basis. Other judges remitted bond payments; certain judges entered more such orders than others. But these judges almost uniformly remitted only those bonds previously forfeited by them or their predecessors in office. The total dollar figure on bonds remitted by Judge Laster was slightly less than twice the total of any judge other than Judge Del Rio.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">A formal complaint in this matter was filed with the Judicial Tenure Commission on January 12, 1977. On February 8, 1977, this Court denied the Commission\u2019s petition for interim suspension and the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss. A master, Judge William Weipert, Jr., of the 38th Judicial Circuit, was appointed. The master conducted a prehearing conference and ordered the formal hearing, which took place on April 25 and 26, 1977. The master filed his report with the Commission on August 18, 1977. He concluded that the respondent should not be suspended and the complaint should be dismissed. On September 30, 1977, the Commission adopted the findings of fact made by the master. The Commission agreed there was no evidence of criminality, but nonetheless found judicial misconduct from facts which gave the appearance of impropriety, and recommended a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">II. Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The respondent initially claims that a <em>de novo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>review of the entire record does not support the Commission\u2019s recommendation of a reprimand. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\"Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. <em>A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety. </em>He must expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny. He must therefore accept restrictions on his conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Pursuant to Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(2), this Court adopted GCR 1963, 932.4, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\".4 Standards of Judicial Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\"(a) A judge shall be personally responsible for his own behavior and for the proper conduct and administration of the court or tribunal in which he presides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">\"(b) A judge shall be deemed guilty of misconduct in office if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">\"(iv) His conduct is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">\"(d) Conduct in violation of the code of judicial conduct or code of professional responsibility and canons, whether the conduct complained of occurred before or after the respondent became a judge or was or was not connected with his judicial office, may constitute mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>conduct in office or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice or other cause delineated in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30. The question in every case is whether the conduct complained of constitutes misconduct in office or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice or there is other cause delineated in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30, not whether a particular canon or disciplinary rule has been violated. All the circumstances are to be considered in deciding whether action by the commission is warranted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">We conclude that the respondent persisted in a course of action which gave the \"appearance of impropriety\u201d and was thus \"clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Several factors specifically give rise to this \"appearance of impropriety\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">1. the <em>ex parte </em>discussion with Goldfarb and the agreement to hear motions wherein Goldfarb, a potential litigant, was seeking the return of a large sum of money from the county treasury;</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">2. the fact that Goldfarb began sending wholesale groups of petitions to the respondent;</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">3. the fact that, with rare exception, no judges other than Judge Laster and suspended Judge Del Rio remitted bonds which were more than three years old while 90 percent of the Laster remissions were older than three years;</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">4. the fact that almost all the bonds remitted by Judge Laster were originally forfeited by another judge or that judge\u2019s predecessor;</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">5. the remissions on the old bonds were accomplished without the prior knowledge of the prosecutor, corporation counsel or court clerk; and</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">6. the fact that the respondent did not assess costs against Goldfarb in any of the 58 cases, but instead merely accepted Goldfarb\u2019s blanket statement that there were none.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Judge Laster\u2019s activities give the appearance of impropriety in that they \"appear\u201d to have involved favoritism and partiality. Regardless of his motivations, respondent created an atmosphere in which Goldfarb could continue to bring to him old bonds for remission and thus effectively by-pass the judges who originally forfeited the bonds. This ongoing pattern of conduct also gives rise to the appearance of \"cronyism\u201d and \"judge shopping\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">This Court, as well as the Commission, acknowledges many of the mitigating factors which the respondent presents. The Commission\u2019s recommendation took into account all the mitigating factors, including \"good faith\u201d. Nevertheless, we agree that these factors do not counterbalance the respondent\u2019s persistent abandonment of statutory procedures, court rules<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and simple fair play.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The respondent next claims, in a series of interrelated issues, that he acted in \"good faith\u201d at all times during these bond remission proceedings and his good faith stands as an absolute defense to any allegation of judicial misconduct. Again, we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">There is no doubt that \"good faith\u201d should be considered as a mitigating factor to acts of misconduct but not as an affirmative defense to charges of misconduct. See, for example, <em>Spruance v Commission on Judicial </em>Qualifications, 13 Cal 3d 778; 119 Cal Rptr 841; 532 P2d 1209 (1975). The Commission has duly weighed the mitigating factors in recommending a public reprimand rather than a more severe penalty. We agree with the Commission\u2019s recommendation in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Finally, the respondent asserts that the existence of appellate review to remedy a judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>conduct divests the Commission of its jurisdiction to review that same conduct for the existence of judicial misconduct. We do not agree. Judicial conduct creating the need for disciplinary action can grow from the same root as judicial conduct creating potential appellate review, but one does not necessarily exclude the other. One path seeks to correct past prejudice to a particular party; the other seeks to prevent potential prejudice to future litigants and the judiciary in general. See <em>In re Judges of Cedar Rapids Municipal Court, </em>256 Iowa 1135; 130 NW2d 553 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">This Court has cited <em>In re Greenberg, </em>442 Pa 411, 416; 280 A2d 370 (1971), and Tamm, <em>Are Courts Going the Way of the Dinosaur?, </em>57 ABA J 228 (March, 1971), in two recent opinions concerning judicial misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\"For generations before and since it has been taught that a judge must possess the confidence of the community; that he must not only be independent and honest, but, equally important, believed by all men to be independent and honest. <em>A cloud of witnesses testify that justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done/ </em>Without the appearance as well as the fact of justice, respect for the law vanishes in a democracy.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">See <em>In the Matter of Del Rio, </em>400 Mich 665, 725; 256 NW2d 727 (1977), and <em>In the Matter of Bennett, </em>403 Mich 178, 198; 267 NW2d 914 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">We believe Judge Laster\u2019s conduct in these bond remission proceedings has fallen short of this standard. His conduct in these matters has displayed, at the very least, an appearance of impropriety. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>An image of favoritism, cronyism and judge shopping is readily discerned. A strong, independent and honest judiciary cannot allow such an image to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Therefore, Judge Laster is forthwith reprimanded for his conduct.</p>\n<judges id=\"b527-6\">Coleman, Fitzgerald, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-15\"> Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\"> <em>In the Matter of Del Rio, </em>400 Mich 665; 256 NW2d 727 (1977); <em>In the Matter of Mikesell, </em>396 Mich 517; 243 NW2d 86 (1976); <em>In re Somers, </em>384 Mich 320; 182 NW2d 341 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\"> Judge Del Rio was suspended from the recorder\u2019s court bench for five years.

What Judge Laster did either violated the law or it did not. Either he abused his office by acting surreptitiously or for his own benefit or he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">The record shows that Judge Laster acted in good faith pursuant to a reasonable and, certainly, arguable construction of the statutes, rules and practices of the Recorder\u2019s Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">Judge Laster viewed the remission of forfeited bonds as a civil matter of concern to the court and the bondsman. He was also concerned that innocent friends or relatives of the defendant, who were sureties on the bonds, would suffer foreclosures of their property although the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>been apprehended and the county had suffered no loss. In his view, the county had no further interest when the defendant had been apprehended at no cost to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Remittance petitions were brought to Judge Laster because he held these views. Unless this Court is prepared to say that a judge may not exercise his discretion to give effect to his judicial philosophies within the bounds of statutes, court rules and practice, it does injustice by reprimanding Judge Laster because Charles Goldfarb, the bondsman, shopped for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Judge Laster remitted the forfeitures of 58 bonds written by Goldfarb.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The remissions were ordered</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">1) in cases where the bond had originally been forfeited by a different judge, an alleged violation of MCL 726.2; MSA 27.3552,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">2) in cases where the bond had been forfeited several years before, an alleged violation of MCL 765.15; MSA 28.902,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">3) without notice to the county, an alleged violation of GCR 1963, 772.4,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>4) on Sundays.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We address each allegation in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">1. The Commission contends that remitting bonds forfeited by other judges constitutes \"review\u201d or \"revision\u201d of an \"order\u201d or \"act\u201d of another judge of the court \"involving personal discretion\u201d. MCL 726.2; MSA 27.3552.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The Master found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">\"Except by isolated error and inadvertence, Judge Laster was careful to make sure that he did not overrule a previous refusal of bond remittance by another judge, instructing his clerk to check each file in this respect. He did not believe that the remissions granted by him in any way overruled the decision of the judge who had originally forfeited the bond. This view cannot be found clearly unreasonable, since <em>forfeiture </em>and <em>remittance </em>are entirely dissimilar [emphasis added]. While the original decision to enter a judgment on the bond is based on a mere ascertainment of whether a principal has failed to appear, the decision to <em>remit </em>a judgment on a bond requires an ascertainment under [MCL 765.15(a);] MSA 28.902(a) of whether the person who forfeited bond or bail is apprehended and the ends of justice have not been thwarted. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">\"Concerning remission of bonds forfeited and paid, as distinguished from other bond procedures * * * , <em>the practice in Recorder\u2019s Court, during the times involved in these proceedings, was shrouded in uncertainty </em>[emphasis added]. Chief Judge Leonard proposed a court rule to clarify the matter so the judges of the court could have a standard to follow. The late Judge Murphy told Judge Laster he was empowered to remit forfeitures. Judge Murphy was the presiding judge at that time. The Recorder\u2019s Court Judicial Assistant recognized that confusion exists.\u201d5 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The Commission itself said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">\"It is easily recognizable that remission is different from forfeiture but it would have been better in those cases where the forfeiting judge was available to present the petition for remission to the forfeiting judge. Thus, the appearance of judge shopping for partiality and favoritism would have been avoided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">2. Judge Laster remitted 44 bonds forfeited more than one year earlier, assertedly in violation of MCL 765.15; MSA 28.902. While some judges thought the statute authorizes remittances only within one year after forfeiture, a number of other judges did not share that view and remitted bonds that had been forfeited more than one year earlier. The Commission does not question Judge Laster\u2019s good faith in construing the statute, with other judges, as making remission mandatory (the statute uses the word \"shall\u201d) if the conditions are met within one year and discretionary thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">3. The Commission charged that the failure to provide the prosecutor with prior notice of the remittance proceedings constituted a violation of GCR 1963, 772.4, concerning \"remission of penalties\u201d.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Master found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\"It was the further view of Judge Laster, found to be held in good faith, that bond remittance was to a large extent ministerial action, although involving exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>judicial discretion, and as such was given no attention by the Prosecuting Attorney but considered to be between the bondsman and the court. <em>As a prosecuting attorney for 17 years, he had never once been consulted by a Recorder\u2019s Court Judge on bond remissions </em>[emphasis added]. Hence he found the absence of notice to the Prosecuting Attorney or absence from the courtroom immaterial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Judge Laster testified that he believed that his duty in remitting bonds was to determine that the requirements of the statute were satisfied. He required that the petition state under oath that the case was closed, the defendant had been brought to justice, and the county had been reimbursed for any costs. If satisfied that those requirements had been met, he entered the orders <em>ex parte, </em>and instructed the clerk to deliver copies of the orders to the prosecutor. The Master said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">\"Judge Laster further instructed his clerk to give a copy of the remittance order to the Prosecuting Attorney upon its filing. 'If the prosecutor had any objections to it he could notify the court, and if necessary I could grant him a rehearing.\u2019 No member of the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s staff ever requested a rehearing in the cases involved in this proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The Master noted Judge Laster\u2019s experience with the informal practices of Recorder\u2019s Court as an assistant prosecutor for 17 years and as a judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">\"As known to Judge Laster from his prior experience as above stated, and after becoming a member of the bench, the Recorder\u2019s Court was a 'court of an informal nature\u2019 with 'very little filing of legal documents,\u2019 and the court rules were 'loosely interpreted.\u2019 'They are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>strictly adhered to by the members of the bench or by the attorneys who practice before the court, both defense attorneys and the Prosecuting Attorney.\u2019 This lack of formality was 'a matter of expeditiousness more than just a matter of lack of concern, due to the great volume of cases coming before the court on a daily basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Consistent with this informality, judges of the Recorder\u2019s Court regularly forfeited bonds <em>ex parte </em>where the defendant failed to show on a given date. Yet, a statute arguably requires notice to the surety in such cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">4. The Commission stresses that 38 of the bonds were remitted on Sundays. The Master found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">\"The Sunday sessions referred to above were not specially called for this purpose. Judge Laster was on assigned duty at those times, presiding as the single Sunday judge of the multi-judge court, and he acted in open court. His court was fully staifed with clerk and court reporter. The files in these cases had been collected by his court clerk, who had been instructed by Judge Laster to check them. The petition for remittance in each case was fully read and considered by Judge Laster before being granted and the order signed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>To the Commission\u2019s allegations of improper conduct, this Court adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">\"The <em>ex parte </em>discussion with Goldfarb and the agreement to hear motions wherein Goldfarb, a potential litigant, was seeking the return of a large sum of money from the county treasury;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\"The fact that respondent did not assess costs against Goldfarb in any of the 58 cases but instead merely accepted Goldfarb\u2019s blanket statement that there were none.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The <em>ex parte </em>discussion and agreement to hear motions, to which the Court refers, was described by the Master:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\"In a courtroom conversation, so far as the record shows on one occasion only, Charles Goldfarb inquired whether he [Judge Laster] would entertain remission petitions from time to time, in cases where collateral which would otherwise be foreclosed existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Judge Laster testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\"I told him if upon filing the petitions \u2014 upon reading of the petitions, rather, and if they met the criteria of the law as I understood it to be, then I would give him the remittance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The petitions were, indeed, granted in large groups. But the Master found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-12\">\"The petition for remittance in each case was fully read and considered by Judge Laster before being granted and the order signed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Judge Laster relied on affidavits under oath that no costs had been incurred by the county. The prosecutor was to receive a copy of each order of remittance so that he could notify the court if any of the claims were incorrect. The Master found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">\"Review of all the files in question by Judge Laster since these proceedings began showed, by his uncontradicted testimony, the claims of the petitioner to be correct, <em>viz., </em>the defendant had in fact been apprehended, and no costs had been incurred by the county or not refunded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The record supports the findings of fact by the Master, Judge William Weipert, Jr., an experienced and highly regarded circuit judge, who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and their demeanor and credited Judge Laster\u2019s testimony regarding his motives for remitting the bonds. The Commission adopted those findings, and this Court does not find the facts to be otherwise. The Master found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\"Judge Laster\u2019s actions, in question in these proceedings, are shown by his testimony to have been motivated by his belief that surety bonds and their availability at reasonable prices serve a humane purpose, to effectuate which remedial statutes on remission should be construed broadly, and judicial discretion employed. He was concerned also with humane treatment of family and friends of convicted persons who had posted collateral with the bondsman to secure the bond. Having been advised by Mr. Goldfarb that such collateral existed, and would be foreclosed if remission petitions were not filed, he did not believe that the public treasury should be enriched and homes or securities foreclosed, if proper grounds for remission existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\"There is no evidence whatever that Judge Laster\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>actions, motivated as above found, were in any way part of a scheme to promote the business interests of the Goldfarb Bonding Agency, although the latter benefited. The examiner acknowledges that no evidence shows personal enrichment of respondent. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\"There is no evidence that Judge Laster showed favoritism to Charles Goldfarb, nor that he acted in these matters because of friendship, or reason other than his own beliefs and judicial philosophy as set forth above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\"No facts appear in the record that suggest any impropriety or appearance of impropriety on Judge Laster\u2019s part relative to Charles Goldfarb or that he acted in consort with the bonding agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Although the Commission adopted the Master\u2019s findings of fact, it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">\"[T]he Master erred in his conclusion that no sanction should attach. A technical violation is easily excusable but the very persistence of respondent\u2019s conduct in repeated violations requires us to recommend discipline. There surfaced numerous statute and court rule violations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">The Commission also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">\"It is suspicious that of all the bonds refunded no costs were awarded to the people apparently on the <em>ex parte </em>affidavit of the bondsman that the people incurred no costs in apprehending the absconding defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">There was no proof, however, that any costs had been incurred by the county in apprehending any defendant. It should give us pause that, after the Commission has had an opportunity to present its case before a Master, it should find it necessary to cast its reasons for disciplinary action in terms of suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The Commission continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">\"The manner and timing in which the orders were entered, particularly at Sunday sessions, gave the appearance of impropriety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">\"We conclude that respondent persisted in a course of action which gave the appearance of impropriety. Subjective good intentions to the contrary, we are of the opinion that this constitutes judicial misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">This Court\u2019s decision is founded on equally shaky ground. Judge Laster is found to have \"created an atmosphere in which Goldfarb could continue to bring to him old bonds for remission and thus effectively by-pass the judges who originally forfeited the bonds. This ongoing pattern of conduct also gives rise to the appearance of 'cronyism\u2019 and 'judge shopping\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Judge Laster did not create an atmosphere in which Goldfarb could continue to bring to him old bonds; rather, the Recorder\u2019s Court itself, in its informal practices and unclear rules, created this atmosphere. Judge Laster did no more than adhere to his judicial philosophy. For a judge to fail to do his duty as he sees it because others might perceive the appearance of impropriety in such actions might itself be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The Court, unable to say that Judge Laster violated any statute or rule, points to certain aspects of his activities. We are told that Judge Laster remitted other judges\u2019 bonds on a wholesale basis on Sundays without the prior knowledge of the prosecutor and that, with rare exception, no judges other than Judge Laster and suspended Judge Del Rio remitted bonds more than three years after forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">With respect to the number of bonds remitted at one time, if it was proper to remit 1 bond it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>proper to remit 20. The characterization, persistent violation, implies that Judge Laster continued to act after his conduct had been questioned; that is not what occurred. Judge Laster acted on six occasions extending over a 31-month period without suggestion that his actions were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The Master found that Judge Laster was advised by former presiding judges of Recorder\u2019s Court that he had the power to remit bonds forfeited by other judges. The statute can fairly be so read. Nor does the statute require that the remittance be issued by the forfeiting judge. This Court reprimands Judge Laster for doing what the statutes and rules do not forbid and what other judges have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">It was Judge Laster\u2019s duty to sit on certain Sundays, and one of his responsibilities then was miscellaneous matters. Judge Laster considered bond remittance a miscellaneous matter, as did late Presiding Judges Murphy and Leonard. Still, the Court finds fault with his so acting on Sundays. Twenty bonds were remitted on days other than Sunday; it cannot be inferred that remittances were ordered on Sunday to hide what was occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Unsure whether bonds can be legally remitted more than one year after forfeiture, the Court points out that \"suspended Judge Del Rio\u201d also remitted old bonds. To reprimand Judge Laster because he performed a judicial act which Judge Del Rio also performed, an act not found to be improper, is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Judge Laster\u2019s granting the petitions without prior notice may, at first glance, seem suspicious. The implication would be that he was attempting to hide his activity. The record, however, disproves this hypothesis. In granting the motions, Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Laster\u2019s actions were appropriate to <em>ex parte </em>proceedings. He acted in open court, and required a petition stating under oath that all the conditions necessary for bond remission were satisfied. He relied on the sworn statement, issued the order, and gave instructions that the prosecutor receive a copy so that his office could inform the Court of any objections to the remission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The undisputed testimony is that the Recorder\u2019s Court was a \"court of an informal nature\u201d and the court rules were \"loosely interpreted\u201d. In his 17 years with the prosecutor\u2019s office, Judge Laster had never heard of that office being notified of presentment of petitions for remittance. The Commission did not even allege that any other judge required prior notice of remittance petitions to the prosecuting attorney. Judge Laster should not be reprimanded for adhering to the practices of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">On what basis, then, does the Court discipline Judge Laster? He is disciplined because, although he has committed no impropriety, he has not successfully avoided all appearances of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides, \"A judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all his activities.\u201d We do not question that this canon rightly calls upon the judge to act properly and avoid the appearance of improper action. Rather, we take issue with the notion that a judge can be disci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>plined for seemingly improper conduct which, upon examination, turns out to be not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The Court disciplines Judge Laster pursuant to GCR 1963, 932.4 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\"(d) Conduct in violation of the code of judicial conduct or code of professional responsibility and canons * * * may constitute misconduct in office or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice * * * . The question in every case is whether the conduct complained of constitutes misconduct in office or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice * * * , not whether a particular canon or disciplinary rule has been violated. All the circumstances are to be considered in deciding whether action by the commission is warranted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We believe that this section requires more of this Court than its conclusory statement that Judge Laster\u2019s conduct \"gave the 'appearance of impropriety\u2019 and was thus 'clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">We are unable to see how Judge Laster\u2019s actions were \"clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d. We are also unable to understand how the Court concludes that disciplinary action is justified in view of all the circumstances, particularly the circumstance that Judge Laster\u2019s conduct conformed to a reasonable, good-faith construction of the statutes and court rules and the practices of the Recorder\u2019s Court for the City of Detroit.</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-8\">Kavanagh, C.J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-14\"> The Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 9-101 and 9-102, in speaking of the avoidance of \"the appearance of professional impropriety\u201d, spells out with particularity the prophylactic rules to be observed by lawyers.
