The issue is whether, under the long-arm statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a Michigan court may exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>limited personal jurisdiction over the insurance agent on the ground that, as a consequence of his negligence, the corporation was uninsured for its tortious act and the Michigan residents are unable to collect the judgment entered by a Michigan court in Michigan or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">We conclude that there were less than the \"minimum contacts\u201d required with Michigan to satisfy Federal constitutional requirements, and that Michigan cannot exercise jurisdiction over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Khalaf was injured while operating a press in Michigan. He and his wife commenced an action in the Wayne Circuit Court against National Machine Servicing Company, Inc., an Illinois corporation, for negligence and breach of implied warranty in servicing the press. National\u2019s insurer, Bankers &amp; Shippers Insurance Company, refused to defend, claiming that the policy issued to National did not cover the operations which resulted in Khalafs injury. The circuit judge entered an order permitting counsel retained by Bankers, who had previously entered an appearance for National, to withdraw as its counsel of record. A $250,000 default judgment was subsequently entered against National and remains unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The Khalafs commenced this action in the Wayne Circuit Court against Bankers for reformation, breach of contract, and negligence, and against James Dullard, the Illinois insurance agent who had procured the insurance for National from Bankers, alleging negligence in such procurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">An order was entered granting Dullard\u2019s motion to quash service of process on the ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>court did not have limited personal jurisdiction over him. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">There are, broadly stated, three issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">1) Does the Khalafs\u2019 complaint state a claim for relief, an issue of substantive law?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">2) Did Dullard\u2019s acts create a relationship to Michigan within the meaning of the long-arm statute, an issue of statutory construction?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">3) Would exercise of jurisdiction be compatible with the concepts of fundamental fairness embodied in the Due Process Clause, an issue of Federal constitutional law?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">We do not consider the issues of substantive law and statutory construction because we conclude that the record does not establish that Dullard\u2019s relationship with Michigan was such as to make exercise of jurisdiction over him reasonable<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">Although we reject the Khalafs\u2019 long-arm theory on due-process grounds, and thus there is no need to decide whether their substantive theory is correct, we nevertheless state it because their long-arm theory builds on their substantive theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">Their substantive theory is that an insurance agent is subject to liability in an \"action for tort\u201d to an unpaid judgment creditor for negligent failure to procure insurance which would have provided a source of recovery. Dullard, by reason of his contractual relationship with National, owed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>duty to exercise due care in the performance of the contract and, as an alternative to an action for breach of contract, an action may be maintained in tort for negligent performance of that duty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The acts committed by National which caused the Khalafs\u2019 loss are within the ambit of the coverage which Dullard agreed to procure for National and, had the agreed-upon insurance been procured, the Khalafs could have looked to it as a source of recovery. They were third-party beneficiaries of the Dullard-National contract, and Dullard owed them a duty to perform the contract with due care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">The Khalafs on that basis assert that Dullard did or caused an act to be done or \"consequences to occur\u201d in Michigan which gave rise to an \"action for tort\u201d, and therefore the court may exercise long-arm jurisdiction pursuant to clause (2) of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">\"The existence of any of the following relationships between an individual or his agent and the state shall constitute a sufficient basis of jurisdiction to enable a court of record of this state to exercise limited personal jurisdiction over the individual and to enable the court to render personal judgments against the individual or his representative arising out of an act which creates any of the following relationships:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\"(2) The doing or causing an act to be done, or consequences to occur, in the state resulting in an action for tort.\u201d MCL 600.705; MSA 27A.705.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The consequence alleged to have occurred in Mich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>igan is that they (Michigan residents) are unable to collect in Michigan or elsewhere the Michigan judgment which they obtained against National. Dullard in Illinois caused that consequence by entering into a contract to procure insurance for National and by negligently performing that contract. The negligent performance provides a basis for maintaining an action for tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The Khalafs assert that exercise of jurisdiction by Michigan would be consistent with the \"minimum contacts\u201d, \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u201d standard declared under the Due Process Clause by the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6 Dullard was aware that National had transacted business in at least one state (Wisconsin) other than Illinois before National serviced the press in Michigan. By agreeing to procure and by procuring insurance for a business whose operations he knew extended beyond Illinois, Dullard was involved in the stream of commerce. His deposition indicated that he may have thought the coverage provided by Bankers covered the Khalafs\u2019 loss. He should have foreseen that negligent performance of his contract with National could cause loss to a Michigan resident. Michigan has an interest in providing effective means of redress for its residents who would be at a severe disadvantage if required to maintain their action for negligence in procuring insurance in a distant forum. It is therefore fair and reasonable to require Dullard to respond in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Dullard counters that the Khalafs\u2019 action sounds in contract and therefore is not an \"action for tort\u201d. The noncollectibility of a judgment is not a \"consequence\u201d occurring in this state. A relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ship with Michigan such as is required by Federal standards was not established: His agreement to procure insurance covering operations beyond Illinois was not a \"purposeful availment\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the privilege of conducting activities within Michigan such as to render him subject to its process; he could not expect to be plucked from his Chicago office and dropped into the Wayne Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">It is unnecessary to decide the statutory issues of whether an action for negligence which sounds in contract is an \"action for tort\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or whether the noncollectibility of a judgment is a \"consequence\u201d occurring in this state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Proof alone that a nonresident caused an effect in Michigan that was foreseeable does not establish a relationship to Michigan such as to make it fair and reasonable to subject the nonresident to jurisdiction. A nonresident insurance agent is not subject to long-arm jurisdiction in an action for negligent procurement of insurance solely on evidence that i) he knows the insured may engage in activities outside the state in which the insured\u2019s activities are generally centered and the agreement to procure insurance was made and ii) he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>agreed to procure insurance which covered those activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The United States Supreme Court declared in <em>International Shoe Co v </em>Washington<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that, in the context of long-arm jurisdiction, the question under the Due Process Clause is whether the defendant has such \"minimum contacts\u201d with the forum that maintenance of the action \"does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This has remained the governing standard in the Court\u2019s subsequent pronouncements.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The Court has held that jurisdiction may be maintained in respect to a single act having \"substantial connection\u201d with the state.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It may also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>be exercised over causes of action arising \"from activities entirely distinct\u201d from the defendant\u2019s activities in the forum where the nonresident has an adequate relationship with the state. \"[G]eneral fairness to the [defendant] * * * [the] amount and kind of activities * * * mak[ing] it reasonable and just to subject the [defendant] to the jurisdiction of that state are to be determined in each case\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">A factor in the analysis is the state\u2019s interest in providing \"effective means of redress for its residents\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">It is not enough, however, that the forum state is \"the 'center of gravity\u2019 of the controversy, or the most convenient location for litigation. The issue is personal jurisdiction, not choice of law. It is resolved in this case by considering the acts of the [defendant]\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Merely because \"a State\u2019s law can properly be applied to a dispute, its courts [do not] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>necessarily have jurisdiction over the parties to that dispute\u201d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">It is <em>\"essential in each case </em>that there be some act by which <em>the defendant purposefully avails </em>itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s activities will ordinarily be such that he will have \"reason to expect to be haled before\u201d the forum court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Justice Blackmun, as a circuit judge, observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\"We also think it is fair to say that these five Supreme Court cases establish only general and not precise guidelines. Perhaps they purposely do no more than this. We observe, however, that, at one time or another in the opinions, three primary factors, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the <em>quantity </em>of the contacts, the <em>nature and quality </em>of the contacts, and the <em>source and connection </em>of the cause of action with those contacts, are stressed, and that two others, <em>interest of the forum state </em>and <em>conve</em>nience, receive mention.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Jurisdiction based on causing \"effects\u201d in another state was considered by the Court in a recent case, <em>Kulko v Superior Court of California in &amp; for the City &amp; County of San Francisco.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>An all-encompassing California statute permits courts of that state to \"exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States\u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The California Supreme Court held that the defendant had caused an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\"effect\u201d in California by allowing one of his children, for whom he was paying a support allowance pursuant to a New York separation agreement and a divorce, to join her mother in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The United States Supreme Court said that the \"effects\u201d test was derived from 1 Restatement Conflicts, 2d, \u00a7 37:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\"A state has power to exercise judicial jurisdiction over an individual who causes effects in the state by an act done elsewhere with respect to any cause of action arising from these effects unless the nature of the effects and of the individual\u2019s relationship to the state make the exercise of such jurisdiction unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\"[TJhis section was intended to reach wrongful activity outside of the State causing injury within the State * * * (shooting bullet from one State into another), or commercial activity affecting state residents\u201d but, even in such situations, \"the Restatement recognizes that there might be circumstances that would render 'unreasonable\u2019 the assertion of jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The Court concluded that the father had not purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activity in California. While California had a substantial interest in protecting the welfare of a minor resident, that alone would not make California a fair forum. The defendant father derived no \"personal or commercial benefit from his child\u2019s presence in California\u201d. \"[Sjending a child to California to live with her mother is not a commercial act and connotes no intent to obtain nor expectancy of receiving a corresponding ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>efit in the State that would make fair the assertion of that State\u2019s judicial jurisdiction\u201d.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The Khalafs contend that the Federal constitutional standard is satisfied by Dullard\u2019s involvement in the stream of commerce, his agreement to procure insurance covering National\u2019s business activities in Michigan and the reasonably foreseeable loss caused a Michigan resident by his negligent failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">It is not claimed that Dullard\u2019s negligence was committed with the intention of causing effects in Michigan but, rather, that his acts could reasonably have been expected to do so. In such a case the Restatement suggests the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\"The act may not have been done with the intention of causing effects in the state but could reasonably have been expected to do so. Whether the state may exercise judicial jurisdiction in such a situation depends upon a variety of factors, including the <em>extent of the relationship of the state </em>to the defendant and to the plaintiff, the <em>nature and quality of the effects </em>resulting from the act, and the <em>degree of inconvenience </em>which would result to the defendant from being forced to stand suit in the state on the particular cause of action.\u201d 1 Restatement Conflicts, 2d, \u00a7 37 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Dullard was an insurance agent in Illinois. There is no evidence that he transacted business in Michigan at any time, nor evidence that he ever procured insurance for persons or property in Michigan or covering risks of loss extant in Michigan at the time the policy was written. Nor is there any evidence that his customer, National, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>apart from the activities that occasioned the Khalafs\u2019 loss, ever did business in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The only evidence indicating that Dullard knew that National did business outside Illinois is a certificate of insurance which he furnished to a Wisconsin company showing that National had been covered by Bankers under a comprehensive general liability policy. The certificate was furnished a few months after the date of the agreement to procure insurance relied on by the Khalafs and after Bankers issued its policy. Dullard indicated that he may have thought that the policy issued by Bankers covered the type of claim asserted by the Khalafs.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The evidence thus tends to show that Dullard did procure insurance for risks of loss outside Illinois, was to that extent involved in the stream of interstate commerce, had agreed with National to procure insurance covering risks of loss of the kind represented by the Khalafs\u2019 claim, had reason to believe that National might do business at some indeterminate future time in some other state, possibly Michigan, and should reasonably have foreseen that negligent performance of his agreement with National could cause loss to a Michigan resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Policies of insurance generally provide coverage beyond the jurisdiction in which the insured\u2019s activities are centered. Just as passenger automobile and homeowner liability policies protect a person when he travels beyond the boundaries of his state of residence, policies covering those engaged in commercial or industrial enterprises may provide such extended territorial coverage. The policy issued by Bankers to National may have so provided. Such extended territorial coverage may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>be and frequently is provided without focus on or identification of any particular out-of-state activity of the insured and without additional or identified premium charge at the time the policy is written.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">To hold that because of such extended territorial coverage an insurance agent has caused a foreseeable effect wherever the insured may travel justifying the exercise of long-arm jurisdiction would be to subject insurance agents, however small and localized their operations, to the jurisdiction of any state to which an insured might travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Michigan is properly concerned with providing effective means of redress for its residents. The Khalafs, however, would have no need to transport witnesses from Michigan to Illinois to maintain an action against Dullard for negligence in procuring insurance. The witnesses are more likely to be located in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The \"quality and nature\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> of the effect in Michigan, inability to collect a judgment, do not pose the risk of physical harm presented by driving an automobile or distributing manufactured products in this state.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Foreseeable effects are a factor in the analysis, but an essential consideration is whether the defendant has \"purposefully availed\u201d himself of the privilege of conducting his activities in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">A \"purposeful availment\u201d is something akin either to a deliberate undertaking to do or cause an act or thing to be done in Michigan or conduct which can be properly regarded as a prime generating cause of the effects resulting in Michigan, something more than a passive availment of Mich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>igan opportunities. The defendant will have reason to foresee being \"haled before\u201d a Michigan court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The effect on the injured person (third party beneficiary) may be the same whether it is the insurer who fails to perform a contract of insurance or the insurance agent who fails to perform a contract to procure insurance. There is, nevertheless, a significant difference between an insurer\u2019s obligation and an insurance agent\u2019s obligation in terms of the nature of defendant\u2019s business and defendant\u2019s purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities within Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Since insurers generally seek to sell their services in new territories including other states, and depend on out-of-state business to generate volume, it is ordinarily fair to conclude that their involvement in commercial activity respecting a state is a direct result of a purpose to expand their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Insurance agents, on the other hand, do not generally<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> seek to expand their business into other states. They will, nevertheless, find themselves writing insurance for risks in other states as a result of the expansion of their customers\u2019 businesses. They become involved in another state, not because of their own purpose to do so, but because of their customers\u2019 purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">An insurer agrees to defend the insured in the forum, an insurance agent generally does not undertake to do anything in the forum. There is a substantial difference between agreeing, as does an insurance agent, to procure someone who will act in Michigan and agreeing, as does an insurer, to act in Michigan. The effect of nonperformance may, indeed, be consequences in Michigan affect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ing in the same way the insured or an injured person, but foreseeable effects alone are not purposeful availment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The Supreme Court of Hawaii held that a Virginia physician was not subject to long-arm jurisdiction in Hawaii for negligence in prescribing medication in Virginia claimed to have resulted in the patient\u2019s loss of consciousness while driving an automobile in Hawaii which struck plaintiffs automobile:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\"The case before us is not one involving a defendant who introduces a defective product into the stream of commerce. Neither is it one involving an intentional tort, nor one where the act was performed for the purpose of causing an effect in Hawaii. Here there was only a chance encounter between a Hawaii resident visiting in Virginia and a physician who was engaged in a strictly localized medical practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\"We hold that under the circumstances of this case, the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant Virginia physician would be violative of his rights under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Ordinary foreseeability principles of tort law are helpful but not determinative, for we are here concerned with constitutional principles of due process. Mere foreseeability of injury was not sufficient to establish the minimum contact necessary to satisfy the requirements of due process.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>If causing foreseeable effects alone constituted purposeful availment, a roadside \"Ma &amp; Pa\u201d sandwich shop in Toledo, Ohio would be subject to long-arm jurisdiction although the adverse physical effects of a tainted sandwich, consumed there or across the border in Monroe, Michigan, manifested themselves or persisted in Detroit or in the Upper Peninsula. It is clearly foreseeable that a person who buys a sandwich at a roadside shop in Toledo might travel to Michigan and that a negligently made sandwich might cause consequences beyond Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">If causing foreseeable effects alone constituted purposeful availment, a Chicago grocery store supplying consumables, a haberdashery or boutique providing clothing, or a marina purveying boat supplies, to a person known to have a Michigan cottage, or a physician performing cosmetic surgery on him, could be subject to Michigan long-arm jurisdiction. In each instance the Chicago provider knows that the product or service is for use in Michigan, and that negligent performance will cause effects in Michigan. The enterprise is commercial, affecting the stream of commerce. But the nature of the provider\u2019s business is nevertheless so clearly localized that proof of transactions with Michigan residents should not alone subject the provider to long-arm jurisdiction. The generat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ing cause is not the provider\u2019s desire to enlarge his business into Michigan but, rather, the Michigan customer\u2019s desire to do business with the Chicago provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">A localized business \u2014 sandwich shop, grocer, haberdashery, boutique, marina, physician, or insurance agent \u2014 does not depend on multi-state distribution to generate volume.

The plaintiffs Khalaf, Michigan residents, claim a third-party-beneficiary interest in this contract on account of an accident in Michigan, which would have been covered by the insurance except for defendant\u2019s negligent performance of his duty in Illinois. Defendant insurance agent was aware that the machine servicing corporation had transacted business in the adjoining state of Wisconsin. However, there was nothing on the record to show that the machine servicing corporation had transacted, or was transacting, business in Michigan, or in any other state, nor was there any record evidence that defendant insurance agent was conducting any business in Michigan or in any other state.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In this condition of the record, it is difficult to find that there was either a \"stream of commerce\u201d, or a \"foreseeable\u201d or a \"purposeful availment\u201d relationship between defendant insurance agent and the unfortunate accident in Michigan. As a consequence, the Michigan long-arm statute has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">On the other hand, it is not difficult to envision that the change of one or two significant facts would change this conclusion. For example, it would have been important if the record had shown that the Illinois insurance agent could reasonably have foreseen that his client was about to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>conduct operations in Michigan.
