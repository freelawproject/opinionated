At trial, he had been allowed only the five challenges required by the possible penalty available for a gross indecency prosecution. The Court of Appeals reversed<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the basis of this claim, ordering a new trial as to all charges. We granted leave to appeal. 399 Mich 824 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The question we will address on this appeal is whether in a gross indecency prosecution, where defendant is also charged with sexual delinquency, reversible error occurs when the court refuses defendant\u2019s request for 20 peremptory jury challenges, even though the separate charge of sexual delinquency carries a possible penalty of life imprisonment. We reverse the Court of Appeals order for a totally new trial. We find defendant\u2019s trial on the principal charges of gross indecency without error. However, we do find error in the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request for 20 peremptory jury challenges incident to his prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tion as a sexually delinquent person and so remand for hearing before a jury separately empaneled to decide this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Defendant was convicted of two offenses involving gross indecency. The statute relating to gross indecency defines the offense in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\"Any male person who, in public or in private, commits or is a party to the commission of or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of any act of gross indecency with another male person shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than 5 years, or by a fine of not more than $2,500.00.\u201d MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Additionally, the statute provides that defendant may be declared a sexually delinquent person at the time the offense<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">\"[I]f such person was at the time of the said offense a sexually delinquent person, [then he] may be [punished] by imprisonment in the state prison for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which shall be 1 day and the maximum of which shall be life.\u201d MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Similar sexual delinquency provisions exist in several other criminal statutes. See MCL 750.158; MSA 28.355 (sodomy); MCL 750.335a; MSA 28.567(1) (indecent exposure); MCL 750.338a; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>28.570(1) (gross indecency, females); MCL 750.338b; MSA 28.570(2) (gross indecency, male-female).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In order to convict defendant as a sexual delinquent, evidence<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of delinquency, as defined by MCL 750.10a; MSA 28.200(1), must be established beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\"The term 'sexually delinquent person\u2019 when used in this act shall mean any person whose sexual behavior is characterized by repetitive or compulsive acts which indicate a disregard of consequences or the recognized rights of others, or by the use of force upon another person in attempting sex relations of either a heterosexual or homosexual nature, or by the commission of sexual aggressions against children under the age of 16.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Conviction of sexual delinquency can be obtained only in conjunction with conviction on the principal charge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Yet, sexual delinquency is a matter of sentencing, unrelated to proof of the principal charge. No additional element of \"sexual delinquency\u201d need be proven in order to convict on the principal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Accordingly, what activates the sexual delinquency provision is proof of guilt of a principal criminal offense. However, coupled with this fact, the sexual delinquency hearing itself must prove that defendant has committed \"repetitive or compulsive <em>acts </em>which indicate a disregard of conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>quences or the recognized rights of others\u201d, or <em>acts </em>of force used \"upon another person in attempting sex relations of either a heterosexual or homosexual nature\u201d, or <em>acts </em>of sexual aggression committed \"against children under the age of 16.\u201d MCL 750.10a; MSA 28.200(1). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">It is also clear that proof of the sexual delinquency charge may involve more than simple ministerial considerations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Very broad substantive factors come into play when the court or jury decide this question. MCL 767.61a; MSA 28.1001(1)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides for a separate hearing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>record,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> involving psychiatric and expert testimony on the question.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even where defendant pleads guilty, the court is ordered to separately investigate the charge of sexual delinquency.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Language in this statute specifically characterizes sexual delinquency as \"an <em>alternate </em>sentence to imprisonment\u201d. See MCL 767.61a; MSA 28.1001(1). (Emphasis added.) In short, this particular provision reflects legislative intent to construe sexual delinquency as a separate, alternate form of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Consequently, we are led to an interpretation different than that adopted by the Court of Appeals. That Court\u2019s opinion found sexual delinquency to be entirely self-contained in MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570, and thus simply a penalty enhancement provision related to the principal gross indecency charge.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To the contrary, we find sexual delinquency to be an alternate sentencing provision tied to a larger statutory scheme. Further, we find the nature of the sexual delinquency hearing itself inconsistent with a simple penalty enhancement rationale. We also find the role of the fact finder highly discretionary in deciding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>delinquency question. Finally, Vre note the risk of extreme punishment involved with a finding of sexual delinquency. All of these considerations require us to reject the approach taken by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">A close examination of the legislative history of sexual delinquency demonstrates a sound basis for an alternate sentencing interpretation. At the time the concept became part of Michigan law, related statutory provisions were enacted<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which clearly indicate sexual delinquency was conceived as possible mental illness precluding a fixed sentence. The concept of sexual delinquency was included in the then-existing mental health code<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and Department of Corrections Act,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which specifically provided for treatment and early release upon satisfactory review by the parole board. The intended result entailed a more flexible and less determinate sentencing framework than set terms of imprisonment. This flexible form of incarceration was meant to entirely replace the more structured and limited sentence provided upon conviction of the principal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Further, this alternate context for handling sexually delinquent persons was explicitly tied to other criminal provisions<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and, by analogy, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>to legislation dealing with civil commitment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In sum, sexual delinquency was part of a much broader scheme of rehabilitation involving a sentence adjusted to defendant\u2019s treatment and recovery from possible mental illness. Thus the sentence for being sexually delinquent was not primarily penal. Punishment within a specific limited period for the principal offense was reserved for those whose psychiatric histories, considered after conviction on the principal charge, reflected no serious tendency toward pathologically repetitive, compulsive, forceful or aggressive acts. So conceived, the sexually delinquent person concept was clearly intended to entail a more flexible, alternate form of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Since the legislation was originally enacted, numerous changes have occurred not only in statutes which specifically included the sexual delinquency concept, but also in legislation related to other forms of sexual conduct considered criminal. The wording in the then-existing mental health code, including sexual delinquency in the definition of mental illness, was deleted.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Further, the Mental Health Code was completely revised four years ago.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Authority now exists for a finding of \"guilty but mentally ill\u201d in criminal prosecutions, which might parallel the sexual delinquency concept as included in the old mental health code.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>for treatment and early release of sexual delinquents, which was included in the Department of Corrections Act, was amended out of that statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Similarly, references to sexual delinquency originally found in other legislation have been deleted as new or revised law has appeared.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In short, sexual delinquency is now limited to five specific criminal provisions, three of which arise from the same criminal conduct.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus constituted, sexual delinquency is a seldom-used category of alternate sentencing, now less explicitly rehabilitative. Provision for treatment is now confined to the normal facilities available to all prison inmates.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We conclude that in order to fairly proceed against a defendant under this modified statutory scheme, the alternate nature of the sentence requires a hearing and record before a <em>separate </em>jury in cases where defendant does not waive jury trial. The substantial function and discretion of the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>in hearing the sexual delinquency charge,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the high potential for automatic conviction were the original jury to hear the delinquency charge and the penalty of life imprisonment possible upon finding sexual delinquency all inform our order for separate jury consideration.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Within the special context of the sexual delinquency hearing, we find that these circumstances distinguish this proceeding from any analogy to habitual offender proceedings. See <em>People v Stratton, </em>13 Mich App 350; 164 NW2d 555 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The trial court cannot predict at the outset whether a defendant will actually be prejudiced by having the same jury decide both the principal charge and the sexual delinquency charge. However, the potential for prejudice is inescapable, given the broad function and wide discretion necessarily accorded the jury in the sexual delinquency hearing. Much more is involved than simply determining whether this defendant is the person convicted of specific prior offenses.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Indeed, acts not necessarily resulting in criminal convictions may be considered under the statute. See MCL 750.10a; MSA 28.200(1). Furthermore, the definition of a sexually delinquent person allows, and in fact must depend upon, consideration of the prior principal sexual offense. Consequently, we find the possibility too real that a jury which only shortly before had found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on the principal sexual offense might without responsible deliberation conclude he was also a sexually delinquent person. In short, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the likelihood of an automatic conviction in this subsequent proceeding requires us to order a separate jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Additionally, in view of the potential life sentence under the sexual delinquency charge, if the same jury hears both charges a defendant is entitled to 20 peremptory challenges in the empaneling the original jury. However, if the need for a second jury is left to the discretion of the trial court and the court finds a different jury necessary to avoid prejudice in trying the sexual delinquency charge, then the time and expense in proceeding with 20 peremptory challenges at the beginning of the trial is wasted. We find this situation incongruous.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">As a result, we conclude that the decision to empanel a separate jury should not be left to the discretion of the trial judge. Unless waived by the defendant, we shall require that a second jury be provided in every case to decide the sexual delinquency charge. The second jury should be empaneled before the same trial judge immediately after conviction on the principal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Further, because defendant is separately tried on the charge of sexual delinquency, which carries a possible sentence of life in prison, he is entitled to 20 peremptory challenges in the empaneling of this jury. On the other hand, at the time the initial jury is empaneled on the principal charge, defendant should be allowed only the number of peremptory challenges appropriate to the possible sentence on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Moreover, though defendant is separately tried by two different juries, the charge against him for sexual delinquency <em>must </em>be brought <em>before </em>trial on the principal charge begins. The statute mandates that result by including the word \"shall\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>relevant language of MCL 767.61a; MSA 28.1001(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\"In any prosecution for an offense committed by a sexually delinquent person for which may be imposed an alternate sentence to imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which is 1 day and the maximum of which is life, the indictment <em>shall </em>charge the offense and may also charge that the defendant was, at the time said offense was committed, a sexually delinquent person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Thus, if brought at all, a charge of sexual delinquency must be included in the original indictment. The word \"may\u201d in the statute refers to the option available to the prosecutor, indicating the sexual delinquency charge may or may not be included. This language does not allow a subsequent information to be filed after the principal charge is tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">We would contrast this provision with the habitual offender statute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In the case of sexual delinquency, ascertaining whether a prosecutor knew or should have known of circumstances which would lead him to add sexual delinquency to the information would be more difficult to establish with certainty. Consequently, determining the prosecutor\u2019s good faith discovery of prior convictions in habitual offender cases is not reasoning which can be transposed to the sexual delinquency context.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">After the trial begins, the prosecutor will have waived the opportunity to bring a sexual delinquency charge. By imposing this time limit, we avoid late charges which would prejudice defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>ant. The substantive character of the sexual delinquency hearing and the extreme penalty possible weigh in our decision. Ideally, the original indictment should include both principal charges and the charge of sexual delinquency. However, we find no impropriety in allowing amendments of the indictment or information prior to trial. Thus, if the prosecutor decides during the period of trial preparation that a charge of sexual delinquency is appropriate, he should be permitted to modify the information. Beyond this point, he waives any right to bring such prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Furthermore, we hold that no reference to the sexual delinquency charge should be made to the jury trying the principal charge.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Given the provision for separate juries, absolutely no need remains to acquaint the jury hearing the principal charge with the possible subsequent conviction of defendant as a sexually delinquent person. Discovery during trial of the principal charge that the jury hearing that case has learned of the sexual delinquency charge will henceforth be grounds for mistrial on the principal charge or reversible error on appeal. The two charges must be tried separately. Basic fairness to defendant requires this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Considering defendant\u2019s position in the present case, we find that the trial held on the principal charge was procedurally acceptable. He was charged in the original two-count information with both the principal crime of gross indecency and sexual delinquency. Defendant was provided with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>only five peremptory challenges during voir dire on the principal charge. The charge of sexual delinquency was not placed before the jury during trial or deliberations on the principal charge. Only after the verdict of guilty on the principal charge did the court acquaint the jury with the charge of sexual delinquency. We thus find no error in the proceeding to this point and so affirm defendant\u2019s conviction of the principal offenses of gross indecency.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">What we find objectionable is the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the same jury hearing the principal charge to decide the subsequent matter of sexual delinquency and, further, to deny defendant the right to 20 peremptory jury challenges on that charge. We thus affirm the Court of Appeals on this basic point; but reverse their order for an entirely new trial. We remand only for hearing before a separately empaneled jury should the prosecutor decide to pursue the sexual delinquency charge. Defendant should be accorded the full 20 peremptory challenges appropriate to the possible life sentence. Should the prosecutor choose not to proceed upon the sexual delinquency charge, or should the defendant be found not guilty, defendant will be resentenced by the trial court only on the principal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Given our ruling of procedural error in the sexual delinquency proceeding, we will not now consider the larger constitutional claim first alleged by defendant in his cross-appeal to this Court. Should defendant be found sexually delinquent on proper hearing below, then appeal on constitutional grounds may be brought and fairly considered in the correct order.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Williams, Levin, Coleman, Ryan, and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Blair Moody, Jr., J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\"> Gross indecency has been designated under three separate provisions of the criminal code.

The prosecutor introduced (1) a certified order of probation of March 5,1965, indicating prior conviction in Alpena County of accosting and soliciting a minor child, and (2) a Macomb County Court disposition sheet showing defendant\u2019s conviction of indecent liberties with a minor child on March 18, 1968. In response, defendant merely argued that the convictions were old enough to cast doubt on any finding of sexual delinquency under the statute. After the verdict, the judge made a separate finding, as a matter of law, that defendant was a sexually delinquent person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\"> The Court of Appeals decision is reported at 70 Mich App 683; 247 NW2d 328 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\"> This language fixes the relevant time to decide whether defendant was sexually delinquent at the point when the principal offense was committed. Further, sexual delinquency was intended to depend upon conviction and subsequent consideration of the principal criminal charge and surrounding psychiatric history.

However, the language qualifying the designated acts conforms to a determinable structure of proof. As noted, proof of these acts must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\"> The Court of Appeals has correctly determined that charges of sexual delinquency may be brought only where the principal criminal statute explicitly so specifies. See <em>People </em>v <em>Seaman, </em>75 Mich App 546; 255 NW2d 680 (1977), where supplementation of third-degree criminal sexual conduct prosecution with sexual delinquency charge was rejected because explicit provision for charging sexual delinquency is nowhere contained within the criminal sexual conduct statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> In this particular case, defendant\u2019s prior conviction constituted the basis for the jury\u2019s sexual delinquency verdict. This case thus parallels the normal habitual offender prosecution where the offense is totally defined and limited by the existence of prior convictions. However, sexual delinquency is not explicitly dependent upon any prior conviction except the principal charge. Hence, though the sexual delinquency prosecution must be defined in terms of a contemporaneous conviction on the principal charge, the court or jury is not limited to record convictions in their deliberations. The only limitation is that they must weigh the acts specified in MCL 750.10a; MSA 28.200(1). Defendant is not punished for prior offenses. He is prosecuted in order to determine whether special circumstances surrounding the principal charge make an alternate sentence appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\"> This provision constitutes the major procedural pronouncement regarding the sexual delinquency hearing and reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\"In any prosecution for an offense committed by a sexually delinquent person for which may be imposed an alternate sentence to imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which is 1 day and the maximum of which is life, the indictment shall charge the offense and may also charge that the defendant was, at the time said offense was committed, a sexually delinquent person. In every such prosecution the people may produce expert testimony and the court shall provide expert testimony for any indigent accused at his request. In the event the accused shall plead guilty to both charges in such indictment, the court * * * before sentencing the accused, shall conduct an examination of witnesses relative to the sexual delinquency of such person and may call on psychiatric and expert testimony.
