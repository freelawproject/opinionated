MCL 767.61a; MSA 28.1001(1).1 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Before trial the sexual delinquency charge was deleted on the assumption that the charge might properly be brought after trial on the principal offense of indecent exposure. The examining magistrate bound the defendant over on indecent exposure but deferred to the prosecutor the decision whether to return an information or take further action relative to the question of sexual delinquency. On June 12, 1973, trial was held on the principal offense and defendant was convicted by a jury <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>On June 25, 1973, the prosecutor filed a supplemental information again charging defendant with being a sexually delinquent person. Defendant was tried by another jury separately empaneled to hear the sexual delinquency charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1234 The jury found defendant guilty. On the basis of this conviction, the court sentenced defendant to serve not less than one day nor more than life imprisonment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, challenging the prosecutor\u2019s right to bring a charge of sexual delinquency subsequent to trial on the principal offense of indecent exposure. The Court of Appeals ruled that any charge of sexual delinquency must be brought in the original information charging indecent exposure. Consequently, because defendant was actually charged only after trial on the principal offense, the sexual delinquency proceeding against him was improper. The Court of Appeals therefore reversed defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>sexual delinquency conviction and dismissed that charge. 59 Mich App 404; 229 NW2d 474 (1975). We granted leave to appeal. 395 Mich 824 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The question on appeal is whether in a case where defendant is convicted of the principal offense of indecent exposure under MCL 750.335a; MSA 28.567(1), the prosecutor possesses authority after trial to file a supplemental information charging sexual delinquency. We find no such authority and affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals. The charge of sexual delinquency must be dismissed. However, we do not fully agree with the reasoning employed to reach this result and so write to clarify our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Defendant was convicted of indecent exposure. The statute defining this offense also provides the basis for charging defendant with being a sexually delinquent person at the time the offense was committed. MCL 750.335a; MSA 28.567(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\"Any person who shall knowingly make any open or indecent exposure of his or her person or of the person of another shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 1 year, or by a fine of not more than $500.00, or if such person was at the time of the said offense a sexually delinquent person, may be punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which shall be 1 day and the maximum of which shall be life: Provided, That any other provision of any other statute notwithstanding said offense shall be triable only in a court of record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The history of sexual delinquency legislation clearly indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent to create a comprehensive, unified statutory scheme. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>legislation was enacted to provide an alternate sentence for certain specific sexual offenses where evidence appeared to justify a more flexible form of incarceration. See <em>People v Helzer, post, 404 </em>Mich 410; 273 NW2d 44 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">To this end, the Legislature introduced language into several previously existing categories of sexual offenses to allow prosecution for sexual delinquency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 78 Additionally, sexual delinquency was included in the then-existing mental health code<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Department of Corrections Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">To help implement these statutory changes, the Legislature also separately enacted a definitional<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provision and a procedural provision as general guidelines in sexual delinquency prosecutions. The latter section which outlines the procedure to be used in such prosecutions is MCL 767.61a; MSA 28.1001(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\"In any prosecution for an offense committed by a sexually delinquent person for which may be imposed an alternate sentence to imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which is 1 day and the maximum of which is life, the indictment <em>shall </em>charge the offense and <em>may also </em>charge that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>was, at the time said offense was committed, a sexually delinquent person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The prosecutor relies upon the underscored language of the statute for authority to file a separate supplemental information charging sexual delinquency after conviction on the principal offense. The Court of Appeals rejected this analysis by concluding that this provision has no application to the procedure governing how the defendant is to be charged as a sexually delinquent person, and that MCL 750.335a; MSA 28.567(1), the section which defines the crime, is complete and self-sustaining. That court stated: \"[t]he prosecutor can charge a person with indecent exposure or he can charge additionally that at the time of the offense the person was a sexually delinquent person. He cannot do both.\u201d We disagree with both analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We find the procedure outlined in MCL 767.61a; MSA 28.1001(1) a necessary part of the integrated statutory structure the Legislature enacted to resolve the problem of sexually delinquent persons. This provision clearly complements and affects any such prosecution. Accordingly, we hold that this provision does not permit the prosecutor to file a sexual delinquency charge after trial to supplement the principal charge. However, it is within the prosecutor\u2019s discretion before trial to simultaneously charge the principal offense and the sexual delinquency claim or to proceed solely with the principal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">A reading of this procedural statute indicates that the indictment \"shall\u201d charge the principal sexual offense and \"may also\u201d charge sexual delinquency. In other words, the original charging instrument should \"also\u201d include any sexual delin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>quency claim that may be charged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are persuaded that use of the word \"may\u201d in the statute simply refers to the discretion of the prosecutor to bring or not to bring the added charge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, no authority exists in this statutory provision, or in any other,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> allowing the prosecutor to file an information subsequent to trial on the principal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">However, given the possible initial uncertainty about lodging so serious a charge against a defendant, we will allow amendment of the indictment or information prior to trial. Nevertheless, after trial on the principal offense begins, the prosecutor is held to waive any right to charge defendant with sexual delinquency. See <em>People v Helzer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The procedure followed in this case violated the dictates of MCL 767.61a; MSA 28.1001(1). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>supplemental information exposed the defendant unduly to the uncertainty and prejudice late charges can produce. The Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed in its reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction of sexual delinquency and its dismissal of that charge. We need not consider defendant\u2019s other claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-5\">Williams, Levin, Fitzgerald, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Blair Moody, Jr., J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\"> MCL 750.335a; MSA 28.567(1) reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\"Any person who shall knowingly make any open or indecent exposure of his or her person or of the person of another shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 1 year, or by a fine of not more than $500.00, or if such person was at the time of the said offense a sexually delinquent person, may be punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which shall be 1 day and the maximum of which shall be life: Provided, That any other provision of any other statute notwithstanding said offense shall be triable only in a court of record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\"> MCL 767.61a; MSA 28.1001(1) specifies the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">\"In any prosecution for an offense committed by a sexually delinquent person for which may be imposed an alternate sentence to imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which is 1 day and the maximum of which is life, the indictment shall charge the offense and may also charge that the defendant was, at the time said offense was committed, a sexually delinquent person. In every such prosecution the people may produce expert testimony and the court shall provide expert testimony for any indigent accused at his request. In the event the accused shall plead guilty to both charges in such indictment, the court in addition to the investigation provided for in section 35 of chapter 8 of this act, and before sentencing the accused, shall conduct an examination of witnesses relative to the sexual delinquency of such person and may call on psychiatric and expert testimony. All testimony taken at such examination shall be taken in open court and a typewritten transcript or copy thereof, certified by the court reporter taking the same, shall be placed in the file of the case in the office of the county clerk.

Two days later, defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term for the sexual delinquency conviction. This dual sentence was improper. We have characterized the indeterminate penalty for a sexual delinquency conviction as an <em>alternate </em>form of sentencing. See <em>People v Helzer, post, </em>404 Mich 410; 273 NW2d 44 (1978). Consequently, defendant can be sentenced only once. If sexual delinquency is an included part of the prosecution on the principal offense, then no sentence should be pronounced until that matter is completely resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\"> See the indecent liberties statute, <em>MCL </em>750.336; MSA 28.568, the rape statute, MCL 750.520; MSA 28.788, the assault with intent to commit rape statute, MCL 750.85; MSA 28.280, the incest statute, MCL 750.333; MSA 28.565, the gross indecency statutes, MCL 750.338, 750.338a, 750.338b; MSA 28.570, 28.570(1), 28.570(2), and the sodomy statute, MCL 750.158; MSA 28.355.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\"> MCL 330.54; MSA 14.844.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\"> MCL 791.33a <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 28.2173(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b470-12\"> See MCL 750.10a; MSA 28.200(1), which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">\"The term 'sexually delinquent person\u2019 when used in this act shall mean any person whose sexual behavior is characterized by repetitive or compulsive acts which indicate a disregard of consequences or the recognized rights of others, or by the use of force upon another person in attempting sex relations of either a heterosexual or homosexual nature, or by the commission of sexual aggressions against children under the age of 16.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\"> We have determined that a charge of sexual delinquency is totally dependent for its prosecution upon conviction of the principal offense.

See <em>People v Helzer, supra. </em>Consequently, though we require the prosecutor to include the sexual delinquency charge either in the original charging document or by amendment of the indictment or information before trial begins, the magistrate at the preliminary examination need only find probable cause to bind defendant over on the principal offense. The magistrate need not find probable cause as to the sentencing provision charging sexual delinquency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\"> Where the prosecutor decides to charge defendant in the original indictment or information with sexual delinquency, he should bring the misdemeanor prosecution on the principal offense of indecent exposure in circuit court under the statute providing concurrent jurisdiction with district court.
