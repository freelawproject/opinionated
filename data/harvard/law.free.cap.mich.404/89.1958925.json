The boulevard has not been developed or maintained as a roadway or \"opened\u201d to vehicular traffic;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is covered with underbrush and trees except along the water\u2019s edge where it is a wide sand beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Defendants contend that the riparian rights<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the Higgins Lake frontage were vested in the public by the dedication of the boulevard to public use. The public at large and, hence, owners of interior lots (\"back lots\u201d) may use the beach and water for lounging, swimming and boating purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Plaintiffs contend that the dedication granted the public only the right to use the boulevard for street purposes, <em>e.g., </em>pedestrian and vehicular travel. Although the front lots are separated from the lake by the boulevard, the riparian rights remain an incident of front lot ownership. The general public (including back lot owners such as defendants) may not use the boulevard and adjoining waters for beach purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The parties stipulated the issues on appeal from the circuit court:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\u2014To whom do the riparian rights along Michigan Central Park Boulevard belong?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u2014Whether lounging, picnicking, bathing, swim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ming, launching and anchoring boats, and erecting or maintaining docks and boat hoists are all riparian rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The circuit court had enjoined the defendants from engaging in the activities described in the second issue. The Court of Appeals vacated the injunction except insofar as it bars the defendants from erecting and maintaining docks and boat hoists and from using plaintiffs\u2019 docks and boat hoists. We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals but vacate a portion of its opinion, and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Erecting or maintaining docks or boat hoists near the water\u2019s edge is a riparian or littoral right, and the parties are in agreement in that regard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The circuit court concluded that in the instant case the riparian or littoral rights are an incident of front lot ownership, and enjoined the defendants from, among other activities, erecting or maintaining docks and boat hoists. The Court of Appeals affirmed that aspect of the judgment, stating that \"[o]nly the plaintiffs may construct docking facilities and permanent mooring devices in front of their lots\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">While this Court granted the defendants permission to add a question, they did not seek leave to cross-appeal. Accordingly, they may not obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>decision more favorable to them than was rendered by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, whether the riparian or littoral rights are an incident of front lot ownership or belong to the public because of dedication of the boulevard, there is no basis for review of the judgment of the circuit court or decision of the Court of Appeals regarding erecting, maintaining or using docks and boat hoists.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The circuit judge additionally enjoined the defendants from, bathing, swimming and temporarily anchoring boats in front of plaintiffs\u2019 property. Although those may indeed be riparian or littoral rights,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we conclude that plaintiffs do not have the right to exclude the general public from also engaging in those activities in the waters in front of their property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The Attorney General intervened in the Court of Appeals in behalf of the state to assert the right of the general public to use the waters of Higgins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Lake and the land lying beneath such waters for the purposes of boating, swimming, wading and fishing, which he asserts is an incident of the right of navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Plaintiffs, in their brief in this Court, state that they have never argued that the general public does not have a right of navigation on the waters of Higgins Lake and that they \"take no exception whatsoever\u201d to the Attorney General\u2019s argument that the public has a right to navigate and to exercise the incidents of navigation on waters of this state which are capable of being navigated by oar- or motor-propelled craft, small craft, so long as members of the public have lawful means of access to such waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The Court of Appeals stated: \"Assuming lawful access, that portion of the lower court\u2019s order which prohibited the defendants from 'bathing, swimming, * * * [temporarily] anchoring boats or similar activities\u2019 must be vacated [deletion and addition by the Court of Appeals].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The public, as plaintiffs acknowledge, may lawfully enter the waters of Higgins Lake from the points where the other streets of the subdivision terminate at the water\u2019s edge,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and may use the waters in front of plaintiffs\u2019 lots, provided they have so or otherwise lawfully gained access, for bathing, swimming and temporarily anchoring boats.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">There remain the questions whether the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>i) may lounge and picnic on the boulevard and ii) has a right, via the boulevard, of access to and from the water for swimming and boating.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Lounging and picnicking on this wide boulevard, activities which need not involve use of the water, are not riparian or littoral rights. We agree with the Court of Appeals that \"[tjhose activities are in no way directly related to a true riparian use of the waters of Higgins Lake; even assuming that the defendants choose to lounge and picnic on the boulevard because of the lake\u2019s proximity. In that context, the only 'use\u2019 of the water is the enjoyment of its scenic presence\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Just as clearly, access to and from the water is a riparian or littoral right.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the plaintiffs own the riparian or littoral rights as an incident of front lot ownership, it does not follow necessarily that the public does not have the right to enter and leave the water from the boulevard. The question to which the parties have devoted most of their attention in this litigation (ownership of the riparian or littoral rights)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is, again, not dispositive. The question whether the public has the right to enter and leave the water from the boulevard, like the question whether they may lounge and picnic on the boulevard, depends, rather, on the scope of the dedication.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Plaintiffs rely on <em>Croucher v Wooster,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which recognized riparian or littoral rights as an incident of ownership of land separated from a lake by a roadway, and on <em>Meridian Township v Palmer,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which declared that the public there did not have a right of access to and from a lake via a roadway along the lake. Defendants assert that those cases are distinguishable because there the roadway was only an easement, the owner retaining the fee, and in the instant case the boulevard was dedicated pursuant to a plat act providing that the recording of a plat \"shall be deemed a sufficient conveyance to <em>vest the fee </em>of such parcels of land as may be therein designated for public uses in the city or village * * * or * * * township * * * in trust to and for the uses and purposes therein designated, and for no other use or purpose whatever\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In an early case, <em>Backus v Detroit,</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court concluded that the city could build a wharf in the Detroit River at the end of a street dedicated in a plat governed by a statute substantively the same as the statute in force when the instant plat was recorded. Recognizing that if an individual had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>acquired the fee to the street he would have acquired riparian rights, including the right to construct a wharf, the Court declared that the question of the city\u2019s right to construct a wharf did not depend on whether, by reason of the plat act, \"title passed instead of a mere easement\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court also declared that the fee passed from the plattor \"by the dedication, and the street became subject to all the ordinary uses of city streets. And one of these uses is for a ferry landing when a franchise for the purpose has been obtained\u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court concluded that the scope of the dedication included public access to the river; \"that the city derives its authority from the dedication of the public way, and that the construction of a wharf which shall give the means of access from the highway by land to the highway by water, is not inconsistent with the gift\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In <em>Meridian Township </em>the question was whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>there was a right of access to and from a lake via a roadway running beside it. The Court declared that cases like <em>Backus, </em>\"involving a street which <em>terminates </em>upon a navigable body of water\u201d (emphasis in original), were distinguishable from those where access is sought from a roadway parallelling the water.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s conclusion was again based on its perception of the scope of the dedication:</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\"In the instant case, however, plaintiff has failed to show that the public acquired any interest beyond a 66-foot easement of passage for roadway purposes. When an easement is given for roadway purposes, the grantors of the easement do not part with their rights to property adjoining the road or to relicted land. There was a total lack of proof showing that the easement in the 66-foot strip included the right in the public to go onto the lake; nor is the lake front a terminus of the road as in <em>Backus v Detroit, supra. </em>^<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Backus </em>was described thus in <em>Meridian Township:</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">\"The opinion states that in thus dedicating the way to the river it was the <em>intention of the grantor </em>to give the public access to the river and not merely to a wall on its bank or some other obstruction put up to preclude access; and that it must have been <em>understood by the grantors </em>that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\"' \"the purpose was to provide means of access for the public to navigable waters,\u201d and that \"such was the <em>scope and purpose of the dedication.\u2019\u201d\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In <em>Cass County Park Trustees v Wendt,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court, speaking of <em>Backus, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">\"It will be noted that the decision was based on the conclusion of the Court as to the <em>scope of the dedication </em>of the street as shown on the plat, and in support of its conclusion the Court cited decisions from other states and also decisions of the Federal supreme court.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">In the instant case, the right of the public to enter and leave the water from the boulevard thus depends on the scope of the dedication, not on who owns the riparian or littoral rights. The plaintiffs may own such rights (including, for example, the right to erect and maintain docking and mooring facilities), and yet there may have been a dedication to the public of a right to lounge and picnic, on the boulevard and to enter and leave the water for swimming and boating purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The Court of Appeals held that lounging, picnicking and access to and from the water were within the scope of the dedication. While the Court of Appeals perceived the pertinent inquiry, we agree with the plaintiffs that the scope of the dedication was not within the stipulated issues. The Court of Appeals should not have reached the question whether the boulevard was dedicated not only for pedestrian and vehicular uses but additionally for park or beach uses such as lounging, picnicking and access to and from the water for swimming and boating.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">It does not appear from the stipulation of facts and issues on which this appeal is presented whether the scope of dedication issue was addressed in the circuit court. Few facts are presented; we are told only that this is a sandy, overgrown strip of land, named a boulevard, dedicated as a \"street\u201d, used as a beach, \"taken over\u201d under the McNitt act<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> by the Roscommon County Road Commission, not opened or maintained for vehicular traffic although other streets in the subdivision have been. The issues concerning the scope of the dedication, and its acceptance or abandonment mentioned in the briefs should be first addressed in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Because we agree with the Court of Appeals that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>lounging and picnicking on the boulevard are not riparian or littoral rights, and because even if the plaintiffs own such rights they could not, on that basis alone, bar the public from entering or leaving the water (if such activities were within the scope of the dedication), we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals insofar as it vacates the judgment of the circuit court barring the defendants from lounging and picnicking on the boulevard and entering and leaving the water. Because the Court of Appeals should not have addressed the scope of dedication issue, we vacate so much of its opinion as decides that lounging and picnicking on the boulevard and entering and leaving the water are within the scope of the dedication.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Since both plaintiffs and defendants were in error in asserting that the public\u2019s right to enter and leave the water from the boulevard depended on who owns the riparian or littoral rights, we remand the cause to the circuit court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In sum, the decision of the Court of Appeals vacating the injunction (except insofar as the injunction bars the defendants from erecting and maintaining docks and boat hoists and from using plaintiffs\u2019 docks and boat hoists) and modifying it,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> is affirmed.

As before stated, it interferes in no manner with the navigation, and the ostensible purpose in constructing it is to aid navigation, not to hinder or embarrass it. But the strip of land was not granted to an individual, but was dedicated to the use of the public as a street. The city is not the public, though it represents the public for all the purposes of control, repair and improvement of the street. The plat, under the statute which was in force when it was made and recorded, passed the fee in all streets marked upon it to the county in which the city is situated: 1871 CL 1345 [1839 PA 91 as amended by 1859 PA 35]; but this was only in trust for street purposes. We attach no special importance to the fact that the title passed instead of a mere easement. The purpose of the statute is not to give the county the usual rights of a proprietor, but to preclude questions which might arise respecting the public uses, other than those of mere passage, to which the land might be devoted.
