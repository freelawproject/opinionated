In particular, \u00a7 255(b), applicable in eighteen counties, including Prince George\u2019s County, permits certain gambling activities by charitable organizations, but explicitly prohibits any individual or group of individuals from benefitting financially from any such activity. Section 258B, applicable only in Prince George\u2019s County, permits charitable organizations to conduct \u201cbenefit performances,\u201d denominated as \u201ccasino nights,\u201d at which designated gaming events are permitted. This section does not include an express requirement that no individual or group of individuals can benefit financially from the event. The issue is whether, in view of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 255(b) and 258B, volunteer dealers and other workers at casino night events in Prince George\u2019s County may benefit financially by receiving gratuities or tips from patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Section 255(b), enacted in its original form by ch. 679 of the Acts of 1949, provides in subsection (b)(1) that it is not unlawful for a charitable organization \u201cto conduct or hold a carnival, bazaar, or raffle for [its] exclusive benefit ..., if no individual or group of individuals benefits financially from the holding of any [such event] or receives or is paid any of the proceeds from [the event], for personal use or benefit.\u201d Subsection (b)(2) authorizes the charitable organization to \u201caward prizes in cash or in merchandise by such devices as are commonly designated as paddle wheels, wheels of fortune, chance books, bingo, or any other gaming device.\u201d Subsection (b)(3) requires that such \u201ccarnivals, bazaars, or raffles shall be managed by the members of [the charitable organization] personally through its members.\u201d It was not until the enactment of ch. 438 of the Acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of 1973 that \u00a7 255(b) was made applicable to Prince George\u2019s County, having been passed by the Legislature on April 9, 1973, and signed into law by the Governor on May 21, 1973, with an effective date of July 1, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Also enacted at the same 1973 session of the Legislature by ch. 342 was \u00a7 258B(a) and (b), applicable only in Prince George\u2019s County. This section was passed as an emergency measure pursuant to Art. XVI, \u00a7 2 of the Maryland Constitution and was signed by the Governor on May 7, 1973, and took effect on that date. Section 258B(a) authorizes charitable organizations in Prince George\u2019s County</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHa\">\u201cto conduct and operate any benefit performance, such as an outdoor or indoor carnival, fair, picnic, dance, card party, bingo party, bazaar, concert, contest, exhibition, lecture, barbecue or dinner, at which the public is invited or admitted ..., the net proceeds of which benefit performance shall inure to [the charitabl\u00e9 organization] ..., and not for the private gain of any member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">This subsection further makes it lawful at such a \u201cbenefit performance ... to award prizes in merchandise ... and other things of value ... or by such mechanical devices as are commonly designated as paddle wheels, wheels of fortune, bingo, or other similar methods,\u201d and to award cash prizes not to exceed $1,000 per prize. Also required by this subsection as a condition to operate any such benefit performance is a written permit from the county and the further requirement that the benefit performance be \u201cmanaged and operated only by members of such ... [charitable] organization personally.\u201d Section 258B(b) authorizes charitable organizations to conduct \u201craffles\u201d under conditions similar to those set forth in subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Subsection (c)(2) of \u00a7 258B was enacted by ch. 194 of the Acts of 1987; it defined the term \u201ccasino night\u201d to mean \u201ca benefit performance conducted under the provisions of this section at which card games, wheels of fortune, or roulette are played and prizes are awarded.\u201d Subsection (c)(3), enacted by the same 1987 Act, requires that a county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>permit fee of $50 be charged \u201cfor each casino night to be conducted.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">From the aforegoing, it is clear that \u00a7 255(b), as it applies in Prince George\u2019s County, requires compliance with three conditions: (1) the proceeds of any event must inure to the exclusive benefit of the organization; (2) no individual may benefit financially from any event or be paid from its proceeds; and (3) members of the organization must personally manage any event. Under \u00a7 258B, five conditions are imposed: (1) the public must be invited or admitted to any event; (2) the proceeds of any event must accrue to the organization for the promotion of its charitable purposes, and not for the private gain of any member; (3) prizes may not exceed one thousand dollars; (4) the organization must obtain a permit for a benefit performance; and (5) members of the organization must personally manage and operate the event. It is thus readily evident that the second condition in \u00a7 255(b) \u2014 that no individual benefit financially from any event \u2014 is not expressly included as a condition in \u00a7 258B(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The Crescent Cities Jaycees Foundation and the Prince George\u2019s Jaycees Foundation (Jaycees) are non-profit, charitable organizations in Prince George\u2019s County. In order to raise money for their philanthropic endeavors, the Jaycees periodically conduct \u201ccasino nights,\u201d at which patrons play various games of chance such as card games, roulette, and wheels of fortune. At these casino nights, the Jaycees permit patrons to tip volunteer dealers and other workers who staff the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">In the spring of 1990, the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Environmental Resources (DER) revoked the Jaycees\u2019 permit to conduct casino nights on the ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>organizations unlawfully permitted their volunteer dealers and workers to accept tips from patrons in violation of the \u201cno-financial-benefit\u201d provision of \u00a7 255(b)(1). The Jaycees appealed to the Board of Administrative Appeals for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">After a hearing, the Board vacated the revocations. It held that the \u201cno-financial-benefit\u201d provision of \u00a7 255(b)(1) does not apply to casino nights and, in any event, \u201cis not a substantive provision, but is a rule of construction on how to interpret the regulation.\u201d The Board also determined that tips are not part of the net proceeds of a casino night event and, consequently, no worker received any financial benefit from the net proceeds of the event. In concluding that no applicable provision of the gaming laws prevented casino night volunteer workers from receiving tips, the Board observed that the giving of tips \u201cis not an element or step of the gambling transaction itself\u201d but rather was a gratuity \u201cvoluntarily given to one who performs a service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The County appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County; the State was permitted to intervene in support of the County\u2019s position that \u00a7 255(b)(1) prohibited the tipping of volunteer workers. The court (Rymer, J.) affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. It agreed with the Board that tips are not part of the net proceeds of the benefit performance and that nothing in \u00a7 258B(a) prohibits tipping. It concurred with the Board that \u00a7 255(b) has no application to casino nights, in effect rejecting the argument that the \u201cno-financial-benefit\u201d clause of \u00a7 255(b)(1), which prohibits tipping, is incorporated into the provisions of \u00a7 258B. The court reasoned that the wording of \u00a7 255(b), which provides that the gaming laws \u201cmay not be construed to make it unlawful\u201d for charitable organizations to conduct gambling events under certain conditions, indicates that the Legislature was merely creating a \u201cpresumption of legality\u201d for events conducted in compliance with those conditions. Where an event violates one of the conditions, according to the court, the presumption of legality afforded to the event by \u00a7 255(b) \u2022 simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>falls away, and a reviewing court would evaluate the event under the remaining provisions of the gaming laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The State appealed. We granted certiorari before review by the intermediate appellate court to consider the issue of significant import raised in the case to the sponsors of charitable gaming events in Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Reduced to its essence, \u00a7 255(b) instructs that it \u201cmay not be construed [as] unlawful\u201d for charitable organizations such as the Jaycees to conduct specified gambling activities at \u201ccarnivals, bazaars and raffles,\u201d as long as they comply with the three conditions previously outlined. By contrast, \u00a7 258B applies to casino nights and expressly permits Prince George\u2019s County charitable organizations such as the Jaycees to conduct such benefit events, as long as they comply with the five conditions previously set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The State does not suggest that the provisions of \u00a7 258B(a) expressly prohibit tipping, or that tips are part of the proceeds of a casino night event; rather, the State argues that \u00a7 255(b) applies to casino nights, that its provisions are in effect superimposed upon and supplement those of \u00a7 258B(a), and that the \u201cno-financial-benefit\u201d clause of \u00a7 255(b) therefore prohibits tipping at casino nights in Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The Jaycees do not deny that gratuities given to the volunteer workers at casino nights constitute a \u201cfinancial benefit\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 255(b). They argue, rather, that \u00a7 255(b) does not apply to casino nights and, even if it does, its provisions are not applicable to casino nights conducted in compliance with \u00a7 258B(a). The Jaycees essentially endorse the circuit court\u2019s view, arguing that \u00a7\u00a7 255(b) and 258B(a) are separate statutes and do not conflict. Refining the circuit court\u2019s \u201cpresumption of legality\u201d concept, they submit that \u00a7 255(b) cannot be read to limit what is lawful under the gaming laws, but only limits what the gaming laws might suggest is unlawful. Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>casino nights which comply with the provisions of \u00a7 258B(a) (but which allow tipping) are clearly lawful, the Jaycees assert, \u00a7 255(b) has no bearing on their legality because that section only serves to protect some events which might otherwise be illegal, without outlawing events which would otherwise be legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The Jaycees maintain that the Board\u2019s decision was predicated on its factual finding, to which we should defer, that tips are not part of the net proceeds of a casino night event and thus are not violative of \u00a7 258B(a). As we see it, however, the dispositive issue in the Board\u2019s decision was its determination that \u00a7 255(b) does not apply to casino nights but rather is merely a rule of construction. This obviously is a purely legal conclusion to which the appellate court owes no deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">As we have so often said, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intention. <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9 (1990); <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744, 580 A.2d 188 (1990); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471 (1988). As we said in <em>Bridges v. Nicely, </em>304 Md. 1, 10, 497 A.2d 142 (1985), when construing a provision of a statute, which is part of a statutory scheme, the legislative intention must be gathered from the entire statute, rather than from only one part. In other words, where statutes relate to the same subject matter, and are not inconsistent with each other, they should be construed together and harmonized where consistent with their general object and scope. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 497 A.2d 142, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Thus, we do not read particular language in a statute in isolation or out of context; rather, we construe statutory language in light of the Legislature\u2019s general purpose and in the context of the statute as a whole. <em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual, </em>322 Md. 689, 696-97, 589 A.2d 944 (1991); <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513-16, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). In this regard, we note that \u00a7 246 provides a specific directive on the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>interpretation of the State\u2019s gaming laws. That section requires that \u201cthe courts shall construe the preceding sections [prohibiting gambling and betting] liberally, so as to prevent the mischiefs intended to be provided against.\u201d We have held \u00a7 246 to apply to all sections prohibiting gambling, even those enacted subsequent to \u00a7 246. <em>Gaither v. Cate, </em>156 Md. 254, 144 A. 239 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The Attorney General of Maryland, in an opinion dated February 2, 1988, reported at 73 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 152, responded to a legislative inquiry of \u201cwhether dealers or other attendants at Casino Nights in Prince George\u2019s County may accept tips from patrons.\u201d The Attorney General said that the practice violated \u00a7 255(b), and that charitable organizations knowingly permitting the practice would be engaged in illegal gambling. In so holding, the Attorney General noted the absence in \u00a7 258B(a) of any express prohibition on tipping of volunteer workers at Casino Night activities. Nevertheless, while he concluded that tips given to dealers at Casino Nights were not \u201cproceeds of the gambling,\u201d he opined that such tips did violate \u00a7 255(b)(1). He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">\u201cWe think that a member of an organization who receives tips for serving as a dealer or other attendant at the organization\u2019s casino night clearly does !benefi[t] financially from the holding of\u2019 the casino night. Moreover, we think that the benefit to that individual is a direct one and thus clearly contravenes the intent of the restriction.... Accordingly, we conclude that the receipt of tips by dealers or other attendants at casino nights violates \u00a7 255(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">\u201cSection 258B(a) does not contain language like that in \u00a7 255(b)(1) expressly imposing a broad prohibition against private gain from the holding of a fundraiser. Accordingly, it does not by itself clearly prohibit dealers or attendants from accepting tips. However, we do not think that \u00a7 258B was intended to negate any of the restrictions imposed by \u00a7 255 on gambling for charitable purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u201cSection 258B was enacted by Chapter 342 of the Laws of Maryland 1973. Section 255 was made applicable in Prince George\u2019s County by an amendment enacted in the same session of the General Assembly. Chapter 438, Laws of Maryland 1973. The General Assembly was presumably aware that it was enacting two laws, with somewhat differing language, regarding gambling by nonprofit organizations in Prince George\u2019s County. Therefore, the two laws should be read together so as to give full effect to each. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 516, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). That can be accomplished by reading their provisions as cumulative, giving effect to the more restrictive whenever the provisions are not identical.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">73 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 154-55 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Of course, courts are not bound by an Attorney General\u2019s Opinion. <em>Read Drug/Chem. Co. v. Claypoole, </em>165 Md. 250, 257, 166 A. 742 (1933); however, \u201cwhen the meaning of legislative language is not entirely clear, such legal interpretation should be given great consideration in determining the legislative intention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this regard, the Legislature is presumed to have known of the Attorney General\u2019s statutory interpretation and to have acquiesced in that construction absent change in the statutory language. <em>Id. </em>at 257-58, 166 A. 742. To like effect, <em>see Crest Investment v. Cohen, </em>245 Md. 639, 648, 227 A.2d 8 (1967). <em>See also Twinbrook Swim Pool v. Comptroller, </em>274 Md. 88, 333 A.2d 49 (1975); <em>Leitch v. Gaither, </em>151 Md. 167, 176-77, 134 A. 317 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We think that the Board and the circuit court erred by focusing on the language of \u00a7 255(b)(1) in isolation from the rest of \u00a7 255(b). As set forth earlier, \u00a7 255(b)(2) provides that an organization \u201cmay award prizes in cash or in merchandise by such devices as are commonly designated as paddle wheels, <em>wheels of fortune, </em>chance books, bingo, or <em>any other gaming device.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). This language indicates that the provisions of \u00a7 255(b) encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>pass casino night benefit performances, for wheels of fortune and \u201cother gaming devices,\u201d such as card games and roulette, are precisely the games which comprise casino night activities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This reading of the statute is supported by the fact that, as originally enacted in 1949, \u00a7 255(b) was not subdivided into separate parts. Rather, the legislature conceived that the playing of wheels of fortune and other gaming devices would occur at carnivals, bazaars and raffles, indicating that it considered those events to encompass what we now know as casino nights. Moreover, the broader context of \u00a7 255 confirms this reading of \u00a7 255(b). For example, Section 255(f)(5), enacted by ch. 464 of the Acts of 1990 and entitled \u201cBaltimore County \u2014 Gaming\u2014Casino Events\u201d, provided in part: \u201cIn Baltimore County, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section ...: Card games, dice games, and roulette, and any events commonly known as casino nights, are prohibited.\u201d Section 255(g)(3) similarly provides in part: \u201cIn Howard County, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section: Card games, dice games, roulette, and any events commonly known as casino nights are prohibited.\u201d Obviously, the Legislature would not have found it necessary to prohibit casino nights in Baltimore and Howard Counties, specifically disclaiming the reach of \u00a7 255(b), if that section did not extend to casino nights. To construe \u00a7 255(b) otherwise would render the prohibitions on casino nights in \u00a7 255(f)(5) and (g)(3) superfluous, in contravention of our practice to read a statute, where possible, to give effect to all of its parts. <em>Sinai Hosp. v. Dep\u2019t of Employment, </em>309 Md. 28, 40, 522 A.2d 382 (1987); <em>Management Personnel Serv. v. Sandefur, </em>300 Md. 332, 341, 478 A.2d 310 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Giving full sway to the legislative intention so clearly expressed in \u00a7 246 that the gaming law prohibitions be liberally construed to prevent the evils inherent in gam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>bling, we construe the restrictive conditions in \u00a7 255(b) to be cumulative to those contained in \u00a7 258B(a). In this regard, we again observe that \u00a7 258B became effective on May 7, 1973, while \u00a7 255(b) was made applicable in Prince George\u2019s County, effective July 1, 1973. We presume, of course, that the Legislature acts with full knowledge of its prior enactments and intends that related statutes be blended into a harmonious body of law, even though they took effect at different times and without reference to one another. <em>Bricker, supra, </em>321 Md. at 93, 581 A.2d 9. There would seem to be few more appropriate situations for applying this presumption than the instant case, in which the General Assembly amended \u00a7 255(b) to include Prince George\u2019s County just two weeks after it enacted \u00a7 258B. We must assume that the Legislature, in extending the reach of \u00a7 255(b) to Prince George\u2019s County, was fully aware of its decision just two weeks earlier to expressly authorize casino nights in that county under certain conditions, although not including an express requirement that no individual benefit financially from the gambling activity. We conclude, therefore, that the General Assembly realized that in its 1973 amendment of \u00a7 255(b) to include Prince George\u2019s County in its coverage, it was implicitly including the no-financial-benefit restriction within the conditions imposed for casino night events conducted under \u00a7 258B(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Sections 255(b) and 258B, as they apply in Prince George\u2019s County, are part of a single statutory scheme permitting gaming activities by charitable organizations in that county. As we have already noted, by ch. 194 of the Acts of 1987, the Legislature repealed and reenacted \u00a7\u00a7 255(b) and 258B in a single bill, indicating legislative recognition that these provisions not be considered as distinct enclaves of legality in the laws governing gaming activities by charitable organizations. Applicable here is our long-standing rule against construing sections of a statute in isolation from one another without regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>actual legislative intent. <em>See Forbes, </em>322 Md. at 696-97, 589 A.2d 944. We have previously adhered to this rule in interpreting the reach of \u00a7 255(b). In <em>State v. 149 Slot Machines, </em>310 Md. 356, 529 A.2d 817 (1987), we held that the phrase \u201cany other gaming device\u201d in \u00a7 255(b) did not exempt an organization desiring to use slot machines from the ban on slot machines in \u00a7 264B. It was our view that a contrary result would contravene the Legislature\u2019s clear hostility to slot machines, manifested in four separate rejections of amendments that would have exempted certain organizations from \u00a7 264B. <em>Cf. American Legion v. State, </em>294 Md. 1, 447 A.2d 842 (1982) (charitable organizations may conduct raffles under \u00a7 255, despite the prohibition on lotteries in \u00a7 356, because the Legislature did not intend for \u00a7 356 to apply to raffles conducted under \u00a7 255).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Accordingly, we are in full agreement with the State\u2019s position that the condition in \u00a7 255(b) that no individual may benefit financially from the gaming activity prohibits tipping of volunteer dealers and other workers, and that this prohibition is applicable to casino night activities under \u00a7 258B.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED.
