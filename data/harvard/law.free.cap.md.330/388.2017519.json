With that additional award, the claimant qualified for additional compensation under the \u201cserious disability\u201d provision of \u00a7 36(3)(a)(iii).

Ch. 446, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1970. The new section provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">\u201cSerious <em>Disability. </em>\u2014 A person who, from one accident, receives an award of compensation for a period of two hundred and fifty (250) weeks or more under subsections (3) or (4) or a combination of both, is thereby considered to have a Serious Disability____ The weeks for such award shall be increased by one-third (computed to the nearest whole number); and the compensation shall be for sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages, in no case to exceed Sixty-five dollars ($65.00) per week and not less than a minimum of twenty-five dollars per week unless the employee\u2019s established weekly wages are less than twenty-five dollars per week at the time of the injury, in which event he shall receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>compensation equal to his full wages---- Provided however, that any additional compensation for permanent partial disability on a petition to reopen shall not increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and actually paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In 1975, \u00a7 36(4A) was amended. The maximum weekly award was repealed and replaced with a formula based on two-thirds of the average weekly wage as determined by the State Department of Employment Security. In addition, the minimum weekly benefit was increased from $25.00 to $50.00. Ch. 639 of the Acts of 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">In 1988, the General Assembly repealed \u00a7 36(4A) and in its place enacted \u00a7 36(3)(a)(iii) which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cAn award of compensation, from one accident, for a period equal to or greater than 250 weeks as specified in paragraphs (c) through (Z), inclusive, of this subsection, or any combination of awards thereunder, except that an award for disfigurement or mutilation under paragraph (h) of this subsection shall not be considered a determination of serious disability, shall be increased by one-third the number of weeks (computed to the nearest whole number) and the total shall be paid at a rate of sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages, in no case to exceed seventy-five per centum of the average weekly wage of the State of Maryland as determined by the Department of Employment and Training____ However, any additional compensation for permanent partial disability on a petition to reopen shall not increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and actually paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Ch. 591, \u00a7 2 of the Acts of 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">The credit proviso found at the end of the subsection stating, that any additional compensation awarded upon reopening shall not increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and actually paid, has been present in the Maryland \u201cserious disability\u201d statute since its introduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>tion in 1965. While this Court has never had the opportunity to interpret the provision where an award of serious disability has been made subsequent to the payment of compensation previously awarded, its application under those circumstances has been addressed by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In <em>Gordon v. Baltimore Spice Company, </em>17 Md.App. 300, 301 A.2d 41, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 755 (1973), the court interpreted the credit proviso as it appeared in Md.Code (1957, 1964 RepLVol. and 1968 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 36(4a). In that case, an employee who had sustained an accidental injury to his back was initially awarded compensation for a 25% industrial loss of the use of his back, which under the \u201cother cases\u201d provisions \u00a7 36(4) entitled him to compensation at $25.00 per week for 125 weeks. After that award was paid in full, his condition worsened. The case was reopened and the Commission found he now had 45 percent industrial loss of the use of his body as a result of the injury to his back. The Commission awarded him 225 weeks of compensation and added 75 weeks pursuant to the \u201cserious disability\u201d provision thus entitling him to 300 weeks of compensation. The Commission credited to the employer-insurer the original 125 weeks of compensation already paid in full leaving him with a balance of 175 weeks at the \u201cserious disability\u201d rate of $40.00 per week. On their appeal to the Superior Court for Baltimore City, the employer and insurer filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that after establishing the revised award on reopening, the Commission should have deducted the weeks of compensation already paid before calculating the increase of one-third weeks for the \u201cserious disability\u201d designation. The Superior Court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201cIn the earlier part of the section the statute draws a distinction between the extra award of the number of weeks and an extra award in the amount of weekly compensation. It seems reasonable that when the legislature used the word compensation at the end of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>to limit the increase of the award that it would be presumed to use the word in the same sense in which it had used it immediately above, i.e., referring specifically to the amount payable per week rather than as a limitation on the number of weeks____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cIf at the original hearing, the claimant in this case had been awarded a 45% disability, he would have received compensation at the rate of $40 a week for 300 weeks for a total of $12,000. As a result of the proviso at the end of the section, he must suffer a penalty by reason of the fact that his ultimate disability was not established until after his first award was paid. We can see no reason why the number of weeks of compensation should be reduced as well as the amount of weekly payments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aie\"><em>Id. </em>17 Md.App. at 304, 301 A.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The court relied in part on Maurice J. Pressman, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation in Maryland, </em>\u00a7 5-3(12)(h) (1972 Supp.), where the author discussed the treatment of the section in the Maryland trial courts and by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cThere is a diversity of opinion among the members of the Commission and the nisi prius Courts throughout the State as to the method of calculating the additional number of weeks which added to a previous award on a petition to reopen changes the disability to a Serious Disability. For instance, if an injured employee had been awarded a 20% permanent partial disability, or 100 weeks at $25.00 a week, under \u201cOther Cases,\u201d Section 36(4), and subsequently, on a <em>petition to reopen </em>to show an increased disability, the disability is increased to 40%, the claimant became entitled to compensation for a Serious Disability (before 1970), of 200 weeks plus an additional one-third number of weeks. Claimants contend that they are entitled to an additional one-third <em>of the 200 weeks, </em>or an extra 67 weeks, making a total of 267 weeks, from which should be subtracted the 100 weeks previously awarded <em>and paid, </em>leaving 167 weeks payable at $40.00 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>week. This method of computation had been upheld ... [by] several nisi prius Courts. As this class of disability was created and innovated in Maryland in 1965 to allow a <em>more adequate award </em>to injured employees whose disability is considered to be serious, and the law contemplates that the \u2018higher element or measure of damage\u2019 should be allowed a claimant, it would appear that the fairest method of computing the additional one-third number of weeks is that adopted in the aforegoing nisi prius rulings. A guide, using this plan of calculation, was prepared after the enactment of this legislation, by the Hon. Daniel T. Doherty, the Chairman of the Commission, but was apparently not followed by all of the Commissioners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 130-31. (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In <em>Maizel v. Maizel &amp; Shapiro Enter., </em>25 Md.App. 1, 332 A.2d 261, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 753 (1975), the court again applied Md.Code (1957,1964 Repl.Yol. and 1969 Cum.Supp.), Article 101 \u00a7 36(4a). Maizel had been injured in the course of his employment, was found to have 35 percent permanent partial disability of his back under \u201cother cases\u201d, and was awarded compensation at $25.00 per week for 80 weeks. His condition worsened and he petitioned to reopen his case. He was subsequently awarded $40 per week (the \u201cserious disability\u201d rate) for 300 weeks based on a .45 percent disability. The award was subject to a credit of 80 weeks for compensation paid. On appeal to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the claimant argued that he was entitled to the difference between the first and second weekly wage rate awards multiplied by the number of credited weeks of compensation. He further argued that the provision as applied was violative of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and, if constitutional, the provision was misapplied. The circuit court rejected the constitutional claim and upheld the Commission\u2019s calculation of the award. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. Speaking for the court, the late Chief Judge Richard P. Gilbert stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201cMaizel\u2019s argument with respect to this contention appears to us to have been answered by this Court in <em>Gordon v.

The present law does not provide for a re-adjustment of compensation previously paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\"><em>Id. </em>25 Md.App. at 6, 332 A.2d at 264 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">In <em>Schindele v. Nu-Car Carriers, Inc., </em>42 Md.App. 705, 402 A.2d 1307 (1979), the issue was whether the credit proviso in Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol. and 1972 Cum. Supp.), Article 101, \u00a7 36(4a) addressed the total amount of compensation paid up to the time of the supplemental award or the compensation paid from the date the Commission designated as the starting point of the supplemental award. In that case, it was the difference between crediting 175 weeks of compensation actually paid or crediting only 28 weeks of compensation paid because the starting date of the new award was made retroactive. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission adopted the former view. The case reached the intermediate appellate court on an appeal from the Circuit Court for Howard County which agreed with the Commission. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding \u201c[a]s written, we think the proviso requires that the date of the second award be the date on which the calculation be made as to what amount of a previous award has been \u2018actually paid\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709-10, 402 A.2d at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>More recently, Richard P. Gilbert and Robert L. Humphries in their treatise, <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook </em>\u00a7 9.4-4 (1988), commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cThe Act allows a claimant to petition for reopening because of a worsening condition. If, for instance, an injured scheduled member receives later impairment from a traumatic arthritic condition, a reopening would be appropriate. When the condition of an injured employee deteriorates to the point where he qualifies for a serious disability award, he may petition the Commission to have his case reopened to obtain additional compensation. In other words, if an employee has been awarded compensation for less than 250 weeks and his condition worsens so that he is entitled to 250 weeks or more, he may ask the Commission to consider granting him an award for \u201cserious disability.\u201d Since the Commission is prohibited from increasing compensation previously awarded and actually paid, the worker may receive compensation at the serious disability rate for only those weeks unpaid as of the date of the second award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 204-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The position of the Court of Special Appeals and the Maryland commentators can be summarized as follows: when upon reopening the case the Commission awards sufficient weeks of compensation to satisfy the \u201cserious disability\u201d threshold, the claimant is entitled to an additional one-third weeks of compensation at the \u201cserious disability\u201d weekly rate; the award of compensation, however, is subject to a credit for all weeks of compensation under the weekly rate paid prior to the date of the award of \u201cserious disability\u201d benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">On April 22, 1985, Telford Hyatt, while in the course of his employment as a carpenter, fell some 15 feet from a scaffold injuring both ankles and feet. Hyatt sought medical care for his injuries and filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission against his employer and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>insurer (\u201cthe appellants\u201d). A hearing was held on October 30, 1987 before Commissioner J. Max Millstone. Commissioner Millstone found that Hyatt had sustained a permanent partial disability under \u201cother cases\u201d, amounting to 35 percent industrial loss of use of his body. In a December 4, 1987 award, the appellants were ordered to pay Hyatt 175 weeks of compensation at the rate of $109 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In the period following the issuance of that award, Hyatt was unable to return to carpentry work. His condition worsened, and he underwent exploratory surgery to one of his feet. The surgery failed to improve the condition. Instead, his condition continued to worsen and planned surgery on his other foot was cancelled. He petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to reopen his claim to consider his worsening condition. A hearing was held on July 22, 1991, before Commissioner Robert S. Redding. On August 28, 1991, Commissioner Redding issued an order, finding that Hyatt then suffered a permanent partial disability under \u201cother cases\u201d amounting to 50 percent industrial loss of use of his body as a result of the worsening of his condition. Commissioner Redding further found that pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol. and 1990 Cum. Supp.), Article 101, \u00a7 36(3)(a)(iii), Hyatt now had a serious disability and was entitled to 250 weeks of compensation, plus an additional one-third weeks, or a total of 333 weeks, subject to a credit for the 175 weeks of compensation paid under the December 4, 1987 order. Accordingly, appellants were ordered to pay a balance of 158 weeks of compensation at the \u201cserious disability\u201d rate of $218 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Stapleford Hall Joint Venture and its insurer appealed to challenge the Commission\u2019s calculation of benefits due Hyatt. The circuit court affirmed the Commission\u2019s order. The employer and insurer then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, but prior to consideration of the case by the intermediate appellate court, we issued our writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In this Court, the appellants argue, as they did before the Commission and the circuit court, that the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>erred when it applied the one-third \u201cserious disability\u201d multiplier to benefits previously awarded and actually paid. Relying on the credit provision\u2019s mandate that \u201ca petition to reopen shall not increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and actually paid,\u201d the appellants conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzT\">\u201cIn order to arrive at the total of 333 weeks the Commission increased not only the new award of 15% (75 weeks) by one-third (25 weeks) but also the <em>prior </em>award of 35% (175 weeks) by an additional one-third (58 weeks).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The appellee urges that we affirm the circuit court based upon the decisions of the Court of Special Appeals discussed in Part II, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In applying Art. 101, \u00a7 36(3)(a)(iii) to the facts of the instant case, we utilize well-settled precepts in our effort to accomplish what the Legislature intended.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cAgain and again, we have said that the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intention.

Thompson, </em>248 Md. at 686-89, 238 A.2d at 233-35 and in <em>Consolidated Eng. Co. v. Cooper, </em>246 Md. at 615, 228 A.2d at 825. As serious disability is governed by \u00a7 36(3)(a)(iii), the plain language of the statute reveals that a claimant can meet the threshold requirement of being entitled to 250 weeks of compensation for permanent partial disability arising from an accident by one award from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission or as a result of an accumulation of awards of the Commission after the reopening of the worker\u2019s claim. In the first instance, should the initial award be for compensation for a permanent partial disability for a period of 250 weeks, the award would be increased by one-third the number of weeks (83 weeks), and the claimant would be entitled to compensation at the serious disability rate for 333 weeks. We so held in the analogous situation presented in <em>Consolidated Eng. Co. v. Cooper, supra. </em>We perceive no reason why a claimant who qualifies for entitlement to serious disability benefits by aggregate awards, reflecting a worsening of his condition following an initial award, should be treated less favorably. The legislative recognition of greater responsibility on the part of the employer for an injury which results in \u201cserious disability\u201d expressly does not depend on whether that plateau is reached immediately after the worker\u2019s injury or whether it is reached as the result of the originally assessed disability worsening and being reassessed on a reopening of the worker\u2019s original claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>For these reasons we approve the holding of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Gordon v.

The number of weeks of compensation paid and payable under the revised disability assessment should be augmented by one-third, that number of weeks should be reduced by the weeks of compensation actually paid to the claimant under any previous order of the Commission, and the balance of weeks of compensation should be awarded to the claimant at the \u201cserious disability\u201d rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\">.
