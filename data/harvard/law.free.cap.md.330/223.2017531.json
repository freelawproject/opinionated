At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, the trial judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the charges of assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to maim.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>At the conclusion of all the evidence, the defendant excepted to the refusal of the court to instruct the jury on the issue of imperfect self-defense, contending that a finding of imperfect self-defense would mitigate the remaining aggravated assault charges to \u201cassault and battery.\u201d The jury found the defendant not guilty of the weapons charge and of assault with intent to disable, but guilty of malicious wounding with intent to disable and of battery. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court and we granted certiorari to consider the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury concerning imperfect self-defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The defendant argues that the principles of imperfect self-defense apply to every crime that requires proof of malice without regard to whether a criminal homicide is involved. He points to <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. 482, 485-86, 483 A.2d 759 (1984), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">[T]he difference between murder and manslaughter is the presence or absence of malice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">jj\u00ab * &gt;{e s[c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">[Imperfect self-defense] operates to negate malice, an element the State must prove to establish murder. As a result, the successful invocation of this doctrine does not completely exonerate the defendant, but mitigates murder to voluntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Thus, the defendant reasons, anything that \u201cnegates malice\u201d must mitigate an offense requiring proof of malice to a lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">The State counters with a two-pronged argument. First, it says, \u201cmalice\u201d as an element of the crime of murder differs from \u201cmalice\u201d with respect to other crimes, and imperfect self-defense negates only that species of malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>applicable to murder. Second, the State argues, the concept of mitigation has universally and historically been limited to offenses involving criminal homicide, or the \u201cshadow\u201d or inchoate forms of those offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the State\u2019s position, and with each of the interrelated prongs of its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In <em>State v. Faulkner, supra, </em>301 Md. at 486, 483 A.2d 759, this Court explained that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, like that of hot-blooded response to adequate provocation, does not serve to exonerate a defendant \u201cbut mitigates murder to voluntary manslaughter.\u201d We went on to hold that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">Logically, because the statutory offense [assault with intent to murder] is defined in terms of murder, all the defenses available in a murder prosecution are applicable in an assault with intent to murder prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 504, 483 A.2d 759. Thus, the Court held, the mitigation defense of imperfect self-defense applies to the statutory crime of assault with intent to murder. Recently, we characterized this latter holding as being perhaps \u201ca generous expansion of the law of self-defense____\u201d <em>Watkins v. State, </em>328 Md. 95, 106 n. 3, 613 A.2d 379 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">We also said in <em>Watkins </em>that \u201c[t]his Court has never held that imperfect self-defense applies to the offense[ ] ... of ... unlawful shooting with intent to disable____\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant in the instant case was convicted of unlawful wounding with the intent to disable, a variation of the offense of unlawful shooting with the intent to disable. These two forms of assault with intent to maim, disfigure, or disable arise from a single statute, Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 386. That statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>If any person shall unlawfully shoot at any person, or shall in any manner unlawfully and maliciously attempt to discharge any kind of loaded arms at any person, or shall unlawfully and maliciously stab, cut or wound any person, or shall assault or beat any person, with intent to maim, disfigure or disable such person, or with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any party for any offense for which the said party may be legally apprehended or detained, every such offender, and every person counselling, aiding or abetting such offender shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction are subject to imprisonment for not more than 15 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">With the exception of a change in the maximum permitted sentence, and certain minor amendments not here relevant, this statute exists today in the form in which it was enacted by Chapter 99 of the Laws of 1853. <em>See Hammond v. State, </em>322 Md. 451, 453, 588 A.2d 345 (1991). The statute sets forth alternative types of assaults and alternative states of mind, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\n<em>Types of Assaults</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">1. Unlawfully shoot at any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">2. Unlawfully, and maliciously attempt to discharge any kind of loaded arms at any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">3. Unlawfully and maliciously stab, cut or wound any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">4. Assault or beat any person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">\n<em>States of Mind</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">A. With intent to maim, disfigure or disable such person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>B. With intent to prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any party for any offense for which the said party may be legally apprehended or detained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">There seems never to have been any doubt that the fourth type of assault, \u201cassault or beat any person,\u201d had to be combined with one of the two alternative states of mind (A or B) to constitute an offense under the statute. Early on, however, a question arose as to whether the first three types of assault listed in the statute were self-standing offenses not requiring proof of any specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In <em>State v. Elborn, </em>27 Md. 483 (1867), the defendant was indicted in one count under the statute for an assault \u201cby unlawfully shooting at a certain John W. Downes\u201d (type of assault # 1) and in a separate count, for assault \u201cby attempting maliciously and unlawfully to discharge a loaded pistol at Downes\u201d (type of assault # 2), without any allegation that the defendant harbored specific intent A or B. The trial judge sustained the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the two counts, and the case reached this Court on a Writ of Error. Our predecessors sustained the granting of the demurrer, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">the two counts in this indictment are defective in not averring in the language of the Act, that the shooting was done with intent to maim, disfigure or disable Downes____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 489-90. Accordingly, it is clear that a crime charged under \u00a7 386 is a specific intent crime, and although a number of alternative elements are available, one of the alternative states of mind must be alleged together with one of the alternative types of assault in order to allege a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Even if the defendant\u2019s argument concerning crimes involving malice would have some validity if the crime charged in this case were \u201cunlawfully and maliciously wounding\u201d the victim, it is clear that this is not the offense proscribed by the statute. The crime here involved is \u201cunlawfully and maliciously wounding with intent to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>able.\u201d The grand jury charged that the defendant \u201cdid unlawfully, feloniously and maliciously wound Thomas Monroe Winston, with the intent to disable said Thomas Monroe Winston____\u201d This offense is virtually identical, for the purposes with which we are here concerned, with the offense of \u201cunlawful shooting with intent to disable,\u201d which this Court held in <em>Watkins </em>was not an offense to which the defense of imperfect self-defense would apply. <em>Watkins, </em>328 Md. at 106, 613 A.2d 379. The addition of the word \u201cmalicious\u201d has little, if any, significance in the description of these specific intent crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Moreover, imperfect self-defense would not apply even if the offense charged were \u201cunlawful and malicious shooting,\u201d and the concept of malice was conceivably of greater importance. Malice, as this Court has pointed out, is a chameleonic term, taking on different meanings according to the context in which it is used. In the context of murder cases, this Court has said that malice means the presence of the required malevolent state of mind coupled with the absence of legally adequate justification, excuse, or circumstances of mitigation. <em>Ross v. State, </em>308 Md. 337, 340 n. 1, 519 A.2d 735 (1987). When correctly defined in criminal cases not involving murder, malice does not involve proof of the absence of mitigation. Simply put, mitigation that will reduce one offense to another is a concept peculiar to criminal homicide cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">This concept of mitigation, <em>i.e., </em>the presence of circumstances sufficient to mitigate murder to manslaughter, developed in England at a time when murder was not divided into degrees and all murder was punishable by death. Recognizing that not all murders were equal in culpability, and that under some circumstances justice required that the perpetrator suffer a lesser stigma and sanction, the concept of mitigation was developed and the catchall of manslaughter was used as an appropriate repository for mitigated offenses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">Why is it that there exists such a crime as voluntary manslaughter to aid one who kills when provoked into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>passion, yet there is no crime like, say, voluntary theft or voluntary mayhem to aid others who, reasonably provoked into a passion, steal from or maim their tormentors? The answer is historical. With most crimes other than murder the English court came to have discretion as to the punishment and so could take extenuating circumstances into account in the sentencing process; but with murder the penalty remained fixed at death, without the possibility of making any allowance for the extenuating fact that the victim provoked the defendant into a reasonable passion. \u2018The rule of law that provocation may, within narrow bounds, reduce murder to manslaughter, represents an attempt by the courts to reconcile the preservation of the fixed penalty for murder with a limited concession to natural human weakness.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>Handbook on Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 76, at 582 (1972) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Perhaps the best known of the mitigators is the hotblooded response to adequate provocation. Although widely accepted as a mitigating circumstance in murder cases, this concept of mitigation has not ordinarily been used to reduce the grade or degree of any crime other than murder. In <em>Sensobaugh v. State, </em>92 Tex.Crim. 417, 244 S.W. 379 (1922), where a husband caught his wife in the act of adultery and cut off her paramour\u2019s sex organ with a razor, it was pointed out that although the doctrine of hot-blooded response to adequate provocation would have mitigated murder to manslaughter had the paramour died, the same provocation would not serve to reduce the crime of mayhem. <em>See also </em>LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>at 617 (stating that \u201cone who is \u2018reasonably provoked\u2019 into a rage to maim by the victim\u2019s conduct cannot use the provocation as a defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The defendant is in error in assuming that absence of mitigation is always an element of malice. The absence of mitigation is an element of malice only when the offense is one to which mitigation may apply to reduce the offense, <em>i.e., </em>offenses involving murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>With respect to other offenses requiring proof of malice, imperfect self-defense does not negate malice because the definition of malice in those cases does not include the concept of absence of mitigation. We agree, therefore, with the conclusion reached by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Bryant v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 237, 244, 574 A.2d 29 (1990), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">imperfect self-defense as a mitigating factor (as, indeed, the very phenomenon of mitigation generally) is limited to criminal homicide and its shadow forms, such as ... attempted murder____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The defendant cites <em>People v. McKelvy, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 694, 239 Cal.Rptr. 782 (1987), as authority for the proposition that imperfect self-defense will mitigate a non-homicide offense to a lesser offense. In <em>McKelvy, </em>the court stated that a genuinely held belief in the need for self-defense may constitute a defense to the crime of mayhem. <em>Id., </em>239 Cal.Rptr. at 786. The California intermediate appellate court quoted extensively from <em>People v. Flannel, </em>25 Cal.3d 668, 160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1 (1980), a decision of the California Supreme Court establishing imperfect self-defense as a mitigating factor in murder cases. The <em>McKelvy </em>court spoke in terms of the defendant\u2019s honestly held belief \u201cnegating malice\u201d and mitigating the offense. The <em>McKelvy </em>decision, however, may be explained on the basis of the special definition the court gave to the term \u201cmalice\u201d and to the hornbook proposition that proof of presence of the state of mind inconsistent with a specific intent required for the charged offense constitutes a defense to that offense. <em>See People v. Goins, </em>228 Cal.App.3d 511, 279 Cal.Rptr. 42, 45 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In California, the instruction on mayhem informs the jury that \u201cacting \u2018maliciously\u2019 means acting \u2018with an unlawful intent to vex, annoy, or injure another person.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKelvy, </em>239 Cal.Rptr. at 785 n. 3. Thus, the <em>McKelvy </em>court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">Although the \u2018malice\u2019 required for the offense of mayhem differs from the \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 with which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>Flannel </em>was concerned, it is equally true in both cases that the <em>requisite state of mind </em>is inconsistent with a genuine belief in the need for self defense. One who truly believes there is a need for self defense cannot be said to act with intent to \u2018vex, injure or annoy\u2019 and may be found guilty of no more than an assault or battery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6c\">Id., 239 Cal.Rptr. at 786 (emphasis added). More recently, the Supreme Court of California held that an honest but unreasonable belief that one is acting under duress is not a defense to the crime of robbery, because the defendant\u2019s belief did not negate the requisite specific intent, <em>i.e., </em>the intent to deprive the owner of the property. <em>People v. Bacigalupo, </em>1 Cal.4th 103, 2 Cal.Rptr.2d 335, 345-46, 820 P.2d 559, 569-70 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The defense of absence of the requisite specific intent to commit a crime should not be confused with the principle of mitigation. A defendant may intend the exact result he brings about, but be entitled to mitigation because of the circumstances that caused him to act. On the other hand, a defendant not entitled to mitigation may present as a defense evidence of an honestly held though objectively unreasonable belief that is inconsistent with the specific intent required to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Certainly, if the jury in the case before us found that the defendant held a subjectively honest, albeit unreasonable, belief inconsistent with the intent to disable, that would furnish a complete defense to this specific intent crime. That fact has nothing to do, however, with the mitigator of imperfect self-defense, which has no application here. The defendant\u2019s state of mind may be relevant and potentially decisive when it undercuts the essential element of specific intent that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. No separate instruction is needed for this defense. Instructions dealing with the essential elements that must be proven by the State and the standard of proof applicable in a criminal case fully cover the point. An instruction on imperfect self-defense under these circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>stances would not only be unnecessary, it would be inappropriate and confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">For entirely different reasons, however, we conclude that the conviction of malicious wounding with intent to disable must be reversed, and further, that the defendant cannot be retried for that offense. Three of the charges submitted to the jury were: assault with intent to disable; malicious wounding with intent to disable; and battery. The jury found the defendant not guilty of assault with intent to disable, but guilty of the other two charges. The explanation for the apparent inconsistency in the finding of not guilty of assault with intent to disable but guilty of malicious wounding with intent to disable is found in the instructions given by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In defining the crime of assault with intent to disable and its constituent elements, the judge explained the burden of the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of an assault and the existence of a specific intent to disable. When defining the crime of malicious wounding with intent to disable, however, the judge incorrectly told the jury that only the wounding and malice need be shown; he did not explain that the State was required to prove a specific intent to disable. No exception was taken to the instruction and the defendant did not raise the issue here or in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">An appellate court ordinarily will not decide any issue not raised in and decided by the trial court, and this Court ordinarily will not consider an issue not included in the petition for certiorari. Maryland Rule 8-131(a) and (b). This Court has held, however, that the word \u201cordinarily\u201d in the Rule does grant an appellate court discretion, under some circumstances, to consider and decide questions not raised in the trial court. <em>Atlantic Mutual v. Kenney, </em>323 Md. 116, 122, 591 A.2d 507 (1991); <em>Crown Oil v. Glen, </em>320 Md. 546, 561, 578 A.2d 1184 (1990); <em>Taub v. State, </em>296 Md. 439, 441-42, 463 A.2d 819 (1983). Additionally, Maryland Rule 4-325(e), which requires a timely objection to an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>struction in order to preserve the issue for appellate review, provides that \u201c[a]n appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.\u201d The question of whether we should exercise our discretion to take cognizance of plain error in this case is a close one, which we resolve in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Plain error is \u201cerror which vitally affects a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>State v. Daughton, </em>321 Md. 206, 211, 582 A.2d 521 (1990). We have limited the instances in which an appellate court should take cognizance of unobjected to error to those which are \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980). <em>See also Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 588, 602 A.2d 677 (1992); <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 594, 468 A.2d 45 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1268, 104 S.Ct. 3564, 82 L.Ed.2d 865 (1984). We will \u201cintervene in those circumstances only when the error complained of was so material to the rights of the accused as to amount to the kind of prejudice which precluded an impartial trial.\u201d <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 397, 478 A.2d 1143 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230, 105 S.Ct. 1231, 84 L.Ed.2d 368 (1985). In each case, we will \u201creview the materiality of the error in the context in which it arose, giving due regard to whether the error was purely technical, the product of conscious design or trial tactics or the result of bald inattention.\u201d <em>Hutchinson, supra, </em>287 Md. at 203, 411 A.2d 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The materiality of the error in this case is uniquely apparent. It is clear from the record that the jury found that the defendant assaulted the victim. It is equally clear that the jury found that the State had not proven the defendant harbored an intent to disable the victim. Correctly instructed concerning the offense of assault with intent to disable, the jury found the defendant not guilty of that offense, even though convinced an assault had occurred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The record offers no possible explanation for the not guilty verdict other than the jury\u2019s conclusion that the requisite specific intent had not been proven. The conviction of malicious wounding is explained by the erroneous instruction, which omitted any requirement of proof of intent to disable.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">This is not a case, therefore, in which we must speculate as to the effect of an erroneous instruction; rather, here we can say with reasonable certainty that the error in the instruction resulted in a guilty verdict that otherwise would not have been rendered. That type of error \u201cvitally affects a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial,\u201d and is therefore plain error of which we will take cognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel prohibits retrial of the defendant on the charge of malicious wounding with intent to disable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">The collateral estoppel form of double jeopardy is not based on two offenses being the same, but on two criminal charges having a common necessary factual component. If the common necessary factual issue is found in favor of the defendant in the first trial, the State may not relitigate the same factual issue in the second trial. If the fact is a necessary element in two offenses, a finding in favor of the defendant in the first trial on the issue requires an acquittal in the second trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\"><em>Apostoledes v. </em>State, 323 Md. 456, 463-64, 593 A.2d 1117 (1991) (citations omitted). <em>See also Ferrell v. State, </em>318 Md. 235, 241-45, 567 A.2d 937, <em>cert. denied, </em>497 U.S. 1038, 110 S.Ct. 3301, 111 L.Ed.2d 810 (1990); <em>Powers v.

The jury\u2019s finding that the defendant did not harbor a specific intent to disable precludes a subsequent prosecution for malicious wounding with the intent to disable. The defendant\u2019s conviction of battery, however, remains valid. He was not sentenced on that count because the trial judge determined the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>merged with the crime of malicious wounding.

As originally enacted, this alternative element read: assault <em>and </em>beat any person.

We explained the latter holding: because the statute used the term \u201cmurder\u201d in describing the crime, <em>id. </em>at 504, 483 A.2d at 771, but did not define or limit that term in any way, \u201c[t]he \u2018natural and ordinary signification\u2019 ... is that the General Assembly intended to incorporate the common law of murder into this particular statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, 483 A.2d at 771, quoting <em>City of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174, 1177 (1984). The <em>Faulkner </em>Court found that, \u201cbecause the statutory offense is defined in terms of murder, all the defenses available in a murder prosecution are applicable in an assault with intent to murder prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, 483 A.2d at 771.

By way of contrast, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">Perfect self-defense requires not only that the killer objectively believed that his actions were necessary for his safety but, objectively, that a reasonable man would so consider them. Imperfect self-defense, however, requires no more than a subjective honest belief on the part of the killer that his actions were necessary for his safety, even though, on an objective appraisal by a reasonable man, they would not be found to be so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>301 Md. at 500, 483 Md. at 768-69, quoting <em>Faulkner v.

Moreover, we said, successful invocation of imperfect self-defense does not completely exonerate the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">Its chief characteristic is that it operates to negate malice, an element the State must prove to establish murder.

The malice element of murder consists of three distinct components: (1) the intent to kill; (2) the absence of justification or excuse; and (3) the absence of mitigation. <em>Ross v.

United States, </em>584 A.2d 537, 539 (D.C.App.1990) (the malice required as an element of the charge of malicious destruction of property is the same as the malice required to make out a case of murder). Moreover, the California Court of Appeal has determined that there is a \u201cclose similarity in the concepts of \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 for purposes of defining murder and \u2018malice\u2019 for purposes of defining mayhem____\u201d <em>People v.

Perkins &amp; Boyce describe malice as a legal concept made up of two components, one importing the intent to cause the particular harm charged and the other requiring the absence of circumstances of justification, excuse or recognized mitigation. <em>Id. </em>at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 454, 601 A.2d 633, 649-50 (1992), we held that \u201c[i]n a non-intentional tort action, the trier of facts may not award punitive damages [for which proof of malice is a prerequisite] unless the plaintiff has established that the defendant\u2019s conduct was characterized by \u2018evil motive,\u2019 \u2018intent to injure\u2019, \u2018ill-will\u2019, or \u2018fraud.\u2019 \u201d (footnote omitted). Discussing the tort of malicious or wrongful interference with economic relationship, this Court, in <em>Natural Design, Inc. v. Rouse Co., </em>302 Md. 47, 69-72, 485 A.2d 663, 674-76 (1984), recognized that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>some contexts, our cases have defined malice, traditionally, as \u201cill-will or spite,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 71, 485 A.2d at 675, citing <em>Willner v. Silverman, </em>109 Md. 341, 354, 71 A. 962, 964 (1909) and, in others, as \u201ca wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse,\u201d <em>id., </em>citing <em>McCarter v. Baltimore Chamber of Commerce, </em>126 Md. 131, 136, 94 A. 541, 542 (1915); or as an unlawful act. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Goldman v. Harford Road Building Assn., </em>150 Md. 677, 682, 133 A. 843, 845 (1926); <em>Klingel\u2019s Pharmacy v. Sharp &amp; Dohme, </em>104 Md. 218, 223, 64 A. 1029, 1031 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In whatever sense or context it is used, \u201cmalice\u201d refers to the actor\u2019s state of mind, which, depending upon the offense, is related to, but different from, <em>see Shell, </em>307 Md. at 68, 512 A.2d at 369, or encompasses, <em>see Ross, </em>308 Md. at 340, 519 A.2d at 736, the intent with which he or she committed the act in question. Stated differently, \u201cmalice is a matter of mind, however convenient it may be to speak in terms of the absence of circumstances of justification, excuse or mitigation. It is a psychical fact which represents the particular kind of <em>mens rea </em>or mind at fault required for guilt of certain offenses.\u201d Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra </em>at 860. So:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">An intent to kill, to give a very limited illustration, may be the same intent in a certain sense, whether it is (a) for self-preservation, (b) formed in a sudden rage engendered by great provocation, or (c) part of a well-laid plan for financial gain; but the psychical fact in its totality is not the same in any two of these. Furthermore the appraisal or evaluation of appearances is also a psychical fact. Hence an intent to kill for the purpose of self-defense under circumstances in which there is reasonable ground for believing this drastic step to be necessary, is psychically different from an intent to kill in self-defense when there is nothing to warrant such a belief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">To prosecute a defendant successfully, the prosecution must prove all of the elements of the charged crime, including any required special mental element, Perkins &amp; Boyce, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>supra </em>at 1046, such as malice. When the trier of fact accepts evidence that the defendant acted under a mistake of fact as to an element \u201crequired for guilt,\u201d and \u201ceven if it is offered without the support of reasonable grounds [,the mistake of fact] negatives the existence of [the element as to which there has been a mistake of fact and] also disproves the charge itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The intent of the defendant at the time of the homicide is material to the issue of malice. <em>Davis v. State, </em>204 Md. 44, 52, 102 A.2d 816, 820 (1954); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 192, 203, 242 A.2d 194, 201, <em>cert. denied, </em>251 Md. 753 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 975, 89 S.Ct. 1467, 22 L.Ed.2d 754 (1969). Malice is not proven solely by reference to intent to cause the particular harm charged, however. When the charged offense is not murder, malice and the intent to commit the offense, though certainly closely related, are different. <em>Shell, </em>307 Md. at 65-68, 512 A.2d at 368-69. Even in the murder context, proof of intent alone is not enough. <em>Cox v. State, </em>311 Md. 326, 333, 534 A.2d 1333, 1336 (1988), quoting <em>State v. Harper, </em>205 La. 228, 17 So.2d 260, 260-61 (1944) (quoting Clark and Marshall, <em>Works on Crimes </em>\u00a7 255 (4th ed.) (\u201c \u2018It is manslaughter, and not murder, because there is no malice aforethought, not because of any absence or presence of intention to kill.\u2019 \u201d). Whether the charge is murder or another offense requiring proof of malice, an intent short of the actual intent to commit the offense charged, under some circumstances, may supply the necessary malice. <em>See Ross v. State, </em>308 Md. 337, 340, 519 A.2d 735, 736 (1987) (In addition to the intent to kill, an intent: to do grievous bodily harm, (2) to do an act under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life (depraved heart), or (3) to commit a dangerous felony will support a conviction for murder). Moreover, use of deadly force in self-defense is not the equivalent of a conscious decision to employ deadly force. <em>Ferrell v. State, </em>304 Md. 679, 686, 500 A.2d 1050, 1054 (1985), citing <em>Foley v. State, </em>11 Wyo. 464, 72 P. 627, 629 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Shell </em>is illustrative. There, the issue was whether \u201cwilfully and maliciously\u201d destroying the property of another, the offense proscribed by Article 27, \u00a7 111, \u201cshould be characterized as a specific intent offense [as to which, ejvidence of voluntary intoxication is ... relevant in deciding whether the requisite mens rea is present.\u201d 307 Md. at 68, 512 A.2d at 369. After reviewing our precedents, notably <em>Brown, Gibson </em>and <em>Rosenberg, </em>and those from the Court of Special Appeals, <em>e.g. Duncan v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 440, 248 A.2d 176 (1968) and <em>Spears v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 700, 382 A.2d 616 (1978), we concluded that it should. 307 Md. at 68, 512 A.2d at 369. We also noted that \u201cthe offense ... required both a deliberate intention to injure the property of another and malice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Analytically, self-defense has two aspects. One involves consideration of what the defendant believes and, in particular, the honesty, or sincerity, of that belief. The other focuses on its reasonableness. Both must be assessed in light of existing circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Imperfect self-defense is a shadow form of self-defense. <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>58 Md.App. 249, 254, 473 A.2d 40, 43, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 316, 477 A.2d 1195 (1984). It is distinguished from self-defense by whether the honestly held belief common to both is reasonable or unreasonable. A defendant who acts in imperfect self-defense has appraised the situation facing him or her in a faulty fashion while one who acts in self-defense has done so reasonably. Since both the subjective honestly-held belief and \u201cthe evaluation of appearances\u201d are \u201cmatter[s] of mind,\u201d Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra </em>at 860, the critical inquiry is which of them, if either, negates malice. <em>Faulkner </em>and <em>Flannel </em>make clear that it is the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In <em>Faulkner, </em>we adopted the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 articulation of the essential elements of imperfect self-defense, as contrasted with those for self-defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Perfect self-defense requires not only that the killer <em>subjectively believed </em>that his actions were necessary for his safety but, objectively, that a reasonable man would so consider them. Imperfect self-defense, however, requires no more than a <em>subjective honest belief on </em>the part of the killer that his actions were necessary for his safety, even though, on an objective appraisal by a reasonable man, they would not be found to be so. If established, the killer remains culpable and his actions are excused only to the extent that mitigation is invoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">301 Md. at 500, 483 A.2d 759, quoting, <em>Faulkner v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 113, 115, 458 A.2d 81, 82 (1983) (emphasis supplied). <em>See Dykes, </em>319 Md. 206, 213, 571 A.2d 1251, 1255 (1990). We went on to observe that \u201c[ljogically, a defendant who commits a homicide while <em>honestly, though unreasonably, believing </em>that he is threatened with death or serious bodily harm, does not act with malice.\u201d 301 Md. at 500, 483 A.2d at 769 (emphasis added). Indeed, we said \u201cwhen evidence is presented showing the defendant\u2019s <em>subjective belief that </em>the use of force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm, the defendant is entitled to a proper instruction on imperfect self-defense.\u201d 301 Md. at 500, 483 A.2d at 769 (emphasis supplied, footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Moreover, our discussion of the possible verdicts flowing from an imperfect self-defense instruction supports the conclusion that it is the subjective, honestly-held belief that negates malice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">A proper instruction when such evidence is present would enable the jury to reach one of several verdicts: (1) if the jury concluded the defendant did not have a <em>subjective belief </em>that the use of deadly force was necessary, its verdict would be murder; (2) if the jury concluded that the defendant had a <em>reasonable subjective belief, </em>its verdict would be not guilty; and (3) if the jury concluded that the defendant <em>honestly believed </em>that the use of force was necessary but that this subjective belief was unreasonable under the circumstances, then its verdict would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>be guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The reason courts have reached the third conclusion is that the conduct of the defendant in these circumstances negates the presence of malice, a prerequisite to a finding of murder, but the defendant is nevertheless the blame for the homicide and should not be rewarded for his unreasonable conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At3\">301 Md. at 500-501, 483 A.2d at 769 (emphasis added). From the foregoing, it follows that the defendant\u2019s subjective belief in the need for self-defense is a matter for determination by the jury, and it is that determination that is dispositive of the murder charge. If the jury finds that the defendant had no such subjective belief, he or she is guilty of murder. If it finds that he or she had that subjective belief, he or she is either not guilty or guilty of manslaughter, depending upon the reasonableness of the belief. Because the difference between murder and manslaughter is the presence or absence of malice, <em>see Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 485, 483 A.2d at 761, and it is the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s belief that determines whether the defendant is completely exonerated, or only partially so, it logically follows that it is the defendant\u2019s subjective belief that \u201cnegates malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The <em>Flannel </em>court recognized that a defendant\u2019s culpability for a homicide is \u201cmitigated\u201d when the defendant lacks the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for murder. 25 Cal.3d at 680, 603 P.2d at 7, 160 Cal.Rptr. at 90. Addressing the question of which crime, as between murder and manslaughter, a defendant commits when acting on a belief, honestly held, but unreasonable, the Court referred to <em>People v. Wells, </em>33 Cal.2d 330, 202 P.2d 53 (1949), which it characterized as standing for the proposition that malice, \u201cas a mental state, cannot coexist with such an honest but unreasonable belief in the need to defend oneself.\u201d 25 Cal.3d at 675, 603 P.2d at 4, 160 Cal.Rptr. at 87. The <em>Wells </em>court noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4F\">[i]f he acted only under the influence of fear of bodily harm, in the belief, <em>honest though unreasonable, </em>that he was defending himself from such harm by the use of a necessary amount of force, then the defendant, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>he would not be guiltless of crime, would not have committed <em>that particular aggravated offense </em>with which he is charged, for the essential element of \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d would be lacking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 245, 202 P.2d at 62-63. (Emphasis added). Thus, an honest, subjective belief, even if unreasonable, is inconsistent with malice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">No matter how the mistaken assessment is made, an individual cannot genuinely perceive the need to repel imminent peril or bodily injury and simultaneously be aware that society expects conformity to a different standard. Where the awareness of society\u2019s disapproval begins, an honest belief ends. <em>It is the honest belief of imminent peril that negates malice in a case of complete self-defense; the reasonableness of the belief simply goes to the justification for the killing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\"><em>25 </em>Cal.3d at 679, 603 P.2d at 7, 160 Cal.Rptr. at 90 (emphasis added). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">[T]he State has no legitimate interest in obtaining a conviction of murder when, by virtue of defendant\u2019s unreasonable belief, the jury entertains a reasonable doubt whether defendant harbored malice. Likewise, a defendant has no legitimate interest in complete exculpation when acting outside the range of reasonable behavior. The vice is the element of malice; in its absence the level of guilt must decline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 680, 603 P.2d at 7, 160 Cal.Rptr. at 90 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Finally, the <em>Faulkner </em>court\u2019s recognition, without reference to the special relationship of manslaughter to murder, that, had the jury found the subjective belief to exist, reduction of the defendant\u2019s culpability would have been warranted is further evidence that the subjective belief negates malice. 301 Md. at 500, 483 A.2d at 769. In any event, there is nothing in <em>Faulkner </em>to suggest that, to \u201cnegate malice,\u201d a defendant must produce mitigating or justifying circumstances additional to those tending to prove self-defense or that proof of lack of the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>malevolent intent is insufficient. Were the defendant\u2019s subjective belief unimportant, it would not have been mentioned as a factor, nor would it have mattered whether it was reasonable. That the <em>Faulkner </em>court addressed the existence of the subjective belief and its reasonableness together, does not prevent their being considered separately-</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">When a charged offense requires proof of a special mental state, <em>i.e. </em>malice, or a specific intent to cause a particular harm, the State\u2019s burden is to prove that special mental state.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">If no specific intent or other special mental element is required for guilt of the offense charged, a mistake of fact will not be recognized as an excuse unless it was based upon reasonable grounds; but even an unreasonable mistake, if entertained in good faith, is inconsistent with guilt if it negates some special element required for guilt of the offense such as intent or knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\"><em>Perkins &amp; Boyce, supra </em>at 1046 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">To be entitled to a self-defense instruction, the defendant initially must produce \u201csome evidence\u201d of an honestly held, subjective belief in the need to defend him or herself. <em>Sims, </em>319 Md. at 553, 573 A.2d at 1323; <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 215, 571 A.2d at 1256, quoting <em>Simmons v.

In that regard, we have made clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ-\">It is hard to imagine a situation where a defendant would be able to produce sufficient evidence to generate a jury issue as to perfect self defense but not as to imperfect self-defense. It seems clear to us that if the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s belief is at issue, as it is on self defense, <em>a fortiori, </em>the existence of that belief is also at issue. Therefore, the jury must reject the reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s belief as well as the existence of that belief to find the defendant guilty of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj8\"><em>Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 502-03, 483 A.2d at 770. The ultimate burden of proving lack of justification or mitigation is on the State. <em>Sims, </em>319 Md. at 553, 573 A.2d at 1323; <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 216, 571 A.2d at 1256-57; <em>Evans, </em>278 Md. at 208, 362 A.2d at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Implicit in <em>Sims, </em>319 Md. at 554, 573 A.2d at 1323, <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 216, 571 A.2d at 1256, and our discussion, in <em>Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 482, 483 A.2d at 768, of <em>Cunningham </em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is that generation of imperfect self-defense requires production of some evidence of each element of self-defense except one \u2014 that the subjective honest belief was reasonable. The defendant, in other words, must produce some evidence of his or her fear of imminent death or serious bodily harm from the victim, that he or she was not the aggressor and that the force used was not excessive, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Where the charged offense requires proof of malice, because an honest, subjective belief in the necessity to defend oneself is inconsistent with malice, a trier of fact\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>finding that a defendant had such a belief is tantamount to finding the defendant not guilty of the charged offense. The honesty of the belief, moreover, is informed by the surrounding circumstances, <em>i.e., </em>who was the aggressor, the amount of force used, whether the defendant retreated, or could have, etc. So, too, is its reasonableness; because the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s subjective belief focuses on the justification for the action, the trier of fact\u2019s reasonableness determination also, necessarily, will be made from its assessment of the surrounding circumstances. A finding that the belief was objectively unreasonable, of necessity, will mean that at least one element of self-defense was not established. Once some evidence of the subjective belief is produced, the reasonableness determination is for the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">That self-defense is generated does not mean that it has been established; generation means simply that the prosecution must negate the defense, either altogether, by proving the non-existence of the subjective belief, or partially, by proving its unreasonableness, <em>i.e. </em>that the defendant acted without justification or mitigation. <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 702, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 1891, 44 L.Ed.2d 508, 521-22 (1975); <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 215-16, 571 A.2d at 1256; <em>Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 39, 542 A.2d at 1261; <em>Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 315, 483 A.2d 6, 17, <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1088, 105 S.Ct. 1856, 85 L.Ed.2d 153 (1985); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 714-15, 415 A.2d 830, 840, <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 993, 104 S.Ct. 2374, 80 L.Ed.2d 846, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>467 U.S. 1268, 104 S.Ct. 3564, 82 L.Ed.2d 865 (1984); <em>Evans, </em>278 Md. at 207-08, 362 A.2d at 635-36. Thus, a defendant may be convicted of murder even though he or she generates self-defense if the jury finds that he or she did not have a subjective, honest belief in the necessity to defend him or herself. On the other hand, a jury finding that the defendant had such a belief precludes a murder conviction, such a belief, being inconsistent with the required proof for murder, even though the jury has also determined that the belief was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The reasonableness of the subjective belief addresses the justification of the defendant\u2019s act. <em>Flannel, </em>25 Cal.3d at 680, 603 P.2d at 7, 160 Cal.Rptr. at 90. <em>See Winner v. State, </em>144 Md. 682, 125 A. 397 (1924). An objectively reasonable belief is deemed sufficient to justify an action; conversely, an objectively unreasonable belief neither justifies nor excuses it.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Thus, in the homicide context, neither of two defendants is guilty of murder when the evidence establishes that one acted in self-defense and that the other acted in imperfect self-defense. Because the subjective belief is identical for self-defense and imperfect self-defense, neither will have acted maliciously; consequently, insofar as the murder charge is concerned, they are treated identically. On another level, however, they may be, and are, treated differently. When the issue is whether their actions, based on a concededly honest belief, were justified, complete exoneration is appropriate only in the case of the defendant who acted reasonably. In other words, rather than mitigate murder to manslaughter, proof of the defendant\u2019s subjective belief, reduces the defendant\u2019s culpability. The requirement that the belief be reasonable is addressed, not to murder, the charged offense, but to any other offense, conviction of which does not require proof of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The same analysis applies in the non-homicide context. Self-defense, as a defense, is not limited to homicide and its shadow forms. <em>See, e.g., Barnhard v. State, </em>325 Md. 602, 614, 602 A.2d 701, 707 (1992) (self-defense may be used to resist illegal arrest); <em>Guerriero v. State, </em>213 Md. 545, 549, 132 A.2d 466, 467-68 (1957) (self-defense proper by third person closely related to or associated with one attacked); <em>Bryant, </em>83 Md.App. at 245-46, 574 A.2d at 33 (self-defense applicable to assault crimes generally); <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 509, 512-14, 363 A.2d 257, 259 (1976) (Defense of self-defense applies to all offenses from simple to first degree murder). <em>See also United States v. Lewis, </em>780 F.2d 1140, 1142-43 (4th Cir.1986). Because self-defense is a defense to non-homicide offenses requiring proof of malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>and imperfect self-defense is a shadow form of self-defense, there is no rational basis for not permitting imperfect self-defense to be a defense to non-homicide offenses. Whether it is self-defense or imperfect self-defense that is generated, the existence of a subjective, honest belief of imminent peril must be proven; it is, after all, the subjective belief, not its reasonableness, that negates malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">As we have seen, to act maliciously, one must act with intent to cause the harm charged and without justification or excuse. <em>Brown v. State, </em>285 Md. at 474, 403 A.2d at 792. One who acts in the belief, sincerely and honestly held, that he or she is in imminent peril of death or grievous bodily injury acts in the belief that his or her actions are justified or excused, hence, without malice. A finding, to that effect, by the trier of fact precludes the defendant\u2019s conviction of a crime requiring proof of malice. It does not, however, prevent the trier of fact from further concluding that the defendant\u2019s belief was unreasonable and, thus, not justified. In the latter event, the defendant could be convicted of any charged offense, whether or not lesser included, or any lesser included offense, whether or not charged, <em>see Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. 398, 416, 601 A.2d 131, 140 (1992); <em>Hagans v. State, </em>316 Md. 429, 450-52, 559 A.2d 792, 802-03 (1989), which does not require proof of malice. While in the case of a murder indictment, the State\u2019s failure to prove malice may result in conviction of manslaughter,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>in the case of an aggravated assault requiring proof of malice, as in the present case, a failure of proof may result in conviction of simple assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Thus, I have no quarrel with the majority\u2019s observation, <em>see </em>op. at 234, that <em>\u201cA </em>defendant may intend the exact result he brings about, but be entitled to mitigation because of circumstances that caused him to act.\u201d That is certainly true when the defense is provocation; in that situation, it is a policy decision whether to permit mitigation of the defendant\u2019s offense. <em>See </em>n. 5, <em>supra. </em>I also agree that \u201ca defendant not entitled to mitigation may present as a defense evidence of a[n] honestly held though objectively unreasonable belief that is inconsistent with the specific intent required to convict.\u201d Op. at 234. That is precisely what occurs when imperfect self-defense is offered as a defense. I do not agree, however, that no separate imperfect self-defense instruction is necessary. Malicious wounding requires proof of malice, in addition to the intent to disable. The former, if not the latter, is implicated when the defense of imperfect self-defense is interposed and the jury ought to be told that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In <em>Watkins v. State, </em>328 Md. 95, 106, 613 A.2d 379, 384 (1992), the defendant had been convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>unlawful shooting with intent to disable, one of the actions proscribed by Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>27, \u00a7 386.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the majority points out, we observed that the defendant\u2019s imperfect self-defense \u201cargument fails because the defense of imperfect self-defense does not apply to and is not available to mitigate any of the crimes of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The issue presented in this case was not there presented, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The Court of Special Appeals and the California intermediate appellate court have addressed this precise issue, reaching different results. In <em>Bryant, </em>83 Md.App. at 245, 574 A.2d at 32, the intermediate appellate court rejected imperfect self-defense as a defense to statutory maiming, assault with intent to disable, and assault and battery,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> holding: \u201cOutside of homicide law, the concept of imperfect self-defense does not exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, the California intermediate appellate court, in <em>People v. McKelvy, </em>194 Cal.App.3rd, 694, 239 Cal.Rptr. 782 (1987), held, relying on <em>Flannel, </em>that an honest, but unreasonable, belief in the need to defend oneself, being inconsistent with malice, negated the state of mind required for mayhem. While recognizing that the \u201cmalice\u201d element of mayhem differs from the \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d required for murder, the court equated the former with malice in the legal sense, <em>i.e.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3c\">\u201c(1) the absence of all elements of justification, excuse or recognized mitigation, and (2) the presence of either (a) an actual intent to cause the particular harm which is pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>duced or harm of the same general nature, or (b) the wanton and willful doing of an act with awareness of a plain and strong likelihood that such harm may result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGF\">194 Cal.App.3d at 702, 239 Cal.Rptr. at 786, quoting Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law, </em>60 (3rd Ed. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">By enacting \u00a7 386, the Legislature, proscribed various actions done with intent either to maim, disfigure or disable or to prevent lawful apprehension or detainer. <em>See State v. Elborn, </em>27 Md. 483 (1867); <em>Hall v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 37, 49-50, 516 A.2d 204, 209-10 (1986). Not all of the proscribed actions require, expressly or explicitly, proof of malice. While the attempt to discharge any kind of loaded arm and the stabbing, cutting or wounding of a person specifically requires that in addition to the requisite intent, malice be proven, unlawfully shooting at a person and assaulting a person do not. Because the Legislature used the term \u201cmaliciously\u201d in connection with some of the proscribed actions and not others, contrary to the position of the majority \u2014 reading \u201cmalice\u201d out of the statute \u2014 I believe that that term must have a meaning different from \u201cunlawfully,\u201d the only other term used to describe those actions. <em>See State v. Patrick A., </em>312 Md. 482, 487 540 A.2d 810, 812 (1988); <em>Bridges v. Nicely, </em>304 Md. 1, 10, 497 A.2d 142, 147 (1985); <em>Bd. of Educ. of Garrett County v.

In the case <em>sub judice, </em>believing that it had been generated, the court instructed the jury on self-defense. The State took no exception and, thus, the propriety of that instruction is not before us. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-325. Notwithstanding that, ordinarily, generation of self-defense means that imperfect self-defense, its shadow form, has also been generated, the court refused the defense request for such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">This is not an overwhelming case of self-defense. It does not need to be, however, for self-defense to be generated. <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 216-17, 571 A.2d at 1257.

That malice has been defined differently in the homicide cases than in non-homicide ones may be explained by the fact that the rule of provocation has application primarily in the homicide context. <em>See </em>Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra </em>at 857 (\"The element of provocation has played such a minor role in some of the non-homicidal offenses that in speaking of them the most common definition of malice is that it means \u2018a wrongful act done intentionally without just cause of excuse.\u2019 \u201d) (footnote omitted); Wayne R.

Although as a lesser defense, the partial proof of an element may still stand as a pale reflection of the fuller proof of that element, it can never forgive the total failure of proof as to other necessary elements.

Manslaughter may be either voluntary or involuntary. 2 Charles E. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 152 (14th ed. 1979). We said in <em>Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 503, 483 A.2d at 770, that imperfect self-defense reduces murder to voluntary manslaughter, apparently assuming that the defendant intended to kill the victim. It is conceivable that one who kills in self-defense <em>intends </em>to kill. That need not be so, however. While, for purposes of determining whether malice exists, the focus is on the honesty of the actor\u2019s perceived need to defend him or herself to the exclusion of any consideration of how the actor intends to accomplish that defense, the focus must shift when the inquiry involves determining which offense, as between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, the defendant committed. The honest belief in the need to defend oneself and the intent to kill may certainly co-exist. Indeed, because the latter may be a creature of the necessity spawned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>by the former, they are significantly interrelated. With what intent the defendant acted is a matter to be determined by the jury. Should it determine that the defendant had an honest subjective belief in the need to defend him or herself and, also, intended to kill the victim, the defendant is guilty of voluntary manslaughter. <em>Bruce v. State, </em>317 Md. 642, 646, 566 A.2d 103, 105 (1989); <em>Cox v. State, </em>311 Md. 326, 331-32, 534 A.2d 1333, 1335-36 (1988); <em>Palmer v.

On the other hand, should the jury determine that the defendant did not intend to kill the victim, then the defendant is guilty of involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\">.

I agree that the malicious wounding instruction the court gave was erroneous. I do not agree that the error should be noticed as plain error. \"An appellate court, on its own initiative ... may ... take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions material to the rights of the defendant, despite any failure to object.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-325(e). <em>See Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 568, 602 A.2d 677, 694 (1992); <em>Sims v. State, </em>319 Md. 540, 550, 573 A.2d 1317, 1301 (1990); <em>Franklin v.

In <em>Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. at 202-03, 411 A.2d at 1038, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>While we do not propose to set forth any fixed formula for determining when discretion should be exercised, we do expect that the appellate court would review the materiality of the error in the context in which it arose, giving due regard to whether the error was purely technical, the product of conscious design or trial tactics or the result of bald inattention. We enumerate these factors because we feel they are ordinarily inconsistent with circumstances justifying an appellate court\u2019s intervention under \u00a7 h [of Rule 757, predecessor to 4-325(e)]. In our cases we have characterized instances when an appellate court should take cognizance of unobjected to error as compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In <em>Trimble, </em>we said that \"we would intervene ... only when the error complained of was so material to the rights of the accused as to amount to the kind of prejudice which precluded an impartial trial.\u201d The error <em>sub judice </em>was neither purely technical nor, under the circumstances, the product of trial tactics. It seems to have been the result of <em>bald inattention. </em>There is no excuse for the failure to take an exception to the malicious wounding with intent to disable instruction, which explains, perhaps, the petitioner\u2019s failure to raise the issue either in the Court of Special Appeals or in this Court. Viewed in the context in which it occurred, therefore, the need to take cognizance of the error is not compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The majority points out that the petitioner was acquitted of assault with intent to disable, on proper instructions, and, on erroneous instructions, convicted of malicious wounding. The only apparent basis for the inconsistent verdicts appears to be the State\u2019s failure to prove, as the instructions for assault with intent to disable required it to do, that the petitioner acted with the specific intent to disable, an element also common to malicious wounding. <em>See Apostoledes v. State, </em>323 Md. 456, 463-64, 593 A.2d 1117, 1121-22 (1991); <em>Ferrell v. State, </em>318 Md. 235, 241-45, 567 A.2d 937, 940-42, <em>cert. denied, </em>497 U.S. 1038, 110 S.Ct. 3301, 111 L.Ed.2d 810 (1990); <em>Powers v.

While I agree that collateral estoppel may well void the malicious wounding conviction, I do not agree that it should be applied on this record. The petitioner may raise the issue on remand, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
