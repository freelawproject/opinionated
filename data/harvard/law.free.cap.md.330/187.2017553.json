ORTH, Jr., Judge, Specially Assigned.</author>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We are asked on this appeal whether, upon judicial scrutiny, the administrative removal of William Henry Anderson, Jr. from State service was legally justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Anderson had been an employee of the Department of Correction (DOC) for a decade when he was fired. His entire tenure had been spent in a security environment, the last nine years as a correctional guard in the South Wing Segregation Unit of the Maryland Penitentiary which housed the most violent and uncooperative inmates. He had attained the rank of Sergeant and the classification of Correctional Officer III. He was suspended by the DOC pending charges for his removal for allegedly using excessive force on an inmate, Glen Wooden. Formal charges against him were filed by the Warden of the Maryland Penitentiary and the charges were approved by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. At a preliminary hearing he was barred from the worksite, so his suspension was without pay. He was notified of the charges by the Department of Personnel (DOP).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The DOP was \u201ccreated as a principal department of the State government\u201d by Md.Code (1957, 1990 Repl.Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7 9-101(a). The head of the Department is the Secretary of Personnel (SOP). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">The [SOP] shall be responsible for promulgating rules and regulations for his office. He shall review and shall have the power to approve or disapprove or revise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>rules and regulations of all of the boards, offices and agencies within the jurisdiction of the [DOP].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Art. 41, \u00a7 9 \u2014 105(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The SOP is also the head of the State Merit System. Md.Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol.) Art. 64A.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">All employees of the Maryland Penitentiary ... shall be included in the classified service and subject to all of the provisions of [Art. 64A].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Art. 64A, \u00a7 2. \u201cIt shall be the duty of the [SOP] to carry out the provisions of [Art. 64A], and to make such rules as he deems necessary or proper to that end.\u201d Art. 64A, \u00a7 11. Art. 64A, \u00a7 33(d)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">The [SOP] shall, by rule, prescribe what may constitute cause for removal, but no removal shall be allowed because of the religious or political opinions or affiliations of any employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">As required, the SOP has promulgated rules and regulations. They are published in the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR). COMAR 06.01.01.61A permits a classified employee against whom charges have been filed to submit a written appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The OAH was established by act of the General Assembly in 1989 and was codified in the Md.Code (1984) as Title 9, subtitle 16 of the State Government article (SG). The OAH is \u201can independent unit in the Executive Branch of State government,\u201d SG \u00a7 9-1602, headed by a Chief Administrative Law Judge, SG \u00a7 9-1603(a). The SOP may designate an official whose duties and responsibilities are unrelated to the hearing process to conduct a hearing in contested removal cases. Art. 64A, \u00a7 36A(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The OAH statute must be read in tandem with the contested cases provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), formerly codified in Md.Code (1957), Art. 41. In 1984 the provisions of the APA were transferred to the new State Government article as Title 10, subtitle 2, in revised language but without substantive change. In 1989 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>APA was amended to accommodate the provisions of the OAH statute. An agency may \u201cdelegate to the [OAH] the authority that the agency ... has to hear particular contested cases,\u201d SG \u00a7 10-207(a)(l), and \u201cmay delegate to [the OAH] the authority to issue the final administrative decision of the agency in a contested case,\u201d SG \u00a7 10-207(a)(2). Section 10-207(b) spells out the duties of the OAH. It shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">(1) conduct the hearing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">(2) submit in writing to the parties involved in the administrative action ...:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">(i) proposed findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">(ii) if the agency has delegated the authority to issue a final decision to the [OAH], final findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The Chief Administrative Law Judge may designate an Administrative Law Judge (AU) \u201cto conduct hearings in contested cases.\u201d SG \u00a7 9-1604(a)(4). \u201cIn any contested case conducted by an [AU], the [AU] may\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">(1) authorize the issuance of subpoenas for witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">(2) administer oaths;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">(3) examine an individual under oath; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">(4) compel the production of documents or other tangible things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">SG \u00a7 9-1605(c). Inasmuch as an agency may delegate to the OAH \u201cthe authority that the agency ... has to hear particular contested cases,\u201d the AU is told by the APA through authority granted an agency how the hearing is to be conducted. SG \u00a7\u00a7 10-208 and 10-209 speak with particularity of the evidence which may be offered and considered. Translating the authority of the agency to the AU, SG \u00a7 10-210 dictates that the AU shall make a record that includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-14\">(1) all motions and pleadings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-15\">(2) all documentary evidence that the agency receives;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-16\">(3) a statement of each fact of which the agency has taken official notice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(4) any staff memorandum submitted to an individual who is involved in the decision making process of the contested case by an official or employee of the agency who is not authorized to participate in the decision making process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">(5) each question;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">(6) each offer of proof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">(7) each objection and the ruling on the objection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">(8) each finding of fact or conclusion of law proposed by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">(i) a party; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">(ii) a hearing officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">(9) each exception to a finding or conclusion proposed by a hearing officer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">(10) each intermediate proposed and final ruling by or for the agency, including each report or opinion issued in connection with the ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Unless the agency has authorized the AU to make a final decision, the AU may only propose a decision which is subject to review by the agency which then renders the final decision. \u201cThe finding and decision of the [SOP] ... shall be final, and shall be certified to the appointing authority and shall forthwith be enforced by such authority.\u201d Md.Code, Art. 64A, \u00a7 33(c). SG \u00a7 10-214(a) requires that \u201c[a] final decision or order in a contested case that is adverse to a party shall be in writing or stated on the record.\u201d Subsection (b) concerns the contents of the decision. In relevant part, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">(1) A final decision in a contested case shall contain separate statements of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">(i) the findings of fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-15\">(ii) the conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\">(2) If the findings of fact are stated in statutory language, the final decision shall state concisely and explicitly the facts that support the findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">In the case before us, the SOP as the head of the DOP delegated to the OAH only the authority to conduct the hearing on the charges and to propose a decision. The AU <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>assigned to conduct the hearing proposed that Anderson be reinstated to State service. The Penitentiary filed exceptions to the proposed decision, and the SOP appointed a designee to conduct a hearing to review the proposed decision of the ALJ. The designee renounced the decision of the AU. She ordered that Anderson be separated from state service. Anderson appealed the order to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City as authorized by SG \u00a7 10-215. The court affirmed the order of the designee for the SOP. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-215(g)(2). Anderson looked to Court of Special Appeals pursuant to \u00a7 10-216(b). <em>See </em>Md.Rule B2. We ordered the issuance of a writ of certiorari on our own motion before decision by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Thus it is that the case has wended its way to this Court through the maze of administrative proceedings for the contested removal of a classified employee from State service. There has been complete compliance with the procedural particularities of the gaggle of statutes, rules and regulations; there is no claim of a procedural irregularity. So what is before us is the propriety of the affirmance by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of the final order of the SOP which cost Anderson his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">THE CHARGES</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Md.Code, Art. 64A, \u00a7 33(b)(2)(i) commands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">No employee who has completed his probation may be permanently removed from the classified service except for cause, upon written charges and after an opportunity to be heard in his own defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The Division of Correction (DOC) was established by \u00a7 4-105(a) of Art. 41 of the Maryland Code as a part of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1992 Cum Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 673 creates the office of the Commissioner of Correction (COC). The COC \u201cis in sole and active charge of the [DOC] and of its several institutions and agencies, subject only to his responsibility to the Secretary of Public Safety and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Correctional Services and to the Governor.\u201d <em>Art. 27, \u00a7 67 1&gt;. </em>The COC is empowered to adopt and promulgate \u201creasonable rules and regulations\u201d including those providing for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkT\">the duties, discipline and conduct of officers and employees of the several institutions and agencies [in the DOC].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_G\">Art. 27, \u00a7 676. The Maryland Penitentiary is one of those institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Anderson was charged with violating a rule of COMAR, four regulations of the DOC (DCRs),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a Post Order of the Maryland Penitentiary, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">(1) COMAR 06.01.01.47 paragraphs B, D, L and M;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">(2) DCR 50-2 IV.A.4, 19a. and 25;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">(3) DCR 50-6 VI.A;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">(4) DCR 50-54 V. and VI.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">(5) DCR 110-23 IV.A;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">(6) Post Order 12 VI.N.5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">(1) The SOP prescribed \u201cCauses for Removal\u201d in COMAR 06.01.01.47. It declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">Any employee in the classified service may be permanently removed from his position only for cause and, except in the case of rejection on probation, only upon written charges and after an opportunity to be heard in his own defense, and not because of his religious or political opinions or affiliations or for refusing to contribute to a political fund or render political services. The following shall be sufficient cause of removal, though removal may be for causes other than those enumerated:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFa\">Paragraph B provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">That the employee has been wantonly careless or negligent in the performance of his duty or has used unwar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ranted or excessive force in his treatment of public charges, fellow employees, or other persons;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Paragraph D provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">That the employee has violated any lawful official regulation or order or failed to obey any lawful and reasonable direction given by his superior officer when the violation or failure to obey amounts to insubordination or serious breach of discipline which may reasonably be expected to result in a lower morale in the organization or to result in loss or injury to the State or the public;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Paragraph L provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">That the employee has willfully made a false official statement or report;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Paragraph M provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">That the employee has been guilty of conduct such as to bring the classified service into public disrepute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">(2) DCR 50-2 IV is titled \u201cProcedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Section A warns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">All employees of the Division must abide by the following rules of conduct established by the Commissioner. All new employees must read this regulation within 24 hours after reporting for duty. All employees will review this regulation at least annually. Violations of this regulation and the stated rules of conduct, whether through ignorance, carelessness, or willful action, will be considered grounds for disciplinary action, possible criminal action, and/or removal from State Service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Subsection 4 (\u201cPersonal Conduct\u201d) commands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-14\">Every employee shall conduct him or herself at all times, both on and off duty, in such a manner as to reflect most favorably on the Division of Correction. Conduct unbecoming an employee shall include that which tends to bring the Division of Correction into disrepute, or reflects discredit upon the employee as a representative of the Division, or that which tends to impair the operation or efficiency of the agency or employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Subsection 19 (\u201cPerformance of Duties\u201d) provides in paragraph a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">Employees are to perform their duties diligently and efficiently. Indifference, carelessness or negligence will constitute grounds for disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Subsection 25 (\u201cReports\u201d) cautions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">Reports submitted by employees must be clear, concise, factual and accurate. Any report, written or oral, which contains an intentional false statement, omission or misstatement of fact will be considered grounds for disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(3) DCR 50-6 VI is headed \u201cProcedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Section A reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">Staff having direct responsibility for custody of inmates, when found to be inattentive, careless or negligent in the performance of their duties which contributes to or results in a breach of security, escape, harm to an inmate, employee or the general public by an inmate, shall be disciplined as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">1. First occasion within the current reckoning period\u2014 Suspension for 15 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">2. Second occasion with the current reckoning period-\u2014 Discharge from State Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">(4) DCR 50-54 V, under the title \u201cPolicy,\u201d declares: The use of force is to be resorted to only after reasonable non-force solutions have failed and only to the extent necessary to control the situation. Any use of force shall be applied in compliance with DCR 110-23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">Section VI is headed \u201cProcedure.\u201d Although the charges do not specify which of the five subsections are intended, they do characterize the violation as \u201cUse of Force,\u201d and it appears that subsection A is applicable. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZqJ\">Excessive or unnecessary force used against an inmate, or any other action by an employee which results in serious bodily harm, death or a serious breach of the security of the institution, its staff, inmates, or the general public, or which has the potential for such results, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>result in the filing of Charges for Removal from State service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">(5) DCR 110-23 IV does not prescribe a violation; it only gives the definitions of \u201cNon-deadly Force,\u201d \u201cDeadly Force,\u201d and \u201cChemical Agents.\u201d Section V, however, titled \u201cPolicy and Procedure,\u201d states in subsection A:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">The use of force is to be resorted to only after reasonable non-forceful solutions have failed and then only to the extent necessary to control the situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The violation as it appears in the statement of charges as \u00a7 IV is characterized as \u201cUse of Force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">(6) Post Order 12 is applicable to the Maryland Penitentiary Correctional Staff. Section II. Its purpose is \u201c[t]o provide a guide to assist officers assigned to the [South Wing].\u201d Section III. \u201cSpecial Remarks\u201d are stated in \u00a7 IV:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">South Wing is a housing unit consisting of inmates assigned to segregation, protective custody, and general population. Extreme caution and strict adherence to procedures should be exercised at all times____ Proper procedures will be adhered to during the movement of inmates housed in this unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201cProcedure\u201d is the subject of \u00a7 VI. It seems that the incident occurred when Wooden was to be removed from his cell to take a shower. After compliance with certain preliminary precautions and when an inmate is about to leave the cell to be escorted to the shower room, paragraph N.5 directs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">The inmate will then be instructed to face the back wall, place his hands behind his back and position himself to be handcuffed when the door is opened. The door will be opened only enough to allow the assisting officer ample space to place handcuffs on the inmate. After being handcuffed, the inmate will be allowed to exit the cell, wearing his shorts and shower shoes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Post Order 12 is not published generally; it is available only to the Maryland Penitentiary personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>THE HEARING BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Eleven witnesses testified at the hearing conducted by the ALJ and 24 exhibits were presented; the transcript of the proceeding consumes 551 pages. The proposed recommendation of the AU listed 31 facts which he found by a preponderance of the evidence \u201c[b]ased on the testimony of witnesses, exhibits submitted at the hearing and documents entered into the record after the hearing.\u201d We set them out verbatim:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">1. On January 15, 1991, Sgt. William Anderson was the shift Officer in Charge (OIC) on the South Wing of the Maryland Penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">2. Sgt. Anderson was required to make two security check rounds of the South Wing during his shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">3. During the course of the morning round, Sgt. Anderson saw an inmate being handcuffed outside of his cell which he believed was a violation of Post Order 12 and a possible breach of security.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">4. Sgt. Anderson approached the cell at a rapid pace and saw Correctional Officers Brenda Dorsey and Henry Brandon with inmate Glen Wooden.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">5. Officers Dorsey and Brandon had been employed by the Division of Correction for two years and ten months respectively compared with Sgt. Anderson\u2019s ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">6. Upon reaching the cell, Sgt. Anderson noticed that Officer Dorsey was attempting to complete handcuffing the inmate in the front by placing one cuff on the wrist and the other on a crutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">7. Sgt. Anderson ordered the inmate to return to his cell immediately in an effort to restore compliance with Post Order 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">8. Inmate Wooden initiated an argument with Sgt. Anderson and verbally and physically resisted the order to return into his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>9. The inmate told Sgt. Anderson that he was a short timer and would get him when he got uptown. This statement was clearly a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">10. The inmate had a history of verbal and physical assaultive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">11. With minor physical pressure, the inmate backed partially into his cell, faced outward and held the crutch by the lower shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">12. Officer Dorsey was between Sgt. Anderson and the inmate and facing the inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">13. Officer Dorsey was trying to correct the handcuffing of the inmate when he (the inmate) raised the crutch as if to swing it and hit her.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">14. Sgt. Anderson responded to this threat by raising his forearm to divert the blow and grabbed the crutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">15. Sgt. Anderson interposed himself between the inmate and Officer Dorsey to prevent her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">16. The inmate refused to respond to Sgt. Anderson\u2019s orders to cease struggling and let go of the crutch. They grappled for the crutch and with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">17. During the course of this struggle, Sgt. Anderson and the inmate hit the wall of the cell several times, then the bed and finally rolled onto the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">18. Sgt. Anderson lay on top of the inmate pinning his arms to prevent being hit; the inmate intertwined his legs with Sgt. Anderson\u2019s and both were unable to break the hold of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">19. When the scuffle began, Officer Dorsey took the keys from Officer Brandon, closed the cell door and went to call in a \u201cSignal 13\u201d indicating an officer was in confrontation with an inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">20. Officer Brandon remained on the scene but did not assist Sgt. Anderson in subduing and containing the inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">21. A response team, including Lt. Wouldridge, came to the cell pursuant to the Signal 13 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>22. Lt. Wouldridge unlocked the cell door, entered and observed Sgt. Anderson and the inmate in the position described in Finding 19 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">23. Lt. Wouldridge directed Sgt. Anderson to stand up who then stated he could not because of the intertwinement of his and the inmate\u2019s legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">24. Sgt. Anderson did stand up after a response team member untangled their legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">25. Lt. Wouldridge escorted the inmate to the inmate inhouse medical facility for treatment of his abrasions and other internal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">26. The inmate\u2019s abrasions and dermal injuries could have been easily caused by the use of minimal force.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">27. On January 16, 1991, Sgt. Anderson reported to</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">work with a swollen arm, abrasions, bruises and lacerations, which caused him to seek medical treatment____</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">He did not report back to work until January 18, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">28. All required incidents and use of force reports were properly filed by participants and observers who were on site at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">29. The variations in these reports resulted from the difference in recollections of the writers rather than any intent to falsify an official report.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">30. Sgt. Anderson was rated overall satisfactory in his annual efficiency rating reports for 1989 and 1990 and superior in the 1988 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">31. On January 16, 1991, Sgt. Anderson was suspended pending charges for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">The AU did not address the alleged COMAR violation but he discussed each of the DCRs charged. As to DCR 50-2 IV.A.4, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">The facts educed at the hearing do not show that Sgt. Anderson acted in a manner bringing disrepute or discredit upon the Division or himself. They do show his action reduced greatly the actual and/or probable risk of a breach of security when he came upon Officers Dorsey and Brandon attempting to handcuff the inmate outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>his cell while holding a dangerous instrument (crutch). Sgt. Anderson reacted instantly to [a] dangerous situation. He intended to restore conditions to those required by DCRs and Post Orders. His response reflected favorably on the Division without discredit or disrepute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">As to paragraph 19a., he observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">The facts show that Sgt. Anderson acted immediately to restore proper security with the least possible harm to himself, fellow officers and the inmate as warranted by the situation. Sgt. Anderson did not act in violation of Paragraph 19a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">As to paragraph 25, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">The facts in this case do not reveal any intentional falsity, omission or misstatement in the required reports. They do show that the variations in the reports arose from natural differences in the recollection of witnesses and participants involved in a traumatic incident. I conclude that Sgt. Anderson did not act in violation of Paragraph 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">On the charge under DCR 50-6 IV.A, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">In this case, Sgt. Anderson came upon a situation that was dangerous and a breach of security. The facts show he acted immediately to restore safety, security and order. Such steps cannot be characterized as negligent, careless or inattentive. Thus, I conclude he did not violate this regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">He discussed DCR 50-54 V and VI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">Sgt. Anderson repeatedly ordered the inmate to return to his cell and only resorted to force after the inmate verbally and physically refused to comply with those orders. Reasonable force was also used by Sgt. Anderson when he saw the inmate raise a weapon (crutch) to strike Officer Dorsey who stood between them. Sgt. Anderson\u2019s attempt to wrest the crutch from the inmate resulted in their scuffling, hitting the wall, bed and floor. In a matter of seconds they came to rest in a position where neither party could hit the other, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the inmate had Sgt. Anderson\u2019s legs entangled so that he could not stand up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">Sgt. Anderson acted immediately to protect Officer Dorsey from a blow from the crutch; his swollen forearm attests to his taking the blow himself. The standoff existing when Sgt. Anderson and the inmate immobilized each other was not a display of excessive or unnecessary force. It was an example of the use of minimum force to contain/control a dangerous situation. Sgt. Anderson\u2019s actions in this situation do not constitute the use of excessive or unnecessary force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">It might be argued that since the inmate was inside the cell, Sgt. Anderson could have retreated from the cell, locked the door and waited for the inmate to surrender the crutch; that was not possible here. The inmate initiated a course of verbal and physical threats, Officer Dorsey was inside the cell and preoccupied with resolving the handcuffing of the inmate. Finally, the use of no force was precluded when the inmate raised the crutch in an apparent attempt to strike Officer Dorsey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The AU correctly noted that DCR 110-23 IY.A. does not prescribe a violation; it merely defines certain terms. Therefore, the AU dismissed that charge. But, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyX\">If it is assumed for the sake of argument that the agency intended to refer to Section V, then the same discussion and conclusion set forth under DCR No. 50-54 above is also applicable here; i.e., Sgt. Anderson did not use excessive force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">As far as we can ascertain from the record that was submitted to us, the charge was not amended to show that a violation of \u00a7 V.A was the intended charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Regarding Post Order 12, the AU declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">The facts in this case show that Officers Dorsey and Brandon were not following proper procedures in handcuffing the inmate for his shower. Sgt. Anderson recognized this fact and immediately attempted to restore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>proper conditions of security with the minimum force necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">He noted: \u201cThe regulation does not speak to any accommodations for the inmate\u2019s use of a crutch.\u201d He pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALb\">The evidence shows that medical authority to use a crutch does not alter basic security procedures if interpreted with a touch of common sense. The Acting Assistant Warden Sanders testified to the above and that if the inmate made a gesture with the crutch, it was completely proper for the Officer to take it from him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We think that the AU covered the COMAR violation even though he did not expressly discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Based on his findings of fact as applied to the charges, the AU concluded as a matter of law that the DOC did not meet its burden of proving any of the charges by a preponderance of the evidence. The AU declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">[Anderson] did not act so as to bring disrepute/discredit upon himself, the Division or other parties. He used only that force necessary to comply with security regulations. In no sense was this excessive or unnecessary force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APU\">The AU issued the following proposed order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">The decision of the Division of Correction to suspend Sgt. Anderson pending charges for removal from State service and their action to remove him from State service is REVERSED. Sgt. Anderson is to be reinstated as of the date his suspension without pay began with all rights, benefits and pay he would have been entitled to from that date to reinstatement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">THE HEARING BEFORE THE DESIGNEE OF THE SECRETARY OF PERSONNEL</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">A hearing on the proposed decision of the AU was triggered by exceptions filed by The Maryland Penitentiary with the SOP. The Penitentiary claimed four errors of law and three errors of fact. It requested that the SOP:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">A. Reject the Proposed Decision as issued;</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>B. Substitute [the SOP\u2019s] own Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law;</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">C. Sustain the Charges and each of them____</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">It suggested a choice of sanctions:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">D. Remove the employee From state service ...; or</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">E. Demote the employee to CO-II; or</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">F. Substitute a lengthy suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The designee of the SOP (SOPD) conducted the hearing. An employee of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services represented the Maryland Penitentiary, and the Director of Field Services for the Maryland Correctional Unit represented Anderson. The SOPD \u201creviewed the entire record [including] the taped proceeding of the administrative hearing before the [ALJ].\u201d Upon review of the record and hearing the oral arguments, the SOP \u201cadopt[ed] in part and rejected] in part the [ALJ\u2019s] proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d The SOPD made these findings of fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">1. On January 15, 1991, Sergeant William Anderson was the shift Officer In Charge (OIC) on the South Wing of the Maryland Penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">2. During the course of his morning security round, Sergeant Anderson saw an inmate being handcuffed outside of his cell which was a violation of Post Order 12 and a breach of security.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">3. Upon reaching the cell, Sergeant Anderson noticed that Officer Dorsey was attempting to handcuff the inmate in the front by placing one cuff on his wrist and the other on a crutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">4. Sergeant Anderson ordered that the inmate\u2019s wrists be cuffed together in front of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">5. The inmate told Sergeant Anderson that he was a short timer and would take care of him when he \u201cgot uptown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">6. The inmate argued with Sergeant Anderson. Mr. Anderson ordered the inmate to return to his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>7. The inmate backed partially into his cell, facing outward and Officer Dorsey moved into the doorway of the cell to remove the inmate\u2019s handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">8. Officer Dorsey was between Sergeant Anderson and the inmate and she was facing the inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">9. The inmate\u2019s verbal barrage against Sergeant Anderson continued and, with cuffed hands, he swung his crutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">10. Sergeant Anderson order Officer Dorsey to step out of the cell and he entered the cell and asked the inmate to surrender the crutch. The inmate refused to let go of the crutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">11. Sergeant Anderson and the inmate grappled for the crutch and with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">12. Sergeant Anderson grabbed the face of the inmate and shoved the inmate into the wall of the cell several times. Sergeant Anderson got the inmate positioned in a headlock. The two fell onto the bed and then rolled onto the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">13. Sergeant Anderson laid on top of the inmate pinning his arms; the inmate intertwined his legs with Sergeant Anderson\u2019s and both were unable to break the hold of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">14. When the scuffle began, Officer Dorsey took the keys from Officer Brandon, and went to call in a \u201cSignal 13\u201d indicating an officer was in confrontation with an inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">15. Officer Brandon remained on the scene but did not assist Sergeant Anderson in subduing the inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">16. A response team reported to the cell pursuant to the Signal 13 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">17. Lt. Wouldridge entered the cell and observed Sergeant Anderson and the inmate in the position described in Finding # 13 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">18. Sergeant Anderson stood up after a response team member freed his legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>19. Lt. Wouldridge escorted the inmate to the in-house medical facility for treatment of his injuries. The inmate was treated for abrasions and skin lacerations on his face and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">20. The inmate was handcuffed in front throughout the entire incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">21. The inmate had a history of verbal and physical assaultive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">22. On January 16, 1991, Sergeant Anderson reported to work with a swollen arm, abrasions, bruises and lacerations, which caused him to seek medical treatment.... He did not report back to work until January 18, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">23. All required incident and use of force reports were filed by the participants and observers who were on site at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">24. Sergeant Anderson was rated overall satisfactory in his efficiency reports for 1989 and 1990 and superior in the 1988 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">25. On January 16, 1991, Sergeant Anderson was suspended pending charges for removal for his involvement in the January 15 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The SOPD complained that the ALT \u201capparently gave weight to only the testimony of Sergeant Anderson and Officers Dorsey and Brandon.\u201d She observed: \u201cIt appears that he completed ignored, without explanation, the testimony of other witnesses. Even in relating the testimony of Sergeant Anderson, the [ALJ] ignored pertinent facts established in the record.\u201d She said, early on in her opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2S\">In light of relevant facts discovered in the record, I reasonably conclude that Mr. Anderson did use excessive force in dealing with the inmate____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">She opined, \u201cConsequently, the charges against him should be sustained and his termination upheld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">The SOPD noted that Anderson, Dorsey and Brandon testified at the hearing before the ALJ and each submitted two reports of the incident. \u201cAll three of the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>reported that Mr. Anderson and the inmate became involved in a physical altercation.\u201d The SOPD observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">According to Mr. Anderson\u2019s direct testimony, Officer Dorsey was standing in the doorway of the cell attempting to remove the inmate\u2019s handcuffs. Out of concern for Officer Dorsey\u2019s safety, Mr. Anderson stepped between Dorsey and the inmate to remove the cuffs himself. He asked the inmate to surrender a crutch he was using and then reached for it. According to Mr. Anderson, the inmate snatched the crutch and swung it at him so he (Anderson) \u201cgrabbed the inmate in the face area and slammed him against the wall of the cell several times.\u201d Mr. Anderson explained that he then got the inmate in a headlock. The inmate hit him in the body and Mr. Anderson reported that he hit the inmate in the side with his fist. The two fell against the bed and onto the floor, at which time the response team arrived to control the disturbance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The SOPD acknowledged that Anderson, Dorsey and Brandon \u201cmaintained that Mr. Anderson confronted the inmate in order to protect himself and Officer Dorsey from personal injury.\u201d But the SOPD believed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANb\">[i]t was clear from Mr. Anderson\u2019s testimony that he considered the crutch a weapon and he believed that the inmate should not be allowed to retain it in his cell. However, the uncontroverted testimony that the inmate needed the crutch to navigate and that his hands were cuffed in front of him throughout the entire incident cannot be ignored. Also several of the witnesses confirmed management\u2019s contention that Mr. Anderson could have retreated from the cell and locked the inmate inside, instead of taking such an aggressive stance of trying to single-handedly wrest the crutch from the inmate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALM\">\u201cConsequently,\u201d the SOPD concluded, \u201cthere were other non-forceful solutions available to Mr. Anderson.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4A\">[Anderson\u2019s] own testimony concerning his involvement in the physical altercation ... leads one to reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>conclude that he used more force than necessary to resolve the situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The SOPD found that the Maryland Penitentiary had met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201cAnderson used excessive force in dealing with the inmate____\u201d She concluded further that \u201csuch behavior violates GOMAR .47B, D &amp; L; DCR 50-2.IV.A.4 &amp; 19a; DCR 50-6, DCR 50-54, DCR 110-23, and the cited Post Order.\u201d But she agreed with the ALJ that the \u201ccharges of violating COMAR .47L &amp; DCR 50-2.IV.A.25 were not substantiated,\u201d even though she had just stated that COMAR .47L had been violated. \u201cConsequently,\u201d she said, \u201cI dismiss the proposal rendered by the Administrative Law Judge that Mr. Anderson be returned to duty. I believe that the employee\u2019s termination, <em>as mandated by DCR 50-54-IV, </em>should be sustained.\u201d (Emphasis added). The SOPD ordered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">William Anderson be removed from his Correctional Officer III position at the Maryland Penitentiary, effective January 16, 1991 (the date of his suspension).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlW\">Anderson, aggrieved by this final order, sought judicial review by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City pursuant to SG \u00a7 10-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">THE REVIEW BY THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">On the judicial review by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the decision of the agency was affirmed by the judge after hearing from the parties. The judge found that \u201cthere was substantial evidence upon which the Secretary could make the findings which she did____\u201d He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">I think there is substantial evidence to indicate both that excessive or unnecessary force was used against the inmate, as well as substantial evidence to support a finding that the force used had the potential for the results of serious bodily harm, death, or serious breach of security of the institution, its staff, inmates, or the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The judge observed, \u201cThe injuries per se to the inmate, Mr. Wooden, may have been superficial but the evidence is sufficient to allow the Secretary to find that the force applied was excessive and not necessary.\u201d The judge opined that the arguments advanced by Anderson were not \u201cin any way frivolous.\u201d He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">Reasoning minds can differ, as they have already as witness the positions of the Administrative Law Judge and the Secretary, and where reasoning minds can differ I cannot change the result below. And I do not find that it\u2019s an arbitrary or capricious decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">THE STANDARD FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Adz\">The authority of a circuit court on judicial review of a final order under the APA is spelled out in SG \u00a7 10-215(g). The subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">(2) affirm the decision of the agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision of the agency:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-14\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-15\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-16\"><em>See </em>Maryland Rules, ch. 1100, subtitle B, Rules B1-B13, implementing SG \u00a7 10-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-17\">We have reviewed a goodly number of our cases addressing the matter of judicial review.

A hearing officer employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>and under the control of the agency where the contested case or other disputed action arises, often results in the appearance of an inherent unfairness or bias against the aggrieved. <em>See </em>the Final Report of the \u201cGovernor\u2019s Task Force on Administrative Hearing Officers.\u201d (1988). It is apparent that the Legislature, in enacting the OAH statute did not depart from the principles which have been recognized in our opinions that govern judicial review of an agency\u2019s final decision. The OAH act on its face and the APA as amended to accommodate the provisions of the OAH act did not address the test for judicial review. The standard for judicial review remained the same as we had consistently declared it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The creation of an ALT as a impartial hearing officer in administrative proceedings introduced another factor to be considered in our standard for judicial review. To determine what impact the findings of fact, conclusions and proposed order of an AU have on an agency\u2019s final order provoked us to look again to <em>Universal </em>Camera, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456. The essential issue raised in <em>Universal Camera </em>was \u201cthe effect of the Administrative Procedure Act and the ... Taft-Hartley Act ... on the duty of Courts of Appeals when called upon to review orders of the National Labor Relations Board.\u201d 340 U.S. at 476, 71 S.Ct. at 458. After carefully tracing the history of the reviewing power, <em>id. </em>at 477-486, 71 S.Ct. at 459-63, the Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVD\">the standard of proof specifically required of the Labor Board by the Taft-Hartley Act is the same as that to be exacted by courts reviewing every administrative action subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 487, 71 S.Ct. at 463. Charles H. Koch, Jr. observed in his <em>Administrative Law and Practice </em>(1985), Vol. 1, \u00a7 6.73 at 520 (hereinafter \u201cKoch\u201d), that <em>Universal Camera </em>\u201coutlined the significance of the presiding officer\u2019s findings for the agency and ultimately for the court.\u201d Our Administrative Procedure Act parallels the federal Administrative Procedure Act sufficiently so that the guidelines of <em>Universal Camera </em>relate to proceedings under our Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The meat of <em>Universal Camera </em>on the standard of judicial review is contained in Part III of the opinion. The basic concept of the test firmly established by our opinions is left intact. <em>Universal Camera </em>is not contrarient to our test but explicates it. First we note that <em>Universal Camera </em>made perfectly clear that the responsibility for the final decision placed on the agency \u201cis wholly inconsistent with the notion that the [agency] has power to reverse an examiner\u2019s findings only when they are \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d 340 U.S. at 492, 71 S.Ct. at 467. This assertion was confirmed in <em>Federal Commun. Com\u2019n v. Allentown Broad. Corp., </em>349 U.S. 358, 364, 75 S.Ct. 855, 859, 99 L.Ed. 1147 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Given that there is no error of law within the contemplation of \u00a7 10 \u2014 215(g)(3)(i)(ii)(iii) and (iv), the test firmly established by our opinions follows the dictate of \u00a7 10-215(g)(3)(v), that the decision of the agency shall be reversed or modified \u201cif any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision of the agency\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Ordinarily, if the decision is so unsupported, it may also be \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d under \u00a7 10-215(g)(3)(vi). <em>See Dashiell, </em>327 Md. at 137-138, 607 A.2d 1249. <em>Universal Camera </em>fleshed out what constitutes the \u201centire record.\u201d The Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">Surely an examiner\u2019s report is as much a part of the record as the complaint or the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\"><em>Id. </em>340 U.S. at 493, 71 S.Ct. at 467. The determination of the substantiality of the record includes the examiner\u2019s report. <em>Id. </em>But, the Court cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">We do not require that the examiner\u2019s findings be given more weight than in reason and in the light of judicial experience they deserve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">340 U.S. at 496, 71 S.Ct. at 469. The Court made clear that the \u201c \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard is not modified in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>way when the [agency] and its examiner disagree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">We intend only to recognize that evidence supporting a conclusion may be less substantial when an impartial, experienced examiner who has observed the witnesses and lived with the case has drawn conclusions different from the [agency\u2019s] than when he has reached the same conclusion. The findings of the examiner are to be considered along with the consistency and inherent probability of testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\"><em>Id. </em>The Court emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">The significance of his report, of course, depends largely on the importance of credibility in the particular case. To give it this significance does not seem to us materially more difficult than to heed the other factors which in sum determine whether evidence is \u201csubstantial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 496-497, 71 S.Ct. at 469. On the matter of assessing the credibility of the witnesses the Court indicated that the agency should give appropriate deference to the opportunity of the examiner to observe the demeanor of the witnesses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">All aspects of the witnesses demeanor \u2014 including the expression of his countenance, how he sits or stands, whether he is inordinately nervous, his coloration during critical examination, the modulation or pace of his speech and other non-verbal communication \u2014 may convince the observing [hearing officer] that the witness is testifying truthfully or falsely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\"><em>Penasquitos Village, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>565 F.2d 1074, 1078-1079 (9th Cir.1977). \u201cNothing in the statutes,\u201d <em>Universal Camera </em>pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">suggests that the [agency] should not be influenced by the examiner\u2019s opportunity to observe the witnesses he hears and sees and the [agency] does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">340 U.S. at 495, 71 S.Ct. at 468. \u201cNothing suggests,\u201d the Court continued, \u201cthat reviewing courts should not give to the examiner\u2019s report such probative force as it intrinsically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>commands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe [agency\u2019s] findings are entitled to respect____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 71 S.Ct. at 466.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">[B]ut they must nonetheless be set aside when the record before a Court of Appeals clearly precludes the [agency\u2019s] decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\"><em>Id. </em>In other words, the decision of the agency must be vacated when \u201cthe standard appears to have been misapprehended or grossly misapplied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491, 71 S.Ct. at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"AVE\">Koch stated on the question of credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">The presiding officer\u2019s findings as to credibility have almost conclusive force and the importance of credibility evidence to the final decision will affect the weight given the presiding officer\u2019s findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\"><em>Koch, \u00a7 6.73 </em>at 522 (footnote omitted). He quoted <em>General Dynamics v. OSHRC, 599 F.2d 453, </em>463 (1st Cir.1979) for the general principle regarding the administrative review body\u2019s authority over credibility findings of the hearing officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">\u201cthe credibility findings of the person who sees and hears the witnesses \u2014 be he ALJ, juror or judge \u2014 is entitled to considerable deference. While the degree of deference due the AU\u2019s final decision is related to the importance of credibility in a particular case, the ALJ\u2019s decision to give or deny credit to a particular witness\u2019 testimony should not be reversed absent an adequate explanation of the grounds for the reviewing body\u2019s source of disagreement with the ALJ.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\"><em>Koch, \u00a7 6.73 </em>at 522 (footnote omitted). \u201cIn sum,\u201d Koch concluded, \u201cthe review authority has the power to reject credibility assessments only if it gives strong reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">We have surveyed a fair sampling of cases in other jurisdictions which address the matter of judicial review of the final decision of an administrative agency. <em>See Appen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>dix </em>hereto. They all look to <em>Universal Camera </em>and are in line with our test as explicated by that opinion. The cases recognize that \u201c[w]hile the standard set forth in <em>Universal Camera </em>is imprecise, \u2018it provides as much clarity as the area affords.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., </em>388 F.2d 495, 499 (2d Cir.1967), quoting <em>Bon-R Reproductions, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>309 F.2d 898 (2d Cir.1962). <em>Universal Camera </em>itself recognized that a precise standard for review \u201ccannot be imprisoned within any form of words____\u201d 340 U.S. at 489, 71 S.Ct. at 465. It noted, \u201cThere are no talismanic words that can avoid the process of judgment. The difficulty is that we cannot escape, in relation to this problem, the use of undefined defining terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBut,\u201d the Court observed, \u201ca standard leaving an unavoidable margin for individual judgment does not leave the judicial judgment at large even though the phrasing of the standard does not wholly fence it in.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Kenneth Culp Davis, in his <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>(1980), Vol. 3, \u00a7 17.16 at 330, observed that the principles of <em>Universal Camera </em>\u201care reasonably clear, but a good many problems arise in applying them____\u201d He selected a number of cases applying the principles to show that each of the cases referred to was \u201cunique; seldom can two or more problems about application of the principles be put together.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">THE DECISION OF THIS COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">As we see it, the SOPD gave no real significance to the AU\u2019s report. She did not adequately take into account in considering the evidence before the AU whatever in the record detracted from the substantiality of that evidence, as, for example the disagreement between the AU and the SOPD as to the disposition of Anderson. We do not agree with the appellees\u2019 assertion that \u201cthere is really no issue of credibility on the genuine issues of this case.\u201d We think that the credibility of the witnesses was of the utmost importance in the circumstances here; it played a dominant role; it was pivotal. But there is no indication that the SOPD gave any deference to the AU\u2019s assessment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>credibility of the witnesses before him. And she gave no strong reasons for rejecting the AU\u2019s assessments of credibility. It seems that the SOPD made her own findings of fact, as suggested by the representative of the Penitentiary, and it appears that she did not take into account in making them the factual findings of the ALL Therefore, we believe that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City was wrong when it found that there was substantial evidence to support the order of the SOPD, because the SOPD did not appreciate the proper relationship between her and the ALT. The SOPD must reconsider her order in the light of what we have found to be the interrelation between her function and the function of the ALT. We vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and remand the case to it with direction to remand the case to the DOP for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">We note that the SOPD found that Anderson\u2019s removal was \u201cmandated by DCR 50-54.VI.\u201d Presumably, she saw her discretion to decide on a less drastic sanction destroyed by Paragraph A of that DOC regulation. As we have noted, the regulation declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">Excessive or unnecessary force used against an inmate, or any other action by an employee which results in serious bodily harm, death or a serious breach of the security of the institution, its staff, inmates, or the general public, or which has the potential for such results, <em>shall </em>result in the filing of Charges for Removal from State service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">(Emphasis added). This belief was probably why she did not address the issue of mitigation raised by Anderson. In any event, she read too much into the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">DCR 50-54.YI.A does not mandate dismissal; all it does is require the filing of \u201cCharges for Removal from State service.\u201d That much, obviously, had been accomplished and was the basis for the hearing. In fact, written charges are required to set the hearing process in motion. <em>See </em>Art. 64A, \u00a7 38(b)(2)(i); COMAR 06.01.01.48. The issue before the AIJ and the SOP was whether Anderson should, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>in fact, be removed from State service in light of the charges already filed. The DCR regulation in no way binds the Department of Personnel to a preordained result in a given case; for its decision, the DOP has its own regulations to guide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The relevant DOP regulation says that a classified employee <em>\u201cmay </em>be permanently removed from his position only for cause----\u201d COMAR 06.01.01.47 (emphasis added). The regulation then sets forth several specific transgressions that \u201cshall be sufficient cause of removal, though removal may be for causes other than those enumerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>COMAR 06.01.01.61, which is headed \u201cAppeal of Charges for Removal of a Classified Employee,\u201d discusses the options open to the SOP when she resolves an employment matter such as the one at issue in this case. It says that the SOP or her designee <em>\u201cmay\u201d </em>decide to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">(1) Restore the employee to his position without loss of pay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">(2) Suspend the employee without pay for a specified period of time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">(3) Demote the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">(4) Remove the employee from the position and the classified service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">(5) Require that other action be taken as indicated by the findings in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">COMAR 06.01.01.61H (emphasis added). The plain meaning of COMAR language applicable to the Department of Personnel is that removal is not \u201cmandated\u201d when an employee fails to abide by the requirements of a Division of Correction regulation. The representative of the DOP acknowledged as much at the hearing in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. She told the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-14\">I do agree with [Anderson\u2019s attorney] that if the [SOP] had thought that a lesser sanction was appropriate she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>didn\u2019t have to remove him because the regulation [DCR 50-54.VI.A] just says [charges] shall be filed.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL WITH DIRECTION TO VACATE ITS ORDER REMOVING WILLIAM HENRY ANDERSON, JR.
