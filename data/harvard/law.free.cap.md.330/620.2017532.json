BELL, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">ELDRIDGE, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The issue in this case is whether the Circuit Court for Baltimore City abused its discretion when it issued an interlocutory injunction notwithstanding a pending proceeding in the Circuit Court for Worcester County involving the same parties and the same issues. This opinion sets forth the reasons underlying this Court\u2019s order of March 10,1992, vacating the order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and staying further proceedings in that court pending resolution of the litigation in the Circuit Court for Worcester County.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The 91st Street Joint Venture owns the Princess Royale Ocean Suite Hotel and Condominiums in Ocean City, Worcester County, Maryland. The Joint Venture wanted to use a portion of its beachfront property, but was unsure if statutes and regulations protecting the beach area dune system would permit the use. After inconclusive discussions with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources regarding the potential uses of the property, the Princess Royale in July 1991 constructed a 14-foot by 14-foot gazebo on its property, to be used as a food and drink concession stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">On August 8, 1991, the State Department of Natural Resources (hereinafter referred to as DNR) filed in the Circuit Court for Worcester County a complaint for injunctive and other relief, contending that \u201cthe gazebo structure placed by the Princess Royale in the Beach Erosion Control District is prohibited by law and, as such, is illegal and environmentally unsound and must be removed.\u201d The com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>plaint further alleged that the gazebo threatened irreparable harm to \u201cthe integrity of the Beach Erosion Control District.\u201d DNR requested the court to order the 91st Street Joint Venture to remove the gazebo and to issue a permanent injunction forbidding the 91st Street Joint Venture and the Princess Royale from \u201cplacing or constructing any permanent structures in the Beach Control Erosion District,\u201d and for \u201csuch other and further relief as justice may require.\u201d DNR also filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The Mayor and City Council of Ocean City moved to intervene in the DNR suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ocean City separately filed a complaint, which incorporated the allegations of DNR\u2019s complaint and, in addition, contended that the gazebo was: \u201ca) constructed without a permit in violation of Section 34-1 of the [Ocean City] Code; b) constructed east of the building limit line in violation of Section 36-4 of the [Ocean City] Code; and c) constructed without critical area foundations in violation of Section 54-3 of the [Ocean City] Code.\u201d Ocean City sought removal of the gazebo, a permanent injunction, and \u201csuch other and further relief as justice may require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Instead of filing any responsive pleading or motion in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, the Joint Venture on August 15, 1991, filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the State of Maryland and DNR, and later amended the complaint to include the Town of Ocean City as a defendant. The Joint Venture asserted that it had the right to file the action challenging the validity of the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, Maryland Code (1984), \u00a7 10-125 of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint included a request for immediate <em>ex parte </em>injunctive relief (1) restraining the plaintiffs in the Worcester County action from enforcing certain building limit line regulations, (2) requiring them to stay the Worcester County action pending resolution of the Baltimore City action or transfer the Worcester County action for consolidation with the Baltimore City action, and (8) restraining them from enforcing the Ocean City Building Limit Line and certain portions of the \u201ccritical area\u201d regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">On the same day that the complaint was filed, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued an <em>ex parte </em>order, restraining DNR from acting to enforce certain regulations, and ordering that DNR either not proceed with its action filed in the Worcester County court or agree to transfer the case to Baltimore City for consolidation with the Joint Venture\u2019s case. The order granted DNR leave to move for a hearing on two days\u2019 notice, and further provided that the Joint Venture was not required to file a bond pursuant to Maryland Rule BB75.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On August 28, 1991, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City entered an <em>ex parte </em>injunction against the Town of Ocean City, \u201cenjoining Ocean City from acting alone or in concert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>with others to enforce by any means the Ocean City Building Limit Line (\u2018OC-BLL\u2019) and the \u2018critical area\u2019 designation in Chapter 54 of the Code of the Town of Ocean City as the designation relates to land east of the OC-BLL pending the outcome of this action____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The State filed a motion to vacate and dissolve the <em>ex parte </em>injunction and for a hearing, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City did not have the authority to interfere with the Worcester County action. After a hearing, the circuit court denied the State\u2019s motion. The State filed a motion to stay and a motion for reconsideration of the motion to vacate the <em>ex parte </em>injunction. The court also denied these motions but delayed entry of an interlocutory injunction so that the parties could attempt to settle the matter. Settlement efforts were unsuccessful, however, and after another hearing, the court entered an order denying the State\u2019s motion to vacate or stay the <em>ex parte </em>injunctions, and granting an interlocutory injunction against the State and Ocean City, which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\n<em>\u201cORDER</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201cUpon consideration of the Amended Verified Complaint and Memorandum of Law in Support thereof filed by Plaintiff, 91st Street Joint Venture (\u201891st Street\u2019), the Motion to Vacate and Dissolve <em>Ex Parte </em>Injunction and 91st Street\u2019s Motion for Interlocutory Injunction against the State of Maryland and the Department of Natural Resources (\u2018DNR\u2019), and having heard oral argument thereon, and, further, upon consideration of 91st Street\u2019s Motion for <em>Ex Parte </em>Injunction against the Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, Maryland (\u2018Ocean City\u2019), and upon Ocean City\u2019s waiver of its right to a hearing before interlocutory relief can be entered against it, ... it is, this 25th day of September 1991,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">\u201cORDERED, that the State\u2019s Motion to Vacate and Dissolve Ex Parte Injunction and the State\u2019s Motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Stay Ex Parte Order and/or Interlocutory Injunction or in the Alternative for Reconsideration of the Motion to Vacate Ex Parte Injunction are Denied; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">\u201cORDERED, that an Interlocutory Injunction be and hereby is issued against DNR, restraining and enjoining DNR from acting alone or in concert with others to enforce by any means the Regulations purportedly adopted by DNR as of August 5, 1991, pending the outcome of this action; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201cORDERED, that DNR either (1) not proceed with the action filed August 8, 1991 in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, Case No. 91CV0804 (\u2018Worcester action\u2019) pending the outcome in this action or (ii) agree to transfer the Worcester action for consolidation with this action in this Court under a new scheduling order; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201cORDERED, that an Interlocutory Injunction be and hereby is issued against Ocean City restraining and enjoining Ocean City from acting alone or in concert with others to enforce by any means the SOC-BLL against 91st Street pending the outcome of this action; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u201cORDERED, that Ocean City either (i) not proceed with the action filed August 8, 1991 in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, Case No. 91CV0804 (\u2018Worcester action\u2019) pending the outcome in this action or (ii) agree to transfer the Worcester action for consolidation with this action in this court under a new scheduling order; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201cORDERED, that Plaintiff is not required to file a bond pursuant to Md.Rule BB75.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">After filing an answer to the complaint in Baltimore City, the State and Ocean City filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari before argument in the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">The first question presented by the State and Ocean City on appeal is whether \u201cthe Circuit Court for Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>City improperly exercise[d] jurisdiction over a subsequently-filed action involving the same parties and the same issues\u201d as involved in the action already filed in the Circuit Court for Worcester County. We conclude that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City abused its discretion when it entertained the Joint Venture\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">It has long been the rule in this State that, once a court takes jurisdiction over a particular subject matter, another court of concurrent jurisdiction generally should abstain from interfering with the first proceeding. In <em>Brooks v. Delaplaine, </em>1 Md.Ch. 351 (1848), a creditor of the insolvent Delaplaine filed in the Frederick County Court an action for accounting against Delaplaine\u2019s trustee. Then, another creditor filed in the Court of Chancery an action for accounting against the same trustee. Upon being informed of the pending action in the Frederick County Court, the Court of Chancery dismissed the bill before it. Chancellor Johnson reasoned that parallel proceedings in the two courts would likely result in \u201cinconsistent and conflicting decrees [being] passed with reference to the same subject-matters.\u201d 1 Md.Ch. at 353. The Chancellor went on to hold that the \u201conly course of safety, therefore, is, when one court having the jurisdiction over the subject, has possession of the case, for all others, with merely co-ordinate powers, to abstain from any interference. Any other rule will unavoidably lead to perpetual collision, and be productive of the most calamitous results.\u201d 1 Md.Ch. at 354. If the creditors are \u201cdissatisfied with the conduct of the trustee,\u201d the Chancellor said, \u201cthey may ... take such steps as to them may seem proper, for the vindication of their rights [in the Frederick County Court].\u201d 1 Md.Ch. at 352-353.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Similarly, in <em>Withers v. Denmead, </em>22 Md. 135 (1864), this Court affirmed the action of a Baltimore City court dissolving an injunction which it had issued before becoming aware that proceedings on the same subject matter had already been brought in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. This Court, relying on Chancellor Johnson\u2019s opinion in <em>Brooks v. Delaplaine, supra, </em>explained that, if one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>court enjoins parties who are subject to the jurisdiction of another court, \u201c[t]he danger of collision is so imminent, that public policy as well as judicial comity requires that the court of co-ordinate jurisdiction, first in possession of any portion of the subject-matter, should not be disturbed by any other court.\u201d 22 Md. at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">This rule has been applied consistently in numerous cases. <em>See, e.g., Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A.2d 842 (1975); <em>A.S. Abell Co. v. Sweeney, </em>274 Md. 715, 337 A.2d 77 (1975); <em>Grimm v. County Comm\u2019rs, 252 </em>Md. 626, 250 A.2d 866 (1969); <em>Loft, Inc. v. Buckler, </em>148 Md. 647, 129 A. 914 (1925); <em>Horsey Co. v. Martin, </em>142 Md. 52, 120 A. 235 (1923); <em>Preston v. Poe, </em>116 Md. 1, 81 A. 178 (1911); <em>Jenkins v. Simms, </em>45 Md. 532, 537 (1877); <em>Keerl v. Keerl, </em>28 Md. 157, 160 (1868).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">There are some limited exceptions to the general rule. For example, in <em>Keyser v. Rice, </em>47 Md. 203, 213 (1877) (emphasis deleted), this Court stated that an equity court \u201chad authority to restrain persons within its jurisdiction from prosecuting suits either in Courts of this State or of other States or foreign countries.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201cThis jurisdiction [was founded upon] the clear authority vested in Courts of equity over persons within their jurisdiction and amenable to process to restrain them from doing acts which will work wrong and injury to others, and are contrary to equity and good conscience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">In that case, a creditor of a Maryland citizen, himself a Maryland citizen, went to a Justice of the Peace in West Virginia to garnish the debtor\u2019s wages, contrary to Maryland law. The Court agreed that \u201cit was against equity, for a creditor to evade the laws of his own [state] and thereby obtain a preference to the injury of other creditors.\u201d 47 Md. at 214. The circumstances warranting the exception in <em>Keyser v. Rice, supra, </em>are not present in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Furthermore, in order for the general rule to apply at all, it is necessary that the two actions be materially the same. <em>See Preston v. Poe, supra, </em>116 Md. at 5, 81 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>at 179. In the instant case, the two actions are materially the same. In their complaints, the DNR and Ocean City alleged that the placement of the gazebo violated certain specific statutes, regulations and ordinances. In its complaint, the Joint Venture claimed, in essence, that the applicable statutes do not prohibit the gazebo\u2019s placement, that the regulations which purport to govern placement of the gazebo are void, and that the Ocean City ordinances were pre-empted by State law. Thus, the issues in both actions concern the validity and applicability of the same statutes, regulations, and ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City should not have interfered with a suit pending in another circuit court unless there were extraordinary circumstances requiring such intervention. Although the Joint Venture argues to the contrary, there were not such extraordinary circumstances here to justify the intervention of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Circuit Court for Worcester County possesses all of the same equity powers as the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and there is no basis for concluding that the Worcester County court would not use its powers fairly to decide the equitable claims of each party.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The Joint Venture alleges, however, that it is inequitably burdened by having to defend a suit in Worcester County. In light of the Princess Royale\u2019s location in Worcester County, we are not persuaded that this is a particularly heavy burden. Moreover, if it were burdensome, the appropriate remedy is not to file a second action. Instead, the Joint Venture should have filed in the Circuit Court for Worcester County a motion under Maryland Rule 2-327(c) to transfer the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Similarly, the Joint Venture\u2019s alleged fear of having to participate in a \u201cmultiplicity of suits,\u201d cannot be the basis for this extraordinary intervention into a pending action. The Joint Venture itself created the multiplicity of suits by filing the action in Baltimore City. Furthermore, where a litigant is faced with a real multiplicity of suits involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the same issues, Rule 2-327(d) furnishes the appropriate avenue for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The Joint Venture additionally contends that DNR promised not to institute court action before a certain date, but filed its action before that date in violation of the agreement. The DNR denies that any agreement to that effect was ever made. Even if it were, however, the Worcester County court is competent to determine what, if anything, ought to be done about the Joint Venture\u2019s allegation. Any of the Joint Venture\u2019s other equitable concerns as to why the Worcester County action should not proceed may be raised by motion or answer in the Circuit Court for Worcester County.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The provision of the Administrative Procedure Act on which Joint Venture relied, \u00a7 10-125 of the State Government Article, does not justify the order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Joint Venture contends that it had the right to bring the declaratory judgment action pursuant to \u00a7 10-125 \u201cregardless of the pendency of the Worcester County action.\u201d (Brief at 23.) In support of this contention, the Joint Venture cites <em>Grimm v. County Comm\u2019rs, supra, </em>252 Md. 626, 250 A.2d 866. <em>Grimm </em>does not, however, support the Joint Venture\u2019s view of this matter. Although, by statute, declaratory relief is available \u201cnotwithstanding the availability of another adequate remedy either at law or in equity,\u201d 252 Md. at 632, 250 A.2d at 869, the declaratory judgment statute does not make appropriate a declaratory judgment action to determine the same issues already before another court. 252 Md. at 636, 250 A.2d at 870.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>supra, </em>276 Md. at 406, 347 A.2d at 849 (\u201c[WJhere, as here, the question to be resolved in the declaratory judgment action will be decided in pending actions, it is inappropriate to grant a declaratory judgment\u201d); <em>Watson v. Dorsey, </em>265 Md. 509, 512 n. 1, 290 A.2d 530, 532 n. 1 (1972). Moreover, this Court\u2019s previously filed order vacating the order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City simply stayed the 91st Street Joint Venture\u2019s declaratory judgment action \u201cpending determination of the litigation in the Circuit Court for Worcester County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In sum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City abused its discretion when it enjoined the State and Ocean City from proceeding with the Worcester County action previously filed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\">. In its motion to intervene, Ocean City contended that the subject matter of DNR\u2019s complaint involved the State \u2014 Ocean City Building Limit Line, allegedly within which the gazebo was placed. Ocean City stated that its ordinances were being violated by the placement of the gazebo, and thus the City had an interest in the litigation because the outcome of the litigation could \"affect its ordinances, statutes and agreement with the State of Maryland, relative to the State \u2014 Ocean City Building Limit Line.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">. Section. 10-125 of the State Government Article provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">\"Declaratory Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">\u201c(a) <em>Petition authorized.- </em>\u2014 {1) A person may file a petition for a declaratory judgment on the validity of any regulation, whether or not the person has asked the unit to consider the validity of the regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">\u201c(2) A petition under this section shall be filed with the circuit court for the county where the petitioner resides or has a principal place of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">\u201c(b) <em>Authority to consider. </em>\u2014 A court may determine the validity of any regulation if it appears to the court that the regulation or its threatened application interferes with or impairs or threatens to interfere with or impair a legal right or privilege of the petitioner.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB-\">The 91st Street Joint Venture alleges that its principal place of business is in Baltimore City, and that, therefore, venue for the declaratory judgment action is proper in Baltimore City.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">. The Declaratory Judgment Act, Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-409(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, provides: \u201cA party may obtain a declaratory judgment or decree notwithstanding a concurrent common-law, equitable, or extraordinary legal remedy, whether or not recognized or regulated by statute.\u201d This provision, formerly codified as Code (1957), Art. 31A, \u00a7 6, was at issue in <em>Grimm </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs, </em>252 Md. 626, 250 A.2d 866 (1969). The Joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Venture does not appear to rely directly on this statutory provision in support of its argument in this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
