Following the completion of the project, Warwick Supply &amp; Equipment Company, Inc. (\u201cWarwick\u201d) filed an appeal to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (\u201cMSBCA\u201d) on April 22, 1991 against both the Department of General Services and the Maryland State Police (the \u201cState\u201d). In its appeal, Warwick alleged that it was owed additional money for extra work it was required to perform under its contract. The State moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was not timely filed. Agreeing with the State\u2019s position, the MSBCA granted the State\u2019s motion and dismissed Warwick\u2019s appeal. Feeling aggrieved, Warwick sought judicial review by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which reversed the decision of the MSBCA and remanded the case for a hearing on its merits by the MSBCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>After the State noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, we issued our writ of certiorari prior to consideration of the case by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Warwick and the State entered into the contract on November 27, 1989. After completion of the project, Warwick sent a letter dated June 18,1990 to the Maryland State Police. This letter stated that \u201cthe Maryland State Police grossly understated the bid quantity\u201d of concrete and requested an \u201cequitable adjustment as a change order to [the] contract.\u201d After the State received Warwick\u2019s letter of June 18, 1990, several telephone conversations occurred between agents of the State and Warwick in which agents of the State acknowledged their receipt of the letter on June 22,1990. Other than the telephone conversations, no action was taken by either party until Warwick filed its appeal to the MSBCA on April 22, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The State moved to dismiss Warwick\u2019s appeal to the MSBCA, alleging that Warwick\u2019s appeal was untimely in light of the regulations promulgated by the Board of Public Works which govern appeals to the MSBCA. COMAR 21.10.04.04E provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">\u201cE.

The President of Warwick, Brigid T. Wist, was the only witness to testify at the hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reiterating statements which she had set forth in an affidavit submitted in opposition to the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, Wist testified that she submitted a claim letter to Milton Johnson of the Maryland State Police, that she made numerous phone calls to settle the claim, and that she was repeatedly \u201cput off\u201d and given the \u201crun around.\u201d The MSBCA issued a written decision with the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201c1. [Warwick] requested an equitable adjustment by letter dated June 18, 1990 in which it outlined its claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201c2. [The State\u2019s] Procurement Officer received the letter of June 18, 1991 [sic] on June 22, 1991 [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">\u201c3. [Warwick] contacted [the State] by phone in September and October of 1991 [sic] concerning the claim letter. [The State] made no specific remarks but said it would examine what, if any, action would be taken, and did not give any definite time for a final decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c4. [Warwick\u2019s] witness Ms. Bridget [sic] Wist testified that no agreement was ever made to enlarge the 180 day period for the procurement officer to issue a written decision. Her undisputed testimony was she was repeatedly \u201cput off\u201d. She further testified that she did not demand a date certain for a decision on the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201c5. The parties agree that 180 days from June 22, 1990 would fall on December 19, 1990. Under that time table January 18,1991 is the last day for filing a timely appeal to this Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201c6. Appeal to this Board was filed [on] April 22, 1991.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ8\">The MSBCA dismissed Warwick\u2019s appeal reasoning that under COMAR 21.10.04.04E, if a contractor\u2019s claim is not acted upon by the procurement officer within 180 days of receipt, that inaction becomes a final decision which must be appealed by the contractor within 30 days to the MSBCA, and that Warwick failed to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Warwick filed an action in the circuit court for Baltimore City for judicial review of the MSBCA\u2019s decision. In the circuit court, Warwick argued that there was no statutory authority for the regulations that were relied on by the MSBCA in ruling Warwick\u2019s appeal was untimely, and therefore, the regulations were overbroad and violated the constitutional requirement of separation of powers. Warwick also argued that Maryland\u2019s courts should interpret this State\u2019s procurement law as being <em>in pari materia </em>with federal procurement law. Warwick asserted that under federal case law the time limitations for filing an appeal by a contractor who has not received a written decision by the contracting officer are not mandatory, but rather, are permissive.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The circuit court reversed the MSBCA\u2019s decision dismissing Warwick\u2019s appeal and remanded the case for a hearing on the merits by the MSBCA. The circuit court made two separate rulings. First, the court ruled that COMAR 21.-10.04.06B was unreasonably overbroad and not authorized by the General Assembly, thereby violating the separation of powers required by the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Second, the court ruled that, because Warwick\u2019s President, Ms. Wist, \u201cwas repeatedly \u2018put off,\u2019 \u201d Warwick\u2019s request for an equitable adjustment remained under active consideration, and therefore, was impliedly never denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The delegation doctrine prohibits a legislative body from delegating its law-making function to any other branch of government or entity and is a corollary of the separation of powers doctrine implicit in the United States Constitution and expressly provided in the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Department of Transp. v.

Malkus, </em>320 Md. 471, 480-81, 578 A.2d 761, 765 (1990), we reiterated the principles we utilize in statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">\u201cAgain and again, we have said that the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intention, <em>Harford County v. University, </em>318 Md. 525, 529, 569 A.2d 649 (1990); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471 (1988). While the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intent, <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275 (1975), the plain meaning rule is not absolute. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). Rather, the statute is to be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policies of the Legislature reflected in the statute. <em>Id. </em>Words in a statute must, therefore, be read in a way that advances the legislative policy involved. <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>319 Md. 597, 603-04, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990). And where two statutes purport to deal with the same subject matter, they must be construed together as if they were not inconsistent with one another. <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 418, 379 A.2d 1007 (1977); <em>Comm\u2019n on Md. Discipline v. Bendler, </em>280 Md. 326, 330, 373 A.2d 1232 (1977). In this regard, the courts strongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>favor a harmonious interpretation in construing the related statutes which gives full effect to both statutes, even where they were enacted at different times and without relation to one another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Construing \u00a7 15-220 in light of \u00a7 15-219, we conclude that, when a state agency fails to act within the statutorily mandated time-frame, no written notice of final action need be received by the contractor in order to begin the contractor\u2019s period for filing an appeal to the MSBCA. Under \u00a7 15-220, \u201c[a]n appeal ... shall be filed ... for a contract claim, within 30 days after receipt of the notice of a final action.\u201d Yet, this section must be read consistently with \u00a7 15-219(d). Section 15-219(d) contains two subparagraphs which, when arranged conjunctively, provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cThe failure to reach a decision within the time required under subsection (c) of this section <em>[i.e., </em>within 180 days after receiving the contract claim or a longer period of time to which the parties agree] is deemed to be a decision not to pay the contract claim [and a] decision not to pay the contract claim is a final action for purpose of appeal to the [MSBCA].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In 1985, the General Assembly, in response to complaints from contractors that State agencies were taking too long to review contract claims and issue final decisions, enacted the language that was codified as \u00a7 15-219(c) and (d). <em>See </em>Ch. 678 of the Acts of 1985.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The contractors complained that they could not appeal to the MSBCA until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the agency issued a final decision and that this authority to issue a final decision was solely within the discretion of the agency. <em>Appeal of the Driggs Corp., 2 </em>MSBCA II121, at 4 (Md. State Bd. Contr.App.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Warwick\u2019s assertion that the contractor\u2019s time for filing an appeal to the MSBCA does not begin until \u201cafter receipt of the notice of final action\u201d ignores the remedial action taken by the General Assembly when it enacted Ch. 678. By enacting Ch. 678, the Legislature expressly authorized appeals by contractors to the MSBCA when the agency fails to reach a decision within the 180 days of receipt of the contract claim, notwithstanding the absence of notice of a final action by the agency. To assert that, before the time for an appeal begins to run, the contractor is entitled to receipt of the notice of a final action by the agency would render nugatory \u00a7 15-219(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The next question is whether the time limitations for filing an appeal to the MSBCA provided by \u00a7 15-220(b) are binding on a contractor, when a state agency fails to reach a decision within the time-frame required by \u00a7 15-219(c) and \u00a7 15-219(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Warwick urges us to construe \u00a7\u00a7 15-219 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>and 15-220 in the same manner that federal courts have construed somewhat similar provisions of the federal procurement statute, the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-563, 92 Stat. 2383 (codified at 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-613 (1982)) (\u201cCDA\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Federal courts have interpreted the twelve-month limitations provision for filing an appeal as being permissive, not mandatory, for the \u201cdeemed denied\u201d provision that applies when a contracting officer fails to issue a decision within the statutorily required time-frame. <em>See Borough of Alpine v. United States, </em>923 F.2d 170 (Fed.Cir.1991); <em>Pathman Constr. Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>817 F.2d 1573 (Fed.Cir.1987); <em>Structural Finishing, Inc. v.

United States, </em>7 Cl.Ct. 199 (1985). Because we believe that the applicable federal statutory provisions are sufficiently distinct from \u00a7\u00a7 15-219 and 15-220, we decline Warwick\u2019s invitation to construe the statutes in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The CDA provides that \u201c[a]ll claims by a contractor against the government relating to a contract shall be submitted to the contracting officer for a decision.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a). Section 605(c)(2) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201c[a] contracting officer shall, within sixty days of receipt of a submitted certified claim over $50,000<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> [either]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>(A) issue a decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">(B) notify the contractor of the time within which a decision will be issued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">And, in any event, \u201c[t]he decision of a contracting officer on submitted claims shall be issued within a reasonable time \u2014 \u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(c)(3).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If the contracting officer fails to issue a timely decision,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201c[a] contractor may request the agency board of contract appeals to direct a contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of time, as determined by the board, in the event of undue delay on the part of the contracting officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(c)(4). Under the CDA, a contractor aggrieved by a decision of the contracting officer has two avenues of redress.

Several reasons support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Unlike 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 605 and 609, which consistently and uniformly refer to the \u201cdecision\u201d of the contracting officer, the General Assembly clearly recognized a difference between a \u201cdecision\u201d and a \u201cfinal action.\u201d Under \u00a7\u00a7 15-220 and 15-219, only a final action is appealable to the MSBCA. A final action includes both \u201ca decision not to pay a contract claim\u201d or \u201cthe failure to reach a decision\u201d within the statutorily required time-frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Perhaps most significantly, the \u201cdeemed denied\u201d provision of \u00a7 15-219(d) simply includes no permissive language akin to the \u201cand will authorize commencement of the appeal or suit on the claim\u201d provided in 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(c)(5), which the federal courts found important in reaching their conclusion. Section 15-219(d) simply provides that the failure to reach a decision within the statutorily required time-frame is deemed to be a decision not to pay the contract claim, and therefore, a \u201cfinal action\u201d for purposes of appeal to the MSBCA. Section 15-220(b) requires an appeal to be filed within 30 days from receipt of the notice, whether written or not, of a final action. There is simply no legislative intention, expressed either by the plain words of the statute or in the materials in the legislative bill file from 1985, that would indicate the General Assembly intended to treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>differently final actions arrived at through an agency\u2019s failure to issue a decision in the statutorily mandated time-frame from final actions arrived at through an agency\u2019s written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In light of our interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 15-219 and 15-220, we can only conclude that COMAR 21.10.04.04E and COMAR 21.10.04.06 are reasonable and consistent with the letter and policy of the statutes under which the Board of Public Works was authorized to act. COMAR 21.10.04.04E does no more than restate \u00a7 15-219(c)(2) and (d). The regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cE.

As we explained in <em>State Administration Board of Election Laws v. Billhimer, </em>314 Md. 46, 548 A.2d 819 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1007, 109 S.Ct. 1644, 104 L.Ed.2d 159 (1989),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAi\">\u201cIn determining whether an agency\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we are mindful that substantial evidence is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 In applying the substantial evidence test, we must not substitute our judgment for the expertise of the agency, for the test is a deferential one, requiring \u2018restrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions[.]\u2019 This deference applies not only to agency fact-finding, but to the drawing of inferences from the facts as well. When, however, the agency\u2019s decision is predicated solely on an error of law, no deference is appropriate and the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.

By making its own finding of fact, the circuit court exceeded its statutory scope of review, and thus erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Moreover, even assuming the circuit court\u2019s finding that Warwick\u2019s claim was impliedly never denied was supported by substantial evidence, such a finding would be erroneous as a matter of law. Under \u00a7 15-219(d), the failure by the state agency to reach a decision on a contract claim within 180 days after receiving the contract claim or a longer period to which the parties agree is deemed to be a decision not to pay the claim. The MSBCA findings in \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, <em>see supra </em>p. 478-479, make clear that no agreement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>reached by the parties to extend the time for a final decision by the State. Thus, the failure by the State to reach a decision within 180 days of receipt of Warwick\u2019s contract claim is deemed, as a matter of law, a decision not to pay the contract claim. The circuit court\u2019s finding to the contrary was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Finally, in an effort to sustain the circuit court\u2019s reversal of the MSBCA, Warwick makes several arguments which we also shall reject. First, Warwick asserts its letter of June 18, 1990, by itself was not a \u201cclaim\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 15-215, <em>see supra </em>note 6, at 482, and therefore, did not trigger the 180 day rule of \u00a7 15-219(d). This argument is wholly without merit. Under \u00a7 15-215(b) a \u201c \u2018contract claim\u2019 means a claim that relates to a procurement contract [and] includes a claim about the ... modification ... of the procurement contract.\u201d Although Warwick attempts to portray the letter as a quotation for additional work, we recognize that forty-one of the fifty-three lines of text in the letter address the costs of the completed project and that it requests an \u201cequitable adjustment as a change order to our contract.\u201d In addition, Warwick repeatedly recognized this letter as a claim. It did so in its pleadings at the MSBCA, in an affidavit from its President, and in testimony elicited in the hearing at the MSBCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Warwick\u2019s second argument is that the letter only ripened into a claim when Warwick\u2019s President was advised over the telephone that its claim was being reviewed. This argument is contrary to the statutory time limitations that unambiguously begin upon receipt of the contract claim by the person who reviews the claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-219(c). It is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Warwick\u2019s reliance on the long form Disputes Clause set forth in COMAR 21.07.01.06 to support its argument that its letter was not a claim is similarly without merit. CO-MAR 21.07.01.06 requires a Disputes Clause be included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>all state contracts and sets forth two model clauses, a short form<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and a long form<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>. First, in rejecting this argument by Warwick, we note that the long form of the Disputes Clause was not part of the contract. Rather, the short form of the Disputes Clause was included as the applicable provision. Second, even if the long form of the Disputes Clause was applicable, that provision would be of no assistance to Warwick in its assertion that its letter was not a claim. It is irrefutable that the letter was \u201ca written demand or. assertion ... seeking, as a legal right, the payment of money, [or] adjustment ... of [the] contract terms----\u201d It thus was a claim within the meaning of COMAR 21.07.01.06B, the long form of the Disputes Clause. Warwick\u2019s assertion that it was a voucher, invoice, or request for payment that was not in dispute when submitted is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The short answer to Warwick\u2019s shotgun attack that its letter was not a claim is a finding by the MSBCA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>MSBCA made a finding of fact that the letter constituted a claim. This finding was not rejected by the circuit court in this case. This finding by the MSBCA is supported by substantial evidence, is not arbitrary or capricious, and accordingly, will not be disturbed. <em>Billhimer, </em>314 Md. at 58-59, 548 A.2d at 826; <em>Supervisor of Assessments v.

The time for the filing of an appeal on a contract claim is within 30 days after receipt of a notice of final action (\u00a7\u00a7 15-219(c) and (d) and 15-220(b)(2) of the State Finance and Procurement Article).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">\u201cThe bill reflects concern for the subcontractor whose appeal rights may be forfeited because the contractor does not have an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>to monitor the 180-day period and who may not receive any notice from the State unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">.
