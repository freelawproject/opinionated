On July 12, 2007, officers from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife, obtained a warrant to search appellant\u2019s residence, at 126 Venango Street, Cygnet, Ohio, for evidence of violations of various fishing laws. During the search, they discovered what appeared to be marijuana plants located in various parts of the residence. While still in appellant\u2019s home, the officers contacted the Wood County Deputy Sheriffs Department and advised them of the suspected marijuana. Sheriffs deputies arrived on the scene and presented appellant with a permission-to-search form and a waiver-of-Miranda-rights form. Appellant signed both forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 6} On August 2, 2007, appellant was indicted by the Wood County Grand Jury on a single count of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, in violation of R.C. 2925.041(A), a felony of the third degree. At arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty. On December 10, 2007, appellant filed a motion to suppress, which, following a hearing on March 4, 2008, was found not well taken and was denied. On July 8, 2008, appellant appeared and entered a plea of no contest to the single count in the indictment. On September 2, 2008, appellant was sentenced to three years of community control, a mandatory fine of $5,000, and 300 hours of community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant argues in support of his first assignment of error that the trial court erred, in violation of his constitutional rights, when it denied his motion to suppress. Specifically, appellant argues that the affidavit upon which the search warrant was issued was fatally flawed and the evidence seized following the execution of the warrant should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 8} The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applied to the states by way of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution contains an almost identical provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cA neutral and detached magistrate may issue a search warrant only upon the finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>State v. Gilbert, </em>4th Dist. No. 06CA3055, 2007-Ohio-2717, 2007 WL 1600367, \u00b6 13, citing <em>United States v. Leon </em>(1984), 468 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>U.S. 897, 914-915,104 S.Ct. 3430, 82 L.Ed.2d 677; Crim.R. 41(C). An affidavit in support of a search warrant must \u201cparticularly describe the place to be searched, name or describe the property to be searched for and seized, state substantially the offense in relation thereto, and state the factual basis for the affiant\u2019s belief that such property is there located.\u201d Crim.R. 41(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"> {\u00b6 10} In evaluating an affidavit for the sufficiency of probable cause, an issuing magistrate must apply a \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d test. <em>State v. George </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 325, 544 N.E.2d 640, paragraph one of the syllabus, citing <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 238-239, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527. The magistrate must \u201cmake a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Gates </em>at 238-239,103 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>George, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio articulated the standard of review for a determination of probable cause based on an affidavit in support of a search warrant. A reviewing court should \u201censure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed\u201d and should not substitute its judgment for that of the magistrate. Id., at paragraph two of the syllabus, citing <em>Gates. </em>The reviewing court \u201cshould accord great deference to the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause, and doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be resolved in favor of upholding the warrant.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 12} In this case, appellant argues that the affidavit in support of the search warrant does not satisfy the probable-cause requirement for two reasons: (1) nothing in the affidavit indicates how appellant\u2019s address was obtained or confirmed and (2) the information contained in the affidavit was stale. This court will first examine appellant\u2019s assertion that nothing in the affidavit indicates how his home address, at 126 Venango Street, Cygnet, Ohio, was obtained or confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 13} In obtaining the search warrant, the officers presented a ten-page affidavit, which set forth in considerable detail an account of their year-long investigation into appellant\u2019s fishing activities. As to the address to be searched, however, the affidavit states that the items they were searching for \u201care being kept in, 126 Venango St. Cygnet, Ohio (a blue two story home with white trim) in that portion of the premises of which William D. Wildman, has possession, control or use,\u201d and later that \u201cin the residence, including cartilage, outbuildings and vehicles associated with the premises, commonly known as 126 Venango St., Cygnet, Ohio (a blue two story home with a white trim) there is now being concealed certain property * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>{\u00b6 14} This court notes that at the hearing on the motion to suppress, there was testimony that the officers had confirmed appellant\u2019s address by running appellant\u2019s license plate and by driving by the address and seeing appellant\u2019s vehicles at the property. For some reason, however, that information was not set forth in the affidavit that was used to obtain the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 15} Upon review of the affidavit in its entirety, this court can conclude only that although the information contained in the affidavit particularly described the place to be searched, it failed to provide any information as to how appellant\u2019s address was obtained or confirmed and, therefore, failed to provide the factual basis for the affiant\u2019s belief that contraband would be located at that place.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 16} In accordance with the foregoing, this court finds that the issuing magistrate did not have a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed to search the home for which the warrant was issued. See <em>State v. George, </em>45 Ohio St.3d 325, 544 N.E.2d 640, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 17} This court must next determine whether the \u201cgood faith exception\u201d to the exclusionary rule will apply to uphold the admissibility of the evidence obtained from the search. See <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3430; <em>State v. Wilmoth </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 251, 22 OBR 427, 490 N.E.2d 1236. The exclusionary rule does not bar the use of evidence gathered by officers acting in \u201cobjectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate but ultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause.\u201d <em>State v. George, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 330, 544 N.E.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 18} The good-faith exception does not apply where a warrant is \u201cso facially deficient * * * that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\u201d Id. at 331, 544 N.E.2d 640, quoting <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923,104 S.Ct. 3430.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 19} Here, because the affidavit does not provide a basis upon which probable cause could be found to search the premises at 126 Venango Street, the officers\u2019 belief that probable cause existed to search that property was unreasonable. The officers\u2019 testimony at the motion-to-suppress hearing as to how they determined that the Venango Street address was appellant\u2019s residence does not change the analysis. \u201c[An] officer cannot claim good faith reliance on a search warrant based on less than probable cause where he has failed to place in the affidavit information known to him that would support probable cause. The officer\u2019s reliance on the warrant can be objectively reasonable only if his belief that the affidavit contains facts sufficient to create probable cause is itself objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>State v. Klosterman </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 327, 333, 683 N.E.2d 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 20} In accordance with the foregoing, this court finds appellant\u2019s first assignment of error well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Appellant argues in his second assignment of error that the permission-to-search forms that he and his wife signed while the search warrant was being executed were not signed voluntarily. When, as here, a defendant\u2019s consent is obtained after illegal police activity, \u201c[t]he consent will be held voluntary only if there is proof of an unequivocal break in the chain of illegality sufficient to dissipate the taint of the prior illegal action.\u201d <em>State v. Retherford </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 586, 602, 639 N.E.2d 498, citing <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 501, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229. Factors to consider in determining whether the consent is sufficiently removed from the taint of the illegal police activity include the length of time between the illegal activity and the subsequent search, the presence of intervening circumstances, and the purpose and flagrancy of the misconduct. See <em>United States v. Richardson </em>(C.A.6, 1991), 949 F.2d 851, 858; see also <em>Brown v. Illinois </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 590, 603-604, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416; <em>State v. Retherford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, the consents of appellant and his wife were obtained immediately following the \u201cprotective sweep\u201d of the premises at 126 Venango Street, with no significant time lapse between the execution of the faulty warrant and the request to search. A short temporal gap between unlawful police activity and a defendant\u2019s consent to search weighs heavily against a finding that the consent was an act of free will sufficient to purge the taint of the earlier police conduct. See <em>State v. Torres, </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1306, 2008-Ohio-2090, 2008 WL 1921741, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 23} Further, there were no intervening circumstances that might have served to attenuate the connection between the illegal execution of the search warrant and the ultimate discovery of the contraband. The entire incident occurred during the execution of the search warrant. A lack of intervening circumstances, like a lack of a substantial temporal gap, between unlawful police activity and a defendant\u2019s consent to search weighs heavily against a finding that a defendant\u2019s consent was sufficient to purge the taint of the unlawful seizure. See <em>State v. Torres </em>at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 24} Upon consideration of the record of proceedings in the trial court and the law, this court finds that the trial court erred in finding that appellant\u2019s consent to search was voluntary, and appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 25} For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-10\">Singer and Osowik, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Charles D.
