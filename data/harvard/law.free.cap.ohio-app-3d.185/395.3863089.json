Brown, Kimberly Muschitz, and Renee M. Oppenheiner (collectively, \u201cthe employees\u201d), have appealed the decision of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas denying their motion for judgment on the pleadings in the action filed by appellees, Jacob Moss and Kim Moss (collectively, \u201cMoss\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, this court affirms the decision of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 2} Jacob Moss is the son of Kim Moss. At the time of the incident that led to the filing of the complaint, Jacob Moss was seven years old. He was attending the Murray Ridge School (\u201cMurray Ridge\u201d) because he was born with Down syndrome and has been diagnosed with other disorders, including epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Due to these conditions, Jacob requires constant supervision. Murray Ridge is owned and operated by the board. Brown, Muschitz, and Oppenheiner are employees at Murray Ridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 3} On August 29, 2007, Jacob was in a classroom at Murray Ridge with other students of the school and school employees. A kitchen area was located in the classroom. Unbeknownst to the school employees monitoring the children, Jacob entered the kitchen area and spilled a pot of hot coffee down his chest. Pursuant to school policy, no students were supposed to be left unattended in the kitchen. Jacob suffered second-degree burns to his chest and abdomen and was in need of substantial medical treatment. He has permanent scarring as a result of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 4} Moss filed a complaint for personal injury and loss of consortium against the board, the employees, and other persons not parties to this appeal. Moss alleged that the classroom in which the injury took place was negligently designed and maintained, in that it included an unsecured kitchen area containing various potential hazards that threatened the safety of the special-needs students at Murray Ridge. Moss also alleged that in neglecting to supervise Jacob, the employees acted recklessly and wantonly by failing to comply with school policy and failing to comply with the standard of care that was owed to him and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 5} The board and the employees moved for judgment on the pleadings, asserting that they were immune from liability. The trial court denied the motion. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>{\u00b6 6} The board and the employees have argued that the trial court erred in (1) ruling that the issue of immunity involved questions of law and fact, (2) not recognizing that one analysis of governmental immunity applies to political subdivisions and a different analysis applies to employees of the subdivision, (3) holding that the employees were not sued in their official capacities, (4) denying the board immunity, (5) denying the employees immunity, and (6) failing to dismiss Kim Moss\u2019s loss-of-consortium claim. For ease of analysis, we will address the assignments of error out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 7} Any order of the trial court that denies a political subdivision and its employees the benefit of immunity is a final order. R.C. 2744.02(C); <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, at \u00b62. An order denying a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by a political subdivision or its employees is a final, appealable order. See <em>Sullivan v. Anderson Twp., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 83, 2009-Ohio-1971, 909 N.E.2d 88, at \u00b6 3-4, 13 (holding that the trial court\u2019s order that denied in part Anderson Township\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings was a final, appealable order because it denied the township the benefit of immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 8} A motion for judgment on the pleadings by a defendant is considered a delayed motion to dismiss an action for failure to state a claim. <em>Dunfee v. Oberlin School Dist., </em>9th Dist. No. 08CA009497, 2009-Ohio-3406, 2009 WL 2005363, at \u00b6 6, quoting <em>Pinkerton v. Thompson, </em>174 Ohio App.3d 229, 2007-Ohio-6546, 881 N.E.2d 880, at \u00b6 18. Thus, we review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to the de novo standard, id., affording no deference to the findings of the trial court. <em>Akron v. Frazier </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 718, 721, 756 N.E.2d 1258. We must confine our review to the pleadings, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Dunfee </em>at \u00b6 6, quoting <em>Pinkerton </em>at \u00b6 18. Judgment on the pleadings is appropriate if it is clear that the nonmoving party can prove no set of facts that would entitle that party to relief. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Assignment of Error 2</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">The Trial Court erred in failing to recognize that two separate and distinct tiered analyses are applied in determining whether either a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision enjoys the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability under the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>{\u00b6 9} With respect to the second assignment of error, the board and the employees have argued that the trial court did not apply the separate \u201ctiered\u201d analyses as described in <em>Cater v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 24, 28, 697 N.E.2d 610, to determine whether the board and the employees were immune from liability. In their brief, the board and the employees have set forth quotations from precedent of the Supreme Court of Ohio that describe the tests to be applied. However, they have not presented any argument in support of their assignment of error. It is the appellants\u2019 responsibility to ensure that the argument \u201cis supported by citations to legal authority and facts in the record.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor </em>(Feb. 9, 1999), 9th Dist. No. 2783-M, 1999 WL 61619, at *3; see also App.R. 16(A)(7). \u201c \u2018It is not the function of this court to construct a foundation for [the appellants\u2019] claims; failure to comply with the rules governing practice in the appellate courts is a tactic which is ordinarily fatal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Catanzarite v. Boswell, </em>9th Dist. No. 24184, 2009-Ohio-1211, 2009 WL 692381, at \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Kremer v. Cox </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 41, 60, 682 N.E.2d 1006. Thus, as the board and the employees have failed to develop this argument, we will not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Assignment of Error 4</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The Trial Court erred in denying [the board] the benefits of statutory immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 10} In order to determine whether a political subdivision is immune from liability, we must engage in a three-tiered analysis. <em>Cater, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 28, 697 N.E.2d 610. The first tier sets forth the following premise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). Pursuant to the second tier, we determine whether one of the five exceptions to immunity outlined in R.C. 2744.02(B) applies to hold the political subdivision liable for damages. <em>Cater </em>at 28, 697 N.E.2d 610. Last, immunity may be restored, and the political subdivision will not be liable, if one of the defenses enumerated in R.C. 2744.03(A) applies. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">{\u00b6 11} In the instant matter, it is not disputed that the board is a political subdivision. See <em>Ridley v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 383, 2002-Ohio-6344, 781 N.E.2d 1034, at \u00b6 25. Also, providing a system of public education and operating facilities for the mentally retarded or developmentally disabled are both govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>mental functions. R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(c) and (o). Thus, the board is entitled to immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 12} We next examine whether one of the exceptions to immunity applies. The five exceptions are (1) if the harm was caused by negligent operation of a motor vehicle by an employee of the board, (2) if the harm was caused by negligent performance of a proprietary function by an employee of the board, (3) if the claim arises from the negligent failure to keep public roads in repair and free from obstruction, (4) if the harm was caused by \u201cthe negligence of [the board\u2019s] employees and [ ] occur[ed] within or on the grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of, buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function, * * * \u201d and (5) if the Revised Code imposes civil liability on the board. R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) through (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 13} Moss alleges that the injury sustained occurred due to the negligence of the employees of the board and due to a physical defect within a building, thereby invoking the exception specified in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4). In order to invoke this immunity exception, Moss was required to allege that the injury (1) was caused by negligence on the part of the board\u2019s employees, (2) occurred within or on the grounds of a building in which a governmental function was performed, and (3) was due to a \u201cphysical defect within or on the grounds of\u2019 the school. R.C. 2744.02(B)(4). See also <em>Dunfee, </em>2009-Ohio-3406, 2009 WL 2005363, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 14} Having determined above that Murray Ridge is a building in which a governmental function is performed, we next examine whether Moss\u2019s complaint contains sufficient allegations that the board\u2019s employees acted negligently and that the injury was due to a physical defect within or on the grounds of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 15} Moss\u2019s complaint contains allegations of employee negligence that caused his injury. Moss has alleged that the kitchen area had been negligently and carelessly designed, maintained, and constructed by the board\u2019s employees and that the named defendants were employees, agents, or contractors of the board who were responsible for the design, construction and maintenance of the facility and as a consequence, Jacob suffered physical injury. Moss has also alleged that the board\u2019s employees were negligent on the date of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">{\u00b6 16} Moss has further alleged that Jacob\u2019s injury resulted from a physical defect within the grounds of the school. In this regard, Moss claims that the kitchen area constituted a physical defect that caused Jacob\u2019s injury. The complaint states that Murray Ridge is a facility designated for educating children with special needs. The kitchen area was located in Jacob\u2019s classroom. Moss further alleged that in light of the negligent design, maintenance, and construction of the kitchen, it contained \u201cphysical hazards\u201d that threatened the safety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the special-needs students. In other words, the negligent design, maintenance, and construction resulted in a physical defect, namely, the kitchen. Furthermore, this physical defect posed special dangers to the young, special-needs students, including Jacob. Finally, the complaint alleges that because of the physical defect, Jacob was injured. Based on the foregoing, we find that Moss has alleged sufficient facts that if proven, demonstrate that the R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) exception applies to the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 17} In the final step of the three-tiered analysis, we must determine whether immunity is restored to the board pursuant to any of the defenses enumerated in R.C. 2744.03(A)(1) through (5). <em>Cater, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 28, 697 N.E.2d 610. The Supreme Court of Ohio has determined that the defenses to imposition of liability of R.C. 2744.03 must be read more narrowly than the exceptions to immunity outlined in R.C. 2744.02(B). <em>Greene Cty. Agricultural Soc. v. Liming </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 551, 561, 733 N.E.2d 1141. The statutory defense potentially applicable in this case is the defense provided in R.C. 2744.03(A)(5), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury, death, or loss to person or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources <em>unless the judgment or discretion was exercised ivith malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">{\u00b6 18} Moss alleges in the complaint that Jacob was injured because the board\u2019s employees completely failed to properly supervise him in the classroom. In light of this lack of supervision, Jacob was able to wander away from his classmates and into the kitchen area, where he reached for a pot of hot coffee on the counter and spilled it on himself. \u201cThe way in which a teacher supervises [her] class and maintains the classroom equipment are discretionary acts.\u201d <em>Bolling v. N. Olmsted City Schools Bd. of Edn., </em>8th Dist. No. 90669, 2008-Ohio-5347, 2008 WL 4599670, at \u00b6 37, citing <em>Banchich v. Port Clinton Pub. School Dist. </em>(1989), 64 Ohio App.3d 376, 378, 581 N.E.2d 1103. See also <em>Marcum v. Talawanda City Schools </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 412, 416-417, 670 N.E.2d 1067. Thus, unless Moss\u2019s complaint sets forth operative facts alleging that the board\u2019s employees exercised their discretion in the classroom with a \u201cmalicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner[,]\u201d the board has a defense to immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 19} One acts with a malicious purpose if one willfully and intentionally acts with a purpose to cause harm. <em>Piro v. Franklin Twp. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 130, 139, 656 N.E.2d 1035. Bad faith is defined as a \u201cdishonest purpose, moral</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>obliquity, conscious wrongdoing, [or] breach of a known duty through some ulterior motive or ill will.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Lindsey v. Summit Cty. Children Sews. Bd., </em>9th Dist. No. 24352, 2009-Ohio-2457, 2009 WL 1478711, at \u00b6 16. A person acts wantonly if that person acts with a complete \u201cfailure to exercise any care whatsoever.\u201d <em>Fabrey v. McDonald Police Dept. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 351, 356, 639 N.E.2d 31. One acts recklessly if one is aware that one\u2019s conduct \u201ccreates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another * * (Citation omitted.) <em>Thompson v. McNeill </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 102, 104, 559 N.E.2d 705. Recklessness is more than mere negligence in that the person \u201cmust be conscious that his [or her] conduct will in all probability result in injury.\u201d <em>Fabrey </em>at 356, 639 N.E.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 20} We conclude that the allegations of the complaint do not rise to the level of maliciousness or bad faith, because each requires purposeful wrongdoing and the complaint does not contain allegations that the board\u2019s employees\u2019 alleged failure to appropriately supervise Jacob was purposeful. However, we conclude that the complaint contains a sufficient allegation that the board\u2019s employees acted in a wanton or reckless manner given the allegations that the supervision of these young, special-needs children was so lax that Jacob was able to leave the group and enter the kitchen area completely undetected to reach for a pot of hot coffee. In essence, Moss has alleged that the conduct complained of was more than merely negligent but was of such a character that there was a complete failure to exercise care and that the failure to exercise care created an unreasonable risk of harm. Thus, we hold that the complaint contains sufficient allegations of reckless and wanton conduct. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Assignment of Error 5</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The Trial Court erred in denying [the employees] the benefits of statutory immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 to the extent that they have been sued in their respective individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 21} The three-tiered analysis of liability applicable to a political subdivision does not apply when determining whether an employee of the political subdivision will be liable for harm caused to an individual. <em>Cramer v. Auglaize Acres, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 266, 2007-Ohio-1946, 865 N.E.2d 9, at \u00b6 17. An employee of a political subdivision is immune from liability unless (1) the employee acted outside the scope of his or her employment or official responsibilities, (2) the employee acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, wantonly, or recklessly, or (3) the Revised Code expressly imposes liability on the employee. R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(a) through (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Moss alleges that the employees are not immune from liability because they acted in a wanton or reckless manner with respect to the care and supervision of Jacob. We reiterate that wanton conduct is demonstrated by a \u201cfailure to exercise any care whatsoever\u201d <em>Fabrey, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 356, 639 N.E.2d 31, and reckless conduct \u201ccreates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another * * *.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Thompson, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 104, 559 N.E.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">{\u00b6 23} In the complaint, Moss states that seven-year-old Jacob requires constant supervision because he suffers from Down syndrome, epilepsy, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and is prone to excited and dangerous behavior. Moss further states that the employees knew or should have known of the dangers posed by the kitchen in the classroom, especially a pot of hot coffee within reach of the students. In light of these circumstances, Moss claims that the employees\u2019 failure to adequately supervise Jacob was wanton and reckless and breached their duty to him. Specifically, Moss alleges that none of the employees in the classroom the day of the accident were even aware that Jacob had left the classroom area and entered the kitchen area.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 24} Accepting the above facts as true, <em>Dunfee, </em>2009-Ohio-3406, 2009 WL 2005363, at \u00b6 6, quoting <em>Pinkerton, </em>174 Ohio App.3d 229, 2007-Ohio-6546, 881 N.E.2d 880, at \u00b6 18, it is clear that the complaint contains sufficient allegations that the employees acted recklessly in that their failure to monitor Jacob in the classroom under circumstances where they appreciated the clear hazards posed by the kitchen area created at least an \u201cunreasonable risk of physical harm\u201d to the child. (Citation omitted.) <em>Thompson, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 104, 559 N.E.2d 705. Further, Moss has also alleged that the employees\u2019 conduct was wanton in light of the allegations that the employees essentially failed to exercise any care whatsoever. For example, Moss has alleged that none of the employees even knew where Jacob was at the time of the accident, that the employees violated school policy regarding the kitchen, and that the employees clearly appreciated the hazards posed by the kitchen. Thus, the complaint contains sufficient allegations from which the trier of fact could find that the complete lack of supervision by the employees fell so far below the standard of care that their actions could be found to be wanton. See <em>Fabrey, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 356, 639 N.E.2d 31. Accordingly, we conclude that the complaint contains sufficient factual allegations of reckless and wanton conduct on the part of the employees pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Assignment of Error 3</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The Trial Court erred in holding that [the employees] have not been sued in their respective official capacities only.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>{\u00b6 25} The employees argue that the trial court erred in failing to hold that they have been named in their official capacities only. In support of their argument, the employees contend that because they were acting as employees of the board, and not as private persons, \u201conly the three-tiered, political subdivision statutory immunity analysis applies in this case.\u201d Essentially, the employees argue that because they were acting in their official capacity as employees of the board, the exceptions to immunity under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) do not apply. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">In a civil action brought against a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision to recover damages for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, the following defenses or immunities may be asserted to establish nonliability:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">In addition to any immunity or defense referred to in division (A)(7) of this section and in circumstances not covered by that division or sections 3314.07 and 3746.24 of the Revised Code, the employee is immune from liability unless one of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">(a) The employee\u2019s acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope of the employee\u2019s employment or official responsibilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">(b) The employee\u2019s acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 27} Thus, an employee is immune from liability unless the employee\u2019s conduct was outside the scope of the employee\u2019s responsibilities or the employee\u2019s acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner. In the amended complaint, Moss alleges that the employees \u201care all employees and/or agents of the Boai'd who had been responsible for monitoring and controlling Plaintiff Jacob Moss while he was attending \u2018circle time\u2019 in Classroom 5.\u201d Moss also alleged that the employees \u201crecklessly and wantonly\u201d failed to comply with existing policies relative to the duty of care owed to Jacob. The employees suggest that despite the specific statutory exception to immunity, the trial court was required to limit the assessment of the claims against the employees to the three-tiered analysis applicable to a political subdivision. However, the employees\u2019 argument ignores the plain language of R.C. 2744.03(A)(6), which clearly provides for specific exceptions to employee immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Assignment of Error 1</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">The Trial Court erred in failing to recognize that whether immunity from liability may be invoked under the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act is a purely legal issue, properly determined by the court prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>{\u00b6 28} The board and the employees argue that the trial court erred in failing to recognize that immunity is a purely legal issue properly determined by the trial court before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 29} In support of their argument, the board and the employees refer to that part of the trial court\u2019s journal entry that states, \u201c[Application of immunity and the exceptions to immunity as contained in the R.C. Chapter 2744 are mixed questions of fact and law.\u201d The board and the employees surmise that in light of this language, the trial court must have improperly evaluated their motion for judgment on the pleadings given that the trial court was required to accept all of the allegations of the complaint as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 30} Moss counters that the trial court did not err in its evaluation of the motion for judgment on the pleadings, but instead suggests that the trial court included this observation in its journal entry because the board and the employees repeatedly attempted to generate factual disputes in their motion for judgment on the pleadings rather than accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 31} In analyzing whether a trial court committed reversible error, we have held that we will not reverse the trial court if it reached the correct result, albeit for an incorrect reason. <em>State ex rel.

Schotten </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 89, 92, 637 N.E.2d 306 (\u201c[A] reviewing court is not authorized to reverse a correct judgment merely because erroneous reasons were assigned as a basis thereof\u2019). As we have determined in our de novo review that the motion for judgment on the pleadings was properly denied, we find that the first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Assignment of Error 6</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">The Trial Court erred in not dismissing the loss of consortium claim as derivative of those in which [the board and the employees] enjoy the benefits of immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, the board and the employees contend that the trial court should have dismissed Kim Moss\u2019s loss-of-consortium claim. \u201cA claim for loss of consortium is derivative and, but for the primary cause of action by the plaintiff, would not exist.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Sprenger Ents., Inc., </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA009238, 2008-0hio-1988, 2008 WL 1849649, at \u00b6 14. Thus, Kim\u2019s cause of action for loss of consortium is derived from, and dependent upon, the personal-injury action that arose from the harm suffered by Jacob at Murray Ridge. The board argues that if Jacob has no cognizable claim against the board, the derivative claim must also fail. However, as we have determined that the complaint sets forth a cognizable claim against the board, the loss-of-consortium claim survives as well. See <em>Rigby v. Fallsway Equip. Co., Inc., </em>150 Ohio App.3d 155, 2002-Ohio-6120, 779 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>1056, at \u00b6 65 (reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Fallsway on Mr. Rigby\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and holding that Mrs. Rigby\u2019s loss-of-consortium claim also should survive summary judgment as it was supported by Mr. Rigby\u2019s claim against Fallsway).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 33} We find that the complaint contains sufficient factual allegations to support the claim that the board and the employees are not immune from liability with respect to Jacob Moss\u2019s injuries. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The judgment of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-8\">Moore, P.J., and Dickinson, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
