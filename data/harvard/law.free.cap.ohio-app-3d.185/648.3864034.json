Banks, filed January 14, 2009. On October 2, 2008, Banks was indicted on one count of possession of crack cocaine (5 grams but less than 10 grams), in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), a felony of the third degree; assault of a peace officer, in violation of R.C. 2903.13(A) and (C)(3), a felony of the fourth degree; and one count of illegal use or possession of drug paraphernalia (crack pipe), in violation of R.C. 2925.14(C)(1), a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Banks pleaded not guilty on October 7, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">{\u00b6 2} On December 1, 2008, Banks withdrew his pleas and pleaded guilty to the felony offenses in exchange for the state\u2019s dismissal of the misdemeanor drug-paraphernalia charge, and in agreement that a one-year mandatory prison sentence on the possession charge would be served concurrently with a 12-month sentence for the assault charge. The trial court informed Banks that it accepted the agreed sentence of one year \u201cprovided you show up for your pre-sentence investigation appointments on time; that you don\u2019t have any further criminal activity of any kind; and that you show up here for sentencing on December the 29th at 9:30 a.m., and you are on time for that.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cIf that does not happen. If those things do not happen, then the one year is off the table and I can sentence you to whatever I think is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c =i= * *</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c * * * The big thing here is cooperating * * *. You have to cooperate with the folks at Pre-Sentence and make your appointments on time and stay out of trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">{\u00b6 6} Banks failed to appear on the original sentencing date. On that same morning, he contacted defense counsel and reported that he was having car problems in Kentucky on his way back to Dayton after visiting his sister in Atlanta, Georgia. A warrant was issued for his arrest, and sentencing was rescheduled for January 5, 2009. Banks turned himself in, and at sentencing, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>again explained his inability to attend the original hearing. The trial court sentenced Banks to two years on the possession charge and to 18 months on the assault charge, to be served concurrently. The record reflects the following exchange at sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cMR. RAMBO: * * * You are aware there was a one-year agreement for this case between the State and the Defendant. That was contingent upon the Defendant making all of his appointments and appearing last Monday. As you are aware, Mr. Banks failed to appear last Monday. He did, however, turn himself in less than 48 hours later in the * * * county jail on Wednesday of last week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIt is my understanding that Mr. Banks had some car problems that morning. He doesn\u2019t drive, but the person that was taking him ended up with a flat tire. That is my understanding of the facts, Your Honor. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cTHE COURT: * * * Mr. Banks, anything you would like to add. First of all, explain to me why you weren\u2019t here last Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cDEFENDANT: Yes, sir. I had car problems. We was coming from Kentucky and we had car problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTHE COURT: What were you doing in Kentucky?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cDEFENDANT: Well, I wasn\u2019t in Kentucky, I was in Atlanta.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cMR. RAMBO: But Kentucky is where you had problems, though?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-13\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cDEFENDANT: Yes, sir. Right out of Kentucky and Tennessee. Tennessee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-14\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTHE COURT: And when did you call your attorney to tell him that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-15\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cDEFENDANT: About five or six that morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-16\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cMR. RAMBO: That is correct Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-17\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cTHE COURT: Isn\u2019t it a condition of your bond, you are not supposed to leave the state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-18\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cDEFENDANT: No sir. * * * I knew I was going to be leaving for a year and my sister, she hasn\u2019t been doing too good. * * * me, my sister and them, we went down to see about her. You understand, knowing that I wasn\u2019t going to be home for a year, she was kind of, you know, worried about me. There was no intention of mine to ever be fleeing from the law or anything like that. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-19\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cTHE COURT: You are on Post-Release Control also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-20\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cDEFENDANT: No, sir. No sir. I am not on no paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>(\u00b6 23} \u201cTHE COURT: That is what they tell us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cDEFENDANT: No, sir. I am on no Post-Release Control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cTHE COURT: You were just released in October of last year on Post-Release Control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cDEFENDANT: Yes, sir. But I have been off that. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cTHE COURT: That is not what they are telling us. So considering the purposes of [sic] Principles of Sentencing the [sic] 2929.11 of the Ohio Revised Code and the seriousness of [sic] recidivism factor 2929.12 and considering you failed to show the other day last week, I am going to sentence you to a period of two years at Corrections Reception Center for possession of cocaine Count one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cOn the assault on a police officer, I am going to sentence you to a period of 18 months at the Corrections Reception Center to run concurrent with the time that you are doing on the possession charge, Count One. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">{\u00b6 29} Banks asserts one assignment of error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant/appellant to additional prison time beyond the agreement made between the defendant/appellant, the state, and the judge in open court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-12\">{\u00b6 31} According to Banks, the trial court abused its discretion and \u201cpenalized the Defendant by imposing an additional year of incarceration for missing his scheduled Sentencing time by less than 48 hours.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-13\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cIn <em>State v. Jeffrey Barker, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 414, 2009-Ohio-3511, 917 N.E.2d 324, at \u00b6 36-38, we wrote:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-14\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c \u2018[T]he trial court has full discretion to impose any sentence within the authorized statutory range, and the court is not required to make any findings or give its reasons for imposing maximum, consecutive, or more than minimum sentences. <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, at paragraph seven of the syllabus. Nevertheless, in exercising its discretion the trial court must consider the statutory policies that apply to every felony offense, including those set out in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 37.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-15\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c \u2018When reviewing felony sentences, an appellate court must first determine whether the sentencing court complied with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence, including R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, in order to find whether the sentence is contrary to law. <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124. If the sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law, the trial court\u2019s decision in imposing the term of imprisonment must be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. Id.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>{\u00b6 35} \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the trial court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151,157[, 16 O.O.3d 169], 404 N.E.2d 144.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Steele, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23402, 2009-Ohio-6019, 2009 WL 3792296, \u00b6 7-10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 36} The two-year prison term imposed by the sentencing court for possession, a third-degree felony, is not the maximum allowable sentence but rather is at the low end of the range of \u201cone, two, three, four, or five years.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(A)(3). The 18-month sentence for assault of a peace officer, although the maximum sentence allowable for a felony of the fourth degree, is within the authorized range of available punishments, and Banks\u2019s sentences are accordingly not contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 37} Our review of the record before us, however, reveals an abuse of discretion. The record does not establish that Banks\u2019s bond conditions prohibited him from leaving the state. He posted a $10,000 bond through Seneca Insurance Co. without any court-ordered restriction of remaining in the State of Ohio. Although he did not appear on the 29th, nothing in the record suggests that Banks otherwise failed to comply with the conditions of his agreed sentence; he kept his presentence-investigation appointments, and he did not engage in further criminal activity. Banks immediately phoned his attorney upon experiencing car trouble and explained that he was unable to attend the hearing on the 29th. Banks\u2019s attorney confirmed receipt of Banks\u2019s call. Upon his return, Banks turned himself in to authorities. After limited inquiry, the trial court increased Banks\u2019s sentence by 100 percent. Nothing in the record suggests that Banks\u2019s defense of impossibility to appear was not credible, and the trial court did not so expressly find.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">{\u00b6 38} Without a basis for the substantially enhanced penalty other than Banks\u2019s inability to appear, we conclude that the trial court acted arbitrarily, and Banks\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. Under these circumstances, an abuse of discretion is established. Postrelease control was not relevant to this inquiry of compliance with plea negotiations. Accordingly, the sentence of the trial court is modified, and we hereby impose the original agreed sentence of a mandatory term of one year on the possession charge and 12 months on the assault charge, to run concurrently. Appellant, having completed his sentence, is ordered discharged unless being held on other charges. The judgment of conviction is affirmed as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-9\">Brogan and Froelich, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
