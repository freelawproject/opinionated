This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">{\u00b6 2} Brenda and Thomas Hill filed a negligence suit against a nurse, Amy Hoover, R.N., and Wadsworth-Rittman Area Hospital Association (\u201cWRH\u201d), the hospital where Hoover was employed. The trial court granted summary judgment against Brenda and Thomas Hill on all claims against WRH and Hoover.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">{\u00b6 3} The suit was based on an incident that occurred on November 9, 2006. On that day, Brenda Hill underwent an outpatient procedure. Upon discharge, Hoover escorted Brenda out of the hospital in a wheelchair. When they approached the hospital lobby, a man stood up, clutched his chest, and collapsed to the floor, experiencing what Brenda thought to be a heart attack. Hoover stopped pushing Brenda and sought assistance for the man who had collapsed. After obtaining assistance for the man, Hoover resumed transporting Brenda out the door and toward the area where Brenda\u2019s husband was to meet her with their vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">{\u00b6 4} Testimony diverges at this point as to whether Hoover engaged a second man in conversation outside and left Brenda alone for a period of time. Clearly, Brenda was impatient to get home, particularly after witnessing an apparent heart attack. She attempted to stand up, tripped over the footrests on the wheelchair and fell, fracturing her patella. Brenda and Thomas brought claims for negligence against Hoover and unknown hospital employees and against WRH for negligent supervision or training of Hoover. Thomas\u2019s derivative claim was for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">{\u00b6 5} Initially, the suit proceeded as a simple negligence action. The defendants moved to dismiss the claims on the basis that they were medical claims and the complaint was unaccompanied by an affidavit of merit as required by Civ.R. 10(D)(2). The trial court denied the motion but later reversed course and ruled that the claims were medical claims under R.C. 2305.113(E)(3). Accordingly, the trial court ordered the Hills to file an affidavit of merit or risk dismissal. The Hills timely filed an affidavit of merit signed by Daniel Clark, R.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">{\u00b6 6} Shortly thereafter, WRH and Hoover deposed Clark. During the deposition, Clark testified that Hoover met the standard of care at all times during her interaction with Brenda. WRH and Hoover filed a motion for summary judgment relying exclusively on Clark\u2019s deposition testimony. The trial court granted summary judgment as to all of the Hills\u2019 claims on the basis that they were unable to demonstrate a violation of the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">{\u00b6 7} The Hills timely filed a notice of appeal. They raise one assignment of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of [ ] Wadsworth-Rittman Area Hospital Associationm [sic] (WRH) on the ground that Brenda and Thomas Hill were required to produce expert testimony on the standard of care and its breach thereof by an employee of WRH while transporting hill by wheelchair upon her discharge from WRH.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">{\u00b6 8} In the Hills\u2019 single assignment of error, they argue that the trial court should not have required them to produce expert testimony to support their negligence claims. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">{\u00b6 9} This court reviews an award of summary judgment de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. We apply the same standard as the trial court, viewing the facts of the case in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and resolving any doubt in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Viock v. Stowe-Woodward Co. </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 7,12,13 OBR 8, 467 N.E.2d 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">{\u00b6 10} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is proper if the following conditions are met:</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">(1) [n]o genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">{\u00b6 11} The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and pointing to parts of the record that show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292-293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Specifically, the moving party must support the motion by pointing to some evidence in the record of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C). Id. Once this burden is satisfied, the nonmoving party bears the burden of offering specific facts to show a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The nonmoving party may not rest upon the mere allegations and denials in the pleadings but instead must point to or submit some evidentiary material that demonstrates a genuine dispute over a material fact. <em>Henkle v. Henkle </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 732, 735, 600 N.E.2d 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">{\u00b6 12} The Hills have consistently argued that under Evid.R. 702(A), the skill necessary to push a person in a wheelchair is not beyond the knowledge or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>experience possessed by laypersons. However, the Hills\u2019 counsel conceded at oral argument that the claims against WRH and Hoover are \u201cmedical claims\u201d as defined by R.C. 2305.118 and as argued by counsel for WRH and Hoover. We are not bound by concessions that are incorrect conclusions of law as opposed to stipulations of fact. <em>State ex rel Leis v. Bd. of Elections of Hamilton Cty. </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 7, 8, 57 O.O.2d 64, 274 N.E.2d 560. Therefore, we disregard the concessions by the parties and apply legal precedent to the undisputed facts presented in the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Medical Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">{\u00b6 13} We conclude that based upon the undisputed facts of this case, the Hills\u2019 causes of action are not \u201cmedical claims\u201d as defined by R.C. 2305.113. WRH and Hoover pointed to the plain language of R.C. 2305.113 in arguing that the Hills\u2019 claims are \u201cmedical claims.\u201d The statute provides that \u201cmedical claims\u201d include \u201c[c]laims that arise out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person.\u201d R.C. 2305.113(E)(3)(b). \u201cCare\u201d generally has a broad meaning; however, it is not without limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">{\u00b6 14} The Supreme Court of Ohio reviewed this language in <em>Browning v. Burt </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 544, 613 N.E.2d 993. In that case, the court examined the language of R.C. 2305.11(D)(3), which was virtually identical to the current language of R.C. 2305.113(E)(3). <em>Browning </em>involved a suit against a hospital for negligent credentialing, allowing the doctor who injured the plaintiff by medical malpractice to continue his staff membership or professional privileges at the hospital. Id. at 545, 613 N.E.2d 993. The plaintiff had already secured a default judgment against Dr. Burt for medical malpractice. Id. at 554, 613 N.E.2d 993. The salient issue before the court was whether the hospital\u2019s alleged negligence in credentialing the doctor constituted a medical claim under R.C. 2305.11. Under the court\u2019s analysis, negligent-credentialing claims were not medical claims as defined by R.C. 2305.11. The <em>Browning </em>court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">The terms \u201cmedical diagnosis\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d are terms of art having a specific and particular meaning relating to the identification and alleviation of a physical or mental illness, disease, or defect. See, generally, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990), at 453-454 and 1502. Conversely, the word \u201ccare\u201d is a general word without a specific legal meaning until placed in a particular context. Under the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule of statutory construction, \u201ccare\u201d as used in R.C. 2305.11(D)(3) (where the word is preceded by terms such as \u201cphysician,\u201d \u201chospital,\u201d \u201cnurse,\u201d and \u201cmedical diagnosis\u201d) means the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness. Thus, the term \u201ccare\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>R.C. 2305.11(D)(3) should not be broadly interpreted when the context in which it is used is properly understood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 557, 613 N.E.2d 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b6 15} The Supreme Court further explained types of activity that would fall under the umbrella of medical claims one year later in <em>Rome v. Flower Mem. Hosp. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 14, 635 N.E.2d 1239, a consolidated case involving two separate plaintiffs. In <em>Rome, </em>one of the plaintiffs was a hospital patient who, during his stay for surgical treatment, was injured while being transported from his room to the physical-therapy department in a faulty wheelchair. Id. at 16, 635 N.E.2d 1239. The <em>Rome </em>court held that the transport of the patient by hospital staff to physician-prescribed physical therapy was \u201cancillary to and an inherently necessary part of his physical therapy treatment\u201d and therefore his claim was a medical claim because it resulted from his care or treatment. Id. Other appellate courts have found that claims fall under the category of medical claims when the plaintiff is injured while being transported to a diagnostic test or physical therapy. See <em>Grubb v. Columbus Community Hosp. </em>(1997), 117 Ohio App.3d 670, 674, 691 N.E.2d 333; <em>Long v. Warren Gen. Hosp. </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 489, 492, 700 N.E.2d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">{\u00b6 16} Courts have occasionally considered dictum from <em>Rome </em>as part of their analysis. See, e.g., <em>Grubb, </em>117 Ohio App.3d at 674, 691 N.E.2d 333; <em>Cooke v. Sisters of Mercy </em>(May 4, 1998), 12th Dist. No. CA97-09-181, 1998 WL 221320, at *4. In addition to determining that the injuries occurred during transport that was \u201cancillary to and an inherently necessary part of\u2019 the care or treatment, <em>Rome </em>included a broad statement regarding employees providing transportation to patients. In examining the claim of the plaintiff transported in a faulty wheelchair, the <em>Rome </em>court stated that the plaintiff \u201cwas assisted by an employee of St. Vincent <em>who was required to use a certain amount of professional skill </em>in transporting the patient in the wheelchair.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Rome, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 17, 635 N.E.2d 1239. This language does not provide an indication as to any particular level of professional skill required. We believe this statement to be mere dictum rather than a statement of law. Further, the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in <em>Rome. </em>Although Hoover transported Brenda, Hoover\u2019s deposition testimony makes clear that a hospital volunteer was originally assigned to assist Brenda. When a volunteer with no requisite medical training is capable of completing the transport out of the hospital, professional skill is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">{\u00b6 17} At the time of her injury, Brenda was either already discharged or in the final stage of discharge from the hospital. There were no diagnostic tests or treatment activities to be completed before she left the hospital. Accordingly, Brenda was not injured in the course of the prevention or alleviation of a physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>or mental defect or illness. <em>Browning, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 557, 613 N.E.2d 993. Nor was the transport ancillary to, and an inherently necessary part of, any treatment. <em>Rome, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 16, 635 N.E.2d 1239. Under the definition of \u201cmedical claim\u201d in R.C. 2305.113 and as interpreted by <em>Brouming </em>and <em>Rome, </em>this case does not involve a medical claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">{\u00b6 18} On June 2, 2008, the trial court ruled that the Hills\u2019 claims were medical claims under <em>Rome </em>and required them to produce an affidavit of merit signed by an expert pursuant to Civ.R. 10 or their claims would be dismissed without prejudice. The trial court\u2019s decision to require expert testimony in order to maintain the action presents a question of law. This court reviews questions of law under the de novo standard of review. <em>Eagle v. Fred Martin Motor Co., </em>157 Ohio App.3d 150, 2004-Ohio-829, 809 N.E.2d 1161, at \u00b6 11. When reviewing a matter de novo, this court does not give deference to the trial court\u2019s decision. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">{\u00b6 19} Generally, the purpose of expert testimony is to \u201cassist the trier of fact in determining a fact issue or understanding the evidence.\u201d <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 687 N.E.2d 735. According to Evid.R. 702(A), an expert witness\u2019s testimony must either \u201crelat[e] to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by the lay person or dispe[l] a misconception common among lay persons.\u201d An expert witness \u201cmay not express an opinion upon matters as to which the jury is capable of forming a competent conclusion.\u201d <em>Burens v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 549, 55 O.O. 436, 124 N.E.2d 724, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">{\u00b6 20} The Hills have consistently argued that an injury occurring while a patient is being transported in a wheelchair is not beyond the experience possessed by a layperson and requires no expert testimony. WRH and Hoover, conversely, direct this court to <em>Bruni v. Tatsumi </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 127, 75 O.O.2d 184, 346 N.E.2d 673, and <em>Ramage v. Cent. Ohio Emergency Servs. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 97, 592 N.E.2d 828, for the proposition that expert testimony is required to prevail on a medical claim, even against a nurse. We find the Hills\u2019 argument more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">In a negligence action involving the professional skill and judgment of a nurse, expert testimony must be presented to establish the prevailing standard of care, a breach of that standard, and, that the nurse\u2019s negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of the patient\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\"><em>Ramage, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">{\u00b6 21} However, \u201c[i]n a negligence action involving conduct within the common knowledge and experience of jurors, expert testimony is not required.\u201d <em>Berdyck </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number><em>v. Shinde </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 573, 581, 613 N.E.2d 1014, citing <em>Ramage, </em>at 103, 592 N.E.2d 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">{\u00b6 22} Rather than the professional skills and judgment of Hoover, this case involves escorting a patient to her vehicle by wheelchair. WRH and Hoover argue that expert testimony would be necessary to interpret or explain the hospital\u2019s transport procedures. This court is confident that under the facts of this case, the finder of fact would be able to adequately interpret WRH\u2019s \u201cTransportation of Patients\u201d procedures without expert testimony, as the entirety of written procedures consist of the following with respect to wheelchairs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">A) Be sure brakes are locked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">B) Provide blanket or cover for warmth and to prevent exposure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">C) Always back wheelchairs in and out of elevators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">{\u00b6 23} The Hills cite the following eases in arguing for negligence rather than medical-malpractice principles regarding expert testimony. <em>Jones v. Hawkes Hosp. of Mt. Carmel </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 503, 505, 26 O.O.2d 170, 196 N.E.2d 592, involved a drowsy, lethargic, delirious, and restless woman who fell and injured herself while attempting to climb over the side rails of her bed after a nurse left her unattended. In <em>Burks v. Christ Hosp. </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 128, 130-131, 48 O.O.2d 117, 249 N.E.2d 829, a short, obese hospital patient in severe pain was sedated to the point of being foggy, drowsy, and disoriented. The defendants did not order the use of guardrails, and the patient fell out of bed, injuring herself. Id. <em>Dimora v. Cleveland Clinic Found. </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 711, 718-719, 683 N.E.2d 1175, involved a patient who fell while left standing at her walker unattended while a student nurse prepared a wheelchair and secured the door hinge. In each case, the court ruled that expert testimony was not necessary to assist the trier of fact in determining the issue of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">{\u00b6 24} In this case, Brenda\u2019s deposition testimony indicates that Hoover was distracted while transporting Brenda outside of the hospital, that Hoover was engaged in a conversation with an unidentified man, and that Brenda was nervous because she had never seen a man have an apparent heart attack and collapse. This made her anxious to leave. Hoover left the immediate area and was gone for about one minute when Brenda fell. By the time Hoover returned, Brenda\u2019s husband had helped her back into the wheelchair. Taking all of Brenda\u2019s statements as true, the factual situation is appropriate for the application of simple negligence principles because these are not matters beyond the common knowledge of a layperson. Evid.R. 702(A). Accordingly, we conclude that under the authority above, medical malpractice involving professional skill and judgment is not implicated by these facts. See <em>Woodham v. Elyria Mem. Hosp. </em>(July 5, 2001), 9th Dist. No. 00CA007736, 2001 WL 753268, at *2, citing <em>Ramage, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 103, 592 N.E.2d 828. The trial court erred as a matter of law when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>it ruled that the Hills\u2019 complaint set forth a medical claim and required expert testimony. \u201cReversing summary judgment on the basis of the trial court\u2019s improper evidentiary ruling is proper because it affects the substantial rights of the adverse party.\u201d <em>Gilmore v. Village Green Mgt. Co., </em>178 Ohio App.3d 294, 2008-Ohio-4566, 897 N.E.2d 1142, at \u00b6 39, citing <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 159,164-165,17 O.O.3d 98, 407 N.E.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">{\u00b6 25} Accordingly, the Hills\u2019 single assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">{\u00b6 26} The Hills\u2019 single assignment of error is sustained.
