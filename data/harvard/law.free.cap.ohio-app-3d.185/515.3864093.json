(\u201cRCI\u201d) installation truck and an SUV. The truck was driven by an employee/co-owner of RCI, defendant Charles Larkin. Appellee Sean McLaughlin was an employee of RCI and a passenger in the truck. It is undisputed that the men were within the scope of their employment at the time of the accident. It is also undisputed that Larkin was at fault in the accident. As a result of the accident, Sean McLaughlin sustained serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 3} J. Andy Miller, a co-owner of RCI, owned the installation truck involved in the accident. Neither RCI nor Miller as the owner of the truck carried motor-vehicle liability insurance. Further, Larkin was an uninsured driver, driving under a suspended license for failure to pay his child-support obligation. As a result, appellees sought uninsured-motorist coverage under their own policy with State Farm. State Farm denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 4} At all relevant times and at the time of the collision, RCI was not in compliance with Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Laws. However, appellee Sean Larkin received payment for his medical bills from the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">{\u00b6 5} Appellees filed the within action naming State Farm, RCI, Larkin, and Miller as defendants. The claims against State Farm included uninsured/underinsured-motorist coverage and medical-payment coverage. Appellees also sued Larkin for negligence in causing personal injuries and damages and Miller for negligent entrustment of the vehicle to Larkin. Appellees asserted claims of negligent entrustment and vicarious liability against RCI.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment on September 28, 2006. Appellees filed their own motion for summary judgment on October 9, 2006. Via judgment entry of November 20, 2006, the trial court denied State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">{\u00b6 7} This court dismissed State Farm\u2019s appeal from the November 20, 2006 judgment entry for lack of a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>{\u00b6 8} On April 11, 2008, the parties filed a stipulation of facts regarding the applicable policy limits, damages, and the involvement of the BWC and the parties\u2019 reservation of rights to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 9} On April 16, 2008, via judgment entry, the trial court incorporated its prior order granting summary judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, this court found that the April 16, 2008 order was also not a final, appealable order, dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 10} On March 16, 2009, the parties entered into an agreed judgment entry and final, appealable order disposing of all remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 11} State Farm proceeded with the within appeal, assigning as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cI. The trial court erred by granting plaintiffs [sic] motion for summary judgment and by not granting the motion for summary judgment of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and by concluding that plaintiffs are entitled to uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage in spite of the fact that plaintiffs could not establish that they were legally entitled to collect from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cII. The trial court erred in granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment against defendant and by not granting the motion for summary judgment of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company on the issue of whether medical payments coverage is available under the factual circumstances surrounding this accident in spite of the fact that the policy of insurance indicates no coverage is available when medical expenses are required to be payable under workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">{\u00b6 14} We review appellants\u2019 assignments of error pursuant to the standard set forth in Civ.R. 56. That rule was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State ex rel. Zimmerman v. Tompkins </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 447, 448, 663 N.E.2d 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cCiv.R. 56(C) provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. <em>State ex rel. Parsons v. Fleming </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 509, 511, 628 N.E.2d 1377, 1379, citing <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317. 327. 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>{\u00b6 16} As an appellate court reviewing summary-judgment motions, we must stand in the shoes of the trial court and review summary judgments on the same standard and evidence as the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">{\u00b6 17} The uninsured-motor vehicle coverage section of the State Farm policy at issue reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cWe will pay damages for <em>bodily injury </em>an <em>insured:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c1. is legally entitled to collect from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c2. would have been legally entitled to collect except for the fact that the owner or driver of the <em>uninsured motor vehicle </em>has an immunity under Chapter 2744 of the Ohio Revised Code or a diplomatic immunity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 21} The policy further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cWhat Is Not Covered * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cTHERE IS NO COVERAGE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">{\u00b6 24} <em>\u201c4. </em>for medical expenses for bodily injury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cb. to the extent workers\u2019 compensation benefits are required to be payable * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">{\u00b6 26} The policy provided uninsured-motorist coverage in the amount of $100,000/$300,000 and medical-payments coverage in the amount of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">{\u00b6 27} Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we find it clear who is the \u201cdriver\u201d and who is the \u201cowner\u201d of the uninsured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">{\u00b6 28} State Farm denied coverage under the policy because the driver of the vehicle, Larkin, and appellee Sean McLaughlin were co-employees of RCI. R.C. 4123.741 sets forth the fellow-servant rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-16\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cNo employee of any employer, as defined in division (B) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code, shall be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for any injury or occupational disease, received or contracted by any other employee of such employer in the course of and arising out of the latter employee\u2019s employment, or for any death resulting from such injury or occupational disease, on the condition that such injury, occupational disease, or death is found to be compensable under sections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">{\u00b6 30} Pursuant to the fellow-servant rule, appellees are not legally entitled to recover against the driver of the vehicle, Larkin. However, appellees maintain that they are entitled to recover against RCI, as Larkin was an employee of RCI operating the vehicle in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>accident at issue. Appellees\u2019 complaint alleges that RCI is jointly and severally liable for the torts committed by Larkin based upon the doctrine of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 31} In support, appellees cite R.C. 1701.03(A) for the proposition that a corporation itself enters into contracts, borrows money, sues, and may be sued on its own. Appellees further assert that a corporation is incapable of acting except through the agency of others; therefore RCI, an artificial person created by operation of law and acting by and through its employee Larkin, drove the truck in which appellee Sean McLaughlin was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 32} The doctrine of vicarious liability imputes liability secondarily to an employer for the torts of its employee, the actual tortfeasor. The employer is charged with passive negligence due to the master/servant relationship. <em>Reynolds v. Physicians Ins. Co. of Ohio </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 14, 623 N.E.2d 30. However, we do not conclude that the doctrine acts to substitute the employer corporation as the \u201cdriver\u201d of the vehicle in the place of the actual tortfeasor. The language of the policy is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Ambiguity cannot be created as to the meaning of \u201cdriver\u201d by application of the doctrine of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 33} We now must determine whether appellees are legally entitled to recover against the owner of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">{\u00b6 34} J. Andy Miller Jr. was the owner of the vehicle. Appellees asserted claims against Miller for negligent entrustment and negligently failing to maintain mandatory motor-vehicle insurance on the vehicle in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 35} The Ohio Supreme Court has defined \u201cnegligent entrustment\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe owner of a motor vehicle may be held liable for an injury to a third person upon the ground of negligence if the owner knowingly, either through actual knowledge or through knowledge implied from known facts or circumstances, entrusts its operation to an inexperienced or incompetent operator whose negligent operation results in the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cIn an action against the owner of a motor vehicle arising from its entrustment for operation, the burden is upon the plaintiff to establish that the motor vehicle was driven with the permission and authority of the owner; that the entrustee was in fact an incompetent driver; and that the owner knew at the time of the entrustment that the entrustee had no driver\u2019s license, or that he was incompetent or unqualified to operate the vehicle, or had knowledge of such facts and circumstances as would imply knowledge on the part of the owner of such incompetency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>{\u00b6 39} <em>Gulla v. Straus </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 193, 42 O.O. 261, 93 N.E.2d 662, paragraphs three and five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">{\u00b6 40} Appellees have not directed us to any evidentiary material in the record to establish that Miler knew or should have known that Larkin was in fact an incompetent driver. Accordingly, we find that appellees are unable to establish that they are entitled to recover against Miller on the theory of negligent entrustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 41} We now turn to the question of whether appellees are legally entitled to recover against Miller because of his failure to insure the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 42} The Ohio Supreme Court held as follows in <em>Mt. Nebo Baptist Church v. Cleveland Crafts Co. </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 185, 42 O.O. 258, 93 N.E.2d 668:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cTo establish negligence of the owner of a motor vehicle in such a case, it is essential that it be shown by competent evidence that the owner of the automobile had knowledge of the driver\u2019s incompetence, inexperience or reckless tendency as an operator, or that the owner, in the exercise of ordinary care, should have known thereof from facts and circumstances with which he was acquainted. <em>(Williamson v. Eclipse Motor Lines, Inc., </em>145 Ohio St.. 467 [31 O.O. 156], 62 N.E.2d 339, 168 A.L.R. 1356, approved and followed.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe general rule applicable is that where the violation of a statute, enacted for the protection of the health and safety of the public, gives rise to liability for consequent damages, it is required that it be shown not only that there was a violation of such statute but also that such violation was a proximate cause of the injury claimed to have been sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">{\u00b6 46} The First District Court of Appeals held as follows in <em>State Farm Ins. Cos. v. Wood </em>(1989), 58 Ohio App.3d 11, 567 N.E.2d 1040:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cWe begin our analysis of the assignment of error by observing the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Mt. Nebo Baptist Church v. Cleveland Crafts Co. </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 185, 191, 42 O.O. 258, 93 N.E.2d 668, in which the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c \u2018The general rule applicable is that where the violation of a statute, enacted for the protection of the health and safety of the public, gives rise to liability for consequent damages, it is required that it be shown not only that there was a violation of such statute but also that such violation was a proximate cause of the injury claimed to have been sustained.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-13\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cR.C. 4509.101(A)(1) provides that \u2018[n]o person shall * * * permit the operation of * * * a motor vehicle in [Ohio] * * *, unless proof of financial responsibility is maintained with respect to that vehicle, or, in the case of a driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>who is not the owner, with respect to his operation of that vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wood, </em>58 Ohio App.3d at 12, 567 N.E.2d 1040. Assuming, \"without deciding, that State Farm could prove that Miller violated R.C. 4509.101, we find that that violation was not the proximate cause of the injury suffered by appellees pursuant to <em>Mt. Nebo Baptist Church, </em>154 Ohio St. 185, 42 O.O. 258, 93 N.E.2d 668.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">{\u00b6 50} Having concluded that appellees are not legally entitled to recover against either the driver, Larkin, or the owner, Miller we find that the trial court erred in finding that appellees were entitled to coverage under their State Farm uninsured-motorist policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 52} In the second assignment of error, appellant State Farm asserts that the trial court erred in finding that appellees were entitled to medical-payment coverage under the policy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 53} The policy reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cWe will pay reasonable medical expenses incurred for bodily injury, caused by accident, for services furnished within three years of the date of the accident. These expenses are for necessary medical, surgery, x-ray, dental, ambulance, hospital, professional nursing and funeral services, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and prosthetic devices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">{\u00b6 56} \u2018What Is Not Covered</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cTHERE IS NO COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c4.
