Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-21\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b358-22\">{\u00b6 2} On January 6, 2009, Adam Smail contacted the Millersburg Police Department to report threats of physical harm made to him by appellant. At the time of the incident, appellant was involved in a relationship with Smail\u2019s ex-wife. Smail had gone to his ex-wife\u2019s home to retrieve firewood and some personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>belongings. Appellant then called Smail and made the alleged threats. Smail reported that appellant threatened to \u201ccome and get him and beat him up\u201d and told him to watch his back because he was going to come after him.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 3} As a result of the exchange, appellant was charged with menacing, in violation of R.C. 2903.22, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 4} On April 28, 2009, the Holmes County Municipal Court found appellant guilty of the charge following a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant now appeals, assigning as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cI. The trial court erred by not granting appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 7} At the close of the state\u2019s case, appellant moved the trial court for an acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(A) Motion for judgment of acquittal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe court on motion of a defendant or on its own motion, after the evidence on either side is closed, shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment, information, or complaint, if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses. The court may not reserve ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the state\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">{\u00b6 10} In the case sub judice, appellant was charged with menacing, in violation of R.C. 2903.22. The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(A) No person shall knowingly cause another to believe that the offender will cause physical harm to the person or property of the other person, the other person\u2019s unborn, or a member of the other person\u2019s immediate family.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">{\u00b6 12} At trial in this matter, Smail testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-15\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cAdam: Well um I\u2019m in the mist of getting a divorce and a Mr. Harding keeps sticking his nose into this divorce and wanted to be a part of it for some reason. And a I went and got some personal belongings that were from my a previous um place a where I lived and a and when I went there he had come out and got aggressive with me and I told him I would call the cops on him and stuff and he a and he just continues to be aggressive with me and very mouthy and belligerent with me. But I went and got some personal possessions from my house and he called me on my phone after a I had left the house and he was saying stuff like \u2018Oh you think you are real cute don\u2019t cha\u2019 and then started to threaten me saying that I better watch over my shoulder he\u2019ll be coming to get me a he\u2019s got friends um stupid derogatory comments like I heard I heard you like it up the a* * and stuff like that. Just demeaningful and constantly on me about something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201cWilliams: O.K. When he said these threats to you um that he was going to jump you or he was going to beat you up did you think that he was true or did you think that he was actually going to carry out these things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAdam: This this incident would be the fourth time that this has happened with Mr. Harding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cWilliams: O.K. And on the date though on January 6th of 09 did you think he was capable of carrying out those threats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAdam: Well that\u2019s what he keeps saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cWilliams: O.K. Are you; are you worried that he is going to cause you or someone you know your immediate family some harm because of these threats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cAdam: I\u2019m not really worried of him I just want it to stop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">{\u00b6 20} On cross-examination, Smail further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAdam: I said just a little bit ago I wasn\u2019t afraid. I was worried and concerned at the time. This is all do [sic] to my wife and me getting a divorce and he has stuck his nose in the middle of it and will not get off my case about it. They have made false police reports against me. They have accused me over and over of many many things and this has gone on and on even with a non-contact order Mr. Harding has continued to harass me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cAdam: I run a business. I run into him all the time and he doesn\u2019t need to have the chance to harass me every time he sees me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cKellogg: So you brought these charges against him so he would leave you alone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-15\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cAdam: I have a business to protect at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-16\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cKellogg: But not because you were afraid of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-17\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cAdam: I\u2019m not afraid of Mr. Harding. I wish he would just leave me alone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-18\">{\u00b6 28} Upon review of the testimony and the record, we find that the evidence before the trial court was insufficient to sustain the conviction on the offense of menacing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The alleged victim\u2019s trial testimony demonstrates that he did not in fact believe that appellant would cause him physical harm. Appellant\u2019s \u201ccapability\u201d to cause harm is insufficient standing alone to support the charge; rather, the state must demonstrate that the victim actually believed that appellant would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>cause harm to him his property, or his family. The state did not meet its burden under the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 30} The April 28, 2009 journal entry of the Holmes County Municipal Court finding appellant guilty of menacing is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-8\">Gwin, P.J., and Edwards, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-19\">. Though appellant may have committed an act of disorderly conduct or have been in violation of a noncontact order such charges were not before the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
