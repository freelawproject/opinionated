The union contends that the arbitrator did not exceed his power by using the clear-and-convincing standard of evidence to find that the department failed to prove that it had cause to discharge Marrs. The union also contends that the award does not violate Ohio public policy. Finally, the union contends that Marrs is entitled to statutory prejudgment interest on the award. We will reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. However, because the trial court did not address the issue, we decline to consider whether Marrs is entitled to prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">{\u00b6 2} It was dark on the night of May 4, 2008, when Officer Brett Marrs, out on patrol, came to a four-way intersection and stopped. As he began to drive through the intersection, a bicycle struck the front side of the cruiser, or the cruiser struck a bicyclist; the fact is contested. The department, Marrs\u2019s employer, believed that Marrs had hit the bicyclist, and it cited him for violating a traffic ordinance that prohibits \u201cimproper starting.\u201d The department also concluded that Marrs had violated two departmental standards of conduct\u2014 Standard of Conduct 06 (committing unsafe acts or endangering themselves or others) and Standard of Conduct 12 (directing employees to display competent performance and achieve competent performance results). Based on these violations, ten days later, May 14, the department discharged Marrs.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 3} While the accident was a necessary cause of the department\u2019s decision to discharge Marrs, it was not the sole cause. Marrs had already been disciplined three times in the past two years. He had received a written reprimand for backing into another cruiser, causing damage; a one-day suspension for excessive personal use of the department\u2019s cellular phone while on duty; and a written reprimand for being late to duty assignments. The accident, then, was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, convincing the department that Marrs did not have the good judgment needed to be an effective police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 4} The labor relationship between police officers and the department is governed by a collective bargaining agreement. Under this agreement, there is a three-step grievance-resolution procedure. The union, on behalf of Marrs, initiated this procedure. While the parties were trying to resolve the grievance, on August 8, 2008, Marrs was tried at a bench trial in municipal court on the \u201cimproper start\u201d citation. Both Marrs and the bicyclist testified. Finding the evidence insufficient to prove that he violated the traffic ordinance, the court found Marrs not guilty. Unable to otherwise resolve Marrs\u2019s grievance, on September 26, 2008, the parties proceeded to the third and final step of the grievance-resolution procedure: arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 5} In his written decision, the arbitrator noted that the agreement permits the department to discharge or discipline officers only for \u201cjust cause,\u201d which is not defined in the agreement. The arbitrator said that \u201cjust cause\u201d required the department to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Marrs had committed the wrongdoing that provided the grounds on which the department decided to discharge him. The arbitrator concluded that the department had failed to prove that Marrs was in any way at fault for the accident. The evidence shows, said the arbitrator, that as Marrs proceeded through the intersection, a bicycle hit the cruiser; the rider, having failed to stop at the intersection, had jumped off moments before. The arbitrator noted that the officer who first arrived on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>scene and investigated the incident concluded that Marrs had not violated any standard, policy, rule, regulation, statute, ordinance, or law indicative of misconduct. It was later, when those \u201chigher up\u201d reviewed the incident, that Marrs was charged with the traffic-ordinance violation. The arbitrator also cited several times the municipal court\u2019s acquittal. Based on the totality of the evidence presented, concluded the arbitrator, the department failed to meet its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that Marrs had committed the misconduct that formed the basis of the disciplinary action. Therefore, the arbitrator ordered the department to reinstate Marrs to his former position.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 6} The department appealed the arbitrator\u2019s award to the Miami County Court of Common Pleas, contending that the arbitrator exceeded his powers and asking the trial court to vacate the award. The department argued that the arbitrator should not have used a heightened standard of proof. It also contended that the award violated Ohio public policy. The trial court agreed with both contentions, concluding that the arbitrator erred when he determined that the department had no \u201cjust cause\u201d to discipline Marrs. As a matter of law, said the court, the arbitrator should have used a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard because that is the standard called for by the agreement. Also, the court concluded, reinstating as a police officer someone with Marrs\u2019s checkered history violates Ohio public policy. \u201cTherefore,\u201d said the court, \u201cthe Court remands this matter to arbitration, consistent with and constrained by, the mandates set forth herein, to (1) determine sufficient and appropriate discipline in view of the prior disciplinary violations and the violations of the two standards of conduct cited herein (2) in a manner and amount that does not undermine or diminish the City\u2019s \u2018right to direct, manage and control the affairs\u2019 of the City (3) with proof by a preponderance of the facts and evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 7} The union\u2019s appeal from this order is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 8} The union\u2019s first four assignments of error concern whether the trial court correctly concluded that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, and we will consider them together. The fifth assignment of error concerns whether the trial court correctly concluded that the arbitrator\u2019s award violates Ohio public policy. And the sixth (and final) assignment of error concerns whether Marrs is entitled to prejudgment interest on the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">{\u00b6 9} These are the first four assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant when it determined that the arbitrator exceeded his power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant when it determined that the arbitrator imperfectly performed his duties so that the arbitration decision was both arbitrary and contrary to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant when it substituted its interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement for the interpretation made by the arbitrator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant when it misapplied the test for overturning an arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant to O.R.C. 2711.10.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 14} The union\u2019s essential contention in the first four assignments of error is that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by ordering the department to reinstate Marrs. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 15} We will limit, as we must, the scope of our review to the trial court\u2019s decision to vacate. See <em>Dayton v. Fraternal Order of Police </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 591, 597, 602 N.E.2d 743 (review \u201cis confined to an evaluation of the order issued by the court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 2711.10\u201d). And we will review the decision de novo. See <em>Dayton v. Internatl. Assn. of Firefighters, Local No. 136, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21681, 2007-Ohio-1337, 2007 WL 866999, at \u00b6 11. Upon review, we conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law by exceeding the permissible scope of its review and vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Judicial review of arbitration awards</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">{\u00b6 16} Judicial review of arbitration awards is limited in order to encourage parties to resolve their disputes with arbitration. <em>Dayton, </em>2007-Ohio-1337, 2007 WL 866999, at \u00b6 9, citing <em>Kelm v. Kelm </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 26, 27, 623 N.E.2d 39. This has long been public policy in Ohio. See <em>Springfield v. Walker </em>(1885), 42 Ohio St. 543, 546 (\u201cArbitration is favored\u201d). The state and courts encourage arbitration because it \u201cprovides parties with a relatively speedy and inexpensive method of conflict resolution and has the additional advantage of unburdening crowded court dockets.\u201d <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities v. Mahoning Cty. Trainable Mentally Retarded Edn. Assn. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 80, 83, 22 OBR 95, 488 N.E.2d 872; see also <em>Springfield </em>at 546 (\u201c[T]he purpose of an arbitration is[] to avoid needless and expensive litigation\u201d). Appellate courts must ensure that trial courts, the front line of arbitral review, do not exceed the scope of their review authority. Otherwise, \u201c[a]rbitration, which is intended to avoid litigation, would instead merely become a system of \u2018junior varsity trial courts\u2019 offering the losing party complete and rigorous de novo review.\u201d <em>Dayton </em>at \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Motor Wheel Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 45, 52, 647 N.E.2d 844. Thus, judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s award is strictly limited, \u201cand where a reviewing court exceeds the permissible scope of review such judgment will be reversed.\u201d <em>Hillsboro v. Fraternal Order of Police </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 174, 176, 556 N.E.2d 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIn order to facilitate and encourage the private settlement of grievance disputes, the scope of judicial review of the arbitration proceedings is limited\u201d by statute and construing case law. <em>Huber Hts. v. Fraternal Order of Police </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 68, 73, 596 N.E.2d 571, citing <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Local Union No. 200, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of Am. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 516, 520, 71 O.O.2d 509, 330 N.E.2d 703. We have observed that \u201c[o]nce arbitration is completed, a trial court has no jurisdiction except to confirm, vacate, modify, or enforce the award and only on the terms provided by statute.\u201d <em>Duckett v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(Aug. 27, 1984), Clark App. No. 1941, 1984 WL 3838. This means further that the court must strive to uphold the arbitration award. <em>Hillsboro, </em>52 Ohio St.3d at 178, 556 N.E.2d 1186 (a trial court \u201cmust be sensitive to upholding an arbitrator\u2019s award whenever it is possible to do so\u201d). Two key principles limit arbitral review. First, the arbitrator\u2019s award is presumed valid. <em>Dayton, </em>2007-Ohio-1337, 2007 WL 866999, at \u00b6 11 (\u201can arbitrator\u2019s award carries with it a strong presumption of validity\u201d). This means that absent contrary evidence, a trial court ought to presume that the arbitration proceedings were regular and had integrity. <em>Huber Hts., </em>73 Ohio App.3d at 74, 596 N.E.2d 571, citing <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Findlay Edn. Assn. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 129, 131, 551 N.E.2d 186. Second, the trial court may not consider the award\u2019s merits \u2014 its substantive aspects. See <em>Duckett. </em>This limitation means that the trial court must be deaf to claims that an arbitrator made factual or legal errors. <em>Huber Hts. v. Am. Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emps., Ohio Council 8, &amp; Local 101 </em>(Feb. 10, 1995), Montgomery App. No. 14762, 1995 WL 51091, *5 (\u201cwe [may not] question the accuracy of the arbitrator\u2019s factual or legal findings\u201d); <em>Duckett, *2 </em>(\u201csubstantive questions of fact and law determined in arbitration are not subsequently reviewable in a trial court\u201d). We must consider further this ramification.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Errors of fact or law must be ignored</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 18} It is because arbitration is a creature of private contract that courts must ignore errors of fact or law. See <em>Dayton, </em>2007-Ohio-1337, 2007 WL 866999, at \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Motor Wheel Corp., </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 52, 647 N.E.2d 844 (\u201c \u2018The limited scope of judicial review of arbitration decisions comes from the fact that arbitration is a creature of contract\u2019 \u201d). Parties, by agreeing to allow an arbitrator to resolve their disputes, also implicitly agree to be bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>mistakes the arbitrator makes while carrying out his charge. See <em>Dayton v. Fraternal Order of Police </em>(June 2, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 18158, 2000 WL 706829, *3, citing <em>Goodyear, </em>42 Ohio St.2d at 522, 71 O.O.2d 509, 330 N.E.2d 703 (\u201cWhen parties agree to submit their disputes to binding arbitration, they agree to accept the result, regardless of its legal or factual accuracy\u201d). The comments to R.C. 2711.10, the statute governing judicial vacation, explain, \u201cThe arbitrators are the sole judges of the law and of the evidence and no vacation of an award will be had because of their misconstruction of the facts or of the law.\u201d See also <em>Duckett </em>(quoting the same) and <em>Dayton, </em>2007-Ohio-1337, 2007 WL 866999, at \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Motor Wheel Corp., </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 52, 647 N.E.2d 844 (\u201cIf parties cannot rely on the arbitrator\u2019s decision (if a court may overrule that decision because it perceives factual or legal error in the decision), the parties have lost the benefit of their bargain\u201d). Therefore, an error of fact or law alone is not a reason to vacate an award. <em>Huber Hts. </em>(\u201c[A]n error of law or fact, * * * [is] insufficient reason[] to vacate the award\u201d). For example, in <em>Duckett, </em>we reversed a vacation order grounded on the trial court\u2019s disagreement with the arbitrator\u2019s understanding of Ohio tort law. Each party had argued in favor of an outcome that it believed the law required. \u201cAlthough these arguments present interesting questions of law and fact,\u201d we said, \u201cthis Court may not reach the merits of this case.\u201d <em>Duckett, </em>1984 WL 3838, *1. We said that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Goodyear </em>was dispositive of the issue: \u201c \u2018How this or another court might have decided the issue presented to the arbitrator is irrelevant; that decision, by voluntary contract, was left to arbitration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duckett, </em>1984 WL 3838, *2, quoting <em>Goodyear, </em>42 Ohio St.2d at 523, 71 O.O.2d 509, 330 N.E.2d 703; see also <em>Rathweg Ins. Assoc., Inc. v. First Ins. Agency Corp. </em>(Aug. 18, 1992), Montgomery App. No. 13184, 1992 WL 206764, *4 (\u201cA court cannot go behind the face of an arbitration award to search for an error of law or fact\u201d). From <em>Goodyear, </em>we may derive the fundamental principle upon which arbitral review restrictions rest: a trial court may not substitute its judgment \u2014 its view of the facts or law \u2014 for that of the arbitrator. See <em>Rathweg </em>at *3 (\u201cAn award is not reviewable by the courts simply because the arbitrators decided the facts incorrectly, made an error in judgment, or misapplied the law\u201d). Critically then, in reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s award, the court must distinguish between an arbitrator\u2019s act in excess of his powers and an error merely in the way the arbitrator executed his powers. The former is grounds to vacate; the latter is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Permissible grounds for vacation</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 19} The grounds upon which a trial court may vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award are few and narrow. See <em>Dayton, </em>2007-Ohio-1337, 2007 WL 866999. Vacation is permitted only if the court finds that one of the conditions identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>in R.C. 2711.10 exists \u2014 fraud, corruption, misconduct, exceeded powers. See <em>Goodyear, </em>42 Ohio St.2d 516, 71 O.O.2d 509, 330 N.E.2d 703, at paragraph two of the syllabus (review is limited \u201cto claims of fraud, corruption, misconduct, an imperfect award, or that the arbitrator exceeded his authority\u201d); see also <em>Duckett; Dayton, </em>76 Ohio App.3d at 597, 602 N.E.2d 743 (vacation is possible \u201conly if it [found] that the determination fails under the standards of R.C. 2711.10\u201d). \u201cThe legislative intent in R.C. 2711.10,\u201d we have said, \u201cis that the court \u2018shall\u2019 not confirm an award that is fraught with fraud, corruption, misconduct or is so indefinite that the court cannot determine what it was that the arbitrator decided.\u201d <em>Ohio Council 8, Am. Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emps., AFL-CIO v. Cent. State Univ. </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 84, 86, 16 OBR 89, 474 N.E.2d 647. Any one of these conditions results in a nullity \u2014 in other words, the award has no legal validity.

R.C. 2711.10(D), the fourth (and final) paragraph, says that the award should be vacated if \u201c[t]he arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d This paragraph \u201cauthorizes the court of common pleas to vacate an arbitration award upon a finding that the arbitrator exceeded the powers conferred on [him] by the arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>Dayton v.

See <em>Huber Hts., </em>1995 WL 51091, *2 (\u201cThis language [of R.C. 2711.10(D) ] reflects the General Assembly\u2019s concern that arbitrators operate only within the bounds of the authority granted them within [the] underlying agreement\u201d). The arbitrator\u2019s authority comes solely from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>parties and is limned and rooted in the arbitration agreement. See id. (\u201cAn arbitrator draws his authority to settle disputes and impose awards under a collective bargaining agreement from the agreement itself\u2019). The arbitration agreement generally explains how the arbitrator may resolve the parties\u2019 disputes, which often concern how their agreement, in which the arbitration provision is contained, should be understood. In this situation, \u201cthe function of the arbitrator is to determine and carry out the mutual intent of the parties by interpreting the agreement and applying its provisions to the issues before him or her.\u201d <em>Dayton, </em>76 Ohio App.3d at 597, 602 N.E.2d 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">{\u00b6 22} Like arbitral review generally, a trial court\u2019s inquiry into whether an arbitrator exceeded his powers under the parties\u2019 agreement is limited. <em>Findlay City School Dist.

Generally, if the arbitrator\u2019s award is based on the language and requirements of the agreement, the arbitrator has not exceeded his powers. See <em>Miami Twp. Bd. of Trustees v.

We find both tests satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">{\u00b6 25} Article 7, Section 3, of the agreement contains the parties\u2019 agreement on arbitration. Pertinent here: \u201cThe arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the Agreement in any way, but shall instead be limited to the application of the terms of this Agreement in determining the dispute. * * * His decision shall be final and binding upon the parties to this Agreement. This grievance- and arbitration procedure shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for all claimed violations of this Agreement and shall be in lieu of all rights under civil service rules.\u201d Neither this provision nor any other in the agreement prevents the arbitrator from ordering the reinstatement of an employee who was discharged without just cause. So by ordering the department to reinstate Marrs, the arbitrator did not violate any express term of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b626} When an arbitration award is \u201crationally supported\u201d by an agreement or can be \u201crationally derived\u201d from an agreement, a rational nexus exists between them, <em>Dayton, </em>2006-Ohio-1129, 2006 WL 574307, at \u00b6 11, citing <em>Southwest Ohio, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 110, 742 N.E.2d 630 (\u201cAn arbitrator\u2019s award draws its essence from a collective bargaining agreement when there is a rational nexus between the collective bargaining agreement and the award\u201d), or as we have said, the award \u201crationally flows\u201d from the agreement. See <em>Huber Hts., </em>1995 WL 51091; <em>Huber Hts., </em>73 Ohio App.3d at 74, 596 N.E.2d 571. The word \u201csupport\u201d has many senses. Here, we understand the Supreme Court\u2019s use of the word in the sense of \u201cjustify,\u201d that the agreement must justify the arbitrator\u2019s award: the agreement must give grounds for, make legitimate, or provide justification for, the award. Similarly, the word \u201cderive\u201d can be used in different senses. We understand the court\u2019s use of the word here to be in the sense that the award may be \u201cdeduced\u201d from the agreement, that it may be obtained by reasoning, or reasoned from the agreement. We conclude that the relationship between the agreement and the arbitrator\u2019s award here is such that the agreement supports the arbitrator\u2019s award, and the award can be derived from the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u201cJust cause\u201d to discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">{\u00b6 27} The dispute in this case comes down to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of \u201cjust cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">{\u00b6 28} The arbitrator\u2019s basis for the award is his determination that the department lacked \u201cjust cause\u201d to discipline Marrs, which it required under the agreement. Articles 2 and 6 of the agreement say that the department has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>right \u201cto discharge or discipline officers for just cause.\u201d See Article 2(B)(8) (stating that the right of the department to direct, manage, and control its employees includes \u201c[t]he termination of probationary Employees, and the termination for just cause of other Employees\u201d). However, the parties did not define \u201cjust cause\u201d in the agreement. When \u201cjust cause\u201d is left undefined, we have generally deferred to the arbitrator\u2019s definition. See <em>Dayton v. AFSCME, Ohio Council 8, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21092, 2005-Ohio-6392, 2005 WL 3240794, at \u00b6 11 (where it is not defined, the existence or nonexistence of just cause for the employee\u2019s discharge \u201cplainly was a matter within the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority and discretion\u201d); see, e.g., <em>Dayton, </em>2000 WL 706829, *4 (deferring to the arbitrator\u2019s just-cause definition because otherwise \u201cthe parties were precluded from arbitrating any grievance relative to whether an employee had been terminated, demoted, suspended, or otherwise relieved of duty for just cause by virtue of the fact that just cause is not defined in the agreement,\u201d saying, \u201c[i]n our view, this would be an absurd result\u201d). If either party wanted a more specific definition of \u201cjust cause,\u201d it could have bargained for it. But \u201c[i]n the absence of an express provision to the contrary, it [is] for the arbitrator to determine the meaning of \u2018just cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dayton, </em>2000 WL 706829, *4. See also <em>Summit Cty. Children Servs. Bd. v. Communication Workers of Am., Local 1516, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 291, 2007-Ohio-1949, 865 N.E.2d 31, at \u00b6 19, quoting <em>Conoco, Inc. v. Oil, Chem. &amp; Atomic Workers Intenatl. Union </em>(N.D.Okla.1998), 26 F.Supp.2d 1310,1317-1318 (\u201c[I]f the parties do not expressly prohibit its use in the CBA and if they leave the term \u2018just cause\u2019 undefined, they risk the arbitrator\u2019s looking \u2018outside the CBA for guidance in defining, interpreting, and applying that phrase\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">{\u00b6 29} The Ohio Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe contractual right of the employer to discipline and discharge employees for \u2018just cause\u2019 requires the arbitrators to make two determinations in considering cases: (1) whether a cause for discipline exists and (2) whether the amount of discipline was proper under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Miami Twp., </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 271-272, 690 N.E.2d 1262, quoting <em>Schoonhoven, </em>Fairweather\u2019s Practice &amp; Procedures in Labor Arbitration (3d Ed.1991) 327. See also <em>Summit Cty., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 291, 2007-Ohio-1949, 865 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 21, citing <em>Miami Twp. </em>at 272, 690 N.E.2d 1262 (\u201c[A]n arbitrator\u2019s inquiry into whether there is \u2018good cause\u2019 is one that almost always involves two factors \u2014 whether the misconduct alleged has been proven and whether the discipline imposed for the misconduct was reasonable\u201d). By separating the \u201cjust cause\u201d inquiry into two determinations, the court recognizes that it is possible to challenge separately the actual commission of the misconduct itself and the reasonableness of the discipline imposed for misconduct. <em>Miami Twp., </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 272, 690 N.E.2d 1262, quoting <em>Schoonhoven </em>at 327 (\u201c \u2018[F]or as frequently as not,\u2019 explained the court, \u2018the reasonableness of the penalty (as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>actual commission of the misconduct itself) is questioned or challenged in arbitration\u2019 \u201d). In most cases, the second determination is the issue \u2014 the misconduct is clear, and the issue is the severity of the discipline imposed. Here, conversely, the first determination is the issue: the arbitrator found that the department had failed to prove that Marrs committed the misconduct on which it based its decision to discipline. The issue is not the department\u2019s evidence per se \u2014 not its quality or quantity \u2014 but the procedural question of what quantum of proof the arbitrator should have used to determine whether \u201ccause\u201d existed. This issue is at the heart of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The quantum of proof</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 30} The arbitrator\u2019s award is grounded on his conclusion that the department failed to prove with \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that Marrs did anything that warrants discipline. The department claims that this is the wrong quantum of proof, that Article 11 of the agreement requires the arbitrator to use a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard. In Article 11, the parties agreed simply, \u201cWhere not covered by the Agreement, and where not displaced by this Agreement, all applicable laws and provisions, state, local and federal shall apply.\u201d Because the quantum of proof is not covered by the agreement, argues the department, the arbitrator should have looked to public law. If he had, he would have found that under Ohio civil service law, in labor and employment disputes before administrative agencies, the quantum of proof is preponderance of the evidence. The arbitrator also would have found that in the vast majority of civil court cases, the quantum of proof used is preponderance of the evidence. Therefore, the department contends, by using a heightened standard, the arbitrator exceeded his powers by failing to interpret and apply the agreement. We reject the department\u2019s contention and argument based on Ohio civil service law, state and federal case law, and the parties\u2019 agreement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 31} It is not clear whether under the civil service law, a procedural issue like the quantum of proof implicates Article 11. Chapter 4117 of the Revised Code governs collective bargaining in the public sector generally. See <em>Dayton, </em>2000 WL 706829. Section 4117.10 specifically governs the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, and the department says in its brief that Article 11 intentionally reflects paragraph (A) of this section. The first sentence of this paragraph says, \u201cAn agreement between a public employer and an exclusive representative entered into pursuant to this chapter governs the wage, hours, and terms and conditions of public employment covered by the agreement.\u201d And the third sentence says, \u201cWhere no agreement exists or where an agreement makes no specification about a matter, the public employer and public employees are subject to all applicable state or local laws or ordinances pertaining to the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment for public employees.\u201d We note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>in particular the part of the statute that says that laws \u201cpertaining to\u201d wages, hours, and the terms and conditions of employment apply when an agreement is silent. A strong argument can be made that procedural matters, like what quantum of proof applies at an arbitration, fall outside these three categories.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 32} We observe too that the idea of the arbitrator alone having the power to set the quantum of proof finds strong support in the case law. The Ohio Supreme Court, federal circuit courts, and the United States Supreme Court agree that absent express language in an agreement, procedural issues are decided by the arbitrator. The Ohio Supreme Court says that the arbitrator has the inherent power to decide the question of proof: in determining whether \u201cjust cause\u201d exists for discipline, and \u201c \u2018 \u201c[i]n the absence of contract language expressly prohibiting the exercise of such power, the arbitrator, by virtue of his authority and duty to fairly and finally settle and adjust (decide) the dispute before him, has the inherent power to determine the sufficiency of the cause and the reasonableness of the penalty imposed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Miami Twp., </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 272, 690 N.E.2d 1262, quoting <em>Schoonhoven </em>at 327, quoting <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>(1962) 63-1 Labor Arbitration Awards, \u00b6 8027 at 3090. Federal appellate courts say the same. See, e.g., <em>Keebler Co. v. Truck Drivers, Local 170 </em>(C.A.1, 2001), 247 F.3d 8 (finding no problem with an arbitrator\u2019s use of a clear-and-convincing standard, saying that when an arbitration agreement is silent on the quantum of proof, the arbitrator may set his own rules of procedure); <em>Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen of N. Am., Dist. Local No. 540 v. Neuhoff Bros. Packers, Inc. </em>(C.A.5, 1973), 481 F.2d 817, 819-820 (noting that the agreement did not define a standard of proof, and \u201cit was not impermissible for the arbitrator, as a basic part of his decisional process, to establish what he considered an appropriate standard\u201d); <em>Gen. Drivers, Helpers &amp; Truck Terminal Emps., Local No. 120 v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(C.A.8, 1976), 535 F.2d 1072, 1076 (stating that \u201c[bjecause collective bargaining agreements are generally silent on procedural matters such as rules of evidence an arbitration panel must be vested with the inherent authority to make procedural rulings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 33} Finally, the United States Supreme Court has said that procedural questions are for the arbitrator, not the court. See <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston </em>(1964), 376 U.S. 543, 557, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898. The court applied this rule to evidentiary matters in <em>United Paperworkers Internatl. Union v. Misco, Inc. </em>(1987), 484 U.S. 29, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286. There, the arbitrator found no just cause for discharge because the employer had failed to prove misconduct, so he ordered the employer to reinstate the employee. The employer appealed on the grounds that the arbitrator should have accepted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>strong evidence of misconduct that it discovered after it made the decision to terminate, which the arbitrator had refused to consider because the employer did not rely on the evidence when it made its decision. The Supreme Court said that evidentiary decisions made by an arbitrator are generally not grounds to vacate. The arbitrator, said the court, was interpreting and applying the agreement when he refused to accept the proffered evidence. \u201c[W]hen the subject matter of a dispute is arbitrable, \u2018procedural\u2019 questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are to be left to the arbitrator.\u201d Id. at 40, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 34} Resolution of the issue under Ohio civil service law and the case law is here unnecessary. Our point is that the arbitrator may, or may not, have gotten the law wrong, that he may, or may not, have misinterpreted the agreement, that he merely erred in <em>executing </em>his powers. The department fails to show, however, that the arbitrator <em>exceeded </em>his powers. As we said above, reviewing courts are deaf to claims of legal error, which is not grounds for vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 35} The law thus provides for the arbitrator\u2019s action a foundation significantly more solid than sand. But it is the parties\u2019 agreement itself that makes the foundation approach the solidity of rock. What is perhaps the main reason for why we reject the department\u2019s contention and argument is this: the department gave the arbitrator the power to set the quantum of proof by agreeing to arbitrate under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) using its rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 36} Article 7, Section 3, of the agreement says that if the parties cannot resolve a grievance otherwise, \u201c[e]ither the City or the Union may then request the appointment of an arbitrator by the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its rules.\u201d According to Rule 1 of the AAA\u2019s Employment Arbitration Rules, \u201c[t]he parties shall be deemed to have made these rules a part of their arbitration agreement whenever they have provided for arbitration by the [AAA] or under its Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures or for arbitration by the AAA of an employment dispute without specifying particular rules.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 8 (arguably) gave the arbitrator the power to choose the quantum of proof (and makes it puzzling why this issue is before us): \u201cAt the Arbitration Management Conference the matters to be considered shall include, without limitation * * * d. the law, standards, rules of evidence, and burdens of proof that are to apply to the proceeding.\u201d Id. \u201cThe arbitrator,\u201d Rule 8 concludes, \u201cshall issue oral or written orders reflecting <em>his or her decisions </em>on the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>matters * * Id. (Emphasis added). The agreement, then, does address the quantum of proof, so Article 11 was not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Award is not arbitrary or capricious</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 37} An arbitrator\u2019s award also fails to derive its essence from an agreement if it is unlawful, arbitrary, or capricious. The award is arbitrary or capricious if the arbitrator\u2019s attitude in fashioning the award was arbitrary or capricious. <em>Huber Hts., </em>1995 WL 51091. We find no evidence that the arbitrator\u2019s attitude was arbitrary or capricious. With respect to the award\u2019s legality, the reinstatement of an employee, discharged though he did nothing wrong, violates no enacted law. The department, however, contends that Marrs\u2019s reinstatement is unlawful because it violates Ohio public policy. We will consider this contention in our review of the fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 38} The first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 39} The fifth assignment of error reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cThe trial court erred in concluding the arbitrator\u2019s ruling violated public policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">{\u00b6 41} The Ohio Supreme Court has said that \u201cvacating an arbitration award pursuant to public policy is a narrow exception to the \u2018hands off policy that courts employ in reviewing arbitration awards.\u201d <em>Southwest Ohio, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 112, 742 N.E.2d 630, citing <em>United Paperworkers Internatl. Union, </em>484 U.S. at 43, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286. We have said that \u201c[a] court may refuse to enforce an arbitration award when specific terms in the contract would violate public policy.\u201d <em>Dayton, </em>2005-Ohio-6392, 2005 WL 3240794, at \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Lawrence Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. L. Robert Kimball &amp; Assoc. </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 860 F.2d 683, 686. \u201c[B]ut,\u201d we have emphasized, \u201cthere is no broad power to set aside an arbitration award as against public policy.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">{\u00b6 42} The issue in this claim is not whether the alleged misconduct violates some public policy, but whether the arbitrator\u2019s award does. See id.; see also <em>Southwest Ohio, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 112, 742 N.E.2d 630, citing <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local 759, Internatl. Union of Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of Am. </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 76 L.Ed.2d 298. We concluded above that the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Marrs committed no misconduct is valid and binding. An award reinstating an employee who has done nothing wrong does not violate Ohio public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">{\u00b6 43} The fifth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">{\u00b6 44} The sixth assignment of error reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant by not awarding interest on all monies due and payable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 46} Presumably because it vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award, the trial court did not address the union\u2019s request for prejudgment interest under R.C. 1343.03.
