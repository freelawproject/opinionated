Cannon, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Daniel O. Goddard, appeals the judgment entered by the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by appellees, Paul and Josephine Stabile.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">{\u00b6 2} The Stabiles owned a home in Niles, Ohio. In May 2007, the Stabiles sold the residence to Goddard. As part of the sale, Paul Stabile completed a residential-property disclosure form. In response to the question \u201cDo you know of any previous or current water leakage, water accumulation, excess moisture or other defects in the property, including but not limited to any area below grade, basement or crawl space?\u201d Paul Stabile marked the box designated yes. Then, Paul Stabile provided the handwritten explanation \u201csmall dampness \u2014 does not flood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">{\u00b6 3} Paul Stabile answered no to the question \u201cDo you know of any water or moisture related damage to the floors, walls or ceilings as a result of flooding; moisture seepage; moisture condensation; ice damage; sewer overflow/backup; or leaking pipes, plumbing fixtures, or appliances?\u201d He also answered no to the question \u201cDo you know of any movement, shifting, deterioration, material cracks/settling (other than visible minor cracks or blemishes) or other material problems with the foundation, basement/crawl space, floors, or interior/exterior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>walls?\u201d Finally, no response was given to a question about other known material defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">{\u00b6 4} Goddard personally viewed the Stabiles\u2019 home three or four times prior to purchasing it. He was shown the home by Harry Pissini, a licensed real estate agent. Pissini reviewed the completed residential-property disclosure form with Goddard. Pissini specifically alerted Goddard that the Stabiles had indicated there was water intrusion in the basement. He advised Goddard to have this problem investigated. Despite Pissini\u2019s recommendation, Goddard did not have a professional inspection performed on the home prior to purchasing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 5} The parties executed a real estate purchase contract. In the contract, Goddard initialed the clause regarding a home inspection, indicating he was waiving his right to have a professional inspection. In addition, the contract contained an \u201cas is\u201d clause, which stated that Goddard was accepting the property in its current condition without any additional obligation from the Stabiles for repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 6} After purchasing the property, Goddard discovered problems with water intrusion in the basement. He hired a basement waterproofing company to repair the basement. These repairs included installing a pressure-relief system, installing a J-channel system, and sealing cracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 7} In September 2007, Goddard commenced the instant action by filing a complaint against the Stabiles. The complaint alleged that the Stabiles committed fraud in the sale of the property. Specifically, Goddard alleged that the Stabiles failed to disclose and concealed certain defects. The Stabiles answered Goddard\u2019s complaint, denying the substantive allegations set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 8} In August 2008, with leave of court, Goddard filed an amended complaint, asserting the additional count of mutual mistake of fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a remedy for this claim, Goddard sought, in the alternative to damages, rescission of the contract. In his motion for leave to file his amended complaint, Goddard explained that there were problems with the porch of the residence, which were only recently discovered. He attached a copy of a proposal for work to be done to repair the porch. The Stabiles filed an answer to the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">{\u00b6 9} On June 4, 2008, the trial court referred this matter to a magistrate. That same date, the trial court issued a judgment entry, that provided, \u201cPT held. Def. to file MSJ by 9/15/08; Plaintiff to respond by 10/15/08; MSJ memos only 10/24/08. Case referred to Mag. Earnhart.\u201d On September 8, 2008, the Stabiles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>filed a motion to extend the dates for filing the dispositive motions, due to the fact that Goddard had filed an amended complaint. On September 10, 2008, the trial court granted the Stabiles\u2019 motion and held, \u201cDispositive motions to be filed by 10/15/08. Responses to be filed by 11/14/08. Memo MSJ reset to 11/21/08.\u201d Thereafter, on September 15, 2008, Magistrate Earnhart filed a \u201cjudgment entry\u201d extending the dispositive motion date to October 15, 2008, and stating that \u201cthe Court will reset the response date and the hearing on Motion and the Trial.\u201d No further orders or judgment entries were filed by the magistrate or the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 10} On October 15, 2008, the Stabiles filed a motion for summary judgment. The Stabiles attached several exhibits to their motion for summary judgment, including Josephine Stabile\u2019s affidavit, a copy of the residential-property disclosure form, Harry Pissini\u2019s affidavit, a portion of the transcript of Goddard\u2019s deposition; and the land sale contract. On November 21, 2008, at 10:53 a.m., Goddard filed a brief in opposition to the Stabiles\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Goddard also attached exhibits to his brief, including his affidavit and an affidavit from Ron Jackson, the foreman of the crew of the basement-waterproofing company that had repaired the basement. Also on November 21, 2008, the trial court issued a judgment entry granting the Stabiles\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s judgment entry states, \u201c[Goddard] did not respond to the Motion.\u201d While the trial court\u2019s judgment entry is stamped November 21, 2008, the stamp does not contain a specific time it was filed. Accordingly, based on the current record before this court, we cannot conclusively determine whether Goddard\u2019s brief in opposition was filed before or after the trial court\u2019s judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 11} As the result of a clerical error, copies of the trial court\u2019s final judgment entry were sent to the wrong attorneys. When this error was discovered, the trial court issued a judgment entry acknowledging the error and resetting the timeline for filing a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 12} Since Goddard has filed his notice of appeal within 30 days of the trial court\u2019s reset timeline, we will consider it timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">{\u00b6 13} Goddard raises the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment constitutes reversible error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">{\u00b6 15} In order for a motion for summary judgment to be granted, the moving party must demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201c(1) [N]o genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made.\u201d <em>Mootispaw v. Eckstein </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 383, 385, 667 N.E.2d 1197.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 17} Summary judgment will be granted if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of facts, if any, * * * show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C). Material facts are those that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law of the case. <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 337, 340, 617 N.E.2d 1123, quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 248,106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 18} If the moving party meets this burden, the nonmoving party must then provide evidence illustrating a genuine issue of material fact, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(E). <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Civ.R. 56(E) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party\u2019s pleadings, but the party\u2019s response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 20} Summary judgment is appropriate pursuant to Civ.R. 56(E), if the nonmoving party does not meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">{\u00b6 21} Appellate courts review a trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153. <em>\u201cDe novo </em>review means that this court uses the same standard that the trial court should have used, and we examine the evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Cleveland Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 383, 701 N.E.2d 1023, citing <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 119-120, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">{\u00b6 22} Initially, we will address the fact that the trial court did not consider Goddard\u2019s brief in opposition to the Stabiles\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Pursuant to the trial court\u2019s initial judgment entry concerning the timeline for this case, Goddard\u2019s brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment was due on October 15, 2008. This date was extended by the trial court to November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>14, 2008. Subsequent to the trial court\u2019s entry, the magistrate issued an entry on the timeline, which provided the same due date for the Stabiles\u2019 motion for summary judgment, but provided that \u201cthe Court will reset the response date and the hearing on Motion and the Trial.\u201d No further direction was given by the magistrate or the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 23} Thus, Goddard was informed by the trial court that his brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment was due on November 14, 2008. However, on a later date, he was informed by the magistrate that the court intended to \u201creset\u201d the due date for his brief in opposition. It appears that this confusion may have occurred as a result of the trial court\u2019s and magistrate\u2019s both independently ruling on the Stabiles\u2019 motion to extend the respective due dates of the various documents. The better practice would have been for Goddard to ask the trial court to clarify the actual due date. Civ.R. 56(C) is clear that the \u201cadverse party, prior to the day of hearing, may serve and file opposing affidavits.\u201d Goddard has not assigned any error for the trial court\u2019s failure to consider his response to the motion. However, in light of the fact that there was confusion regarding the hearing date and the due date of Goddard\u2019s brief in opposition, and based on our de novo review, we will consider Goddard\u2019s brief in opposition to the Stabiles\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 24} Goddard advanced claims of fraudulent concealment, fraudulent nondisclosure, and fraudulent misrepresentation. In his amended complaint, Goddard claimed he experienced \u201csevere problems related to the undisclosed defects,\u201d which required \u201cextensive repair.\u201d Although not specifically mentioned in the amended complaint, Goddard\u2019s claims apparently relate to the basement and porch of the home. We will initially address Goddard\u2019s claims relating to the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>precludes recovery in an action by the purchaser for a structural defect in real estate where (1) the condition complained of is open to observation or discoverable upon reasonable inspection, (2) the purchaser had the unimpeded opportunity to examine the premises, and (3) there is no fraud on the part of the vendor.\u201d <em>Layman v. Binns </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 176, 519 N.E.2d 642, syllabus. The term caveat emptor has traditionally meant \u201c \u2018let the buyer beware.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waleszewski v. Angstadt, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-L-113, 2004-Ohio-335, 2004 WL 144243, at \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Layman v. Binns, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 177, 519 N.E.2d 642. \u201c \u2018The doctrine of caveat emptor is designed to finalize real estate transactions by preventing disappointed real estate buyers from litigating every imperfection existing in residential property.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Thaler v. Zovko, </em>11th Dist. No. 2008-L-091, 2008-Ohio-6881, 2008 WL 5389607, at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>{\u00b6 26} In Jackson\u2019s affidavit, he states that he discovered various problems related to water intrusion in the basement upon arriving at the site and during the course of his work. He does not state that the problems were concealed. He further states that the problems \u201cprobably took a number of years\u201d to develop. This evidence suggests that these problems were open to observation when Goddard inspected the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 27} We note that Goddard did not have a professional home inspection of the property performed, despite the Stabiles\u2019 disclosure that there was water intrusion and the specific recommendations of Pissini.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 28} In this matter, the real estate contract contained an \u201cas is\u201d clause. \u201c \u2018(W)hen a buyer agrees to accept property \u201cas is,\u201d the seller is relieved of any duty to disclose latent defects.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Thaler v. Zovko, </em>2008-Ohio-6881, 2008 WL 5389607, at \u00b6 37, quoting <em>Durica v. Donaldson </em>(Mar. 3, 2000), 11th Dist. No. 97-T-0183, 2000 WL 263785. Accordingly, as a matter of law, Goddard\u2019s claims of nondisclosure are barred by the \u201cas is\u201d clause. <em>Kimball v. Duy, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-L-046, 2002-Ohio-7279, 2002 WL 31886713, at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 29} However, an \u201cas is\u201d clause does not preclude causes of action for fraudulent representation or fraudulent concealment. <em>Waleszewski v. Angstadt, </em>2004-Ohio-335, 2004 WL 144243, at \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Felker v. Schwenke </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 427, 430-431, 717 N.E.2d 1165. (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe elements which constitute the basis for a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation are: \u2018(1) a representation, or where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact, (2) which is material to the transaction at hand, (3) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred, (4) with the intent of misleading another into relying on it, (5) justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment, and (6) a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance.\u2019\u201d <em>Kimball v. Duy, </em>2002-Ohio-7279, 2002 WL 31886713, at \u00b623, quoting <em>Cardi v. Gump </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 16, 22, 698 N.E.2d 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 31} First, we note that the Stabiles disclosed the fact there was water intrusion in the basement. In describing the problem, the Stabiles stated \u201csmall dampness \u2014 does not flood.\u201d We recognize there is a vast spectrum of water infiltration between the levels of \u201csmall dampness\u201d and \u201cflooding.\u201d However, it is significant to note that Pissini, a real estate professional, was concerned about this disclosure and specifically advised Goddard to have the matter examined. Despite this warning, Goddard waived his right to have a professional inspection of the residence. Irrespective of Goddard\u2019s inaction, the fact that the disclosure alerted a licensed real estate professional that there could be additional problems with the basement demonstrates that the Stabiles\u2019 disclosure was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>made with the intent of misleading Goddard. Moreover, the fact that Goddard was informed by Pissini to have the matter inspected prohibits a finding that Goddard was justified in his reliance on the Stabiles\u2019 disclosure regarding the specific amount of water intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cTo prevail on a claim of fraudulent concealment, the injured party must establish: (1) actual concealment of a material fact; (2) with knowledge of the fact concealed; (3) and intent to mislead another into relying upon such conduct; (4) followed by actual reliance thereon by such other person having the right to so rely; (5) and with injury resulting to such person because of such reliance.\u201d <em>Chamar v. Schivitz, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-L-181, 2004-Ohio-1957, 2004 WL 834487, at \u00b6 13, citing <em>Bagdasarian v. Lewis </em>(June 4, 1993), 11th Dist. No. 92-L-171, 1993 WL 419081.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 33} Goddard asserts that the Stabiles concealed the defects in the basement by caulking and painting certain areas of the basement. However, we again note that the Stabiles <em>admitted </em>that there was water intrusion in the basement. Accordingly, there was no intent to mislead Goddard regarding this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">{\u00b6 34} At first impression, the case sub judice appears to be analogous to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Waleszewski v. Angstadt, </em>2004-Ohio-335, 2004 WL 144243. In <em>Waleszewski, </em>this court held that there was a genuine issue of material fact on the plaintiffs fraudulent-concealment claim concerning a wet basement. Id. at \u00b6 12-24. However, <em>Waleszewski </em>is distinguishable from the instant matter on two important points. First, in <em>Waleszewski, </em>the seller specifically assured the buyers that there were no \u201cproblems with water seepage.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 21. In this matter, the Stabiles did not deny water-seepage issues; instead, they disclosed the water-intrusion problem on the residential-property disclosure form. Second, in <em>Waleszewski, </em>the condition of the basement was dry when the buyer\u2019s professional home inspector conducted the inspection. Id. In the case sub judice, Goddard refused his option to have the home professionally inspected and agreed to accept the property \u201cas is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">{\u00b6 35} Goddard claims that some of the water damage was hidden due to the placement of furniture in the basement. However, in his deposition, he acknowledged that he did not attempt to move the furniture. Nor does the record indicate that he asked for the furniture to be moved so he would have unimpeded access to those areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">{\u00b6 36} In relation to Goddard\u2019s claims regarding the basement, the Stabiles disclosed that there was water intrusion; Goddard was advised to have the condition inspected; and despite this recommendation, Goddard did not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>professional inspection performed. Accordingly, there are no genuine issues of material fact relating to the claims associated with the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 37} Next, we address Goddard\u2019s claims regarding the porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 38} We note that the amended complaint did not mention any defects in the porch. \u201cWhen a complaint is based upon fraud, \u2018the circumstances constituting fraud * * * shall be stated with particularity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kimball v. Duy, </em>2002-Ohio-7279, 2002 WL 31886713, at \u00b6 18, quoting Civ.R. 9(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 39} In addition to this procedural deficiency, Goddard\u2019s claims regarding the porch fail on their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 40} In his affidavit, Goddard states, \u201cThe defects to the porch had been concealed by the Defendants having a new pad poured to cover the old cracked pad.\u201d Goddard has not submitted any evidence to demonstrate this practice is against the industry standard or otherwise unacceptable. Thus, there is no evidence that the condition of the pad was a \u201cmaterial defect,\u201d which required disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 41} The only other material in the record relating to the porch is a proposal to fix the porch, which was attached to Goddard\u2019s motion for leave to file his amended complaint. We note that this proposal was not properly before the trial court for the purpose of a summary-judgment determination, since it was not the type of evidentiary material specifically listed in Civ.R. 56(C), nor was it accompanied by an affidavit laying the proper foundation for its consideration. See <em>Diakakis v. W. Res. Veterinary Hosp., </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-T-0151, 2006-Ohio-201, 2006 WL 156732, at \u00b6 20-22. However, even if this material was considered despite its evidentiary infirmity, it would not demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">{\u00b6 42} Goddard has not pointed to specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact on his claims of fraudulent concealment or fraudulent misrepresentation in relation to the porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">{\u00b6 43} Goddard advanced a claim of mutual mistake in his amended complaint, wherein he sought the alternative remedy of rescission. In some circumstances, mutual mistake may be a ground for rescission of a contract. See <em>Reilley v. Richards </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 352, 632 N.E.2d 507. However, in this matter, Goddard received a residential-property disclosure form. Accordingly, \u201crescission is not an available remedy.\u201d <em>Chamar v. Schivitz, </em>2004-Ohio-1957, 2004 WL 834487, at \u00b6 18-20, quoting R.C. 5302.30(K)(3)(d) and <em>Wilson v. Safarek </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 622, 625, 723 N.E.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>{\u00b6 44} There were no genuine issues of material fact, and the Stabiles were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Thus, the trial court did not err in granting the Stabiles\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">{\u00b6 45} Goddard\u2019s assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b646} The judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-7\">Trapp, P.J., and Rice, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\">.
