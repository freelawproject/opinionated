Milburn V, individually and as the administrator of the estate of Ashley Nicole Milburn, appeals from the summary judgment rendered by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, which dismissed appellant\u2019s claims against defendant-appellee, Allstate Insurance Company Property and Casualty.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">{\u00b6 2} The tragic facts giving rise to appellant\u2019s claims are undisputed. On October 29, 2005, appellant\u2019s daughter, Ashley, was killed while riding as a passenger in a 1997 Honda Civic that her grandfather, John W. Milburn Jr. (\u201cJohn Jr.\u201d), owned and that he had furnished for Ashley\u2019s full-time use. Ashley and her 14-year-old boyfriend, Timothy Shanks, had been out driving around with Ashley\u2019s friends, who were driving a second vehicle. The group had no specific destination at first, but eventually they drove down Agler Road toward Shanks\u2019s house with the ultimate goal of taking Shanks home.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>{\u00b6 3} At some point Shanks asked Ashley if he could drive the Civic. Ashley assented, despite the fact that Shanks did not have a valid driver\u2019s license. According to Shanks, he was driving that night for no reason other than he wanted to drive. Shanks drove down Agler Road, following Ashley\u2019s friend Erin. When Erin slowed down, Shanks believed that Erin was going to make a right turn, so he moved into the center turn lane in order to pass her. However, Erin did not turn right and sped up. From the passenger seat, Ashley yelled at Shanks to get back over into the through lane. According to Shanks, when he failed to do so immediately, Ashley grabbed the steering wheel and pulled it to the right. Shanks lost control of the vehicle and struck two trees and a concrete barrier, killing Ashley.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">{\u00b6 4} At the time of her death, Ashley was residing with her parents and grandparents in the same home in New Albany, Ohio. Ashley\u2019s parents held an Allstate automobile insurance policy under which the Civic was listed as a covered vehicle. The coverage for the Civic specified bodily-injury liability limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence, and uninsured/underinsuredmotorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) limits in the same amounts. Appellant and his wife testified that while they had never explicitly forbidden Ashley to allow anyone else to drive the Civic, they always felt that such a prohibition was understood. John Jr. held a separate Allstate policy with liability limits of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence and UM/UIM limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. The Civic was not listed as a covered vehicle on John Jr.\u2019s policy. John Jr. had specifically forbidden Ashley to allow anyone else to drive the Civic.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">{\u00b6 5} Shanks\u2019s mother, Jill, had an automobile insurance policy with Farmers Insurance Columbus, Inc., with liability limits of $30,000. Farmers extended coverage to Shanks for his liability and offered appellant the limits of its policy, which appellant accepted. Appellee denied coverage under both appellant\u2019s and John Jr.\u2019s policies, after which appellant instituted this action for declaratory judgment. On November 19, 2008, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed appellant\u2019s claims. This appeal followed, in which appellant advances three assignments of error for our review, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">I. The trial court committed reversible error when it granted summary judgment in favor of respondent/appellee Allstate Insurance Company Property and Casualty in denying the extension of liability coverage to Timothy Shanks, Jr., under policy number 926554443.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">II. The trial court committed reversible error when it granted summary judgment in favor of respondent/appellee Allstate Insurance Company Property and Casualty in denying underinsured motorists benefits under policy number 926554443.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>III. The trial court committed reversible error when it granted summary judgment in favor of respondent/appellee Allstate Insurance Company Property and Casualty in denying underinsured motorists benefits under policy number 026848319.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">{\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to appellant\u2019s claim that Shanks was an \u201cinsured person\u201d under the liability section of appellant\u2019s policy, thereby providing liability coverage to Shanks for the accident that killed Ashley. The trial court determined that Shanks was not an \u201cinsured person\u201d under the language of the liability section of appellant\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">{\u00b6 7} The liability section of appellant\u2019s policy defines \u201cinsured person\u201d as, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">1. While operating your insured auto:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">a. you,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">b. any resident relative,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-9\">c. any other person operating it with your permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">{\u00b6 8} The liability section also provides that \u201cAllstate will not pay for any damages an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: * * * 8. bodily injury to any person related to an insured person by blood, marriage, or adoption and residing in that person\u2019s household.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) This is known as an intrafamily exclusion. The trial court determined that under this exclusion Shanks is not covered for Ashley\u2019s injuries, because Ashley is related to insured persons (her parents) and she resided in their household. The court refused to read the term \u201cinsured person\u201d to mean only the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the accident (here, Shanks) because, it explained, \u201cthe policy exclusion reads: \u2018an\u2019 insured person; and, the effect of \u2018an\u2019 encompasses three different types of Insured Persons: one being \u2018you,\u2019 another being a \u2018your resident relative,\u2019 and a third being the one Plaintiff advocates: Timothy Shanks * * *. Thus, Ashley\u2019s relation and residence with the first two precludes coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant argues, as he did below, that because the term \u201cinsured person\u201d is defined in reference to being engaged in \u201coperating your insured auto,\u201d neither he nor any of his resident relatives can be treated as an insured person because none of them were operating the Civic at the time of the accident. Thus, he contends, the intrafamily exclusion does not apply to preclude liability coverage for Ashley\u2019s injuries. In response, appellee argues that \u201caccording to the plain language of the policy, the exclusion applies to <em>any </em>insured, not just the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>one person who may fit the definition of insured with respect to the particular accident that caused the injury.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">{\u00b6 10} We reject appellee\u2019s argument and hold that the exclusion does not apply. We acknowledge that the trial court was correct in observing that the use of the word \u201can\u201d preceding the term \u201cinsured person\u201d necessarily includes all three possible definitions of \u201cinsured person\u201d (that is, \u201ca. you, b. any resident relative, c. any other person operating it with your permission\u201d). However, no matter which of these three types of persons one uses to determine whether any person is an insured person, the fact remains that each is subject to the introductory qualifying phrase \u201cWhile operating your insured auto\u201d and thus can be an insured person for purposes of liability coverage only \u201cwhile operating your insured auto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">{\u00b6 11} Thus, to determine whether any particular person is an insured person for purposes of the intrafamily exclusion, one must first determine whether that person was, at the time of the accident, \u201coperating your insured auto.\u201d To do otherwise would be to ignore express and unambiguous language in the policy. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in applying the intrafamily exclusion to exclude liability coverage for Ashley\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, for the reasons that follow, we hold that other policy language precludes coverage because under that language and the undisputed facts of the case, Shanks is not an insured person entitled to coverage for his liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant argues that Shanks is an insured person and is therefore covered under the liability section of appellant\u2019s policy for Ashley\u2019s injuries because he was operating the Civic and was \u201cany other person operating it with your permission.\u201d See \u00b6 7, supra. The policy defines the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to mean the policyholder named in the policy declarations (here, appellant and his wife). Therefore, the parties agree that under this language, Shanks is an insured person if, at the time of the accident, he was operating the Civic with permission of appellant or his wife.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Appellant argues, as he did below, that because Ashley did not need to ask permission to drive the Civic on the day in question, she steps into the policyholders\u2019 shoes as the \u201cyou\u201d whose permission was required, and because she gave Shanks permission to drive the Civic, Shanks was \u201coperating it with your permission.\u201d For support of this proposition, appellant cites <em>State Farm v. Doss </em>(Feb. 16, 2001), 2d Dist. No. 18487, 2001 WL 127876.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Doss, </em>the driver, who was the sole occupant of a vehicle titled in his girlfriend\u2019s name but insured under the girlfriend\u2019s father\u2019s automobile insurance policy, damaged the vehicle in a one-car accident. Though his girlfriend had not given Doss explicit permission to drive the vehicle on the date of the accident, she had given him permission to drive it one day earlier and had asked him to return it, which is what he was doing when the accident occurred. The issue on appeal was whether Doss had the requisite permission to drive the vehicle. (Unfortunately, the precise policy language was never made a part of the record in <em>Doss, </em>as the court in that case repeatedly noted.) The court of appeals affirmed judgment in favor of Doss on the insurer\u2019s subrogation claim against him. Distinguishing the case from others in which the alleged \u201cfirst permittee\u201d was not the titled owner of the vehicle, the <em>Doss </em>court explained that because Doss\u2019s girlfriend was the titled owner of the vehicle, she did not need the permission of the policyholder (her father) in order to drive the vehicle. Thus, the court concluded, Doss \u2014 not his girlfriend \u2014 was the first permittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">{\u00b6 15} The fact that no one \u2014 including the Second Appellate District \u2014 knows the precise policy language involved in <em>Doss </em>substantially reduces the persuasive value of that case. Moreover, <em>Doss </em>is easily distinguishable from the instant case. Here, Ashley was not the titled owner of the vehicle, like Doss\u2019s girlfriend was, nor was she the policyholder. Therefore, though John Jr. furnished the Civic for Ashley\u2019s general use, she still required his permission and the permission of appellant, the policyholder, in order to use it. Thus, Ashley is the first permittee in this case \u2014 not Shanks. By the plain language of the policy at issue, Shanks was not an insured person, because he was not \u201coperating it with your [meaning appellant\u2019s or his wife\u2019s] permission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Citing <em>West v. McNamara </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 187, 50 O.O. 229, 111 N.E.2d 909, and <em>Nicholas v. State Farm Ins., </em>11th Dist. No. 2001-T-0085, 2002-Ohio-6262, 2002 WL 31545355, appellant argues that even if Ashley was the first permittee, Shanks is insured as a second permittee (that is, a permittee of the first permittee) because, by virtue of the fact that Ashley was a passenger, he was serving Ashley\u2019s purpose or benefit at the time he was driving. We reject this argument because the evidence is undisputed that Shanks was driving simply because he wanted to do so. He testified that Ashley was not impaired or unable to drive. He testified that Ashley did not ask him to drive; rather, he asked her if he could drive because he wanted to drive himself home. At the time of the accident, Shanks was not serving Ashley\u2019s purpose, benefit, or advantage. He was indulging his own desire to drive. Accordingly, Shanks is not a second permittee insured under appellant\u2019s policy. For this reason, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">{\u00b6 17} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the UIM portion of his policy covers the damages to Ashley\u2019s estate and survivors because the policy covers damages to an insured person caused by the operator of an \u201cuninsured auto.\u201d However, the trial court rejected this argument because appellant\u2019s policy plainly specifies that \u201can uninsured auto is not * * * a motor vehicle which is insured under the Automobile Liability Insurance of this policy.\u201d The trial court determined that because the Civic is listed in the \u201cVehicles Covered\u201d section of the policy\u2019s declarations page, and that page sets forth liability limits specifically covering the Civic, it is \u201cinsured under the Automobile Liability Insurance\u201d of the policy and thus it is not an uninsured auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant argues that the foregoing definition of what an uninsured auto \u201cis not\u201d does not apply because it is ambiguous. Appellant argues that this section would have been clearer had it stated that an \u201cuninsured auto\u201d is not an \u201cinsured auto,\u201d a term that is explicitly defined in the policy. He also argues that the phrase \u201cis not * * * a motor vehicle which is insured\u201d is ambiguous because its language is inconsistent with that of the liability section of the policy. The liability section of the policy refers to vehicles as \u201clisted\u201d and <em>people </em>as \u201cinsured,\u201d but does not refer to <em>vehicles </em>as \u201cinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">{\u00b6 19} But language in a contract is not ambiguous just because it could have been drafted in a clearer manner. <em>Rucker v. Davis, </em>4th Dist. No. 02CA2676, 2003-Ohio-3190, 2003 WL 21404511, \u00b6 17. A contract provision is ambiguous if it is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation. <em>Otto v. Country Mut. Ins. Co., </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-227, 2008-Ohio-1514, 2008 WL 852613, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>{\u00b6 20} In our view, the language upon which the trial court relied is not ambiguous. Because the Civic was specifically listed on the policy declarations, it is \u201cinsured\u201d under the liability coverage of the policy and thus is not \u201cuninsured.\u201d This is consistent with the language of the UM/UIM statute, R.C. 3937.18, which refers to <em>vehicles </em>having (or not having) liability coverage. The statute also provides, \u201cFor purposes of underinsured motorist coverage, an \u2018underinsured motorist\u2019 does not include the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has applicable liability coverage in the policy under which the underinsured motorist coverage is provided.\u201d This court rejected the same argument that appellant now advances in the case of <em>McDaniel v. Westfield Cos., </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-441, 2003-Ohio-6662, 2003 WL 22927474, in which nearly identical policy language was involved. For all of the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">{\u00b6 21} In his third assignment of error, appellant argues that the UIM portion of John Jr.\u2019s policy covers the damages to Ashley\u2019s estate and next of kin. The trial court rejected this argument based on the following language in John Jr.\u2019s policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">Allstate will not pay any damages an insured person * * * is legally entitled to recover because of bodily injury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">(2) while in * * * [a] motor vehicle owned by * * * you * * * which is not insured for this coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-8\">(3) while in * * * a motor vehicle which you own which is insured for this coverage under another policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">{\u00b6 22} It is undisputed that John Jr. owned the Civic, that the Civic is not listed on the declarations page of John Jr.\u2019s policy in the section entitled \u201cVehicles Covered,\u201d and that the Civic is listed as one of the \u201cVehicles Covered\u201d in another policy \u2014 appellant\u2019s. Based on these undisputed facts, the trial court determined that both exclusions to UIM coverage applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">{\u00b6 23} On appeal, appellant argues that these two exclusions are ambiguous because the phrases \u201cwhich is not insured for this coverage\u201d and \u201cwhich is insured for this coverage under another policy\u201d are susceptible of different interpretations because throughout John Jr.\u2019s policy the word \u201cinsured\u201d often refers to persons, not vehicles. Appellee argues that as a matter of fundamental grammar, the word \u201cwhich\u201d refers to things and the words \u201cwho\u201d and \u201cwhom\u201d refer to people. Thus, appellee argues, the use of \u201cwhich\u201d in the exclusions makes it clear that the word \u201cinsured\u201d refers to vehicles, not people.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">{\u00b6 24} We have rejected appellant\u2019s argument in two previous cases involving virtually identical policy language. <em>Weinsziehr v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>10th Dist. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>03AP-96, 2003-Ohio-5450, 2003 WL 22332020 (language similar to exclusion (3)); <em>Gaines v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(Apr. 30, 2002), 10th Dist. No. 01AP-947, 2002 WL 755884 (language similar to exclusion (2)). We hold that John Jr.\u2019s policy unambiguously excludes UIM coverage of damages for bodily injury to an insured while in a vehicle that John Jr. owned but that was not listed as covered under his policy, and while in a vehicle that John Jr. owned but that was listed as covered under the UM/UIM coverage in another policy. Because the undisputed facts establish that both exclusions apply, appellant\u2019s argument for coverage under the UM/UIM section of John Jr.\u2019s policy is unavailing. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">{\u00b6 25} Having overruled all of appellant\u2019s assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b845-7\">Tyack and Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">. Neither the trial court nor the parties have cited any authority for their positions, and our research has not revealed any authority on the precise issue presented here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\">. Appellant also argues on appeal that the intrafamily exclusion is against public policy and contrary to R.C. 3937.18. Because we have determined that the exclusion does not apply, we need not reach these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b841-10\">. Appellant's policy defines \u201cinsured auto\u201d as \u201cany auto or utility auto you own which is described on the Policy Declarations. This also includes: a. A replacement auto; b. An additional auto; c. A substitute auto; d. A non-owned auto; or, e. A trailer while attached to an insured auto.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) It is undisputed that neither appellant nor his wife owned the Civic. Thus, the Civic was not an auto \"you own.\u201d The Civic was not a \"replacement auto\u201d or an \"additional auto,\u201d because the policy\u2019s definitions of those terms require that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>auto be one that the policyholder owns. The Civic was also not a \u201csubstitute auto\u201d because the policy\u2019s definition of that term requires that the auto was being used only to replace an insured auto while the latter is being serviced or repaired or after it has been stolen or destroyed. The Civic was not a \"non-owned auto\u201d because the policy's definition of that term specifically excludes an auto \u201cavailable or furnished for the regular use of you or a resident relative.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) It is undisputed that the Civic was available and furnished for Ashley\u2019s regular use and that Ashley was a resident relative of appellant. For all of these reasons, the Civic does not meet the definition of \"insured auto.\u201d However, neither party has raised this issue, and we consider it waived. Thus, for our purposes, the Civic is an \u201cinsured auto\u201d and the only issue we must determine is whether the trial court correctly determined that Shanks was not operating it \"with your permission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
