(\u201cCSX\u201d), filed this appeal seeking reversal of a judgment by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in favor of appellee and cross-appellant, Timothy W. Martin. Martin filed a cross-appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">{\u00b6 2} On October 15, 2002, Martin was 37 years old and was employed by CSX as a signal maintainer, a job that involved checking and repairing signals and switches along the railroad tracks. On that date, Martin and senior signal maintainer Tim Stamper were directed by their supervisor, Chris Clark, to check a broken pole along the tracks between Sciotoville and Minford, Ohio, and to determine whether the pole could be removed. Martin had never removed a pole before, but had removed tree branches.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">{\u00b6 3} Martin and Stamper checked the broken pole and decided to attempt to remove it. Stamper used a pole stick to steady the broken pole while Martin used a chainsaw to cut pieces from the bottom of the pole. After Martin made the first cut, the pole, which was still attached to the wires running along the track, flipped over and struck Martin\u2019s helmet. A bolt used to attach a crossarm to the pole pierced Martin\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">{\u00b6 4} Martin did not want to file an injury report, so Stamper drove Martin to Stamper\u2019s home, where Stamper\u2019s wife administered first aid. Three CSX employees, including Martin\u2019s supervisor, went to Stamper\u2019s home and asked Martin whether he wanted to file an accident report. Martin declined because he was concerned that filing an accident report could have repercussions for his job. Later that day, Martin drove himself to an urgent-care center to have the shoulder wound checked and to get a tetanus shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">{\u00b6 5} Martin returned to work the following day and continued to work for CSX until June 2003, when he underwent surgery for an unrelated medical condition. Martin did not return to work after that surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Martin filed an action seeking recovery for his injuries pursuant to the Federal Employers Liability Act (\u201cFELA\u201d) in a Florida court. After CSX filed a motion to dismiss based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, Martin agreed to dismiss the action and refile the case in Ohio. Martin filed his action in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, alleging (1) negligence for failing to use reasonable care and for failing to provide a safe place to work, (2) negligence for failing to provide Martin with suitable equipment to perform work safely, (3) negligence for failing to provide sufficient manpower to perform work safely, (4) negligence for assigning Martin work for which he was not qualified, (5) negligence for assigning Martin work beyond his physical capabilities, and (6) failure of CSX to comply with FELA.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">{\u00b6 7} Ultimately, the case proceeded to a jury trial before a magistrate. The jury found in favor of Martin and awarded damages in the amount of $2,029,941. The jury further found that Martin was 30 percent contributorily negligent. Thus, the total amount of the judgment in Martin\u2019s favor was $1,420,958.70. The trial court overruled a motion by CSX seeking a setoff against the jury verdict and motions by Martin seeking to overturn the jury\u2019s finding on contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">{\u00b6 8} CSX filed an appeal, alleging six assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">[1.] The trial court erred in its August 28, 2008 final judgment and entry and its October 7, 2008 final judgment and entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">[2.] The trial court erred in denying Defendant\u2019s partial motion for directed verdict regarding future damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">[3.] The trial court erroneously excluded testimony as inadmissible hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">[4.] The trial court erred by excluding evidence of Plaintiffs receipt of various disability benefits as inadmissible collateral source evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">[5.] The trial court erred in rejecting Defendant\u2019s proposed jury instructions regarding causation and in failing to properly instruct the jury as to the correct standard of causation under the Federal Employers Liability Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">[6.] The trial court erred in denying the Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">{\u00b6 9} Martin filed a cross-appeal, alleging two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">[1.] The trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict based upon Cross-Appellant\u2019s lack of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">[2.] The trial court erred in overruling Cross-Appellant\u2019s post-trial Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-15\">{\u00b6 10} Although designated as a separate assignment of error, CSX\u2019s brief does not contain any argument regarding any alleged error in the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>final judgment entry. Consequently, we need not address that assignment of error. App.R. 12(A)(2). CSX\u2019s first assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">{\u00b6 11} In its second assignment of error, CSX argues that it should have been granted a partial directed verdict on the issue of future damages. CSX argues that none of the medical testimony Martin offered included any conclusion that the injuries Martin suffered were permanent in nature, and the issue of future damages should therefore not have been submitted to the jury for consideration. The jury\u2019s verdict included as one element of the damages a total of $950,000 for future wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">{\u00b6 12} Civ.R. 50(A)(4) provides that \u201c[w]hen a motion for a directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c \u2018[I]t is well established that the court must neither consider the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses in disposing of a directed verdict motion. * * * Thus, \u201cif there is substantial competent evidence to support the party against whom the motion is made, upon which evidence reasonable minds might reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Eastman v. Stanley Works, </em>180 Ohio App.3d 844, 2009-Ohio-634, 907 N.E.2d 768, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Estate of Cowling v. Estate of Cowling, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 276, 2006-0hio-2418, 847 N.E.2d 405, \u00b6 31, quoting <em>Strother v. Hutchinson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 282, 284-285, 21 O.O.3d 177, 423 N.E.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">{\u00b6 14} CSX argues that the evidence was insufficient for Martin to carry his burden of proving that the October 15, 2002 incident resulted in future wage loss. In order to show future wage loss in a personal-injury case, a plaintiff must demonstrate with reasonable certainty that the plaintiffs injury prevents the plaintiff from attaining his pre-injury wage. <em>Hall v. Kreider Mfg., Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-272, 2003-0hio-6661, 2003 WL 22927416. If the injury itself, independent of other factors, provides an evidentiary basis for a jury to conclude with reasonable certainty that future damages will result, no expert testimony regarding permanent impairment is necessary. Id., citing <em>Ratliff v. Colasurd </em>(Apr. 27, 1999), 10th Dist. No. 98AP-504, 1999 WL 253002. However, where an injury is subjective in nature, expert testimony is required to establish both that the injury is permanent in nature and that the injury is certain to have an adverse effect on future earning capacity. <em>Hall. </em>In FELA cases, courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>considering the appropriateness of an award for future wage loss have considered whether expert testimony that a plaintiffs injuries are permanent has been provided. <em>Martinez v. Union Pacific RR. Co. </em>(C.A.8, 1996), 82 F.3d 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">{\u00b6 15} Martin provided testimony from a number of witnesses regarding the nature of his injuries. Dr. William Zerick is a neurological surgeon who performed three surgeries on Martin\u2019s neck. Dr. Zerick testified in a video deposition that the first surgery, on April 5, 2004, was for the purpose of removing a disk from Martin\u2019s neck, between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae, that was placing pressure on a nerve, and included placement of a titanium plate and screws. The second surgery, on May 11, 2005, was in response to complaints of constant headaches and involved removal of another disk, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, and placement of another titanium plate and screws. The third surgery, on February 27, 2006, involved complaints of severe arm pain and involved the same area as the first surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">{\u00b6 16} When asked whether each of the surgeries was related to the October 15, 2002 incident, Dr. Zerick stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">A. You know, I felt \u2014 and again \u2014 you know, my \u2014 my understanding from the conversations we had was that before a pole fell on him, he really didn\u2019t have any significant complaints of neck, arm pain and that all began after this pole fell on him, so I think it\u2019s reasonable to say that the first surgery was brought about by the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">The second surgery is less clear. You know, one would \u2014 one could argue that in 2003 an MRI showed that he did not have significant disc protrusion at C67, but then in 2005 he did resulting in a second surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">So you could say, well, you know, that\u2019s just life, that\u2019s just nature, and that is what we typically see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">You could also argue that \u2014 and I don\u2019t know what the answer is. You could also argue that, gosh, he had surgery at C5-6 that I would \u2014 I\u2019m\u2014I am convinced was caused by his accident and that predisposed him to need the subsequent adjacent level surgery and, you know, we know that that is a real entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">The third surgery, when I saw him that day and to this day, I don\u2019t really understand that. And I would say that the third surgery was either because I didn\u2019t do an adequate job of decompressing his C5-6 nerve at the time of his first surgery, or, B, he, for whatever reason, developed a recurrent bone spur at that level. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. But, you know, I \u2014 that in no way is related to his accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">{\u00b6 17} As to the question of whether Martin\u2019s injuries are permanent, Dr. Zerick testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Q. Doctor, has Mr. Martin, as far as the neck is concerned, reached what you call maximum medical improvement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">Q. And for \u2014 and in layman\u2019s terms, what does maximum medical improvement or MMI mean to a doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">A. That at this point there\u2019s \u2014 you know, there\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s at some sort of plateau. There\u2019s nothing really for us to do to \u2014 you know, he\u2019s probably as good as he\u2019s going to get with respect to his neck issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">Q. Doctor, I\u2019m going to ask you some questions for your opinion. I\u2019d like for you to express your opinion in terms of a reasonable and medical probability based upon your training and experience as a neurosurgeon, your examination and treatment and sub \u2014 and subsequent surgery of Mr. Martin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">What would be your final diagnosis as far as his neck? In other words, what\u2019s his \u2014 what\u2019s the present condition of his neck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">A. He has, you know, cervical spondylosis, which is really just a fancy term for, you know, arthritic changes. He has a fuse \u2014 he is fused from C5 to C6 to C7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">Q. And that would be about \u2014 and\u2014and I guess in centimeters or inches, about what \u2014 what portion of the neck are we talking about in that fusion? A. It\u2019s about a third of his neck. It\u2019s probably about two and a half inches. Q. And with the fusion of the neck, Doctor, what does that \u2014 what does that do to the neck, a person\u2019s ability to move that portion that\u2019s fused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-12\">A. I mean, it\u2019s variable in different people. I mean, a lot of people \u2014 you know, certainly as you age, it\u2019s normal as you age to lose some element of movement of your neck as your joints become more arthritic. That\u2019s just normal aging.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-13\">But people that have undergone a one-level fusion, such as Mr. Martin did early on, some of those people can tell a difference, some can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-14\">The majority of the people that have a two-level fusion, such as Mr. Martin at this p[o]int, most of those people can tell a difference with their cervical range of motion both in the up and down and side to side motion, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-15\">Q. Doctor, this particular condition for which you have operated on Mr. Martin\u2019s neck, is that a permanent condition? In other words, is the hardware \u2014 the hardware, is it in there to stay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-16\">A. Well, the hardware is superfluous. Once \u2014 the hardware is intended to stabilize the spine until bone fusion, the biological process of bone fusion, can occur, and that has occurred with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-17\">So at this point, if we could magically, you know, remove the hardware, that\u2014 that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not doing anything at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Q. The range of motion limitations which you told us about, are those permanent restrictions as far as his range of motion of his neck is concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">Q. Doctor, Mr. Martin has \u2014 has advised you, I take it, that he worked on the railroad. In fact, he was working on the railroad when he got hurt in October 2002. Is that what you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">A. I believe so, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">Q. Would \u2014 would he be able \u2014 based on what he\u2019s told you, and I know you don\u2019t have all your charts, I mean don\u2019t have all the \u2014 maybe not all the details, but based on what he\u2019s told you, would you \u2014 would he be allowed or would it be recommended that he go back to work for the railroad or discontinue that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">A. Well, you know, it\u2019s a difficult question. And my feeling is I always want people to go back to work. I mean, I think working\u2019s important. And \u2014 and I always try to get people to go back \u2014 at least try to go back to work, you know, try to rehab them, whatever, go back to work and see if they can do it. I mean, it\u2019s a very subjective thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">With Mr. Martin, my feeling based upon \u2014 I don\u2019t really remember the conversation, although I know we had it, I basically \u2014 you know, after we talked, you know, it\u2019s very subjective. I mean, it\u2019s up \u2014 you know, I have to \u2014 I\u2014they know how they feel. They know what they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">My feeling, if you assimilate everything, my feeling is that it\u2019s unlikely that he could return to that type of work, I mean a very heavy laborious type of work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">[Q.] Is that \u2014 and that\u2019s based on the \u2014 the injury to his neck and his subsequent surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">[A.] Well, not just that. I think \u2014 you know, I think \u2014 I\u2019m sure not a shoulder specialist, but, I mean, I think he has the shoulder problem. He\u2019s had, you know, three neck surgeries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">Not to say that people with three neck surgeries don\u2019t go back to work, but I don\u2019t * * * again, it\u2019s very subjective, but I think it\u2019s unlikely that he could\u2014 it\u2019s probably not the safest thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-12\">And the next guy that goes through more than Tim might be able to go back to work and do fine. And some of it\u2019s based on, you know, him telling me things. But I think that if I had to advise, I would say I would probably tell him, and I did, I told him he should seek disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-13\">And I don\u2019t like people on disability. I mean, I\u2019d rather people try to work, but I think the right thing in this situation was to advise him not to return to work, to that type of work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-14\">Q. So, in other words, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, it would be your recommendation that he not return to the same kind of job he was doing for the railroad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>A. Yes, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">Q. Doctor, what is Mr. Martin\u2019s prognosis as far as his neck\u2019s concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">A. I don\u2019t know. I mean, he may never have another problem. He may never have another surgical procedure. I mean, you know \u2014 I mean, certainly the guy is a \u2014 he\u2019s still \u2014 you know \u2014 I mean, he may have another surgery. He may have another surgery. I can\u2019t tell you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">{\u00b6 18} Martin also offered the deposition testimony of Dr. Yousef Mohammad. Dr. Mohammad gave his opinion that Martin suffered postconcussion syndrome as a result of the October 15, 2002 incident and that this condition could interfere with his ability to work. However, Dr. Mohammad was not asked whether this condition is permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">{\u00b6 19} Dr. Kimberly Umhoefer, Martin\u2019s family physician, also testified on his behalf by way of deposition. During the reading of Dr. Umhoefer\u2019s deposition, there was a sidebar discussion regarding Dr. Umhoefer\u2019s opinion regarding the permanence of Martin\u2019s injuries. During the sidebar, counsel indicated that when asked about permanence, Dr. Umhoefer stated that it was too early to tell whether the injuries are permanent. As a result of this discussion, Dr. Umhoefer\u2019s opinion on permanence was excluded from the reading of the deposition. Therefore, the jury did not hear Dr. Umhoefer\u2019s opinion on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">{\u00b6 20} The only other medical evidence offered regarding the nature of Martin\u2019s injuries was that of Dr. Joseph Carver, a clinical psychologist. Dr. Carver gave his opinion that Martin suffers from depression at a major or severe level, and that this depression prevents Martin from gainful employment. However, Dr. Carver was not asked whether Martin\u2019s major depression is a permanent condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">{\u00b6 21} The testimony offered showed that Martin\u2019s injuries are subjective, not objective in nature. Thus, Martin was required to offer expert testimony both that the injuries he suffered on October 15, 2002, are permanent and that those injuries are certain to result in future loss of earning capacity. <em>Hall, </em>2003-Ohio-6661, 2003 WL 22927416.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">{\u00b6 22} The only medical testimony on the issue of permanency was that of Dr. Zerick, who stated that the loss of range of motion in Martin\u2019s neck is permanent. However, Dr. Zerick\u2019s opinion did not differentiate between the loss of range of motion resulting from the first surgery, which he stated was related to the October 15, 2002 incident, and the loss of range resulting from the second surgery, which he could not sufficiently relate to the incident. Instead, Dr. Zerick stated that some people who have undergone a single fusion, such as that accomplished by the first surgery, can tell a difference in their range of motion, and some cannot tell a difference, whereas \u201cmost\u201d people undergoing a double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>fusion, such as that resulting from the second surgery, can tell that some range of motion has been lost. During argument on CSX\u2019s motion for directed verdict, Martin\u2019s attorney argued that the permanency of Martin\u2019s injuries could be inferred from the testimony that Martin would permanently have the plate and screws from the fusion surgery in his neck. However, this argument was directly refuted by Dr. Zerick\u2019s testimony in response to questioning by Martin\u2019s counsel that those items were serving no purpose. No other medical testimony established that the injuries suffered as a result of the October 15, 2002 incident, including Martin\u2019s major depression, are permanent conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">{\u00b6 23} Ultimately, based on our review of the record, we believe the evidence on the issue of whether Martin\u2019s injuries are permanent in nature was not sufficient to support an instruction to the jury on future wage loss. The evidence was clear that Martin cannot return to his former employment as a signal maintainer, but the evidence was insufficient to support a claim that he is permanently prevented from working. Arguably, the fact that the jury was given an instruction on mitigation of damages directing that they consider the availability of other employment allowed the jury to consider this possibility in determining an award. However, given the lack of any testimony from the medical experts that Martin\u2019s injuries resulting from the October 15, 2002 incident are permanent, we find that the issue of future wage loss should not have been submitted to the jury at all and that CSX was entitled to a directed verdict on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, CSX\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">{\u00b6 25} In its third assignment of error, CSX argues that the trial court erred when it excluded as inadmissible hearsay a statement made by Martin\u2019s former supervisor, Chris Clark. During the testimony of Oval Osborne, a CSX employee who had checked the pole in question prior to Martin\u2019s attempt to remove it, Osborne testified that he believed it would be necessary to remove the pole using a boom truck, which is a truck equipped with a movable arm that can be used to lift heavy objects, and that he communicated this belief to Clark. CSX attempted, through Osborne, to introduce a statement made by Clark that Clark believed a boom truck could not be used because the precise location of the pole would make it impossible for the boom to reach it. Martin objected to introduction of the statement on hearsay grounds. The trial court sustained the objection and excluded the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">{\u00b6 26} The decision to admit or exclude evidence lies within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court should not disturb the trial court\u2019s evidentiary decisions in the absence of an abuse of discretion that creates material prejudice. <em>State v. Conway, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-0hio-2815, 848 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>N.E.2d 810. Thus, a reviewing court\u2019s inquiry is confined to determining whether the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or unconscionably in deciding the evidentiary issues. <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">{\u00b6 27} The trial court excluded Clark\u2019s statement on the grounds that it constituted inadmissible hearsay. Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Evid.R. 801(C). CSX argues that Clark\u2019s statement that a boom truck would not reach the pole was not hearsay, because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but was instead offered to rebut Martin\u2019s argument that CSX failed to provide him with equipment necessary for him to remove the pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">{\u00b6 28} Contrary to CSX\u2019s argument, we find that Clark\u2019s purported statement that a boom truck could not reach the broken pole was offered at least in part for the truth of the matter asserted. The statement would have served to explain why a boom truck was not used, and the truth of whether a boom truck could, in fact, have reached the pole was not relevant for that purpose. However, CSX\u2019s argument would have been bolstered if the jury believed that the boom truck would not have been useful. Thus, the truth of the matter asserted was relevant, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the purported statement on hearsay grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">{\u00b6 29} Moreover, even if the statement could have been offered only as proof of something other than the truth of the matter asserted, we find that no prejudice resulted from the statement\u2019s exclusion. Clark\u2019s deposition was read into the record at trial, and when questioned about the use of a boom truck to remove the pole in question, the following testimony was elicited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">Q. So that I summarize and make sure that I\u2019m correct, I don\u2019t want to misstate anything, Mr. Martin and Mr. Stamper go to the scene of this particular incident at mile post CJ 5.5 to remove this pole with a chain saw and the stick. In your estimation, that would be a safety violation; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">A. Without being at the location and seeing what they did, you know, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">Q. If they tried \u2014 okay. Well, then, are you able to answer the question, then, that if they had a chain saw and a fiberglass pole to remove this, to remove this pole by cutting it in sections, would you be in a position with that information to say whether or not that was a violation of the rules in the way they went about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>A. The location of where this happened if I remember it was a \u2014 a steep incline. It was \u2014 it was hard to do it safely any way. I mean, it\u2019s a bad spot. Probably if I had been there and seen them chopping it down with a chain saw, I probably would have stopped them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">Q. You would have stopped them and asked for a boom truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">A. Yeah. I would have preferred the boom truck to be there. But, you know, depending on the situation to situation, you\u2019ve just got to look at it. And whether that would have worked, you wouldn\u2019t know until you got it there. So\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">{\u00b6 30} Thus, even if Osborne had been allowed to testify that Clark said he did not believe a boom truck would work, this statement was contradicted by Clark\u2019s actual testimony, in which he indicated he did not know whether a boom truck would have been effective in removing the pole. In addition, because of Clark\u2019s testimony, CSX was able to argue that there was at least some question about whether a boom truck could have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">{\u00b6 31} Thus, CSX\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">{\u00b6 32} In its fourth assignment of error, CSX argues that the trial court erred when it excluded evidence regarding Martin\u2019s applications for disability benefits. CSX sought to introduce a form that Martin provided to State Farm, in which Martin responded in the negative to a question regarding whether he was seeking disability benefits as the result of a work-related injury. CSX also sought to introduce answers that Martin provided in an interview as part of the process of seeking disability benefits from the Railroad Retirement, in which he stated that he had passed out and hit his head on a flower pot, resulting in his recurrent headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">{\u00b6 33} CSX filed bench briefs on the issue, and the trial court considered argument by the parties prior to the start of trial. At that point, the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the documents was a preliminary ruling, but the trial court affirmed its preliminary ruling over CSX\u2019s objection during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">{\u00b6 34} The collateral-source rule has been defined as \u201c \u2018the judicial refusal to credit to the benefit of the wrongdoer money or services received in reparation of the injury caused which emanates from sources other than the wrongdoer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hutchings v. Childress, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 486, 2008-Ohio-4568, 895 N.E.2d 520, \u00b6 30, quoting <em>Pryor v. Webber </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St.2d 104,107, 52 0.0.2d 395, 263 N.E.2d 235. The United States Supreme Court has held that in FELA cases, introduction of a plaintiffs receipt of disability benefits is improper. <em>Eichel v. New York Cent. RR. Co. </em>(1963), 375 U.S. 253, 84 S.Ct. 316,11 L.Ed.2d 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">{\u00b6 35} CSX first argues that Martin\u2019s statements were not offered as evidence of the receipt of collateral benefits, but rather were offered to impeach Martin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>credibility as to his claims that his injuries were caused by the October 15, 2002 incident. CSX further argues that Martin opened the door to introduction of evidence regarding his application of disability benefits by offering evidence that he was experiencing financial hardship, the rebuttal of which is a recognized exception to the collateral-source rule. See <em>Sullivan v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1991), 947 F.2d 946. CSX pointed to testimony from Dr. Carver, Martin\u2019s treating psychologist, to references that Martin had made to financial issues during the course of his treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">{\u00b6 36} In deciding to exclude the two pieces of evidence, the trial court cited EicheVs concern with \u201cthe danger of the jury finding no liability [or] reducing a damage award when it learns that the plaintiffs loss is entirely or partially covered.\u201d The trial court further stated, with regard to the exceptions for rebuttal of a plaintiffs claims of financial hardship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">What I think is the spirit of the exceptions specifically that date do not allow a plaintiff to basically attach and wrap themselves, cloak themselves within the collateral benefit rule but then put on independent evidence that deals with issues that could be rebutted or impeached by a showing of collateral [benefits]. In other words, that type of protection in certain instances when it\u2019s used as a sword, although, they don\u2019t use the word sword, they use the word springboard, which the plaintiff can go forward with affirmative evidence, and then a boundary of silence exists where the defendant is deprived of the ability to respond to that type of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">The examples that we see in the case law deal with issues such as malingering. They deal with issues of the fiscal status of the plaintiff or aversions by a plaintiff that they\u2019re destitute when, in fact, benefits are being received. So they do allow from an exception and they do allow for impeachment with evidence of collateral benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">But, again, I think we don\u2019t want the exceptions necessarily to swallow the rule. And I think they\u2019re carefully defined as instances where the plaintiff has disadvantaged or deprived the defendant of the ability to respond to direct evidence that they have submitted. In this instance, we deal with an element of causation, which is fundamental in these types of cases. So, certainly, it\u2019s an important area. And the defendant is essentially stating that because there is that aspect of plaintiffs case in chief they should be allowed to respond with that type of evidence. But the way that I see it there\u2019s going to be a causation issue in most any of these cases. I don\u2019t think that is something that qualifies under these carefully defined exceptions. I do think that the case authority states that I\u2019m to engage and it\u2019s appropriate for me to engage in Rules of Evidence 403(B) type of balancing. And that traditionally allows me to decide the probative value of that type of evidence as to be weighed with the potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>for prejudice or confusion or some type of difficulty in understanding how these issues go together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">And I think, you know, despite the fact that we\u2019re just dealing with an application, which, again, several of the cases, including the first case that I discussed, do distinguish that as separate. I think we still have to engage in that balancing. * * * The risk of prejudice is small because the jury is only receiving a very limited amount of information, and then a cautionary or curative instruction can be allowed. But I agree with Mr. Hollon that it would be inappropriate simply to allow those documents on their face, the single document, the State Farm application, I should say, and then the interview. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s contained in a questionnaire or if that\u2019s a transcript that\u2019s not specified but without any further information so as not to confuse the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">But I fail to see an application for benefits as being significantly different than receipt of benefits because it essentially raises that issue to the jury. And they\u2019re not going to know one way or the other and they may be left to assume certain things. And I think equally significant to the fact that it\u2019s simply an application, the fact that Mr. Hollon would be \u2014 have to be allowed an opportunity to explain the context \u2014 and that\u2019s when we get into the litigation and the carpal tunnel and various other materials, some of which may even, you know, be germane in the packet of material that I\u2019ve received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">But when I consider all of that with the case authority engaged in this balancing, I think that we invariably are going to get into information that isn\u2019t relevant to this action first of all and granting an equal opportunity for the plaintiff to respond to that type of impeachment to explain the context. And also I think we are going to be going down a path inevitably where confusion is likely to arise and we\u2019re going to have numerous instances where we will be violating * * * the collateral source rule. And I just don\u2019t think that the underlying purpose is propelling enough as far as probative value to overweigh that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">{\u00b6 37} Thus, the trial court\u2019s decision, while based in part on the application of the collateral-source rule, in actuality involved a determination by the trial court that the evidence\u2019s probative effect was outweighed by its prejudicial effect and should therefore be excluded pursuant to Evid.R. 403(B). Given the trial court\u2019s careful weighing of the issues regarding admission of the proposed evidence regarding Martin\u2019s receipt of disability benefits, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">{\u00b6 38} Consequently, CSX\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">{\u00b6 39} In its fifth assignment of error, CSX argues that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that it could find CSX liable under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>FELA if it determined that CSX\u2019s negligence played any part, no matter how slight, in causing an injury to Martin. Generally, a court should give a requested jury instruction if it is a correct statement of the law, and reasonable minds might reach the conclusion sought by the instruction. <em>Maghie &amp; Savage, Inc. v. P.J. Dick Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-487, 2009-0hio-2164, 2009 WL 1263965. CSX argues that the instruction given by the trial court had the effect of removing Martin\u2019s burden of proving the element of proximate cause necessary to prove a claim of negligence and was therefore an incorrect statement of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">{\u00b6 40} Ohio courts have recognized that in FELA cases, \u201cthe traditional concept of proximate cause is supplanted by the less stringent standard that there be some causal relation, no matter how slight, between the injury and the railroad\u2019s breach of duty.\u201d <em>Smalley v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. </em>(Sept. 2, 1999), 10th Dist. No. 99AP-147, 1999 WL 680151. See also <em>Hager v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 87553, 2006-0hio-6580, 2006 WL 3634373, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">{\u00b6 41} The idea that the proximate-cause standard has been supplanted by a less stringent standard stems from the decision by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Rogers v. Missouri Pacific RR. Co. </em>(1957), 352 U.S. 500, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493. CSX now argues that Supreme Court cases since Rogers have recognized that proximate cause continues to be an element required to establish a railroad\u2019s liability under FELA. See, e.g., <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Sorrell </em>(2007), 549 U.S. 158, 127 S.Ct. 799, 166 L.Ed.2d 638. However, in <em>Sorrell, </em>the Supreme Court, while acknowledging the argument presented by CSX, i.e., that FELA cases require the same standard of proximate cause as other negligence cases, expressly declined to address that argument. <em>Sorrell, </em>549 U.S. at 164, 127 S.Ct. 799,166 L.Ed.2d 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">{\u00b6 42} We recognize that there may be some question regarding the validity of the principle that proximate cause in FELA cases has been supplemented by a less stringent \u201csome causal relation, no matter how slight\u201d standard. However, unless the United States Supreme Court expressly concludes that those cases that have applied that standard are incorrect, we are constrained to follow those Ohio cases, such as <em>Smalley </em>and <em>Hager, </em>that have continued to recognize the principle. Thus, we cannot say the trial court\u2019s instruction included an incorrect statement of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">{\u00b6 43} Therefore, CSX\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">{\u00b6 44} In its sixth assignment of error, CSX asserted that the trial court erred when it overruled CSX\u2019s motion for summary judgment. However, in briefing, CSX sets forth no separate argument on that issue. Thus, we need not address it. App.R. 12(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Martin\u2019s two assignments of error in his cross-appeal are interrelated, and will therefore be addressed together. Martin argues that the trial court erred when it failed to direct a verdict in his favor on the issue of contributory negligence, and then failed to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict when the jury found that he was 30 percent contributorily negligent. Essentially, Martin argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that he was contributorily negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">{\u00b6 46} At trial, Martin described the assignment given to him by Chris Clark as \u201cif we got a chance to go down and look at that pole and then to take it out if we had to.\u201d On cross-examination, CSX elicited the following testimony from Martin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">Q. Now, we\u2019ve already talked about Chris Clark, your supervisor. And I want to talk about when he gave you the assignment. There were no trains stopped that day, were there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">Q. In fact, I think you\u2019ve said earlier today that when Mr. Clark told you that if you had the chance check out that pole and if it were necessary to remove it. Isn\u2019t that what you told us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">Q. You were given that assignment, but you didn\u2019t ask for any instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYs\">A. Instructions to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\">Q. How to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-12\">A. We had to do it every day, cut trees out. It\u2019s no different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-13\">Q. So you believed you knew how to do it because you cut trees out all the time, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-14\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-15\">Q. Now, prior to that date, you had never asked a superior to provide you with assistance and have them refuse you, had you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-17\">Q. And if you felt you needed assistance on October 15th to remove that pole, you could have called Chris Clark and asked for it, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-18\">A. Well, to start with, usually we only have two people. And me and [Tim Stamper] could have handled the pole and taken it out. But in a freak accident, this pole flipped back and hit me. That\u2019s no different than when we\u2019ve cut trees out of the lines before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-19\">Q. Okay. If you felt you needed more people to help you, you could have called Chris and asked for it, couldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-20\">A. I could have. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Q. In fact, if you felt you needed a boom truck, you could have called Chris; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">Q. Well, if you felt you needed a boom truck on October 15, 2002, and that you would not have been able to do it without a boom truck, you could have called Chris; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">A. If I felt like I couldn\u2019t have done that job on October 15, 2002, I would not have attempted it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">Q. I understand that. And my question is: If you thought you would have needed a boom truck to help you get that job done, you could have called and asked for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">A. If I thought I would have needed a boom truck, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">Q. You didn\u2019t call for a boom truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-12\">Q. You didn\u2019t call for extra assistance or equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-13\">A. Didn\u2019t feel like I needed to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">Q. Right. And if you felt you couldn\u2019t do the job, you could have just chosen not to do it; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-15\">A. If I felt I couldn\u2019t have done the job, I wouldn\u2019t have started it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-16\">{\u00b6 47} Given this evidence, a jury could have reasonably believed that Martin was negligent in failing to recognize the risk posed by a pole with wires attached to it versus that posed by a tree. The jury could further have reasonably concluded that Martin was negligent for failing to recognize that additional help and equipment may have been needed to remove the pole safely. Thus, we cannot say that the trial court erred when it declined to direct a verdict, or to grant a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, on the issue of Martin\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-17\">{\u00b6 48} Thus, Martin\u2019s two assignments of error on cross-appeal are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-18\">{\u00b6 49} Accordingly, we sustain CSX\u2019s second assignment of error on the issue of future wage loss, overrule the remainder of CSX\u2019s assignments of error and Martin\u2019s assignments of error on cross-appeal, and remand this matter to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas for entry of judgment consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-19\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>French, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b59-5\">Brown, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b59-6\">Brown, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Az\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">{\u00b6 50} Disagreeing with the conclusion reached by the majority with regard to CSX\u2019s second assignment of error, I respectfully dissent. After reviewing the evidence presented, I would find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it submitted the issue of future damages to the jury, as there was evidence presented that appellant\u2019s injuries were permanent in nature and that such injuries prevented him from attaining his preinjury wage. For this reason, I would overrule CSX\u2019s second assignment of error. I concur, however, with the majority\u2019s disposition of the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
