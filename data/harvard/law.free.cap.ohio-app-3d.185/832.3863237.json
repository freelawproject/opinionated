He also takes issue with the length of sentence imposed. After a thorough review of the record, and for the following reasons, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and forfeiture and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Cleveland police officers began an investigation of Brian Jarabek, a known marijuana dealer. Cleveland police detective John Pitts testified that he received a tip that Jarabek was in town and had resumed selling marijuana. After an investigation, Pitts obtained a search warrant for Jarabek\u2019s premises. Upon execution of the warrant, police officers discovered Jarabek and appellant seated on couches in the living room of Jarabek\u2019s apartment with a tray of marijuana in front of them on the coffee table. Jarabek\u2019s two-year-old daughter was between the coffee table and the television watching \u201cScarface.\u201d After a search of the house, 473 pills of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (\u201cMDMA\u201d or \u201cecstasy\u201d) were found in a kitchen cabinet, which was adjacent to the living room but separated by a hallway. Aso, 188 grams of powdered cocaine was found in an upstairs bedroom. Various tools for the preparation of drugs for sale were also discovered, including a digital scale with cocaine residue on it, small plastic bags, and a grinder with marijuana residue on it. Police also found $1,220 in appellant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">{\u00b6 3} On March 13, 2008, appellant was indicted along with Jarabek on six counts, with only five pertaining to appellant. Counts 1 and 3 were for trafficking in MDMA and cocaine respectively, both with juvenile specifications that elevated these charges to first-degree felonies. Counts 2 and 4 were for possession of MDMA and cocaine respectively, both second-degree felonies. Count 6 was for possession of criminal tools, a fifth-degree felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">{\u00b6 4} This was not the first time appellant had been at a location when police executed a search warrant. On two prior occasions, appellant was found in locations where police officers executed drug-related search warrants. Detective Jamal Ansari of the Cleveland Police Narcotics Unit testified that on May 7, 2003, he came across appellant when he executed a search warrant in an investigation of Danny Nida and James Ouk. Appellant and others were arrested, and police found between 300 and 400 pills of ecstasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">{\u00b6 5} Detective John Gucik of the Lakewood Police Department testified that on May 25, 2004, his department executed a search warrant pursuant to an investigation of James Ouk. Appellant was present when the search was executed, and police found 67 pills of ecstasy and a large quantity of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">{\u00b6 6} In both of these prior instances, appellant was not the subject of the police investigations, nor was he known to police officers conducting the investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">{\u00b6 7} The state offered these other two incidents as other-acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). On August 5, 2008, prior to voir dire, the trial court held a hearing on the state\u2019s notice of its intent to use other-acts evidence. The state argued that the evidence would be offered to show that it was \u201cno mistake, no coincidence, * * * no accident * * * that [appellant] was at the scene because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>he * * * is a drug dealer just like Brian Jarabek.\u201d The trial court allowed the state to present evidence of these past instances when appellant was found at the same time and location where large amounts of MDMA were found, but issued a limiting instruction to the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cEvidence was received about the commission of crimes other than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence was received only for a limited purpose. It was not received, and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity or accordance with that character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIf you find that the evidence of other crimes is true, and that the defendant committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether [it] proves the absence of mistake or accident or the defendant\u2019s motive, opportunity, intent or purpose, preparation, or plan to commit the offense charged in this trial; or knowledge of circumstances surrounding the offense charged in this trial, or the identity of the person who committed the offense in this trial. That evidence cannot be considered for any other purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">{\u00b6 10} The jury, in their deliberations, asked the trial judge a few questions, including the following: \u201c[There] was testimony that the defendant had been found twice before at locations where MDMA was found. Can we take that into consideration?\u201d The court answered: \u201cYes, but only as specified in the \u2018other acts\u2019 instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">{\u00b6 11} On August 8, 2008, the jury returned verdicts of guilty of trafficking in MDMA, a first-degree felony; guilty of possession of MDMA, a second-degree felony; and guilty of possession of criminal tools, a fifth-degree felony. The jury found appellant not guilty of trafficking in or possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">{\u00b6 12} At appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing on August 8, 2008, the court ordered that he serve nine years in prison on Count 1, eight years on Count 2, and one year on Count 6, all to run concurrently. Appellant was also fined $20,000, ordered to forfeit the seized property, and informed of five years of postrelease control. Appellant then filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Other-Acts Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">{\u00b6 13} On appeal, appellant claims first that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s error in permitting the admission of \u2018other acts evidence\u2019 was highly prejudicial to Appellant-Defendant with little or no probative value in contradiction to the principles set forth in Evid.R. 404 and in violation of Appellant\u2019s right to due process of law, as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe admission of evidence lies within the broad discretion of a trial court, and a reviewing court should not disturb evidentiary decisions in the absence of an abuse of discretion that has created material prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Noting, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, at \u00b6 43, citing <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 752 N.E.2d 904. An abuse of discretion \u201cimplies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151,157,16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">{\u00b6 15} With regard to the admissibility of other-acts evidence, it is well established that \u201cextrinsic acts may not be used to prove by inference that the accused acted in conformity with his other acts or that he has a propensity to act in such a manner. <em>[State v. Smith </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 137, 140, 551 N.E.2d 190]. Although Evid.R. 404(B) permits \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence for certain enumerated issues, \u2018the standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.\u2019 <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682, paragraph one of the syllabus. Furthermore, under Evid.R. 403(A), even relevant evidence which is admissible under ordinary circumstances must be excluded if the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Chaney, </em>Seneca App. No. 13-05-12, 2006-Ohio-6489, 2006 WL 3544710, at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 2945.59 states: \u201cIn any criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\u201d See also Evid.R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Valid Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">{\u00b6 17} The state asserted at trial that it was no coincidence that appellant was present twice in the past where large quantities of ecstasy were found by the police. While evidence of past wrongs is not admissible to show the character of a person or to show that he acted in conformity therewith, it may be admitted for any of the reasons contained in Evid.R. 404(B). The state\u2019s theory is that the police entered the house as the two individuals were concluding a drug deal during which appellant had \u201cfronted\u201d Jarabek MDMA in exchange for the $1,220.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jarabek had an extensive history with the police as a small-time marijuana dealer. They suspected him of dealing only in marijuana, but on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>occasion they found a large quantity of other drugs in his home along with appellant, who was in possession of a large sum of money with no apparent ability to have acquired such a sum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state argues that without knowledge of appellant\u2019s prior acts, the jury may have thought that appellant\u2019s presence at Jarabek\u2019s house was a mistake and that he had no intent to be there with those drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">{\u00b6 18} The state does not try to show a plan or scheme perpetrated by appellant, leaving only mistake, intent, knowledge, or motive as possible valid uses for the other-acts evidence. Of these, the state relies on mistake and knowledge as reasons for allowing testimony of appellant\u2019s presence at past drug raids.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">{\u00b6 19} In analyzing the similar federal other-acts rule, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals employed a two-step analysis, stating, \u201cFirst, the trial court must ascertain whether the proffered evidence is relevant and admissible for a proper purpose. <em>United States v. Zelinka, </em>862 F.2d 92, 98 (6th Cir.1988). To be relevant, \u2018the evidence must relate to a matter which is \u201cin issue,\u201d and must deal with conduct substantially similar and reasonably near in time to the offenses for which the defendant is being tried.\u2019 <em>United States v. Blankenship, </em>775 F.2d 735, 739 (6th Cir.1985) (citations omitted). To determine whether the proffered evidence is admissible for a proper purpose, the trial court must decide, \u2018whether that evidence is probative of a material issue other than character.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Feinman </em>(C.A.6, 1991), 930 F.2d 495, 499, quoting <em>Huddleston v. United States </em>(1988), 485 U.S. 681, 686, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">{\u00b6 20} The Ohio Supreme Court has offered guidance, setting forth several factors for courts to examine: \u201c(1) the other crimes evidence must have a proper purpose, (2) the proffered evidence must be relevant, (3) its probative value must outweigh its potential for unfair prejudice, and (4) the court must charge the jury to consider the other crimes evidence only for the limited purpose for which it is admitted.\u201d <em>State v. Gus, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 85591, 2005-Ohio-6717, 2005 WL 3475795, at \u00b6 18, citing <em>Huddleston, </em>485 U.S. at 691, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">{\u00b6 21} Here, appellant never argued that he did not know the drugs were present or that he lacked knowledge of their presence. He claims that he was there to smoke marijuana. Although his stated reason for being there<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>explanation of the $1,220 dollars in his pocket were unbelievable, that does not provide a door through which the state may introduce the prior incidents of appellant being found in the same place as MDMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>State v. Burrell </em>(May 22, 1995), Stark App. No. 1994 CA 00314, 1995 WL 495888, the Fifth District allowed Evid.R. 404(B) evidence to circumstantially establish knowledge of drugs on the part of the defendant from his presence at the same residence during two prior controlled drug buys the previous week. The case before us is distinguishable because the prior instances were at different residences and occurred at least a few years apart. Also, the defendant in <em>Burrell </em>witnessed the drug transactions, which further established knowledge. Here, the officers who executed prior search warrants were unable to give any such testimony. The presence of appellant twice before at locations where large amounts of MDMA were found is not probative of knowledge or mistake on the occasion leading to appellant\u2019s arrest. Therefore, this evidence was not offered for a valid purpose, and its admission was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Prejudicial Effect</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">{\u00b6 23} Even if this evidence was offered for a valid purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), evidence that is substantially more prejudicial than probative must still be excluded because of its deleterious effects to an accused\u2019s right to a fair trial. See <em>State v. Matthews </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 440, 14 OBR 559, 471 N.E.2d 849; Evid.R. 403(A). In this case, the presence of appellant at other drug raids is not probative of knowledge or lack of mistake when he was discovered a third time. It is also very prejudicial since it leads the trier of fact to conclude that appellant is somehow associated with MDMA. This prejudice partially relieved the state of proving necessary elements of the charged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">{\u00b6 24} In order to overturn appellant\u2019s conviction here, the evidence admitted in error must have resulted in prejudice. \u201cPrejudice occurs if there is a reasonable possibility that the error might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Basen </em>(Feb. 16, 1989), Cuyahoga App. No. 55001, 1989 WL 12914, citing <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 96, 104-105, 39 O.O.2d 97, 227 N.E.2d 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">{\u00b6 25} Here, little evidence existed to convict appellant of possession of drugs, let alone drug trafficking. The trial court tried to limit the possibility of any prejudicial effect by issuing a limiting instruction to the jury to consider the evidence only for a proper purpose under Evid.R. 404(B). However, two witnesses were called exclusively to testify about the two prior instances. Their testimony was not an insignificant portion of the record in this case, spanning over 30 pages. Also, the jury specifically asked the trial judge about the appropriate use of this evidence during its deliberations. The fact that the jury found appellant not guilty of the charges relating to cocaine also contribute to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>court\u2019s view that there exists a reasonable possibility that the admission of the other-acts evidence contributed to appellant\u2019s conviction. Therefore, the error was not harmless. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken, and we therefore reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and remand the cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Excessive Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">{\u00b6 26} Appellant claims that \u201c[t]he trial court erred to the prejudice of Defendant-Appellant when it issued an excessive sentence not in conformity with the relevant factors for felony sentencing.\u201d Appellant claims that pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B), the trial court should have sentenced him to the minimum sentence unless the court made findings that would justify raising his sentence above the minimum required. Given our holding above, this assigned error is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">{\u00b6 27} The other-acts evidence admitted during appellant\u2019s trial was not offered for a proper purpose under Evid.R. 404(B). Also, its admission was not harmless, because there exists a reasonable probability that it contributed to appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">{\u00b6 28} The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b880-10\">Blackmon, P.J., and Stewart, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-9\">.
