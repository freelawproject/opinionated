The township did not provide any guidance as to what types of computer usage were acceptable or appropriate, except for a Code of Ethics, which instructed township employees that they were \u201cbound by the highest standards of morality\u201d and should conduct themselves so as to not bring discredit upon the township. In the absence of additional guidance, the township could not discipline Bowman for accessing legal, nonpornographic videos on the computer, and the trial court abused its discretion in affirming the trustees\u2019 decision to terminate Bowman. The matter will be remanded to the trial court for it to vacate the trustees\u2019 decision. A procedural error in the trustees\u2019 vote on the disciplinary action and the trustees\u2019 actions to correct that error were not prejudicial to Bowman.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">{\u00b6 3} Bowman worked for Butler Township as a part-time firefighter and emergency medical technician. In 2007, routine maintenance of the township computer system revealed that members of the fire department had been accessing and downloading violent and pornographic files from the Internet on work time using township computers. The township initiated an investigation of Bowman and several other firefighters, which was conducted by the fire chief and the police chief. The computer records indicated that Bowman had watched several videos while at work. The parties do not dispute the content of the videos in question: seven of the videos were violent, military videos, and one contained sexually explicit language but was not pornographic. Bowman admitted watching only one of the videos, entitled \u201cFelony Fights,\u201d which he claimed had some training value; he denied accessing the other videos and explained that he had shared his computer password with other firefighters. The investigators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>concluded that Bowman had accessed all of the videos and had engaged in \u201cimproper conduct\u201d by doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">{\u00b6 4} Based on the township\u2019s investigation, the Township Administrator recommended that Bowman and other firefighters be fired. The Trustees conducted a hearing. Based on the narrow time frame in which many of the videos were watched, their sequence, and Bowman\u2019s admission that he had watched \u201cFelony Fights,\u201d while denying that he had accessed or watched other videos, the trustees concluded that Bowman\u2019s account was not credible. The trustees accepted the recommendation of the township administrator and voted, in executive session, to terminate Bowman. They then announced this decision in open session.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 5} On January 24, 2008, Bowman filed a notice of appeal in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. On March 3, 2008, in response to the filing of the notice of appeal, the trustees filed conclusions of fact in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 6} Several firefighters appealed from the trustees\u2019 votes on disciplinary action. While Bowman\u2019s appeal was pending, the trial court judge handling one of the other appeals concluded that the trustees\u2019 vote should have been taken in open session, rather than in executive session. He remanded for the trustees to properly adopt their decision. In light of this judgment, on November 10, 2008, the trustees repeated their votes in open session with respect to all of the firefighters who had been disciplined for improper computer usage, including Bowman. The trustees then filed the minutes of the meeting at which they had voted in open session in Bowman\u2019s pending case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court did not consider any additional evidence. On January 6, 2009, the trial court affirmed the township\u2019s decision to terminate Bowman.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 8} Bowman raises two assignments of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">{\u00b6 9} Bowman\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred in affirming the decision of the Board of Township Trustees terminating appellant in the absence of evidence the appellant was guilty in the performance of his official duty of bribery, misfeasance, malfeasance, nonfeasance, misconduct in office, gross neglect of duty, gross immorality, or habitual drunkenness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">{\u00b6 11} Bowman contends that the trustees\u2019 factual findings were erroneous and that employees were not provided with adequate notice of what kinds of conduct \u2014 and particularly what types of computer use \u2014 would be grounds for disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>{\u00b6 12} R.C. 505.38 provides for the removal of firefighters in accordance with R.C. 733.35. R.C. 733.35 provides that an officer may be removed if he \u201chas been guilty, in the performance of his official duty, of bribery, misfeasance, malfeasance, nonfeasance, misconduct in office, gross neglect of duty, gross immorality, or habitual drunkenness.\u201d The trustees found that Bowman was guilty of malfeasance in accessing and viewing \u201cinappropriate materials\u201d at the firehouse, and the trial court affirmed this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 13} When considering an administrative appeal, a court of common pleas must weigh the evidence in the record to ascertain whether there exists a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence to support the administrative agency\u2019s decision. R.C. 2506.04; <em>Dudukovich v. Lorain Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 207, 12 O.O.3d 198, 389 N.E.2d 1113; <em>State ex rel. Pilarczyk v. Riverside, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20706, 2005-Ohio-3755, at \u00b6 10, 2005 WL 1714206. Consistent with its findings, the court may affirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the decision or remand the matter to the body appealed from with instructions to enter a decision consistent with the findings or opinion of the court. R.C. 2506.04. The common pleas court \u201cconsiders the \u2018whole record,\u2019 including any new or additional evidence admitted under R.C. 2506.03, and determines whether the administrative order is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.\u201d <em>Henley v. Youngstown Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 142,147, 735 N.E.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 14} The standard of review to be applied by an appellate court in an R.C. 2506.04 appeal is \u201cmore limited in scope.\u201d Id., citing <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 30, 34,12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848. Under R.C. 2506.04, the court of appeals does not have the same extensive power to weigh the evidence as is granted to the common pleas court. While \u201c[i]t is incumbent on the trial court to examine the evidence^] [sjuch is not the charge of the appellate court.\u201d Id. at 147, 735 N.E.2d 433. An appellate court reviews the judgment of the common pleas court only on questions of law. <em>Kisil, </em>12 Ohio St.3d at 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848, fn. 4. The appellate court\u2019s inquiry is limited to a determination of whether, as a matter of law, the decision of the common pleas court is not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Id. at 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848. In other words, in reviewing questions of law, the appellate court considers whether the trial court abused its discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 15} Because an appellate court does not review questions of fact in an administrative appeal, we accept the trial court\u2019s summary of the trustees\u2019 factual findings as true:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201cComputer data records show that Appellant\u2019s username and password for the Butler Township computer system [were] used to access the following video files: \u2018Lions Eat Man\u2019 (10/1/07 at 6:46 p.m.), \u2018Hamas Militant Shot Killed\u2019 (10/1/07 at 6:47 p.m.), \u2018Felony Fights\u2019 (10/1/07 at 7:05 p.m.), \u2018Helicopter Crewman Execution\u2019 (10/1/07 at 7:09 p.m.), \u2018Sniper Shots\u2019 (10/1/07 at 7:12 p.m.), \u2018Guerillas Killed\u2019 (10/1/07 at 7:13 p.m.), \u2018Terrorists Guerilla Killed\u2019 (10/1/07 at 7:13 p.m.), and \u2018Best Girlfriend Ever\u2019 (10/19/07 at 8:46 p.m.).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAppellant admitted to accessing \u2018Felony Fights\u2019 on October 1st, but none of the others. Appellant, however, could offer no credible reason to explain why he was logged on to the computer when those video files were accessed. At first, Appellant testified that he observed [another firefighter] Jason Holfinger watching the military-themed videos. When it was determined later in the hearing that Jason Holfinger was not working on October 1st, Appellant testified that he did not know if the military-themed videos he was accused of accessing were the exact same ones he observed Jason Holfinger watching and suggested that the times shown on the computer data were altered. Appellant testified that he gave his username and password to several individuals who worked at Station 89 and proposed that they could have accessed the videos. However, the computer data records show that Appellant\u2019s username was used to access the allegedly inappropriate files from the computer located at Station 88. Appellant testified that it was possible he did not log out correctly. This does not explain how the videos were accessed under his surname <em>before </em>Appellant viewed \u2018Felony Fights.\u2019 The Board\u2019s finding that Appellant\u2019s testimony was not credible and that Appellant accessed and viewed the aforementioned video files is supported by the preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">{\u00b6 18} The parties agree that Bowman did not access pornographic videos at the firehouse. The parties also agree that firefighters were permitted to use township computers at the firehouse for personal use during their down time; by the nature of their work and long shifts, firefighters regularly sleep, eat, and conduct other activities while on duty that may not be permitted on work time in many other professions. The trial court found that he accessed videos \u201ccontaining] graphic images of brutal violence, death, and injury\u201d and \u201ca short comedic vignette in which an adult female, who is in a sports bar with two males, drinks beer from the pitcher, belches, yells at the t.v. screen, and verbalizes in vulgar language her desire to practice what she learned from a pornographic film.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 19} We cannot say that, as a matter of law, the factual findings of the common pleas court are not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence or that the trial court abused its discretion in weighing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the evidence as it did. Thus, we cannot agree with Bowman\u2019s argument that the factual findings were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 20} Bowman further contends that the township and fire department did not have a policy in place that provided sufficient notice as to what types of computer usage were permitted or prohibited and that, therefore, he should not have been found guilty of malfeasance. He noted at oral argument, by way of example, that watching football games on a township television or computer is acceptable, while, according to the township\u2019s argument, watching a violent video on the computer is not. Bowman claims that he had no way to know that the videos he watched were not permitted. The township does not discuss this argument in its brief, except to say that \u201ccommon sense\u201d demonstrates that Bowman\u2019s conduct was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d At oral argument, the township also relied on Fire Department Special Order # 07-003 and the township\u2019s code of ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 21} The township argues that Special Order # 07-003, issued by the Fire Chief on January 19, 2007, sets forth its policy for employee conduct. Special Order # 07-003 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cRecently I have been made aware of several instances where employees [sic] behavior, even though the employees were off-duty, were alleged to be inappropriate. Employees must remember that their behavior, even when off-duty, is a reflection on the Township and this Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cAs a reminder to all employees, the Township\u2019s Personnel Policy includes a section on ethics. Furthermore, discipline may result from inappropriate actions, on or off duty, if those actions are deemed to be a violation [of] this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe Township\u2019s Personnel Policy ethics section reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c6.5 CODE OF ETHICS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe sole objective of Butler Township is to provide services for the benefit of all citizens of the community. All employees of the Township must be aware of the importance placed upon them as a Township employee, and being employed by a governmental agency, must realize that they are bound to uphold the Constitution of the State of Ohio, and the resolutions, rules and regulations established by Butler Township. All Township employees are bound by the highest standards of morality, and should be concerned that both their official functions as Township employees as well as their private affairs should be conducted so as not to bring discredit upon or injure in any way the credibility of the entire Township organization. Township employees shall cooperate fully with other public officials and employees, and shall seek to find and have adopted more efficient and economical ways of getting official tasks accomplished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Neither Special Order # 07-003 nor the code of ethics in the township\u2019s personnel policy provides any specific guidance as to appropriate computer usage for firefighters. Neither document mentions computer usage specifically, and the code of ethics requirement that employees adhere to the \u201chighest standards of morality,\u201d while laudable, is vague and not clearly definable. Although watching pornographic videos would more universally be classified as conduct that does not satisfy the \u201chighest moral standards,\u201d here, the appropriateness of Bowman\u2019s conduct turned upon the more amorphous question of where to draw the line about which violent behaviors are consistent with the highest standards of morality and thus acceptable to watch on television or computer. At oral argument, the township conceded that some violent content was permissible, such as football coverage, news reports, or perhaps even fighting championships, while arguing that the military-themed violence in the videos watched by Bowman was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d The township contends that \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cappropriateness\u201d should have informed Bowman that the videos in question were improper in the workplace but, in our view, these estimable concepts provide no meaningful guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 28} In discussing whether a statute is vague, the United States Supreme Court has held that the legislature cannot forbid or require the doing of an act \u201cin terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess as to its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d <em>Zwickler v. Koota </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 241, 249, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444. See also <em>Akron v. Rowland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 374, 382-383, 618 N.E.2d 138. Due process requires a person to have notice of conduct that' is prohibited. In our view, the township failed to provide such notice with respect to use of the computer to access legal, nonpornographic materials. Prior to Bowman\u2019s disciplinary proceedings, the township had provided no meaningful guidance as to where it drew the line between appropriate and inappropriate content along the spectrum of behaviors that can be accessed by television or computer. In other words, the township\u2019s policies gave no guidance as to what types of content, violent or otherwise, made Internet or other media materials \u201cinappropriate\u201d or violated the \u201chighest standards of morality.\u201d Under these circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion in affirming the trustees\u2019 finding that Bowman had engaged in malfeasance warranting his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 29} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">{\u00b6 30} Bowman\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion and denied the appellant due process of law by allowing the township to reconvene appellants [sic] disciplinary hearing more than ten months after the initial hearing was concluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>{\u00b6 32} The trustees rendered their decision in Bowman\u2019s case on January 14, 2008, when they voted to terminate Bowman and several other firefighters during an executive session and then announced the decisions it had made in open session.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">{\u00b6 33} While Bowman\u2019s appeal to the trial court was pending, another judge on the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas entered a judgment in <em>Nihizer v. Butler Twp. Bd. of Trustees </em>(Oct. 10, 2008), C.P. Montgomery No. 08-CV-868. <em>Nihizer </em>is a case involving the administrative appeal of another Butler Township firefighter who was terminated by the trustees on the same day and in the same manner as Bowman. In <em>Nihizer, </em>the firefighter argued that the trustees had violated the Open Meetings Act by taking official action in executive session rather than in open session. The trial court determined that the trustees should have voted on Nihizer\u2019s termination in an open session and that the trustees\u2019 decision had not been properly adopted pursuant to the Open Meetings Act. Thus, the court remanded \u201cto allow the Board to properly adopt their decision in an open, regularly scheduled meeting\u201d and declined to consider the other issues raised in the appeal until the decision was properly adopted. In response, on November 10, 2008, the trustees voted on the disciplinary actions taken <em>against all the firefighters </em>again, this time in open session.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 34} On November 14, 2008, the trustees filed in Bowman\u2019s case a \u201cNotice of Filing November 10, 2008 Butler Township Board of Trustees\u2019 Meeting Minutes.\u201d The minutes showed that the trustees had adopted the township administrator\u2019s recommendation to terminate Bowman and the other firefighters in an open session. No transcript of the session was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 35} Bowman contends that the trustees\u2019 \u201creconvened hearing\u201d on November 10, 2008, violated statutory requirements and his due process rights because the meeting was not transcribed, and it is unclear whether additional facts were considered or additional discussion occurred. We disagree. The trustees voted on the disciplinary action in open session, a process that seems to have been all that was required by the Open Meetings Act. The minutes of this meeting do not suggest that any additional consideration of the issues occurred; in fact, the township\u2019s attorney suggested that \u201cmotions, seconds, approvals and votes\u201d of the earlier action be placed on the public record. In light of the remand in <em>Nihizer, </em>the trustees prudently took these steps with respect to all the firefighters against whom disciplinary action had been taken at the earlier hearing. In our view, this correction of the procedure used by the trustees in the earlier proceedings did not affect Bowman\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 36} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 37} The judgment of the trial court will be reversed. This matter will be remanded to the trial court for it to vacate the order of the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-7\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
