A bench trial commenced on July 17, 2008. By stipulation, appellee dismissed his breach-of-contract claim. By judgment entry filed September 18, 2008, the trial court found in favor of appellee on the fraud claim and awarded appellee $37,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>in compensatory damages. A separate hearing on attorney fees and punitive damages was held on December 16, 2008. By judgment entry filed February 13, 2009, the trial court awarded appellee attorney fees in the amount of $18,489 and punitive damages in the amount of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant filed an appeal, and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in finding defendant-appellant liable for fraud as such finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in its method of assessing and awarding compensatory damages to plaintiff-appellee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in awarding punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiff-appellee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant claims that the trial court\u2019s finding that he was liable for fraud was against the manifest weight of the evidence as appellee failed to establish that he relied on the alleged fraudulent representations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">{\u00b6 7} A judgment supported by some competent, credible evidence will not be reversed by a reviewing court as against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. A reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court when there exists some competent and credible evidence supporting the judgment rendered by the trial court. <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614 N.E.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Burr v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 69, 23 OBR 200, 491 N.E.2d 1101, paragraph two of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio found the elements of fraud to be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-15\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(a) a representation or, where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-16\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(b) which is material to the transaction at hand,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201c(c) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(d) with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(e) justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(f) a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance. <em>(Cohen v. Lamko, Inc. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 167[, 10 OBR 500], 462 N.E.2d 407, followed.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 15} The elements of fraud must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118. The burden to prove fraud rests upon the party alleging the fraud. <em>First Discount Corp. v. Daken </em>(1944), 75 Ohio App. 33, 30 O.O. 319, 60 N.E.2d 711, paragraph seven of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 16} As a condition to the residential real estate purchase agreement, appellant was to provide a year-end financial statement for the prior two years. However, appellant provided only \u201cProposed Expenses,\u201d which represented one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 17} The \u201cProposed Expenses\u201d indicated that the rents from the apartment units grossed $2,900 to $3,000 per month. Appellant admitted that this was his own statement. The amounts were consistent with the listing by Cutler GMAC Real Estate\u2019s Centralized Real Estate Information Services sheet, which listed the total gross rental income as $36,000. It was also consistent with what the realtor, Don Esber, was told by appellant, and with the cash-flow analysis including cost of utilities given to appellee\u2019s son, Frederick Rapport.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">{\u00b6 18} During appellant\u2019s testimony, he claimed that the one-year financial report was only an estimate and that he never told Esber or anyone that the income was $2,900 to $3,000 a month or that rent for a two-bedroom apartment was $700 and rent for a three-bedroom apartment was $800. Appellant further claimed that he gave his 2003 and 2004 income-tax returns for the property to Esber. On cross-examination, appellee\u2019s attorney impeached appellant with his own deposition that contradicted his statements. Appellant further, \u00e1 la Clinton\u2019s argument about the word \u201cis,\u201d claimed he said \u201cabout\u201d and the amounts were an estimate of the rents grossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">{\u00b6 19} This inevitably led to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant lacked credibility:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cBased on the foregoing and Defendant\u2019s unequivocal testimony in his deposition and at trial that his tax returns were the actual figure for rents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>received, Defendant\u2019s testimony regarding having provided Exhibit 4 only as a projection of income and the statement that he provided income tax returns is not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cKochovski\u2019s subsequent testimony that the written statement concerning rental income was only an estimate intended to show what the property <em>could </em>generate if it were fully rented were made with a reckless disregard for the truth, are not credible, and even if true would have only been a half-truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 22} We review these facts as they reflect on the issue of fraud. Clearly, the trial court\u2019s decision that appellant made false representations with the intent to mislead is basically unchallenged. The only contrary evidence was appellant\u2019s own testimony, which the trial court found not to be credible. This finding by the trial court is substantiated in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 23} The true gravamen of this assignment is whether appellee relied on the false statements and waived the issue of appellant\u2019s failure to provide a year-end financial statement for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 24} The failure to provide two years\u2019 worth of financials is a \u201cred herring\u201d to the issue presented. It is clear that appellant\u2019s misleading and false statements about the rental income were consistently presented. To find that somehow appellee \u201cwaived\u201d appellant\u2019s fraud would be inconsistent. Undoubtedly, if appellant had provided the required year-end financials for two years of income, it would have also been false.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 25} Appellee testified that he was searching for a property for his \u201cretirement\u201d and to facilitate a 1031 like-kind exchange. When appellee was provided with the income from the subject property, he used the information to receive advice from his accountant, Kevin Harris. Appellee\u2019s accountant testified that he presumed the income figures were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">{\u00b6 26} When appellant met appellee just prior to closing, he assured appellee that he had good renters. In fact, the tenants proved not to be \u201cgood renters.\u201d One three-bedroom unit was vacant. The other three-bedroom unit was occupied by a new tenant who did not have a lease, never paid, and was subsequently evicted. The tenants in the two-bedroom units never paid the correct amount and never paid in a timely manner. One of these tenants bartered rent in exchange for painting services. This occurred for approximately six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">{\u00b6 27} Appellee stated that he relied on the income figures and the assurances that the tenants were \u201cgood.\u201d From the cited testimony, the trial court concluded that appellee relied on the given statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cIt has been proven by clear and convincing evidence that the false ' statements and omissions were material to the transaction in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>{\u00b6 29} \u201cIt has been proven by clear and convincing evidence that Rapport relied on Kochovski\u2019s false statements and omissions and supplied Kochovski\u2019s written misrepresentation concerning rental income to his bank and accountant in reliance on the truth of the statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 30} We find that these conclusions of law are founded on credible and consistent evidence and have been established by clear and convincing evidence. The trial court\u2019s conclusions on fraud and detrimental reliance are supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 31} Assignment of error I is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 32} Appellant claims that the trial court erred in the method of assessing and awarding damages. Specifically, appellant claims that no evidence was presented as to the actual value of the property at the time of sale vis-a-vis the price paid by appellee. Appellant also claims that the trial court erred in relying on the testimony of appellee as a lay witness in assessing damages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 33} In its conclusion of law No. 19, the trial court specifically rejected appellee\u2019s loss-of-income analysis:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThis Court is specifically not awarding damages for lost rents due to the fact that the rents actually received by Rapport would be consistent with the true fair market value of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">{\u00b6 35} The trial court relied on the testimony of the ten-percent reduction in fair-market value once the true rents were established:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIt has been proven that the damage sustained by Rapport as a result of Kochovski\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations is the reduction of fair market value of the property by 10% or $37,000.00 less then (sic) what Rapport actually paid for the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cUnder the owner-opinion rule, an owner of real property, by virtue of his ownership and without qualification as an expert, is competent to testify to his property\u2019s fair market value. * * * The rule is based on the presumption that \u2018the owner of real estate * * * possesses] sufficient acquaintance with it to estimate the value of the property, and his estimate is therefore received although his knowledge on the subject is not such as would qualify him to testify if he were not the owner.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cincinnati v. Banks </em>(2001), 143 Ohio App.3d 272, 291, 757 N.E.2d 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">{\u00b6 38} Further, \u201cEvid.R. 701 permits a lay witness to testify in the form of an opinion if the opinion is \u2018rationally based on the perception of the witness\u2019 and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u2018helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe measure of damages resulting from a sale induced by a vendor\u2019s fraudulent representation is the difference between the actual value of the property, at the time of the purchase and its value, had it been as represented.\u201d <em>Molnar v. Beriswell </em>(1930), 122 Ohio St. 348, 171 N.E. 593, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 40} Under the trial court\u2019s decision, the fair-market value of the subject property is $333,000 ($370,000 minus $37,000). Appellee\u2019s testimony established that the rents for a full 12 months were $26,958 in 2006 and $32,485 in 2007. Using the percentage-of-income approach in determining value, the average income for 2006 and 2007 was $29,722, or a return on investment slightly over nine percent of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 41} We also note that no objection was raised to appellee\u2019s testimony as to the ten-percent reduction in value. An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804; Crim.R. 52(B). In order to prevail under a plain-error analysis, appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. <em>Long. </em>Notice of plain error \u201cis to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 42} We find that the simple computation of return on investment substantiates appellee\u2019s testimony and the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 43} Assignment of error II is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">{\u00b6 44} Appellant claims that the trial court erred in awarding punitive damages and attorney fees as there was no finding of actual malice. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">{\u00b6 45} R.C. 2315.21 governs the recovery of punitive and exemplary damages in tort actions. In order to be awarded punitive damages, a plaintiff must show the following by clear and convincing evidence (R.C. 2315.21(D)(4)):</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThe actions or omissions of that defendant demonstrate malice or aggravated or egregious fraud, or that defendant as principal or master knowingly authorized, participated in, or ratified actions or omissions of an agent or servant that so demonstrate.\u201d R.C. 2315.21(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cActual malice, necessary for an award of punitive damages, is (1) that state of mind under which a person\u2019s conduct is characterized by hatred, ill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>will or a spirit of revenge, or (2) a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.\u201d <em>Preston v. Murty </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 334, 512 N.E.2d 1174, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 48} As pointed out by appellant, the parties met only once prior to the closing. We do not find the lack of personal knowledge of a particular person to be necessary. In products-liability cases, personal knowledge is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 49} We find that the trial court\u2019s decision speaks only to the elements of fraud and is silent as to the elements of malice separate and apart from the fraud:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cKochovski\u2019s subsequent testimony that the 'written statement concerning rental income was only an estimate intended to show what the property <em>could </em>generate if it were fully rented were made with a reckless disregard for the truth, are not credible, and even if true would have been only a half-truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cIt has been proven that Kochovki\u2019s (sic) misrepresentations and actions are such that the imposition of punitive damages is warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 52} It could be argued that because appellant knew that the timeliness of finding a suitable 1031 like-kind exchange was an issue, his actions were beyond those necessary for fraud. Appellant\u2019s apparent disregard of the truth at trial is also not sufficient to prove malice. However, when reviewing the transcript of the trial and the findings of fact by the trial court, we find no separate animus to establish malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">{\u00b6 53} Assignment of error III is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">{\u00b6 54} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, Ohio is hereby affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-13\">Wise and Edwards, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
