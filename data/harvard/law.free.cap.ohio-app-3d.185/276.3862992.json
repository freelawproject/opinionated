D &amp; E had a policy with Ohio Casualty that included coverage for damages caused by uninsured and underinsured motorists (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d). It was undisputed that Wilson was an insured under the policy\u2019s UM/UIM provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 3} On January 3, 2007, Ohio Casualty sent Wilson\u2019s attorney a letter acknowledging that Wilson was pursuing a UM/UIM claim. The letter stated that Ohio Casualty had been made aware of Wilson\u2019s injuries on August 12, 2002, but that the company had been \u201cadvised that our insured\u2019s employee, Mr. Wilson, was proceeding through the Ohio Bureau of Worker\u2019s Compensation and would not be pursuing a claim against D <em>&amp; </em>E Electric\u2019s Business Auto policy.\u201d Despite its knowledge of Wilson\u2019s injures, Ohio Casualty had never provided him with a copy of the D &amp; E Electric policy and had not informed him of any time-limitation clauses in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">{\u00b6 4} On July 22, 2008, Wilson filed a complaint seeking a declaration that he was entitled to coverage under the Ohio Casualty policy. Ohio Casualty asserted that Wilson\u2019s claim was barred by a clause in the policy requiring an insured to assert a claim for UM/UIM coverage within three years of an occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Ohio Casualty, stating that there was \u201cno reason why it should have taken Mr. Wilson nearly six years to determine if his employer had UM/UIM insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">{\u00b6 6} In his sole assignment of error, Wilson now argues that the trial court erred in granting Ohio Casualty\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Specifically, he argues that the court erred in enforcing the policy\u2019s three-year limitation period for UM/UIM claims, because Ohio Casualty had not informed him of the limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">{\u00b6 7} Under Civ.R. 56(C), a motion for summary judgment may be granted only when no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and with the evidence construed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>adverse to that party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court reviews the granting of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">{\u00b6 8} In general, a claim based on a written contract must be asserted within 15 years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But under R.C. 3937.18(H), a policy for UM7UIM coverage may shorten the limitations period to as little as three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 9} The Tenth Appellate District addressed the enforceability of a contractual limitations period in <em>Midwest Allergy Assoc., Inc. v. Cincinnati Ins. </em>Co.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Midwest, </em>the insured had been denied coverage for property damage based on a 12-month limitations period contained in the policy. The insured had informed the insurer of its claim and had sought a copy of the policy within the 12-month period, but the insurance company had provided only a portion of the policy, omitting the limitations clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">{\u00b6 10} In reversing the judgment against the insured, the <em>Midwest </em>court held that it was incumbent upon the insurer to establish the enforceability of a limitations clause and that it could not enforce such a clause when the insured had not been provided with notice that the clause was part of the policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In holding that the limitations clause was unenforceable, the court stated that \u201c[i]t would be unconscionable to permit an insurance company to enforce a limitation clause contained in the standard form of their policy against an insured who did not specifically bargain for the clause and who never had an opportunity to become aware of the clause until after the limitation period had expired.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">{\u00b6 11} We find the reasoning in <em>Midwest </em>to be persuasive. An insurer owes an insured a duty of good faith,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and if the insurer simply remains silent about a limitations period in the face of a potential claim, it violates that duty. And Ohio Casualty\u2019s stated assumption that Wilson would forgo any UM/UIM claim in favor of a claim under the workers\u2019 compensation system did not relieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>it of its duty of good faith; only with full knowledge of his options could Wilson rationally have chosen among his available remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 12} Ohio Casualty cites <em>Angel v. </em>Reed<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for the proposition that the onus is on the insured to inquire about the limitations period for UM/UIM coverage. In <em>Angel, </em>the tortfeasor had misled the plaintiff, claiming that he had been insured under a policy with Nationwide Insurance Company.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Upon discovering that the tortfeasor had not been insured, the plaintiff filed a UM/UIM claim under her own policy with Allstate Insurance Company.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 13} Although the UM/UIM claim with Allstate had been filed beyond the contractual limitation period, the plaintiff claimed that she had been unaware that the tortfeasor had been an uninsured motorist. She argued that the limitations period in the Allstate policy should therefore have been tolled.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Ohio rejected that argument, holding that it had been the insured\u2019s duty to inquire of the <em>tortfeasor\u2019s </em>insurer whether the tortfeasor had been insured.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 14} <em>Angel </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar. In <em>Angel, </em>the issue was whether the insured had a duty to inquire of the tortfeasor\u2019s purported insurer about the tortfeasor\u2019s status. The case did not address whether the insured had a duty to inquire about a limitation period that was included in the insured\u2019s policy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">{\u00b6 15} Furthermore, the insurer in <em>Angel </em>had not been aware of the plaintiffs UM/UIM claim within the contractual limitations period. In this case, Ohio Casualty was aware of Wilson\u2019s potential claim but did not inform him of the limitations period until after it had expired. Accordingly, the holding in <em>Angel </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 16} Ohio Casualty nonetheless argues that the notice requirement should apply only to the policyholder itself and not to a third-party beneficiary such as Wilson. But to restrict the notice requirement to the policyholder itself would be to ignore the contractual duty that the insurer owes to insureds other than the policyholder. Moreover, the policyholder, as a signatory to the insurance policy, would in most cases have notice of the limitations period without having to be specifically alerted to the provision by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>{\u00b6 17} And while Ohio Casualty argues that it would be unduly burdensome to inform every insured of the shortened limitations period, our holding does not reach that far. Only when the insurer is notified that the insured has a claim under the UM/UIM provisions of a policy must the insurer inform the insured of the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 18} Accordingly, we hold that where the insurer has been made aware that an insured has a potential claim under a policy providing UM/UIM coverage, the insurer must inform the insured of any applicable limitations period contained in the policy. The insurer\u2019s duty may be fulfilled by providing the insured with a copy of the policy or by other means reasonably calculated to apprise the insured of his rights under the policy. Unless the insurer fulfills that duty, the contractual limitations period is unenforceable. We emphasize that our holding is limited to the specific factual situation presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 19} The assignment of error is sustained. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-8\">Cunningham and Dinkelacker, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">.
