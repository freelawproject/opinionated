The only issues involved on the hearing were the degree of the claimant\u2019s disability resulting from the injuries and the amount of his weekly wages. The deputy director found the claimant\u2019s average weekly wages to be $32.98 and found that he suffered a 40 percent partial loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>of use of his right hand, and based an award on such findings. The full board, on appeal, affirmed the deputy director\u2019s award. On the claimant\u2019s appeal to the superior court the board\u2019s award was affirmed, and the claimant excepts.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b502-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Felton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY-\">1. Without setting out the evidence, suffice it to say that there was sufficient competent evidence to authorize the finding that the claimant suffered only a 40 percent loss of use of his right hand as a result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">2. Where the evidence shows that the claimant did not work in his employment during substantially the whole of 13 weeks immediately preceding the injury, and the claimant himself introduced the evidence showing the wages of a similar employee in the same employment, who had worked substantially the whole of such 13 weeks, the claimant cannot complain that the superior court erred in affirming the board\u2019s award, basing the claimant\u2019s average weekly wages on that of the similar employee as prescribed by Code (Ann. Supp.) \u00a7 114-402 (2) instead of using the formula prescribed in Code (Ann. Supp.) \u00a7 114-402 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The court did not err in affirming the board\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AaT\">\n<em>Sutton, C.
