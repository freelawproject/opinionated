The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted, on res judicata grounds, the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because (1) the defendant had no right to file a second motion for summary judgment after the court previously denied a similar motion and (2) the plaintiffs state law claim was never disposed of in the federal court action because that court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction. We disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s first claim, but agree with his second claim and reverse the judgment on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The defendant employed the plaintiff from 1951 through 1988. In April, 1978, the plaintiff suffered a work-related injury to his back. He received workers\u2019 compensation benefits and took a medical leave for several weeks before returning to work. Between 1978 and 1988, the plaintiff reinjured his back on several occasions and was unable to work for extended periods of time. The defendant eventually terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment in April, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in February, 1989. The first count alleged a violation of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, and the second count alleged a breach of an implied employment contract. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in November, 1989, asking the District Court to dismiss \u201cany and all causes of action.\u201d The motion also specifically requested that that court \u201cdecline to exercise pendent jurisdiction with regard to [the] plaintiffs state law claim of breach of implied employment contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not oppose the defendant\u2019s motion. In February, 1990, the District Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, without a written opinion, \u201cafter careful review and absent objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">After the plaintiffs motion for relief from the judgment was denied, he commenced the present action in the Superior Court. The complaint alleged breach of implied contract in addition to five other counts. In March, 1995, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment based on collateral estoppel. The motion asserted that the issues in the plaintiffs complaint had been litigated and decided in the federal court action. The court denied the motion, and the defendant filed a second motion for summary judgment based on the related doctrine of res judicata. The second motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court should not have entertained the defendant\u2019s second motion for summary judgment because the court had denied a prior motion that was based on similar grounds. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The plaintiff asserts that the language of Practice Book \u00a7 379,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which uses the singular article \u201ca\u201d before the words \u201csummary judgment,\u201d precludes a party from filing more than one motion for summary judgment. There is nothing in the rules of practice or in our case law, however, that specifically restricts a party to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>summary judgment motion. Our Supreme Court \u201cfound nothing in our rules of practice that prohibited the refiling [of a motion for summary judgment] and looked to the federal rules for guidance. . . . [T]he federal courts have held that it is not an abuse of discretion or a violation of the doctrine of the \u2018law of the case\u2019 for a trial judge to reconsider a motion for summary judgment that has previously been denied, particularly where new evidence has been presented which was not before the court at the time of the original motion, or a clarification of the law has since occurred.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Mac\u2019s Car City, Inc. </em>v. <em>American National Bank, </em>205 Conn. 255, 260-61, 532 A.2d 1302 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We discern no reason why a second motion for summary judgment, on a different ground, should not be considered. The only restriction on a party seeking a summary judgment, according to \u00a7 379, is that \u201cthe party must obtain the court\u2019s permission to file a motion for summary judgment after the case has been assigned to trial.\u201d In this case, the defendant obtained the trial court\u2019s permission to file the second motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The plaintiff also argues that the court should not have entertained the defendant\u2019s second motion for summary judgment for reasons of judicial economy. We note that our Supreme Court has cautioned against \u201cfuture unnecessary piecemeal litigation brought on by the repeated filing of successive motions for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Mac\u2019s Car City, Inc. </em>v. <em>American National Bank, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 262. It has also recognized, however, that the desire for judicial efficiency inherent in the summary judgment procedure would be frustrated if parties were forced to try a case where there was no real issue to be tried. <em>Kakadelis </em>v. <em>DeFabritis, </em>191 Conn. 276, 281, 464 A.2d 57 (1983); <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Kielak, </em>160 Conn. 14, 16, 273 A.2d 716 (1970); <em>Dorazio </em>v. <em>M. B. Foster Electric Co., </em>157 Conn. 226, 228, 253 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>A.2d 22 (1968). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly considered the defendant\u2019s second motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds of res judicata<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> since the plaintiffs state law claim was never litigated in the federal court action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The standard of review for summary judgment is well established. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 384 mandates that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . .\u2019\u2019(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fernandez </em>v. <em>Standard Fire Ins. Co., </em>44 Conn. App. 220, 222, 688 A.2d 349 (1997). Therefore, to determine whether summary judgment was properly granted in the present case, we must first determine whether the federal court exercised pendent jurisdiction and rendered judgment on the merits of the plaintiffs state law claim when it granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">For a federal court to have jurisdiction over an entire action, including any state law claims, the court must exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state law claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pendent jurisdiction may be exercised whenever the federal and state law claims derive from a commonnucleus of operative facts and are such that a plaintiff would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding. Id. The <em>Gibbs </em>court emphasized, however, that pendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of the plaintiffs right. Therefore, a federal court may decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over a party\u2019s state law claims. That is precisely what occurred in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In its motion for summary judgment in the federal court action, the defendant specifically asked the federal court to decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the plaintiffs state law claim. The defendant now argues,, however, that the federal court actually granted the defendant\u2019s broader request for the court to \u201cdismiss any and all actions,\u201d including the plaintiffs state law claim, in the summary judgment proceeding. Since the plaintiff did not object to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we assume that the federal court granted each request of the moving party when it granted the motion. In doing so, the court necessarily declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the implied breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The defendant asserts that the plaintiffs failure to file any pleadings in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the federal court, or to appeal from that judgment, should preclude the plaintiff from any attack on the federal summary judgment. It is significant that the defendant is responsible for any ambiguity in this matter. Any uncertainty as to whether summary judgment entered on the plaintiffs state law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>claim results from contradictory wording of the motion for summary judgment. Basic fairness dictates that confusion created by the defendant should not deprive the plaintiff of his day in court to pursue his state law claim. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s motion can be fairly read in a noncontradictory way, that is, as a request that all claims except the state law claim be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The defendant\u2019s final contention is that the federal court exercised pendent jurisdiction over the plaintiffs state law claim and dismissed it on the merits because \u201cwhere a federal court declines to exercise jurisdiction over pendent state claims it will specifically say so.\u201d Our review of federal cases involving pendent state law claims reveals that federal courts also typically state when they <em>are </em>exercising pendent jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>124 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 1997); <em>Losquadro </em>v. <em>FGH Realty Credit Corp., </em>959 F. Sup. 152, 160 (E.D.N.Y. 1997); <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>959 F. Sup. 125, 134 (D. Conn. 1997); <em>Tower Air, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp., </em>956 F. Sup. 270, 287 (E.D.N.Y. 1996); <em>Aquinas </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp., </em>940 F. Sup. 73, 79 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). Because federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction; see <em>Aldinger </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>427 U.S. 1, 96 S. Ct. 2413, 49 L. Ed. 2d 276 (1976); <em>Verlinden B.V. </em>v. <em>Central Bank of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 320, 321 (2d Cir. 1981), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 461 U.S. 480, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1983), it is unlikely that the court would have exercised pendent jurisdiction without saying so.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Binding precedent also makes it unlikely that the federal court exercised pendent jurisdiction. \u201cThe Second Circuit has held that absent exceptional circumstances, where federal claims are disposed of [prior to trial], courts should abstain from exercising pendent jurisdiction. <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. </em>v. <em>Saxony Heights Realty, </em>777 F. Sup. 228, 240 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (quoting <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Time Life Films, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 44, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>53 [2d Cir.], cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S. Ct. 2278, 90 L. Ed. 2d 721 [1986]).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Rytman, </em>241 Conn. 24, 50, 694 A.2d 1246 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Furthermore, \u201c[i]n this district, the courts have been particularly reluctant to exercise pendent jurisdiction over state law claims in ADEA suits.\u201d <em>Koehler </em>v. <em>Chesebrough-Ponds, Inc., </em>705 F. Sup. 721, 722 (D. Conn. 1988). The <em>Koehler </em>court relied on the following cases in reaching this conclusion: <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>J.M. Ney Co., </em>United States District Court, Docket No. H85-653 (JAC) (D. Conn. March 25, 1987) (Conn. L. Trib. No. 20, p. 38) (dismissing pendent claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of employment contract); Herbst <em>v. Chesebrough-Ponds, </em>Inc., United States District Court, Docket No. H85-481 (TEC) (D. Conn. September 16, 1986) (dismissing pendent claims for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional infliction of emotional distress); <em>Ulan </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>United States District Court, Docket No. H86-258 (JAC) (D. Conn. January 12, 1988) (dismissing pendent claims for breach of contract, fraud and misrepresentation); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Feroleto Steel Co., </em>659 F. Sup. 303, 304-305 (D. Conn. 1986) (dismissing plaintiffs public policy discharge claim); and <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>American Cyanamid Co., </em>472 F. Sup. 298, 306 (D. Conn. 1979). We may fairly presume that the district judge was aware of the foregoing cases and probably would not have exercised pendent jurisdiction, sub silentio, after dismissing the federal ADEA claims. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiffs state law claim was never litigated in federal court and, therefore, summary judgment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> The defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment states in relevant part: \u201c[T]he defendant, Nash Engineering Company . . . moves this Court, pursuant to Fed.
