On December 21, 1995, the trial court approved a written agreement entered into by the parties that resolved the issues of custody and visitation. On April 30, 1996, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>marriage was dissolved and the agreement, which gave sole custody of the minor, Robert T. Lowe III, to the plaintiff father and sole custody of the minors, Christopher Lowe and Lauren Lowe, to the defendant mother, was incorporated into the court\u2019s judgment. The court\u2019s judgment also resolved issues involving, inter aha, child support, alimony, medical insurance, postmajority education, and the division of marital property. The basis of the order requiring the plaintiff to pay for the postmajority education of the three children was the parties\u2019 oral stipulation during trial that the plaintiff would do so to the extent he is financially able.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We reverse the judgment and remand the case to the trial court as to the first issue and affirm the judgment in all other aspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The most important claim before us is the plaintiffs assertion that the trial court improperly held him responsible for the postmajority education of the children in the absence of a written agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>enforce the parties\u2019 oral stipulation that the plaintiff would pay for the postmajority education of the children because General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires that agreements for postmajority support be in writing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u201cIt is now axiomatic that support for a minor child extends to age eighteen years only . . . .\u201d <em>Arseniadis </em>v. <em>Arseniadis, </em>2 Conn. App. 239, 243, 477 A.2d 152 (1984). \u201cThe legislature amended General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 (then \u00a7 46-49) in order to provide for the support of postmajority children only if there is an agreement to do so and if it is in writing.\u201d Id., 244. \u201cThe language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and we cannot by our construction substitute other words for the words \u2018in writing.\u2019 \u201d Id., 246. \u201cAbsent ... a written agreement by the parties, the court does not have jurisdiction to order payment of child support beyond the age of majority and may not enforce such an order.\u201d <em>Albrecht </em>v. <em>Albrecht, </em>19 Conn. App. 146, 155, 562 A.2d 528, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 813, 565 A.2d 534 (1989); see <em>Arseniadis </em>v. <em>Arseniadis, </em>supra, 243. \u201cA lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>time and cannot be waived by either party. . . . [Further], [t]he parties to an action cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court by their consent, silence, waiver or private agreement.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Although we recognize that often \u201c \u2018[t]he rendering of a judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other\u2019 <em>Cuneo </em>v. <em>Cuneo, </em>12 Conn. App. 702, 710, 533 A.2d 1226 (1987), quoting <em>Ehrenkranz </em>v. <em>Ehrenkranz, 2 </em>Conn. App. 416, 424, 479 A.2d 826 (1984); this is not such a case. The plaintiff offered to pay for the children\u2019s postmajority education, and the trial court simply incorporated that offer into its proper orders. Moreover, the trial court had no jurisdiction and, therefore, no discretion, to order postmajority support. As a result, the order of postmajority support is separate and distinct from the court\u2019s proper orders of alimony and premajority support. See <em>Zern </em>v. <em>Zern, </em>15 Conn. App. 292, 296-97, 544 A.2d 244 (1988). Because the court had no discretion to award the postmajority support and because the other awards were appropriate, a remand to review all of the financial orders is unnecessary. See <em>Cuneo </em>v. <em>Cuneo, </em>supra, 710-11. A remand with direction to vacate the meaningless portion of the order would in no way affect the remaining appropriate judgment rendered; it had no impact aad, therefore, severance is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">In his second claim, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court improperly found that a substantial change of circumstances will occur when the parties\u2019 elder son graduates from high school. The plaintiff argues that this finding involves impermissible speculation into the future.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>It is a general rule that \u201c[i]n a dissolution action, marital property is valued as of the date of dissolution .... <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>165 Conn. 742, 748-49, 345 A.2d 21 (1974); <em>Cuneo </em>v. <em>Cuneo </em>[supra, 12 Conn. App. 702], \u2018[This] requirement is simply part of the broader principle that the financial awards in a marital dissolution case should be based on the parties\u2019 current financial circumstances to the extent reasonably possible.\u2019 <em>Cuneo </em>v. <em>Cuneo, </em>supra, 709; see Practice Book \u00a7 463.\u201d <em>Zern </em>v. <em>Zern, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s financial awards were based solely on the present financial circumstances of the parties. Even if we assume, arguendo, that the trial court made an impermissible finding by speculating as to the future financial circumstances of the parties, the trial court\u2019s purported finding with regard to the plaintiffs elder son was extraneous and is not binding on the parties because the issue of modification was not properly before the trial court. See <em>Chester </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>46 Conn. App. 148, 150, 698 A.2d 370 (1997). If and when the elder son graduates from high school, or any other change of circumstances occurs, either party seeking a modification of alimony or support orders would have to prove to the trial court that a substantial change in circumstances occurred pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we are unpersuaded by the plaintiffs argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The plaintiffs third claim is that the trial court improperly relied on previous proceedings that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>not made part of the trial record in making its orders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the trial court may take judicial notice only of pertinent facts disclosed by the record in the case before it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201cThe trial court has the power to take judicial notice of court files of other actions between the same parties. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 581, 591, 409 A.2d 1029 (1979).\u201d <em>In re Mark C, </em>28 Conn. App. 247, 253, 610 A.2d 181, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 922, 614 A.2d 823 (1992); see <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>213 Conn. 289, 293, 567 A.2d 1187 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 939, 110 S. Ct. 3220, 110 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1990) (court took judicial notice of court files from prior proceeding between parties even though files not formally made part of record at trial); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>186 Conn. 118, 124, 439 A.2d 447 (1982) (court considered previous contempt orders when considering issue of custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In the present case, the trial court properly took judicial notice of prior proceedings pertaining to the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. Therefore, the plaintiffs claim is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">In the plaintiffs fifth and seventh claims, he challenges the trial court\u2019s factual findings that his commissions would increase in the future and that his excessive drinking and involvement with another woman had caused the marital breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201cThe scope of our review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of its broad discretion in domestic relations cases is limited to the questions of whether the [trial] court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have concluded as it did. . . . Moreover, we do not retry the facts. ... In determining whether the trial court could reasonably conclude as it did on the evidence before it, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . The conclusions which we might reach, were we sitting as the trial court, are irrelevant.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Leo </em>v. <em>Leo, </em>197 Conn. 1, 4-5, 495 A.2d 704 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">After a full review of the record, transcript and briefs, we conclude that the trial court could reasonably have concluded as it did. We affirm the findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The plaintiffs fourth, sixth and tenth claims are that the trial court improperly included \u201cone-time bonus money\u201d paid to the plaintiff and \u201cbonus money\u201d withheld by his employer and not yet paid as income in calculating alimony and child support,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> improperly calculated his gross and net income,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and failed to designate which part of the arrearage owed by him was alimony and which part was support.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u201cIt is the appellant\u2019s burden to supply us with a record adequate to provide a proper review, and, [w]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is unclear, proper utilization of the motion for articulation serves to dispel any such ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ashton </em>v. <em>Ashton, </em>31 Conn. App. 736, 741, 627 A.2d 943, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 901, 634 A.2d 295 (1993). \u201cOur role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court, either on its own or in response to a proper motion for articulation, any decision made by us respecting this claim would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westfall </em>v. <em>Westfall, </em>46 Conn. App. 182, 184, 698 A.2d 927 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">It was the plaintiffs burden, as appellant, to file a motion for articulation that would clarify the trial court\u2019s basis for and reasoning behind its calculations. See Practice Book \u00a7 4051; <em>Gelormino </em>v. <em>Liberman, </em>36 Conn. App. 153, 154, 649 A.2d 259, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 946, 653 A.2d 826 (1994). Without such an articulation, it is unclear how the trial court calculated net income, which part of the arrearage was alimony and which part was support, and whether the bonus money was included in the calculation of net income.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>is no adequate record permitting review of those claims, and the plaintiff failed to file a motion for articulation. Therefore, we decline to review the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In the plaintiffs eighth claim, he asserts that the trial court improperly failed to appoint separate counsel for the three children. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the plaintiff did not raise this issue at trial, he seeks review pursuant to the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He argues that, because his elder son, in his custody, was competing for child support money with the two younger children in the custody of the defendant, it was plain error and a violation of the elder son\u2019s due process rights to fail to appoint separate counsel for him. We conclude that the plaintiff lacks standing to assert the rights of his son on appeal and, therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Further facts are pertinent to the resolution of the threshold issue of standing. In the present case, the defendant filed a motion requesting that the trial court appoint counsel for the three minor children, and the court, in its discretion, granted the motion and appointed counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Subsequent to the judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the filing of this appeal, the trial court granted the children\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw because the trial court found, on the basis of counsel\u2019s representations, that there would be a conflict of interest with regard to any postjudgment motions or appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u201c \u2018The issue of standing implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. . . . Standing focuses on the party seeking to be heard and not on the issues that party wants to have heard. . . . The question of standing does not involve an inquiry into the merits of the case.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Taff v. Bettcher, </em>35 Conn. App. 421, 424-25, 646 A.2d 875 (1994). In addition, \u201c[o]ur case law is . . . clear that a person cannot gain standing by asserting the due process rights possessed by another individual. It is axiomatic that due process rights are personal, and cannot be asserted vicariously. . . . Thus, once the court finds it appropriate to appoint counsel for the minor child, the representation is the child\u2019s entitlement, not the parent\u2019s.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 425-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The plaintiff did not claim, nor did he demonstrate to the trial court, that the trial court\u2019s failure to appoint separate counsel would in any way prejudice his own case. See <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>44 Conn. App. 370, 375-76, 689 A.2d 509, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 913, 696 A.2d 985 (1997). It is clear that the plaintiff lacks standing to assert the rights of his elder son on appeal. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">In the plaintiffs ninth claim, he asserts that the trial court improperly failed to award child support for the elder son, who lives with the plaintiff, and failed to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the Connecticut guidelines for child support. After a full review of the record, we are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The trial court specifically stated in its memorandum of decision that the child support guidelines were carefully considered.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, the court reduced its order of child support for the two children in the custody of the defendant pursuant to the guidelines for child support because of the plaintiffs obligation to support his elder son.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, the reduction of support for the two children in the care of the defendant was, in effect, the award for the child in the care of the plaintiff. As a result, the plaintiffs claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except as modified to eliminate the award of postmajority education expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\"><em> </em>On direct examination of the plaintiff, counsel asked questions regarding the college education of the elder son. The plaintiff stated that he told his son to maintain high grades in order to qualify for scholarships. The following colloquy then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Would you like to see your other children go on with their formal education?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes, I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: And, would you like to pay the tuition if any is necessary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: To the extent that I\u2019m able.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-14\">The plaintiff, the defendant and the children subsequently agreed to the plaintiffs offer. Counsel for the children agreed to reduce the parties\u2019 agreement to writing, but the trial court replied: \u201cI\u2019d just make it as part of my orders. Now, as I understand it, this agreement is simply that Mr. Lowe will pay for the college expenses of the children to the extent he is financially able, is that right?\u201d The plaintiff and defendant responded affirmatively.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-15\"> The plaintiff has raised nine other issues concerning various procedural and evidentiary rulings of the trial court. Some claims also rest on factual findings of the trial court and factual assumptions that the court rejected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cAll of them suffer from the difficulty that appellate pursuit of so large a number of issues forecloses the opportunity for fully reasoned discussion of pivotal substantive concerns. A shotgun approach does a disservice both to this court and to the party on whose behalf it is presented.\u201d <em>Latham &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 297, 300, 589 A.2d 337 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the agreement is in writing and provides for the care, education, maintenance or support of a child beyond the age of eighteen, it may also be incorporated or otherwise made a part of any such order and shall be enforceable to the same extent as any other provision of such order or decree, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1-ld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">General Statutes \u00a7 1-ld provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute . . . the terms \u2018minor\u2019, \u2018infant\u2019 and \u2018infancy\u2019 shall be deemed to refer to a person under the age of eighteen years and any person eighteen years of age or over shall be an adult for all purposes whatsoever . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\"> The trial court stated in its memorandum of decision that the parties\u2019 elder son \u201cwill graduate from high school in June of 1997.

The trial court relied on court files, transcripts and previous orders of the trial court in making the aforementioned references. Counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged at trial that as long as prior proceedings are \u201crelevant and otherwise admissible, \u201d then the trial court may take judicial notice of such proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> The plaintiff further argues that the trial court treated such money as a marital asset and conveyed it as part of the property division, thus improperly \u201cdouble-counting\u201d the money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b391-10\"> The plaintiff states in his brief that \u201c[b]ecause the court made no qualifying remarks as to how it came about the finding of the plaintiffs gross and net income, and did not indicate whether it felt that these numbers were actual, projected or based on earning capacity, the evidential underpinnings for the conclusion drawn by the court are inadequate . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\"> Although the plaintiff frames his argument by stating that the trial court improperly failed to designate which part of the arrearage was alimony and which part was support, the question presented by his argument is whether the trial court improperly calculated his true net income. This is evident in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>that the plaintiff cites no authority for his assertion that the trial court must designate the arrearage in terms of alimony and support, and argues in his brief that \u201c[b]ecause the court did not designate which portion is alimony and which portion is child support, the court could not have taken into account the tax implications of the orders that it made, and therefore would have been unable to calculate the true net income of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> The trial court states in its memorandum of decision that the net income was \u201cbased on the financial affidavits submitted by the plaintiff to the court and dated March 6, 1996, and March 12, 1996.\u201d The plaintiff submitted separate affidavits on both dates for weekly income including and excluding bonus money. Therefore, it is unclear whether the trial court included or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>excluded bonus money from its calculation of net income. Moreover, this ambiguity precludes this court from determining whether the bonus money was \u201cdouble-counted,\u201d because it is unclear whether it was counted at all for purposes of net income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\"> The plaintiff originally states in his brief that the trial court failed to appoint separate counsel for the three children.
