We agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of uncharged misconduct and that the trial court improperly refused to give a lesser included offense instruction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On the basis of the evidence adduced at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim and her husband lived in an apartment complex on Crystal Avenue in New London at the same time that the defendant lived in the complex with his girlfriend. The defendant first spoke with the victim when he came into the business where she worked and applied for a job. She did not initially recognize him, but he recognized her and asked if she lived at the Crystal Avenue apartments. For several months after this meeting, the defendant and the victim occasionally had conversations in the parking area while the defendant worked on cars. Among other things, they discussed the victim\u2019s marital problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">When the defendant moved from the complex, he gave the victim his pager number. Some time later, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>April 11, 1995, the victim, after discussing it with her husband, paged the defendant to see if he could fix her car. The defendant called in response to the page and offered to look at the car. The victim then drove the car to the defendant\u2019s residence; her husband, who was not feeling well, stayed at their apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The victim met the defendant at a grocery store, since she was not familiar with the area, and he led her to Myrock Avenue, a dead-end street in Waterford. The defendant was living there with a friend, Todd Cooms. When they arrived at Myrock Avenue, at around 6:30 or 7 p.m., it was still daylight.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">For at least one hour, the defendant worked on the car while the victim watched. Cooms arrived and went into the residence. Before the defendant stopped working on the victim\u2019s car, Cooms\u2019 girlfriend, Laurie Sullivan, arrived. Cooms, Sullivan and the defendant decided to go to a pub nearby and invited the victim to join them. She agreed, and the defendant rode in the victim\u2019s car while Cooms rode in Sullivan\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">They spent several hours at the pub, socializing and drinking beer and shots of liquor. During that time, the victim consumed two to three beers, and the defendant drank about six beers. The victim also had a sip of liquor, and the defendant had a shot and the remainder of the victim\u2019s shot. The victim and Sullivan spent most of the time talking, while Cooms and the defendant shot pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">During the evening, the defendant told the victim how pretty she was and that it was a shame she was married. He also put his hand on her leg and, at one point, told her he was going to have to kiss her. At trial, the victim described his behavior as lewd and obnoxious. The victim \u201cshrugged it off\u201d and attributed the defendant\u2019s behavior to his consumption of alcohol. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>She described the defendant as having a \u201cbuzz\u201d but not being drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">At about 11 p.m., Sullivan said that she had to leave, and Cooms decided to drive her home because of her alcohol consumption. Cooms said that he would need a ride from her house. The victim agreed to follow him and the defendant rode with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Along the way, when they stopped for a soda at a convenience store, the defendant tried to kiss the victim and touched her breast. She pulled away from him and pushed away his hand. She testified that she was not concerned because she felt able to take care of herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">After Cooms dropped off Sullivan and her car, the three returned to the pub. The victim had another beer and the defendant had several more beers. They left the pub at around midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The victim drove Cooms and the defendant to their residence on Myrock Avenue. There, the defendant, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, told Cooms to get out, which he did. The defendant asked the victim to drive to the end of the cul-de-sac about one quarter of a mile away, which she did. When she had gone about three quarters of the way around the circle at the end of the street, the defendant asked her to stop. Thinking the defendant was about to apologize for his earlier conduct, she stopped the car but left the engine running with the transmission in gear and the clutch depressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">The defendant put his hand behind the back of the victim\u2019s head and tried to kiss her. She said no. He looked in her eyes and appeared to hesitate three times before finally saying, \u201cHow about just a blow job?\u201d The victim responded, \u201cAh, you\u2019re drunk. No, I don\u2019t think so, you know.\u201d The defendant forcefully grabbed her hair on the back of her head and pulled her over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>car console toward his lap. With his other hand, he groped her breasts and crotch. Two or three times, he tried to force the victim\u2019s head into his lap. She told him no and tried to push away and turned her head away from him. During most of the struggle, the defendant held her by her hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">They argued and fought, and the victim eventually released the clutch, causing the car to stall. She asked that he leave the car but he would not. Two or three times, she tried to reach for the door, but he pulled her back by her hair. Fifteen to twenty minutes after the struggle began, she succeeded in opening the door and got her feet out. The defendant grabbed her by her hair and shirt, and she \u201cpushed and pulled with everything [she] had.\u201d Her shirt ripped in the defendant\u2019s hand as she exited the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">After escaping, the victim ran. She started toward the convenience store but, realizing it would be closed, ran to Cooms\u2019 house. She told Cooms that the defendant tried to rape her. Cooms saw that she was crying and distraught, and her shirt was tom. Moments later, the defendant came to the door. The victim asked that Cooms not let him in, but Cooms said that he had to, since the defendant lived there. The defendant tried to apologize. The defendant held her, stroking the back of her hair, as he told her he was sorry. She cried and was \u201cpetrified, and anything that [she] could do to get closer to the outside door [she] would do.\u201d The defendant offered to walk her home, but she refused and Cooms walked with her. Cooms felt that she was too upset to drive and drove her home in her car. When they went by the the defendant\u2019s residence, his pickup truck, which had been there moments earlier, was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Cooms went into the victim\u2019s home and explained to her husband what had happened. The police were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>called. The Waterford officer who interviewed the victim observed that her shirt was tom and that she had pronounced red marks on her left wrist. The victim, her husband, Cooms and the investigating officer arrived at the Waterford police station at approximately 1:40 a.m. At that same time, the officer was notified by radio that the defendant had been stopped by another officer and was being detained at an intersection in New London. The officer took the victim in his police car to that location, where she immediately identified the defendant and began to cry uncontrollably.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The Waterford police officer who stopped the defendant had observed the defendant\u2019s pickup truck occupied by two individuals on Willets Avenue. Hope Becker and the defendant were the occupants of the tmck. The officer did not observe any erratic operation, and the defendant pulled to the curb in an orderly fashion. The defendant was responsive to the officer\u2019s directions, gave his license as requested and responded appropriately to inquiries. After the officer transported the defendant to the Waterford police department, he became uncooperative and was placed in a cell. The officer concluded that the defendant\u2019s demeanor might have been partially related to the alcohol he had consumed. At about 2:30 a.m., when the officers went to see if the defendant had calmed down, they could not rouse him.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Hope Becker was a prostitute with a drag habit who admitted to having consensual sex with the defendant in the early morning of April 12,1995, after the incident with the victim. She had felony convictions for narcotics violations and for a failure to appear, and was on probation with other criminal charges pending at the time the defendant was arrested. She had used cocaine on the night of April 11 but was no longer high when she was with the defendant. At approximately 1 a.m., on April 12, the defendant solicited her for prostitution in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>front of her residence on Jay Street in New London. She agreed to perform oral sex for $20. She entered his pickup truck, and he drove to Myrock Avenue, stopping first at an automatic teller machine to get $20. The defendant proceeded to the end of the cul-de-sac, where he stopped the truck. The defendant had Becker get on the floor of the truck. She testified that the defendant was \u201cvery dominant, veiy aggressive to the point that he scared me.\u201d She said the defendant \u201chad a hold on the back of my head and his fingers entwined in my hair, veiy roughly. When I would try to pull my head up, he would force my head back down, very aggressive. I was crying. I asked to stop. You know, let me catch my breath for a second. And he was telling me that I had been paid. You know, do my job.\u201d After she finished, she apologized for her conduct \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t feel it was professional. But I did explain to him that I had recently been raped, and that I was very touchy, and skittish and that he scared me.\u201d The defendant apologized for scaring her. He was driving her back to her residence when he was stopped by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">At trial, the state offered Becker\u2019s testimony to prove motive and intent and also to show that the defendant had used force against the victim earlier that night. The trial court initially excluded the testimony but, following a request to reconsider its ruling, the trial court reversed its earlier ruling and allowed the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence testimony of misconduct concerning his patronizing a prostitute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the evidence of the other misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>is not relevant to intent or motive involving sexual assault in the first degree or kidnapping in the first degree. The basis of the defendant\u2019s argument is that evidence involving consensual sex is not relevant to proving compelled sex. The defendant claims that Becker\u2019s testimony had no bearing on the defendant\u2019s motive or intent for kidnapping and sexual assault because, since the state admitted that Becker acted under her own free will, there was no evidence of force used to compel sexual intercourse. The defendant asserts that the state\u2019s claim that the sexual assault was motivated by a desire for sexual gratification is flawed because the gravamen of the crime of sexual assault is the use of force to compel sexual acts. The intent required for sexual assault is not sexual gratification but the intent to use force. Citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>3 Conn. App. 148, 153, 485 A.2d 1343 (1985),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant states that \u201c[t]he absence of the use of force to compel Becker to engage in intercourse makes the motive for and intent behind this misconduct completely different from that the state sought to prove in the charged offense.\u201d The defendant also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the other misconduct evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect, especially because the misconduct involved a drug-addicted prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Evidence of other misconduct \u201cis inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>against him. . . . The rationale of this rule is to guard against its use merely to show an evil disposition of an accused, and especially the predisposition to commit the crime with which he is now charged.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 161, 665 A.2d 63 (1995); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>43 Conn. App. 830, 835-37, 687 A.2d 544 (1996). There are exceptions to the general rule; such evidence is admissible for other purposes, such as to show identity, malice or a system of criminal activity, or an element of the crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 162; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">One exception to the general rule of inadmissibility of other misconduct evidence is that such evidence is admissible to prove motive. \u201c[T]here are two components to relevant evidence: materiality and probative value. . . . [E]vidence is relevant if it has a tendency to establish the existence of a material fact. . . . Evidence of motive is a highly relevant factor for assessing the guilt or innocence of a defendant. . . . [E]vidence otherwise relevant and material is not rendered inadmissible because it tends to prove that an accused committed other crimes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>42 Conn. App. 41, 49, 680 A.2d 1340 (1996). \u201c \u2018Motive is a fact which may be inferred from circumstances; hence the circumstances from which it may be inferred are relevant.\u2019 \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>24 Conn. App. 330, 336, 588 A.2d 648, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 903, 593 A.2d 132 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Another exception is that such evidence is admissible to show intent. \u201cIntent, or any other essential element of a crime, is always at issue unless directly and explicitly admitted before the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>224 Conn. 347, 356, 618 A.2d 513 (1993). \u201cBecause intent is almost always proved, if at all, by circumstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>evidence, [other] misconduct evidence, where available, is often relied upon.\u201d Id., 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Whether evidence of other misconduct is admissible depends on a two part test: (1) the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions to the propensity rule, and (2) the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 162; <em>State </em>v. <em>Madore, </em>45 Conn. App. 512, 519, 696 A.2d 1293 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The state argues that the evidence of the other misconduct is relevant to intent and motive. Although admitting that \u201c[s]exual assault is generally a crime of dominance and violence, not of passion,\u201d the state, in its brief, contends that the evidence is probative and that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial impact. The state argues that the evidence has probative value for two reasons. First, the state argues that it is probative because of the similarities between the charged and uncharged offenses. These similarities concern the particular sex act referred to in both instances, the location, i.e., the end of the cul-de-sac on Myrock Avenue, the positions of the persons within the vehicles, the defendant\u2019s manner of grabbing the hair of the two women and the defendant\u2019s aggressiveness. Second, the state claims that Becker\u2019s characterization of the defendant\u2019s conduct toward her as \u201cdominant\u201d and \u201cvery aggressive\u201d shows a motive to achieve sexual gratification by force and an intent to achieve that goal. While recognizing that \u201cit is a close call\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 426, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993); we agree with the state because we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its broad discretion when it concluded that the evidence was relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions to the propensity rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The defendant asserts that, in general, the usual motive of perpetrators of sexual assault is to exert violence upon and to exercise control of a victim, and that the intent is to gain a sense of power and not to achieve sexual gratification.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if we assume, arguendo, that that is true, here the other misconduct evidence showed that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cdominant\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d toward an intended female object of this aggression, that the defendant held her hair tightly and otherwise treated Becker roughly, and that the defendant told Becker to do something that because of her attempt to stop and her tears, she appeared at least for a short time unwilling to do. We cannot conclude that the trial court was incorrect in ruling that the evidence may have tended to show that the defendant had the intent to exert aggressive or violent control and that his intent was to achieve a sense of dominance, via a particular method, over persons with less power.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The cases cited by the defendant are more applicable to the admissibility of evidence of a common scheme than, as here, to the admissibility of evidence of motive and intent. Both our Supreme Court and this court have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>commented on the admissibility of evidence of consensual sexual conduct in cases involving charges of non-consensual sexual conduct. Specifically, the Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. Esposito, 192 Conn. 166, 172-73, 471 A.2d 949 (1984), stated that \u201c[i]f the common plan or scheme of the actor embraces compelled sexual intercourse then evidence tending to show the common scheme will also tend to establish the doing of the forbidden conduct. . . . Since conceptually compulsion and consent are antonymous in effect, if not in meaning, it would follow that any act engaged in under compulsion would necessarily be nonconsensual. In that sense <em>evidence of a common plan or scheme to engage in compelled sexual intercourse </em>would tend to negate a defense of consent.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) This court has required that other misconduct evidence, in cases involving sexual assault in the first degree, show that \u201cthe <em>common scheme </em>involved the use or threatened use of force in order to compel sexual intercourse.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>supra, 3 Conn. App. 153. Neither court, however, has extended the applicability of their holdings beyond cases in which misconduct evidence is offered to show a common scheme or plan. Furthermore, as the defendant concedes in his brief, a lesser degree of similarity between the other misconduct evidence and the charged offenses is required where the other misconduct evidence is used to show motive and intent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morowitz, </em>200 Conn. 440, 445, 512 A.2d 175 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The second part of the propensity exception test is a determination of whether the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial impact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 166-67; <em>State </em>v. <em>Madore, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 522. We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>value of the other misconduct evidence outweighed its prejudicial impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Though the evidence was probative, its probative value was minimal. There are considerable dissimilarities between the two incidents. There was no evidence that the victim and Becker were similar in appearance or otherwise. The evidence showed some normal social interaction between the victim and the defendant prior to the incident in question, while it showed little more than a business transaction between the defendant and Becker. The victim testified that she knew the defendant before the incident; Becker did not. Most significantly, the other misconduct evidence represented an act on the part of the defendant that may have indicated to the jurors that he had a propensity to commit various sexual misconduct. \u201cIt is precisely this type of evidence which may permit the jury to draw the erroneous and prejudicial inference which the rule is meant to avoid.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>190 Conn. 104, 109, 459 A.2d 510 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We recognize that \u201c[t]he primary responsibility for conducting the prejudicial-probative balancing test rests with the trial court, and its conclusion will be disturbed only for a manifest abuse of discretion\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 162; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 43 Conn. App. 837; or where injustice appears to have been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 23, 444 A.2d 213 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 336-37. Nonetheless, \u201c[i]n admitting such evidence, the trial court\u2019s discretion is limited. . . . The trial court\u2019s discretion to admit other [misconduct] evidence imports something more than leeway in decision-making. Discretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. . . . When assessing the admissibility of other [misconduct] evidence, the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>of a mechanical test determining that the proffered evidence fits within some class of exception to the rule of nonadmissibility, may obscure sight of the underlying policy of protecting the accused against unfair prejudice. That policy ought not to evaporate through the interstices of the classification.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 356-57; <em>State </em>v. <em>Busque, </em>31 Conn. App. 120, 129-30, 623 A.2d 532 (1993), appeal dismissed, 229 Conn. 839, 643 A.2d 1281 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision concerning the probative-prejudicial balance, \u201c[w]e must determine whether the trial court properly balanced the actual relevancy of the other crimes evidence in light of the issues and the other evidence available to the prosecution against the degree to which the jury will probably be roused by the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Busque, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 130. Here, as noted, the other misconduct evidence had limited probative value. The admission of such evidence created a very strong likelihood that the jury\u2019s emotions were unduly roused.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[R]elevant evidence that is potentially prejudicial should be excluded . . . where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 337; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Busque, </em>supra, 130-31. \u201c \u2018Prejudice is not measured by the significance of the evidence which is relevant but by the impact of that which is extraneous.\u2019 St<em>ate </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 337. In this case, the other misconduct evidence included considerable evidence that was extraneous to the charged crime. For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>there was evidence that the defendant had sex with a prostitute, that the prostitute was drug-addicted, that the prostitute had been recently raped and that the defendant had scared the prostitute. \u201cEvidence is prejudicial \u2018when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. 1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 357. Much of this evidence was extraneous and was likely to rouse unduly the jury\u2019s emotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the prejudicial effect of the other misconduct evidence outweighed its minimal probative value and that its admission into evidence constituted an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u201cAlthough we conclude that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct, we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision was harmful. In a case involving an evidentiary ruling, it is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that it is more probable than not that the court\u2019s action affected the result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Busque, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 131, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>213 Conn. 422, 436, 568 A.2d 448 (1990). Some degree of prejudice inevitably accompanies the admission of evidence of a defendant\u2019s other misconduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 513, 523, 447 A.2d 396 (1982). Here, because the evidence improperly admitted was so potentially prejudicial, we cannot conclude that it was harmless. The prejudicial effect of the other misconduct evidence is apparent. \u201cAny improper evidence that may have a tendency to excite the passions, awaken the sympathy, or influence the judgment, of the jury, cannot be considered as harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra, 437; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 109; <em>State </em>v. <em>Busque, </em>supra, 131-32. We conclude that it is more probable than not that it unduly influenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the jury to believe the defendant had a proclivity to commit acts of sexual misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly denied his request to charge the jury on unlawful restraint in the second degree as a lesser included offense of kidnapping in the first degree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the specific intent required by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>kidnapping statute was negated by the defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time and, therefore, he could have been found guilty merely of unlawful restraint of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u201cThere is no fundamental constitutional right to a jury instruction on every lesser included offense . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 260, 681 A.2d 922 (1996). Rather, \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof of the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u201cIn considering whether the defendant has satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, [179 Conn. 588], we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser included offense. . . . [T]he jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested. . . . Otherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence. ... If we cannot exclude, as a matter of law, the possibility that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense, we must conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction is improper.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Abdalaziz, </em>45 Conn.

Ment &amp; R. Fracasse, Connecticut Selected Jury Instructions: Criminal (3d Ed. 1995), and the appropriate statutes. Nonetheless, the defendant claims that the trial court had discussed the issue with the prosecutor and the defendant\u2019s counsel in chambers, was aware of the defendant\u2019s request prior to formulating its charge, was thus afforded the time<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to scrutinize the requests and investigate the relevant case law and, therefore, knew the precise point to which the defendant wanted to call attention.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>235 Conn. 67, 75-77, 663 A.2d 972 (1995). The defendant also argues that the trial court cut off the defendant\u2019s explanation of the grounds justifying the request, did not pursue the matter after a break for conference in chambers, and did not specifically rely on the lack of justifying grounds in its decision to deny the request. Thus, contends the defendant, there was no finding by the trial court, nor can there be any showing, of noncompliance with Practice Book \u00a7 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u201cA proposed instruction on a lesser included offense constitutes an appropriate instruction for purposes of the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>if it complies with Practice Book \u00a7 854.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 261. Practice Book \u00a7 854 provides that \u201c[w]hen there are several requests [to charge], they shall be in separate and numbered paragraphs, each containing a single proposition of law clearly and concisely stated with the citation of authority upon which it is based and, if requested by the judicial authority, the evidence to which the proposition would apply. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n the context of a written request to charge on a lesser included offense, this requirement of \u00a7 854 is met only if the proposed request contains such a complete statement of the essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>supra, 261-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u201cWhile this court does not favor unyielding adherence to rules of procedure where the interests of justice are thereby disserved . . . the ever increasing refinement of our law justifies cooperation of counsel in stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>requests for jury instruction. The minor burden of cooperation imposed by [Practice Book \u00a7 854] is neither unreasonable nor novel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">One element of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) is that the actor have the intent to \u201cinflict physical injury upon [another person] or violate or abuse him sexually . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-96 (a),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> unlawful restraint in the second degree, requires an intent only to restrain another person. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant now contends that the defendant\u2019s intoxication negated any possible specific intent required by the kidnapping statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Although the defendant\u2019s request did not contain a complete statement of the facts that would have justified the court in charging in the form requested; cf. <em>State v. Arena, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 76; we cannot conclude that the trial court was unaware of the legal and factual basis for the request to charge. We reach this conclusion for two reasons. First, in the midst of a discussion about the legal and factual justification for the request, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>trial court called counsel for the state and the defendant into chambers. Once the court resumed, there was no additional questioning from the trial court about the basis for the request. The inference is that \u201cthis issue [had] been discussed in chambers\u201d; id., 77; and whatever questions the court had may have been answered in chambers. Because that discussion is not part of the record, we cannot determine that those questions were left unanswered or that the trial court did not have the opportunity to inquire into the legal and factual grounds for the request. Therefore, on the basis of the facts before us in this case, we presume that the trial court was aware of the defendant\u2019s request and the point to which the defendant wanted to call attention \u201cand thus was afforded the time to scrutinize the requests and investigate the relevant case law.\u201d Id. Second, the trial court itself interrupted the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s explanation of the grounds for the request. It would be unfair to allow a trial court to interfere with a defendant\u2019s attempt to meet the requirements of \u00a7 854 and then to conclude that the sole basis for the defendant\u2019s failure to meet those requirements was an inadequate answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">On that basis, we conclude that the trial court was made aware of the basis for the defendant\u2019s request to charge. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s request charge was not inappropriate and, therefore, satisfied the first prong of <em>Whistnant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Having determined that the defendant has met the first prong of <em>Whistnant, </em>we next must determine whether the proof on the element or elements that differentiate conviction of unlawful restraint in the second degree from conviction of kidnapping in the first degree was sufficiently in dispute. Proof is sufficiently in dispute when \u201cit is of such a factual quality that [it] would permit the finder of fact reasonably to find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>defendant guilty on the lesser included offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>45 Conn. App. 6, 10, 692 A.2d 865 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">To obtain a conviction on unlawful restraint in the second degree in this case, the state would have been required to prove that the defendant \u201crestrained\u201d the victim within the meaning of the statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-96 (a). Thus, the state would have had to prove that the defendant restricted the victim\u2019s movements intentionally in such a manner as to interfere substantially with her liberty by confining her to the place where the restriction began without her consent. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (1). Those elements differ from the elements of kidnapping in the first degree. Under the kidnapping statute, the state had to prove that the defendant abducted and restrained the victim with the intent to inflict physical injury or to sexually attack her. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). The state had to prove that the defendant abducted the victim by restraining her with the intent to prevent her liberation by using or threatening to use physical force or intimidation. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In the present case, the victim testified that when she attempted to flee, she was held by her shirt and was able to free herself only by pulling away so hard as to rip her shirt. She testified that prior to fleeing, she attempted to reach for the door several times but was pulled back by the defendant, who grabbed her hair. Thus, the state claims that there was no evidence presented to the jury that the victim was restrained in any other way than by physical force or intimidation. Additionally, the state claims that with respect to the defendant\u2019s argument that his intoxication negated the specific intent to prevent the victim\u2019s liberation, there was evidence showing that the defendant was able to get in his truck, to drive to New London, to use an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>automatic teller machine and to drive back to Myrock Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The state\u2019s claims, however, are not pertinent to the question of whether the proof offered on the defendant\u2019s intent would have allowed the jury to find him guilty of merely unlawfully restraining the victim rather than kidnapping her. The evidence included testimony\u2014from Cooms, the victim and two investigating officers\u2014about the defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It also included testimony of the victim that she believed at least during part of that night that the defendant\u2019s behavior was affected by his alcohol consumption.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court found enough evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication to charge the jury on the issue.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request to charge on the lesser included offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>that evidence would have been sufficient to allow the jury reasonably to have concluded that the defendant\u2019s intoxication prevented his forming the specific intent required by the kidnapping statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The defendant satisfied the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant </em>because we cannot exclude'the possibility that he is guilty of the lesser offense and not the greater. We conclude that the trial court improperly failed to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u201cWe employ a two part analysis in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a criminal conviction. . . .

We do not sit as a [seventh] juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record.

Nicholas Groth, Men Who Rape\u2014 The Psychology Of The Offender (1979) p. 2, states that \u201cthe defining characteristic from the victim\u2019s point of view is force and from the offender\u2019s point of view it is a release of anger and the exercise of power and control. \u2018A number of popular notions and stereotyped images persist in regard to the offender, his victim, and the offense. With regard to the offender, he is frequently regarded as a lusty male who is the victim of a provocative and vindictive woman, or he is seen as a sexually frustrated man reacting under the pressure of his pent-up needs, or he is thought to be a demented sex-fiend harboring insatiable and perverted desires. All these views share a common misconception: they all assume that the offender\u2019s behavior is <em>primarily </em>motivated by <em>sexual </em>desire and that rape is directed toward gratifying the sexual need. Quite to the contrary, careful clinical study of offenders reveals that rape is in fact servicing primarily nonsexual needs. Rape is a pseudosexual act . . . addressing issues of hostility (anger) and control (power) more than passion (sexuality).\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.)

(All are derived from Connecticut Selected Jury Instructions, Criminal 1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">1. \u00a7 2.35 Intoxication \u00a7 53a-7 (as modified by the defendant): There has been some testimony to the effect that the defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant, namely, alcohol, at the time of the alleged acts. The Penal Code defines intoxication as a substantial disturbance of mental or physical capacities resulting from the introduction of substances into the body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">If you find that the defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant at the time of the alleged acts, you must then determine what effect, if any, this voluntary intoxication had on his ability to form the specific intent required to commit the alleged crimes. Penal Code \u00a7 53a-7 states that \u2018Intoxication shall not be a defense to a criminal charge, but in any prosecution for an offense evidence of intoxication of the defendant may be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to negate an element of the crime charged . . . .\u2019 Such evidence was offered through examination and cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">Note that intoxication is not a defense to or an excuse for the commission of a crime. It is only relevant to negate an element of the crime charged, such as intent. If you find that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the crime, you may take this fact into consideration in determining whether he was in such a state of intoxication as to be incapable of forming the required specific intent, which is a necessary element for the commission of the crimes of Kidnapping in the First Degree and Attempt to Commit Sexual Assault the First Degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-14\">I charge you further that if you believe that the defendant, although intoxicated, was still capable of possessing a specific criminal intent, then his responsibility is the same as if he were not intoxicated. You must first decide whether the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the alleged crime; and second, whether he was incapable of possessing an intent to commit the acts constituting the crimes of Kidnapping in the First Degree and Attempt to Commit Sexual Assault in the First Degree. Remember, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>defendant does not have to prove that he was intoxicated. The state always has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was capable of forming the required intent.

I would say in my opinion he had a buzz, but I wouldn\u2019t say that he was drunk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\"> The trial court charged the jury on the issue of intoxication as follows: \u201cThere has been some testimony to the effect that the defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant, namely, alcohol, at the time of the events here. Our law defines intoxication as a substantial disturbance of mental or physical capacities resulting from the introduction of substances like alcohol into the body. If you find the defendant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the alleged acts, you must then determine what effect, if any, this voluntary intoxication had on his ability to form the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>intent required to commit the crimes alleged in counts one and two. Our penal code states, \u2018Intoxication shall not be a defense to a criminal charge. But in any prosecution for an offense, evidence of intoxication of the defendant may be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to negate an element of the crime charged.\u2019 Again, note, intoxication is not a defense or an excuse for the commission of a crime. It is only relevant to negate an element of the crime charged such as intent. If you find that the defendant was intoxicated at the relevant time, you may take this fact into consideration in determining whether he was in such a state of intoxication as to be incapable of forming the required specific intent which is a necessary element for the commission of the crime of kidnapping in the first degree and criminal attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">\u201cI charge you further that if you believe that the defendant, although intoxicated, was still capable of possessing a specific criminal intent then his responsibility is the same as if he were not intoxicated. You must first decide whether the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the alleged crimes and, second, whether he was incapable of possessing an intent to commit the acts constituting the crimes of kidnapping in the first degree and criminal attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree. Remember, the defendant does not have to prove that he was intoxicated. The state always has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was capable of forming the required intent. Any degree of intoxication, not merely total intoxication, may be considered] in determining whether the defendant possessed the requisite intent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
