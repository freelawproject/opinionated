J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvA6\">The plaintiff appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining the defendant commissioner\u2019s suspension of the plaintiffs motor vehicle operator\u2019s license for refusal to submit to a chemical alcohol test following his arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-227b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the administrative hearing officer\u2019s findings (1) that the plaintiff was operating the motor vehicle in question and (2) that there was probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. The plaintiff also claims that his arrest was unlawful. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The following facts are necessary for a disposition of this appeal. On January 11, 1996, at approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>10:09 p.m., Officer Charles Zwick of the Seymour police department was dispatched to investigate a report of a single vehicle accident. Upon arriving at the scene of the accident, Zwick observed a vehicle, later determined to belong to the plaintiff, stuck in a snowbank. Upon closer inspection, Zwick determined that the vehicle\u2019s transmission control was in the drive position and the inside compartment of the vehicle was warm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Zwick began to search the area for the operator of the vehicle and located the plaintiff approximately two-tenths of a mile from the vehicle. The plaintiff was walking toward his home, which was less than one mile from the scene of the accident. Zwick observed that the plaintiff swayed as he walked and lost his balance in the road. Zwick confirmed that the vehicle belonged to the plaintiff, searched the plaintiff, placed him in the patrol car and returned to the accident scene. Officer Patrick Giglio had also arrived at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Giglio\u2019s investigation report indicates that the plaintiff said that he had driven his vehicle from Stop <em>&amp; </em>Shop in Waterbury, where he was employed, back to Seymour. Giglio\u2019s report further states that the plaintiff appeared to be intoxicated, smelled strongly of alcohol and failed the field sobriety tests administered to him. After being placed under arrest, the plaintiff refused to take a breath test. The plaintiff was subsequently notified by the commissioner that his operator\u2019s license would be suspended for six months because he refused to be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b, the plaintiff requested and was granted an administrative hearing to contest the suspension. Section 14-227b (f) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe hearing shall be limited to a determination of the folio w-ing issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>both ... (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to such [chemical alcohol] test or analysis . . . and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle.\u201d The hearing officer found that all four criteria had been met, resulting in suspension of the plaintiffs operator\u2019s license for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. Following the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his case, the plaintiff appealed to this court. The plaintiff concedes that he refused to submit to the chemical alcohol test but argues that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the other three requirements of \u00a7 14-227b (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Review of the commissioner\u2019s action is highly restricted. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>33 Conn. App. 501, 506, 636 A.2d 409, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 909, 642 A.2d 1205 (1994). Neither the trial court nor this court may retry the case or substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 3, 509 A.2d 489 (1986). \u201cIn order to sustain an administrative decision, all that is required is that the determination be reasonably supported by the evidence in the record. . . . [T]he plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the commissioner\u2019s decision to suspend the motor vehicle operating privilege was clearly erroneous in view of the rehable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. . . . Substantial evidence exists if the administrative record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>47 Conn. App. 111, 114-15, 702 A.2d 1197 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The plaintiff first argues that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>appellant was operating the motor vehicle in question. \u201cSubstantial evidence exists if the administrative record affords a substantial basis in fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>229 Conn. 31, 40, 639 A.2d 1018 (1994). Proof of operation is a factual determination. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In <em>O\u2019Rourke, </em>this court distinguished between a criminal proceeding seeking a conviction for violation of \u00a7 14-227a and an administrative proceeding involving revocation of a driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b. \u201cIn a criminal case, the state must prove each element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . In an administrative action, however, the agency need only produce probative and reliable evidence to ensure that the proceedings are fundamentally fair. . . . Thus, a hearing officer\u2019s decision to revoke a [driver\u2019s] license is not subject to the far higher burden of proof that is required for a criminal conviction of driving under the influence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In the present case, the record showed that the arresting officer found the plaintiffs vehicle off the road in a snowbank. The vehicle was in drive and still warm from recent operation. An officer found the plaintiff in the immediate proximity, having difficulty walking and with an odor of liquor about him. Finally, the plaintiff admitted that he had driven his vehicle from Waterbury to Seymour.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The record contains substantial evidence supporting the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had operated the motor vehicle in question. Thus, the trial court was correct in holding that the hearing officer\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The plaintiff next claims that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that the police officer had probable cause to arrest him for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor or drugs. \u201cIt is fundamental that a plaintiff has the burden of proving that the commissioner, on the facts before him, acted contrary to law and in abuse of his discretion.\u201d <em>Demma </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor </em>Vehicles, 165 Conn. 15, 16-17, 327 A.2d 569 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u201cProbable cause, broadly defined, comprises such facts as would reasonably persuade an impartial and reasonable mind not merely to suspect or conjecture, but to believe that criminal activity has occurred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>26 Conn. App. 805, 810, 603 A.2d 1203 (1992), aff'd, 224 Conn. 730, 620 A.2d 789 (1993). In determining whether there was probable cause to arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor, the court may consider, just as in an arrest for any other criminal offense, circumstantial as well as direct evidence. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 512, 515, 516 A.2d 160 (1986), aff'd, 14 Conn. App. 212, 540 A.2d 1063, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 809, 545 A.2d 1105 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u201cTo establish probable cause, it is not necessary to produce a quantum of evidence necessary to convict.\u201d <em>State v. Paoletto, </em>181 Conn. 172, 181, 434 A.2d 954 (1980). Accordingly, there can be a situation where there is sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to arrest even though on the eventual trial of the case there would not be sufficient evidence to support a conviction. This is such a case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">At the motor vehicle hearing, the plaintiff testified that when the police officer came upon him, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>under the influence of intoxicating liquor only as a result of consuming alcohol at his home <em>after </em>he had operated his motor vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of the administrative agency, and this court cannot disturb the conclusions reached by the commissioner if there is evidence that reasonably supports his decision. <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor </em>Vehicles, 168 Conn. 587, 589, 362 A.2d 840 (1975). Thus, it was within the hearing officer\u2019s province to determine whether he believed the plaintiffs testimony regarding when the plaintiff consumed liquor in relation to the time of operating his motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The record shows that the testimony of the police officers, the police reports that were admitted into evidence and the totality of the circumstances existing at the time of the plaintiffs arrest support the hearing officer\u2019s finding that there was probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The plaintiffs final claim is that even if the officer had probable cause to arrest him for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor, the arrest was unlawful under General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf and therefore could not be considered to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 14-227b.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision did not address the plaintiffs claim that his arrest was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>A motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is the proper procedural device for seeking the trial court\u2019s ruling on an overlooked matter. <em>Wolk </em>v. <em>Wolk, </em>191 Conn. 328, 335 n.1, 464 A.2d 780 (1983). If a motion for articulation is denied or if the resulting articulation proves inadequate, review should be sought from this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4054.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The plaintiff filed a motion asking that the trial court articulate its findings and conclusions, including whether the court had found that the plaintiffs arrest was lawful. We agree with the plaintiff that the trial court\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law are necessary for appellate review. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion for articulation, but the plaintiff failed to seek review by this court. Because of this failure, we are deprived of the necessary findings and conclusions of law to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The duty to provide us with a record adequate to afford review rests with the plaintiff. Practice Book \u00a7 4061;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>32 Conn. App. 317, 319, 629 A.2d 1137, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 902, 634 A.2d 295 (1993). Under the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff has failed to furnish us with a record adequate to review his claim that the arrest was unlawful. See <em>Dime Savings Bank of Wallingford </em>v. <em>Cornaglia, </em>33 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>App. 549, 553-56, 636 A.2d 1370, cert. granted, 229 Conn. 907, 640 A.2d 120 (1994) (appeal withdrawn October 17, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-227b, as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-279, \u00a7 1, provides in relevantpart: \u201c(a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle in this state shall be deemed to have given his consent to a chemical analysis of his blood, breath or mine ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">\u201c(b) If any such person, having been placed under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both . . . and thereafter . . . refuses to submit to the designated test, the test shall not be given ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">\u201c(c) If the person arrested refuses to submit to such test or analysis . . . the police officer, acting on behalf of the commissioner of motor vehicles, shall immediately revoke and take possession of the motor vehicle operator\u2019s license . . . for a twenty-four-hour period and shall issue a temporary operator\u2019s license ... to such person valid for the period commencing twenty-four hours after issuance and ending thirty days after the date such person received notice of his arrest by the police officer.
