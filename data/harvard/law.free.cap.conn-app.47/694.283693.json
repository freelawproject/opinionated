The plaintiffs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> operate a business in Bridgeport known as Main Port Fish &amp; Chips, a business that sells fish dishes, sandwiches, chowders, salads, desserts and beverages. Main Port has ten tables, capable of seating thirty-five persons. In addition, Main Port sells a substantial amount of take-out food. Both dining room and take-out customers place their orders from a one page menu at the counter, where a cashier registers the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The commissioner conducted a sales and use tax audit of Main Port for the period September 1, 1988, through August 31, 1991. On September 1, 1992, the commissioner issued an assessment against Main Port asserting a sales and use tax deficiency plus interest and a penalty. Main Port protested the assessment to the commissioner\u2019s appellate division. On July 21,1993, the commissioner issued its final determination, concluding that the amount owed by Main Port was $42,378.75. Main Port appealed to the trial court, which reviewed Main Port\u2019s claimed exemptions and remanded the case to the commissioner for further proceedings. The commissioner appealed from the trial court\u2019s decision on the issues regarding Main Port\u2019s claimed exemptions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse the decision of the trial court in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The commissioner first argues that the trial court improperly construed the department of revenue services 1990 Bulletin No. 17 to find that sales of three or more pieces of fish and a pint of coleslaw are bulk sales of grocery food exempt from sales tax. To resolve this claim properly, we must examine the relevant statutes, regulations and bulletins. Before we do so, however, we must first note \u201cthe principles of statutory construction that govern the availability of a tax exemption. First, statutes that provide exemptions from taxation are a matter of legislative grace that must be strictly construed against the taxpayer. Second, any ambiguity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the statutory formulation of an exemption must be resolved against the taxpayer. Third, the taxpayer must bear the burden of proving the error in an adverse assessment concerning an exemption.\u201d <em>Plastic Tooling Aids Laboratory, Inc. v. Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 365, 369, 567 A.2d 1218 (1990). Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that a statute, even one providing for a tax exemption, should not be construed to effectuate a bizarre or irrational result.\u201d <em>Rich-Taubman Associates </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>236 Conn. 613, 621, 674 A.2d 805 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">In Connecticut, sales tax is imposed on the sale of all tangible personal property unless specifically exempted. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-407 (2) (a) and 12-408. General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (13)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> specifically provides an exemption for \u201c[sjales of food products for human consumption.\u201d The definition of \u201cfood products\u201d within this statute is very broad. The statute provides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>however, that \u201c \u2018[f]ood products\u2019 ... do not include meals sold by an eating establishment or caterer.\u201d The statute further provides that \u201c \u2018[m]eaT means food products which are furnished, prepared or served in such a form and in such portions that they are ready for immediate consumption. A meal . . . includes food products which are sold on a \u2018take out\u2019 or \u2018to go\u2019 basis and which are actually packaged or wrapped.\u201d Thus, pursuant to this statute, food products are exempt from the sales tax unless they constitute meals, which are not exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">We turn next to \u00a7 12-426-29 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, titled, \u201cExemption of food products for human consumption; Taxability of meals sold by eating establishments or caterers.\u201d This regulation states that its purpose \u201cis to clarify what is covered by that exemption.\u201d Section 12-426-29 (c) (1) defines \u201cmeals\u201d as \u201cfood products for human consumption sold in such form and such portions that they are ready for immediate consumption and are of a type normally consumed on or near the location of the seller.\u201d This regulation distinguishes \u201cbulk sales\u201d and \u201cmeals,\u201d stating in pertinent part that \u201c \u2018[m]eals\u2019 do not include bulk sales of food products unless meant for consumption on or near the location of the seller. Examples of such bulk sales include the sale of ice cream in one-half gallon containers, whole pies, cold sliced meat sold by the pound and cold salads sold by the pound. Examples of sales which are not bulk sales include the sale of whole pizza pies and buckets of fried chicken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">To further clarify the taxability of meals, the department of revenue services promulgated Bulletin No. 17. Unfortunately, Bulletin No. 17 was revised during the audit period in question, so that different versions apply to the present case at different times. As previously noted, the commissioner conducted a sales and use tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>audit of Main Port for the period September 1, 1988, through August 31, 1991. The first version of Bulletin No. 17 (version I) was issued in August, 1987, prior to the commencement of the audit period. In May, 1990, the department of revenue services revised Bulletin No. 17 and, therefore, the revised version (version II) applies during the latter portion of the audit period.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Version I of Bulletin No. 17 provides in part that \u201c[m]eals consist of food products ordinarily sold in such form and portions that they are ready for immediate consumption on or near the location of the seller. A meal may be a full dinner or it may be limited to a single item. . . . Meals costing $2.00 or more are subject to tax whether they are served at the location of the seller or are sold as a \u2018take-out\u2019 order.\u201d Version I further provides that \u201c[t]he sale of food items in bulk would not generally be considered the sale of a meal. Examples of exempt bulk food sales would include the sale of a half gallon of ice cream at an ice cream shop or a box of a dozen donuts at a coffee and donut shop. <em>However, the sale of a, hot pizza by a pizzeria or the sale of a large container of hot fried chicken or fish pieces by a restaurant is considered the sale of a meal and is subject to tax, if it costs $2 or more.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial court, interpreting version I of Bulletin No. 17, concluded that the sale of a large order of fish, as well as a fish \u201cplatter\u201d and a serving of five stuffed clams were meals subject to the sales tax. The trial court reached the same conclusion under version I with regard to pints of chowder, pints of coleslaw and large orders of fries. The commissioner does not challenge these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The trial court, however, further concluded that under version II of Bulletin No. 17, sales of three pieces of fish or more and pints of coleslaw are bulk sales and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>are, therefore, exempt from the sales tax. The commissioner challenges that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Version II of Bulletin No. 17 provides in part that \u201c[t]he sale of food items in bulk is not generally considered the sale of a meal. Exempt bulk food items are those items sold in such form or in portions which are larger than those which are ordinarily considered for immediate consumption. For example, whole cooked chickens, racks of cooked ribs, whole loaves of bread, and whole cakes or pies are considered bulk food purchases and are, therefore, not taxable.\u201d Version II then goes on to list examples of taxable meals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The specific reference to fish pieces as a taxable meal that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>present in version I was deleted in version II. The trial court placed great reliance on that omission in concluding that three or more fish pieces are bulk sales exempt from the sales tax under version II.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The commissioner argues, however, and we agree, that the omission of fish pieces in version II is not significant in that the language immediately preceding the list states that <em>\u201c[ejxamples of food for immediate consumption include, but a,re not limited to, the following </em>. . . The question to be resolved in determining whether the sales tax applies is whether pieces of fish are more like bulk food, such as whole loaves of bread and whole cakes or pies, or meals, such as pizza and cooked chicken sold by the piece, including buckets of chicken. If it were otherwise, any particular item of food that is not included on the list of examples of taxable meals would automatically be considered a tax exempt bulk sale. Such a construction would \u201ceffectuate a bizarre or irrational result.\u201d <em>Rich-Taubman Associates </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">We conclude that fish pieces are similar to pieces or buckets of chicken and, therefore, constitute meals subject to the sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The commissioner next challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the sale of a pint of coleslaw is a bulk sale exempt from the sales tax under version II. We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">According to \u00a7 12-426-29 (c) (1) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, \u201c[m]eals do not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>bulk sales of food products unless meant for consumption on or near the location of the seller. <em>Examples of such bulk sales include the sale of </em>. . . <em>cold salads sold by the pound.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Version II of Bulletin No. 17 provides in part that \u201c[sjalads sold in containers of less than one-half pound\u201d are taxable meals. The trial court held that it is \u201clikely that a pint of coleslaw weighs more than one-half pound. A pint of coleslaw is, consequently, a \u2018bulk sale.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">We initially note that coleslaw is \u201ca <em>salad </em>made of raw sliced or chopped cabbage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). We further note that Main Port does not sell coleslaw by weight. A review of Main Port\u2019s menu reveals that coleslaw is sold in individual portions and by the pint. In order for coleslaw to be considered a bulk food under the applicable regulation and version II of Bulletin No. 17, it would have to be sold in containers of greater than one-half pound. Because Main Port does not sell coleslaw by weight, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the sale of a pint of coleslaw is a bulk sale.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The commissioner next argues that the trial court improperly considered individual food items in a single transaction to be meals under $2 and, therefore, exempt from sales tax under General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (51).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>We agree. Section 12-412 (51) was repealed in 1989. See Public Acts 1989, No. 89-251, \u00a7 202. It was in effect, however, at the beginning of the audit period.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 12-412 (51) provided an exemption for \u201c[t]he sale of any meal, as defined in subsection (13) of this section, for which the purchaser is charged a total of less than two dollars . ...\u201d As previously stated, a meal is \u201cfood products which are furnished, prepared or served in such form and in such portions that they are ready for immediate consumption.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (13).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Main Port, in its application of this exemption, treated each individual item that it sold as a \u201cmeal.\u201d The trial court properly described the issue as follows: \u201c[T]o take one example, if a hypothetical customer ordered a cup of chowder, a small order of fries, and a stuffed clam, each of these items would be considered a \u2018meal\u2019 [by Main Port]. Suppose that the cost of each of these items was $1. In spite of the fact that the total cost of these items is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>$3, Main Port treated this purchase as a purchase of three \u2018meals,\u2019 each costing less than $2. The question presented is whether this treatment was appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We again note that statutes that provide exemptions from taxation must be strictly construed against the taxpayer and that any ambiguity in the statutory formulation of an exemption must be resolved against the taxpayer. <em>Plastic Tooling Aids Laboratory Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 369. Because \u00a7 12-412 (51) provides an exemption for meals under $2, any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">With this principle in mind, we next consider that a meal is the portion of food taken at one time to satisfy appetite. Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). Neither this definition nor the definition in \u00a7 12-412 (13) provides that each individual item is a separate meal for purposes of the $2 exemption. We therefore disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[a]ny particular item\u2014whether it be an order of fries, a stuffed clam, or a piece of fish\u2014sold by Main Port plainly qualifies as a \u2018meal\u2019 under [the definition in \u00a7 12-412 (13)]. If a customer orders three such items, it is consistent with the statute to treat such a purchase as a purchase of three \u2018meals.\u2019 \u201d We conclude, rather, that a meal for purposes of \u00a7 12-412 (51) consists of the total number of items of food charged to a person or persons at one given time. Such a construction is consistent with both the statutory and dictionary definitions of a meal.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Finally, the commissioner challenges the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the exemption in General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (9)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> regarding sales to patients in nursing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>homes. The commissioner argues that to qualify for the exemption in \u00a7 12-412 (9), Main Port must show that the meal was served and sold in a hospital, home for the aged, convalescent home, nursing home or rest home to a patient pursuant to an arrangement whereby Main Port ran the institution\u2019s cafeteria or dining facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The commissioner, however, raises this issue for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 4061 provides that \u2018[t]he court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.\u2019 This court follows the \u2018[long-standing] rule that absent certain exceptional circumstances . . . claims not distinctly raised at trial will not be reviewed on appeal.\u2019 <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 52, 57, 597 A.2d 839, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 902, 600 A.2d 1029 (1991).\u201d <em>In re Michael A., </em>47 Conn. App. 105, 110, 703 A.2d 1146 (1997). We therefore decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\"> This court previously dismissed the commissioner\u2019s appeal and the plaintiffs\u2019 cross appeal for lack of a final judgment. The commissioner filed a petition for certification to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reversed our judgment and remanded the case to this court to consider the commissioner\u2019s appeal. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>242 Conn. 599, 603, 699 A.2d 961 (1997). The Supreme Court further held, however, that because the plaintiffs did not file a petition for certification in the Supreme Court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4126 or a cross petition for certification pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4129, the judgment dismissing the cross appeal was not affected by the remand. Id., 603-604. This opinion, therefore, will address only the issues raised in the commissioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b725-11\"> The plaintiffs are Kenneth Jones, Edward Jones and David Jones, doing business as Main Port Fish <em>&amp; </em>Chips. Hereinafter, the plaintiffs will be referred to as Main Port.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"> In addition to its conclusions regarding Main Port\u2019s claimed exemptions, the trial court also found that the commissioner\u2019s auditors did not consult Main Port\u2019s cash register tapes, and that Main Port did not produce the tapes until the field stage of the audit had been completed. The trial court further found no evidence that Main Port withheld the tapes in bad faith. The trial court, therefore, remanded the case to the commissioner for a redetermination of Main Port\u2019s sales tax liability based on all of the available evidence, including the now available tapes. The commissioner does not challenge that portion of the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b727-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (13) provides: \u201cSales of food products for human, consumption. \u2018Food products\u2019 include cereals and cereal products, milk and milk products, oleomargarine, meat and meat products, fish and fish products, eggs and egg products, vegetables and vegetable products, fruit and fruit products, spices and salt, sugar and sugar products other than candy and confectionery; coffee and coffee substitutes, tea, cocoa and cocoa products other than candy and confectionery. \u2018Food products\u2019 do not include spirituous, malt or vinous liquors, soft drinks, sodas or beverages such as are ordinarily dispensed at bars and soda fountains, or in connection therewith, medicines except by prescription, tonics and preparations in liquid, powdered, granular, tablet, capsule, lozenge and pill form sold as dietary supplements or adjuncts. <em>\u2018Food,products\u2019 also do not include meals sold by an eating establishment or caterer. \u2018Meal\u2019 means food products which are furnished, prepared or served in such a form and in such portions that they are ready for immediate consumption.
