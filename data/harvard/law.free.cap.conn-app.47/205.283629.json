The first count charged the defendant with the crime of conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-54a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>resulted in the death of Glenroy Gordon. The second count charged the defendant with the crime of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, alleging that \u201cwith intent to cause the death of Glenroy Gordon, [the defendant] caused the death of Glenroy Gordon by shooting him.\u201d The third count charged the defendant with the crime of criminal attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-59 (a) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging that when \u201cacting with the intent to cause a serious physical injury to another person, [he] performed a substantial step in the course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of the crime, to wit: arming himself with a deadly weapon, going to Allen Drive, and shooting one Will Little.\u201d The fourth count charged the defendant with the crime of assault in the second degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-60a and 53a-60 (a) (2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that \u201cwith intent to cause physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>cal injury to another person, [he] caused such injury to Will Little by using a firearm.\u201d The fifth count charged the defendant with the crime of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted on the first, third and fifth counts. Thereafter, he was sentenced to twenty years on the first count, twenty years on the third count and ten years on the fifth count with the sentences on each to run consecutively, thus resulting in an effective sentence of fifty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for the attempted assault charged in the third count and (2) the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the doctrine of transferred intent with regard to the third count. Our resolution of the first claim makes it unnecessary for us to reach the second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 7, 1993, at approximately 8 p.m., Gordon was standing near Allen Drive in Hartford and was holding the hand of Tiffany Rodriguez, a four year old girl. Delroy Stone, Wilbur Jolly and Little were also there. Tiffany Rodriguez\u2019 mother, Nancy Rodriguez, was sitting in front of her house on the opposite side of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Allen Drive. A 1981 Plymouth Grand Fury car came slowly down Allen Drive. Four persons were in that car, all wearing hooded sweatshirts. The defendant was sitting on the door out the window of the passenger side holding, on the roof of the car, an automatic gun estimated to be about two feet long with a clip extending downward estimated to be about nine inches long.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that position, the defendant, also known as B-Boy, was facing toward Gordon. The state\u2019s witnesses, Nancy Rodriguez, Stone and Jolly, all testified that the defendant started shooting toward Gordon, who then fell to the ground.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before Gordon did so, however, he shouted at Tiffany Rodriguez to run, which she did. Jolly saw Little get shot in the leg. Little was later found with a wound in his upper right leg by a Hartford police officer. Many shots were fired as the Grand Fury moved \u201cvery slowly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">There was, however, evidence from Detective James Rovella of the Hartford police department, who interviewed the defendant<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on June 4, 1994, that gave the jury another perspective on who shot at Gordon. According to Rovella, the defendant admitted that he was in the Grand Fury from which shots were fired toward Gordon on Allen Drive on August 7, 1993. With him in that car were Carlos Ortiz (Mad Dog), who was driving, Diego Lopez<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Hippy), who was sitting on the door out the window in the front passenger side, and an individual known as Smiley, who was in the back seat with the defendant. The defendant told Rovella <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>that three of the persons in that car were armed, but that he was not armed. Ortiz had a nine millimeter weapon, Lopez had a Mack 10 semiautomatic, and Smiley had a Tech 9 weapon.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The defendant took part in the planning and executing of a plan to do a \u201chit\u201d on Allen Drive on a member of Twenty Love, a rival gang.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A \u201chit\u201d is a shooting and murder. The plan was formulated at a Latin Kings meeting in a garage on Webster Street in Hartford with the orders for the planned incident coming from Melvin Castro. The garage had been rented by Castro. The planned incident, the defendant told Rovella, arose out of a dispute between Twenty Love and the Latin Kings over a gun and a backpack. At the time of the shooting of August 7, 1993, Gordon had not actually been accepted as a member of Twenty Love, but was \u201cgoing to be.\u201d The plan involved a three car operation. One car would go up Coleman Drive, turn left onto Allen Drive and be posted at the west end of Allen Drive. The second car was the Grand Fury, which was driven down Allen Drive and from which the shooting was done. The third car was posted on the east end of Allen Drive. After the shooting, the occupants of the Grand Fury<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> exited it with their weapons, left the area and returned to the garage on Webster Street for a short time. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>then went to a pizza shop on the comer of Park and Wolcott Streets in Hartford where they had a \u201ccelebration\u201d of pizza and beer purchased by Castro, who said \u201cit was in return for a job well done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Mark Castagna, a Hartford police officer, was nearby on Flatbush Avenue in his police cruiser with his partner when he heard gunshots at approximately 8 p.m. on August 7, 1993. Castagna proceeded to Allen Drive where he found Gordon with what appeared to be a bullet hole in his head. Emergency medical personnel responded, and Gordon was taken to Hartford Hospital. Castagna noticed bullet casings at the scene. Aware that a casing is discharged when an automatic or semiautomatic weapon is fired, he proceeded to rope off the scene with yellow crime scene tape. Hartford Police Detective Raymond Cruz,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> an evidence technician, found twenty-nine shell casings that were of different brands of ammunition. There were seventeen Winchesters, ten Norencos and one Frontier that were for nine millimeter weapons, as well as one PMC that was for a ten millimeter weapon. James Jachimowicz, employed by the Connecticut state police at the forensic science laboratory as a firearm and tool mark examiner, examined those casings. It was his opinion that \u201c[t]he ten Norencos were fired from the same firearm, but they were not fired from the same firearm as the other eighteen nine millimeter fired cartridge cases.\u201d Jachimowicz received another PMC cartridge case after having received one PMC cartridge case, and it was his opinion that it was \u201cactually impossible that these ten millimeters could have been fired in the same firearm as the nine millimeters.\u201d The two bullet fragments recovered at the autopsy could not be linked to any particular casing because the jacketing material was missing so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>that there was \u201cno way\u201d that Jachimowicz could \u201cdetermine whether these two bullets were fired from the same firearm.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The casings and the fragments given to Jachimowicz \u201ccould have come from anywhere from three to five guns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction under the third count of attempted assault in the first degree of Little. In doing so, he maintains that the state failed to prove that he had the requisite intent to harm Little and that the doctrine of transferred intent cannot be utilized to supply the intent necessary for a conviction of attempted assault in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The state, on appeal, in arguing to sustain the conviction on the third count, claims that the intended victim in that count was actually Gordon, not Little. This position is irreconcilable with the state\u2019s theory at trial as to the third count. The state\u2019s theory of the case at trial is evident, as we will point out, not only from its presentation of evidence and argument to the jury but also from its position as to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions concerning the third count.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The thrust of the state\u2019s case at trial with regard to Gordon was that the defendant conspired to murder Gordon, as the first count specifically charged, and that he did murder Gordon, as the second count specifically charged. The jury found the defendant guilty of the conspiracy and not of the murder. On appeal, the state now claims that the intended victim in the third count was Gordon. To understand more fully the position of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the state at the trial, certain additional circumstances must be set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Count one, conspiracy to commit murder, and count two, murder, of the information explicitly specify Gordon as the alleged and indeed actual target. Count three, on the other hand, does not mention Gordon at all, but does mention Little. That count alleges that while \u201cacting with the intent to cause a serious physical injury to <em>another person </em>[who is unnamed], the defendant performed a substantial step in the course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of the crime, to wit: arming himself with a deadly weapon, going to Allen Drive and shooting one Will Little.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In count four, the state returns to its posture, as it did in counts one and two, and specifies the person injured (Little) by the defendant\u2019s alleged assault on him with a firearm. The state continues its posture of specifying the alleged victim in the fifth count where it names Tiffany Rodriguez as the alleged victim of the defendant\u2019s conduct under the risk of injury to a child charge. Thus, in its five count information, it is only in the challenged third count that the alleged victim is not explicitly named. It is the \u201canother person\u201d language, without explication in that count, that has germinated into the crucial issue in this matter. The defendant reasonably believed that the \u201canother person\u201d in that count referred to Little.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">During final arguments to the jury, the state went into great detail about its claims under the murder and conspiracy to murder counts, but said very little as to the remaining three counts (the third, fourth and fifth). It did, however, say that \u201cwith respect to Mr. Little, the state does not claim that the injury to him constitutes a serious physical injury as defined by our statutes. And the judge is going to tell you what the elements of the various offenses are, but you\u2019ll understand when you hear his explanation that is why the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>charged in connection with this shooting of Will Little with attempted assault in the first degree, the essence of which is attempting to cause a serious physical injury with a deadly weapon by shooting him. And . . . the defendant is also charged with assault in the second degree with a firearm. That is for actually causing a physical injury, albeit not a serious one. And the judge will explain these offenses to you.\u201d This language, combined with the absence of any reference to Gordon, contributed to the perception that Little was the victim in the third count.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">A more compelling aspect of the state\u2019s overall presentation that reasonably led the defendant, the court and the jury to believe that the \u201canother person\u201d in the third count was Little, not Gordon, was the state\u2019s inaction and standing mute when the court charged the jury that \u201cif you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the shooter of Will Little, then you are required to return a verdict of not guilty as to count three.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This perception was compounded when, during its deliberations, the jury sent a note saying that it wanted an explanation of counts three and four. The court started its recharge on these two counts by saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll recall I told you yesterday that <em>counts three and four deal with Will Little. </em>He is the alleged victim of the misconduct committed against him. Mr. Will Little.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Shortly thereafter, in the same recharge, the court said, \u201cNow the <em>essence </em>of this count [three] <em>charges </em>that the defendant went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Allen Drive, Hartford, on August 7, 1993, at or about 8 p.m. with the intent to cause serious physical injury by arming himself with a deadly weapon and shooting Will Little in the left buttock.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Again, the state said nothing, nor did the defendant, to correct the trial court as to this recharge. Not only the defendant, but \u201cthe prosecution has the responsibility to avoid error by making appropriate objections.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Klose, </em>334 N.W.2d 647, 651 (N.D. 1983). Certainly, the defense cannot be faulted for not objecting as there was a reasonable basis for it to believe that the state had been and still was treating the third count as directed to Little.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Moreover, the state\u2019s scenario on appeal makes no sense when we consider that the third count charges an <em>attempted </em>crime and the \u201cvictim\u201d (Gordon, according to the state) was actually killed. One wonders why the state would charge the defendant with <em>attempt </em>to assault a victim (who was killed) in the same information in which the defendant was charged with murdering that victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The state, as the defendant claims, has attempted on appeal to change its theory of the case from that which it pursued at the trial. To countenance such a course, the defendant argues, would violate his constitutional rights under due process by affirming a conviction obtained on the basis of a theory not presented to the trial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">This view is foreshadowed in United States Supreme Court jurisprudence by such cases as <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>333 U.S. 196, 68 S. Ct. 514, 92 L. Ed. 644 (1948), and <em>Chiarella v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 222, 100 S. Ct. 1108, 63 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1980). In <em>Cole, </em>the court agreed with the petitioner\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]o sustain a conviction on grounds not charged in the information <em>and </em>which the jury had no opportunity to pass upon, deprives the defendants of a fair trial and a trial by jury, and denies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the defendants that due process of law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cole </em>v. Arkansas, supra, 200. More to the point, the <em>Cole </em>court said that \u201c[t]o conform to due process of law, petitioners were entitled to have the validity of their convictions appraised on consideration of the case as it was tried and as the issues were determined in the trial court.\u201d Id., 202; see <em>Presnell </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>439 U.S. 14, 16, 99 S. Ct. 235, 58 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>442 U.S. 100, 106, 99 S. Ct. 2190, 60 L. Ed. 2d 743 (1979), where there was no variance between the indictment and proof at trial, \u201cthere was a discrepancy between the basis on which the jury rendered its verdict and that on which the [Tenth Circuit] Court of Appeals sustained [the defendant\u2019s] conviction.\u201d In referring to this discrepancy, <em>Dunn </em>said that \u201c[t]o uphold a conviction on a charge that was neither alleged in an indictment nor presented to a jury at trial offends the most basic notions of due process.\u201d Id. It also said that \u201cappellate courts are not free to revise the basis on which a defendant is convicted simply because the same result would likely obtain on retrial.\u201d Id., 107. Later, the court said in <em>Chiarella, </em>\u201c[W]e cannot affirm a criminal conviction on the basis of a theory not presented to the jury, <em>Rewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 814 [91 S. Ct. 1056, 28 L. Ed. 2d 493] (1971), see <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[supra, 106] . . . .\u201d <em>Chiarella </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 445 U.S. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">An instructive opinion for this case is that of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>Cola </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>787 F.2d 681 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 930, 107 S. Ct. 398, 93 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1986). In <em>Cola, </em>a habeas corpus proceeding, the petitioner had been convicted after a jury trial in the Massachusetts Superior Court. He was given a prison sentence and a fine. On appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>his convictions were affirmed, and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied further review. Neil Cola filed a habeas petition in the United States District Court essentially claiming that he had been denied due process because the state appellate court had affirmed his conviction under the relevant statute on grounds that were never specified in the indictment or presented to the jury. He also claimed that the trial court\u2019s jury charge was faulty in that it did not frame the charge in terms by which the jury could have found him guilty under the relevant statute. The District Court denied habeas relief finding that \u201cthe theory of guilt upon which the state appeals court affirmed <em>had </em>been set forth in the indictment and at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) <em>Cola </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>supra, 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The First Circuit in <em>Cola </em>said, \u201c[W]e . . . hold that <em>Dunn </em>requires the appellate theory to be set forth in both the indictment <em>and </em>the case presented to the jury.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 696. That court reasoned that \u201cin addition to notice, due process requires a trial in which criminal defendants are able to confront the government\u2019s case. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 314, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2786, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979) . . . .\u201d <em>Cola </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>supra, 787 F.2d 696. The <em>Cola </em>court aptly pointed out that the <em>Dunn </em>court recognized that \u201cwhile evidence fully supporting the [government\u2019s] appellate theory had been before the jury, the prosecution had not \u2018built its case\u2019 on such evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>Dunn, </em>supra, 442 U.S. at 107 .... Accordingly, noted the <em>[Dunn] </em>Court, the offense had not been <em>defined </em>in terms of the appellate theory, and hence, the presence of such unexplained evidence would not reinstate due process.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Cola </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>supra, 699. Because the prosecution in Cola\u2019s case had not built its case on the evidence supporting its appellate theory and had left such evidence unexplained, the presence of that evidence, <em>Cola </em>held, was irrelevant to the due process violation in that case. Id., 700. The <em>Cola </em>court concluded that \u201cCola has established lack of notice as to the [state\u2019s] appellate theory . . . .\u201d Id., 702. \u201cThe lack of notice here, under [the state\u2019s claim of] harmless variance analysis [which was rejected], suffices to violate due process.\u201d Id. It is clear that, quite apart from the failure of notice from the indictment to make a defendant aware of what he has to defend against at trial, a separate and distinct violation of due process will occur where \u201cwithout specification <em>at trial </em>of the appellate theory, [an appellate court] can neither be sure that defendants ever recognized, much less defended against, the <em>final </em>[state] rationale of guilt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 701; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wulff </em>207 Wis. 2d 144, 152, 557 N.W.2d 813 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Here, as the state\u2019s case went in, as the state argued to the jury and as the trial court charged the jury, the defendant could and did understand that Little was the \u201canother person\u201d whom the defendant was charged with having attempted to assault in the first degree, and not Gordon, as the state argues on this appeal. The defendant\u2019s belief at trial was reasonable under the circumstances. The state is attempting on this appeal to have this court review and decide the appeal not on the theory it pursued at trial and on which the challenged conviction was obtained, but on a new theory that it advances for the first time on appeal. The state cannot do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>This brings us to the defendant\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence claim. The defendant did not make any claim of insufficient evidence in the trial court. He now seeks review of it under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Our Supreme Court has said that <em>\u201cJackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>[supra, 443 U.S. 307] compels the conclusion that any defendant found guilty on the basis of insufficient evidence has been deprived of a constitutional right, and would therefore necessarily meet the four prongs of <em>Golding. </em>There being no practical significance, therefore, for engaging in a <em>Golding </em>analysis . . . [the Supreme Court reviewed] the defendant\u2019s challenge to his conviction [for insufficient evidence] . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 276 n.3, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>45 Conn.

Ed. 2d 969 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>30 Conn. 500, 506 (1862).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">At trial, the state presented no evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent as to Little.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There is no evidence that the defendant even knew Little or knew that Little was at the scene of the shooting. The defendant\u2019s June 4,1994 statement, taken about ten months after the shooting, does not refer to Little. Detective Rovella, who took the statement from the defendant, did not testify concerning the defendant\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d of Little.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The state put on Delroy Stone, an eyewitness to the shooting, and questioned him regarding Little as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">\u201cQ. Now you said that Will Little is someone that was there, is that correct?<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cQ. And did you see where Will Little ran?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. Did you see Will Little again in a short while?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">\u201cQ. Where did you meet up with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">\u201cA. After everything went down to Flatbush down there they have an ambulance down there, everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">\u201cQ. You saw him on Flatbush Avenue where the ambulance came to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-14\">\u201cQ. Okay. Did you see any wounds on him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-15\">\u201cA. At that time yeah, he got a wound on his butt.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-16\">\u201cQ. Okay. And was it on the left side or the right side, if you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-17\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t quite remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-18\">The state also showed Stone a photograph of Little, and Stone identified it as a photograph of Little.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-19\">The state thereafter put on the eyewitness Wilbur Jolly and questioned him about Little as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-20\">\u201cQ. Do you know someone by the name of Will Little?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-21\">\u201cA. Yes. Chill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-22\">\u201cQ. What\u2019s the name that you call him, Chill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-23\">\u201cA. Chill Will, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201cQ. Was he there [on Allen Drive]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cA. Yes ... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201cQ. What did you see when you ran?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cA. Then I see my boy Chill get shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u201cQ. Did you see where he got shot on his body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">\u201cA. In the leg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">\u201cQ. Could you see who was doing the shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">\u201cQ. Who? Who are you pointing at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-14\">\u201cA. B-Boy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-15\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s the person known as Robert Torres?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-16\">\u201cA. Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-17\">In addition, the state put on Hartford police officer Brian Heavren who was in the area and, upon hearing gunshots, came and, in the course of checking the area, found Little in the rear of a building on Flatbush Avenue. He took Little to the hospital at that time. The state also put on Linda Crabbe, the physician who treated Little at the hospital on the night of the shooting.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Neither of these witnesses testified about anything relating to the circumstances surrounding Little\u2019s shooting. Significantly, the treating physician, Crabbe, was not asked by the state about the seriousness of Little\u2019s injury. Without evidence that the defendant knew Little or knew of his presence on Allen Drive, the jury cannot have had a basis to find that the defendant possessed the required intent to injure Little seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-18\">Moreover, at trial, the state presented no alternative evidentiary basis for proving the required intent for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>assault of Little under the third count. Although the court did charge on transferred intent,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the state, in its brief, stated that \u201cno theory of transferred intent was placed before the jury. The state never argued to the jury that it should utilize transferred intent to convict the defendant of attempted assault. . . . [Transferred intent is simply not necessary because injury is not an essential element of criminal attempt. . . . [Transferred intent is not needed to convict a defendant whose aim was poor of attempted assault. . . . [T]he defendant\u2019s injection of \u2018transferred intent\u2019 into this appeal is misleading.\u201d \u201cThe issue in this appeal is <em>not </em>whether the doctrine of \u2018transferred intent\u2019 applies to attempt liability generally. The state agrees it does not.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) \u201cThe defendant\u2019s injection of transferred intent into this appeal is a red herring because transferred intent was irrelevant to the defendant\u2019s attempt to assault Gordon, not Little.\u201d \u201cThe court\u2019s explanation of transferred intent was only incidental to explaining the elements of assault in the first degree to the jury . . . .\u201d \u201cMoreover, in the context of the charge as a whole, the evidence presented, and the state\u2019s closing argument, the jury necessarily understood that transferred intent was not the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>charge of criminal attempt.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> These statements from the state\u2019s brief are disingenuous keeping in mind that the state did not object to or seek clarification of the trial court\u2019s instructions on transferred intent.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The state also suggests that \u201csimultaneous intention\u201d supports the claim that Gordon was the victim in the third count just as he was in the second count charging murder and in the first count charging conspiracy to commit minder, and there it refers to <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>237 Conn. 748, 757, 679 A.2d 920 (1996). It is true that <em>Williams </em>said: \u201cWe conclude that, under the appropriate circumstances, a defendant can simultaneously intend to cause the death of, and intend to cause serious physical injury to, the same victim.\u201d Id. In <em>Williams, </em>the court found the trial court\u2019s instruction to that effect to be proper under the circumstances of that case. <em>Williams, </em>however, is not this case. In <em>Williams, </em>the trial court specifically charged on \u201csimultaneous intention.\u201d Here, it did not. This alone serves to distinguish the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">There is no question but that the defendant went to Allen Drive on the night of the shooting with his confederates as the result of the earlier planned objective of killing Gordon. As the state presented its case, there was no claim that the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury to Gordon. The state claimed that the defendant actually murdered Gordon, but the jury found otherwise. The crime of attempted first degree assault, from the state\u2019s posture at trial as set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>out earlier, demonstrates that it truly regarded Little, not Gordon, as the victim in that count. We have already set out the state\u2019s evidence adduced against the defendant vis-a-vis Little as the victim the third count. It is totally insufficient to prove that the defendant had the requisite intent necessary for conviction in that count. That conviction violates this defendant\u2019s federal constitutional due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">It is concluded that, when evaluated under the appropriate standard, the evidence in this case is constitutionally insufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of attempted assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The judgment as to the third count is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment of acquittal as to the third count.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Azk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a.)
