J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap3o\">The defendant appeals from his conviction, after a jury trial, of having a weapon in a motor vehicle without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the same time, the defendant was also convicted of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2). On appeal, he does not challenge his robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury on the weapons charge, (2) denied his motion for judgment of acquittal and (3) admitted an exhibit without a proper chain of custody. We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The following facts are necessary for the disposition of this appeal. On May 24,1995, the victim and a friend were walking on Broad Street in downtown Bridgeport when the defendant approached the victim and placed a gun to his head. The defendant stole money from the victim\u2019s person and then ran down the street and entered a vehicle. The victim found a police officer in the immediate vicinity and together they gave chase in a cruiser until the vehicle carrying the defendant was stopped nearby. The defendant was seated in the backseat of the vehicle and was identified by the victim as the individual who had committed the robbery. After the officer conducted a lawful search of the vehicle and found two guns therein, he placed the defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In his first claim, the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction improperly omitted an essential element of the crime with which he was charged. It is axiomatic that it is the state\u2019s burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and the court\u2019s failure to charge on an essential element of a crime constitutes a constitutional defect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 510-11, 594 A.2d 906 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In the present case, the trial court failed to include in its instruction the statutory definition of a pistol as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 29-27.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant properly preserved this claim for review by filing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>request to charge the jury that the length of the gun barrel must be less than twelve inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">This appeal is controlled by <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>30 Conn. App. 68, 74-78, 618 A.2d 1372 (1993), aff'd, 228 Conn. 234, 636 A.2d 760 (1994). <em>In Hamilton, </em>the defendant walked up to a backyard swimming pool where a boy and his friends were swimming and, at gunpoint, ordered them into the house. Once inside, the defendant demanded money, pointed the gun at the boy\u2019s father and fired one shot into the ceiling. Id., 70. The defendant was subsequently charged with, inter alia, carrying a pistol without a permit. In its charge to the jury, the trial court failed to define the term pistol as specified in \u00a7 29-27, and failed to inform the jury that to find the defendant guilty of carrying a pistol without a permit, it first must find proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was carrying a weapon that had a barrel less than twelve inches in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The <em>Hamilton </em>court held that the length of a gun\u2019s barrel was an essential element of the crime of carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that failure to instruct the jury thereon required reversal of the judgment of conviction. \u201cA jury\u2019s verdict finding an accused guilty of a crime necessarily includes a determination that the state has proven all the elements of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Such a verdict cannot be upheld unless the jury had a proper instruction from the court as to the law, which must include an identification of each and every essential element for which the state has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Without such a basic instruction, we cannot conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>jury acted in a fair manner.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Hamilton, supra, 30 Conn. App. 76.</p>\n<p id=\"AEo3\">\u201cWe find . . . where the trial court failed to instruct the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty of carrying a pistol without a permit it must specifically find that the defendant had carried upon his person a firearm having a barrel less than twelve inches in length. The omission of any instruction on the barrel length of the weapon deprived the jury of the ability to perform its task properly.\u201d Id., 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">For the purposes of this opinion, we discern no material difference between the crime of carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35, as <em>in Hamilton, </em>and having a pistol in a motor vehicle without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-38, as in the present case. Accordingly, in light of <em>Hamilton, </em>the defendant\u2019s conviction for violation of \u00a7 29-38 cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Our conclusion on the defendant\u2019s first claim is dis-positive of this appeal. We do not reach the issues in the defendant\u2019s other claims because they are not likely to arise on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The judgment is reversed only as to the conviction of having a weapon in a motor vehicle without a permit and the case is remanded for a new trial on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who knowingly has, in any vehicle owned, operated or occupied by him, any weapon for which a proper permit has not been issued . . . shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years or both, and the presence of any such weapon in any vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the owner, operator and each occupant thereof. The word \u2018weapon\u2019, as used in this section, means any pistol or revolver . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-27 provides: \u201cThe term \u2018pistol\u2019 and the term \u2018revolver\u2019, as used in sections 29-28 to 29-38, inclusive, mean any firearm having a barrel less than twelve inches in length.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall carry any pistol or revolver upon his person, except when such person is within his dwelling house or place of business, without a permit to carry the same . .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
