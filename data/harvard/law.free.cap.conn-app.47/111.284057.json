J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9Qs\">The defendant commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner) appeals from a judgment of the trial court sustaining the plaintiffs appeal from the commissioner\u2019s administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">The plaintiffs motor vehicle operator\u2019s license was suspended for six months because he refused to submit to a chemical alcohol test following his arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>plaintiff challenged the suspension at an administrative hearing. The commissioner affirmed the suspension after finding that the four license suspension criteria set forth in \u00a7 14-227b (f) had been met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, claiming that the statutory criteria were not satisfied because the plaintiffs arrest was not lawful. The trial court sustained the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">On appeal to this court, the commissioner claims that the trial court improperly determined that the police lacked a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the plaintiffs vehicle and, therefore, that the plaintiffs arrest was not lawful. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to the trial court with direction to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The plaintiffs suspension was based on the following facts. At 1:07 a.m. on October 20, 1995, a Berlin police officer was informed by his dispatcher that someone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>was banging on the door of a closed restaurant and attempting to gain entry. The officer was also informed that the person in question might be driving a red Chevrolet Corsica. Upon arrival at the scene, the officer stopped a red Chevrolet Corsica that was exiting from an area behind the restaurant. The plaintiff was operating the Corsica. The officer noticed that the plaintiffs speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and he smelled of alcohol. After administering field sobriety tests, the officer placed the plaintiff under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff later refused to submit to a chemical alcohol test. Refusal to submit to such a test is grounds for suspension of an operator\u2019s license. General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201c[J]udicial review of the commissioner\u2019s action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (General Statutes . . . \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189), and the scope of that review is very restricted. ... In cases involving administrative appeals it is not the function of this court, nor was it the function of the trial court, to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Redden </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>45 Conn. App. 225, 228, 695 A.2d 26 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In order to sustain an administrative decision, all that is required is that the determination be \u201creasonably supported by the evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 512, 514, 516 A.2d 160 (1986), aff'd, 14 Conn. App. 212, 540 A.2d 1063, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 809, 545 A.2d 1105 (1988). \u201c[T]he plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the commissioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>decision to suspend a motor vehicle operating privilege was clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d <em>Bialowas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>44 Conn. App. 702, 708-709, 692 A.2d 834 (1997). \u201cSubstantial evidence exists if the administrative record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Pursuant to the license suspension criteria set forth in \u00a7 14-227b (f), in affirming a police initiated suspension, the commissioner must find, inter alia, that the operator of the vehicle was placed under arrest. The plaintiff contends that this criterion was not satisfied here because the investigatory stop that led to his arrest was unlawful. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">A police officer does not need to have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed in order to make a lawful stop of a motor vehicle. An investigatory stop is authorized if the police officer had a \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990). Whether a reasonable and articulable suspicion exists depends on the totality of the circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>24 Conn. App. 438, 441, 589 A.2d 372, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 903, 593 A.2d 130 (1991). \u201cAn investigative stop can be appropriate even where the police have not observed a violation because a reasonable and articulable suspicion can arise from conduct that alone is not criminal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kolakowski </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>43 Conn. App. 636, 644, 685 A.2d 689 (1996). The purpose of an investigatory stop is to maintain the status quo for a brief period of time to allow the police to investigate the circumstances that give rise to the suspicion of criminal wrongdoing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>In the present case, the police officer was dispatched to investigate a complaint that someone was banging on the door of a closed restaurant and attempting to gain entry shortly after 1 a.m. He was further informed that the person might be operating a red Chevrolet Corsica. Arriving at the scene, the officer observed a red Chevrolet Corsica departing from the immediate area of the restaurant. Because the vehicle was the same color and make as that identified by the complainant, the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the vehicle\u2019s operator was the person who had been seeking entry to the restaurant. Banging on the door of a closed restaurant and trying to gain entry in the middle of the night is unusual behavior. Such behavior warranted further investigation, particularly since someone had called the police to complain about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It was proper for the officer to execute a brief investigatory stop of the plaintiff in view of the complaint regarding unusual activity at the restaurant. We do not agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs conduct failed to justify a brief investigatory stop. There is substantial evidence in the record supporting the hearing officer\u2019s finding that there was a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify the police stop of the plaintiffs automobile.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The stop was warranted and the plaintiffs subsequent arrest was lawful. Thus, the trial court improperly sustained the plaintiffs appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>in light of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle in this state shall be deemed to have given his consent to a chemical analysis of his blood, breath or urine ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">\u201c(b) If any such person, having been placed under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both . . . and thereafter . . . refuses to submit to the designated test, the test shall not be given ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-15\">\u201c(c) If the person arrested refuses to submit to such test or analysis . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the: police officer, acting on behalf of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, shall immediately revoke and take possession of the motor vehicle operator\u2019s license . . . for a twenty-four-hour period and shall issue a temporary operator\u2019s license ... to such person valid for the period commencing twenty-four hours after issuance and ending thirty days after the date such person received notice of his arrest by the police officer.

(2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to such test or analysis . . . and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b144-9\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> The hearing officer made asubordinate finding that \u201c[t]here was areasonable <em>or </em>articulable suspicion to stop the respondent\u2019s vehicle . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff contends in a footnote that the hearing officer\u2019s use of the word \u201cor\u201d instead of \u201cand\u201d indicates that the hearing officer applied the wrong legal standard in determining the propriety of the stop. This court will not review any claim or any alternative claim to a properly briefed claim that has been presented and argued by way of a footnote. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>15 Conn. App. 342, 343, 545 A.2d 1109, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 819, 551 A.2d 758 (1988). Accordingly, we will not review this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
