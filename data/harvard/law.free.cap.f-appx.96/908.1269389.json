Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-22\">Blackwood asserts she was not advised of the potential consequences attendant on revocation of supervised- release at the time of her underlying guilty plea in 1993, and this failure amounts to plain error, tainting the subsequent sentence on revocation of supervised release. This claim is, in essence, a challenge to the propriety of the 1993 plea hearing and resultant sentence and conviction. Blackwood\u2019s opportunity to raise this claim by direct appeal has long since lapsed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). Similarly, Blackwood\u2019s right to move to vacate, set aside, or correct her conviction and sentence lapsed on April 24, 1997, one year after the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). <em>See Hernandez v. Caldwell, </em>225 F.3d 435, 437-39 (4th Cir. 2000); <em>Brown v. Angelone, </em>150 F.3d 370, 375-76 (4th Cir.1998). Accordingly, although we have jurisdiction over the present appeal of the revocation order, we do not have jurisdiction over the claim she advances in this appeal. <em>See United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 196 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-23\">We affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
