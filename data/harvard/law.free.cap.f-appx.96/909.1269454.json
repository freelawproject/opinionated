Bracey\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue on appeal, but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Bracey was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">Bracey asserts his plea of guilty was involuntary because he was unaware that his failure to report to serve a sentence for a North Carolina probation violation would increase the criminal history points in the computation of his sentencing level. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.1 (2002). The imposition of a sentence exceeding Bracey\u2019s expectations does not render his plea involuntary. <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394-95 (4th Cir.1992). Additionally, we find no error in the computation of Bracey\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Bracey\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
