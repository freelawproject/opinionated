Although it does not appear that Harris was seeking to appeal the district court\u2019s 1999 order, to the extent his motion was construed as a notice of appeal, such an appeal is untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a). Because the appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d we lack jurisdiction to consider Harris\u2019s claims. <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
