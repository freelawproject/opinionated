In his plea agreement, Uwaezuoke waived his right to appeal any sentence within the guideline range and below the statutory maximum. His twenty-seven month sentence satisfied both these requirements. Uwaezuoke\u2019s counsel has filed an appeal under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that the sentencing court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure. Uwaezuoke was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">We review the validity of a defendant\u2019s waiver of appellate rights de novo. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). We conclude that Uwaezuoke\u2019s waiver is valid, and his appeal is therefore meritless. <em>See United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). Accordingly, we affirm Uwaezuoke\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
