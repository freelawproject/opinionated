Escobar appeals his sentence. He asserts that the district court erroneously increased his base offense level by applying the specific offense characteristics of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1. He contends that his underlying offense was aiding and abetting a drug transaction and that only the specific offense characteristics of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 applied to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-23\">Review of Escobar\u2019s argument is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Rios-Ouintero, </em>204 F.3d 214, 215 (5th Cir. 2000). Escobar must show \u201c(1) an error; (2) that is clear or plain; (3) that affects [his] substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-24\">Escobar does not dispute that the Chapter Two Sentencing Guideline section applicable to his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1 and that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 also applied to his case because the underlying offense was aiding and abetting a drug transaction. <em>See </em>Appendix A; U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.1, lB1.2(a). Once the applicable guideline section from Chapter Two has been determined, the court is directed \u201cto determine any applicable specific offense characteristics (under that guideline).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2, comment, (n.2.).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>Amendment 634 explains that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1 was amended to ensure that money launderers receive an offense level that is \u201cone to four levels greater than the Chapter Two offense level for the underlying offense.\u201d Amendment 634, Appendix C, Vol. II. The \u201cone to four\u201d additional levels are derived from the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b) specific offense characteristics. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Frank, </em>354 F.3d 910, 927-28 (8th Cir.2004) (applying specific offense characteristic for money-laundering guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(B), in addition to specific offense characteristic for underlying offense of fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Escobar has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination of his offense level was error, plain or otherwise. Accordingly, the judgment' of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b995-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
