We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). Eshete next disputes the IJ\u2019s finding that she failed to qualify for withholding of removal. We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that Eshete failed to properly exhaust this claim when she appealed to the Board from the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Farrokhi v. U.S. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-24\">We accordingly dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-25\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
