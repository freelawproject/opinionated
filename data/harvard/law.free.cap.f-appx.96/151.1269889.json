We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">To the extent that Weir appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to withdraw her consent to have a magistrate judge preside over her case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1) (2000), we find no error in the district court\u2019s finding that Weir failed to establish \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d sufficient to withdraw the reference to the magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(4) (2000); <em>Dixon v. Ylst, </em>990 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir.1993); <em>Fellman v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>735 F.2d 55, 58 (2d Cir.1984). We further find no merit to Weir\u2019s claim that the magistrate judge did not have authority to impose sanctions against her. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(e)(4) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the magistrate judge. <em>See Weir v. Curtis, </em>No. CA-03-4 (E.D.Va. Oct. 2, 2003). We grant Weir\u2019s motion to amend her informal brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
