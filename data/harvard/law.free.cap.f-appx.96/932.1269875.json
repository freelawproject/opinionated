Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Daniel was indicted after her neighbors and erstwhile friends, Julie Herrick and Michael Richmond, reported her possession of a firearm to authorities, and a firearm was found in her residence during an ensuing search. On appeal, Daniel argues that the district court erred in denying her motions in limine and allowing the evidence of her drug use and the motivations of Herrick and Richmond to be admitted at trial. We review a district court\u2019s determination of the admissibility of evidence for abuse <em>of </em>discretion. <em>See United, States v. Brooks, </em>111 F.8d 365, 371 (4th Cir.1997). Our review convinces us that the district court properly determined that the evidence in question was relevant. <em>United States v. Masters, </em>622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir.1980). Moreover, the district court\u2019s evaluation of the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403 was not \u201can arbitrary or irrational exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Heater, </em>63 F.3d 311, 321 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">We therefore affirm Daniel\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
