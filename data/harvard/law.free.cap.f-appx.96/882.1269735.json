Keys was sentenced to twenty-seven months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release based on his conviction in the District of Maryland for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2) (2000). While on supervised release from that court, Keys was convicted by the District of Florida of similar crimes. Based in part on the Florida convictions, the District of Maryland revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to eighteen months of imprisonment to be followed by a new term of twelve months of supervised release. The eighteen-month sentence was imposed to run consecutively to Keys\u2019 Florida sentence. On appeal, Keys challenges the sentence imposed for violating his supervised release. Keys\u2019 counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issue: whether the court erred by imposing Keys\u2019 eighteen-month sentence to run consecutively with his sentence for his convictions in the District of Florida. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-20\">We do not find that the district court abused its discretion by imposing Keys\u2019 sentence for violating his supervised release to run consecutively with his Florida convictions. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995) (stating standard of review). More specifically, we do not find that the district court impermissibly imposed multiple punishments for the same conduct. <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>200 F.3d 218, 221 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>ments of <em>Anders, </em>including the issues raised in Keys\u2019 pro se supplemental brief, and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. We grant Keys\u2019 motion for an extension of time to file a reply brief but deny his motion to compel and \u201cEmergency Motion to Stay All Proceedings.\u201d This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
