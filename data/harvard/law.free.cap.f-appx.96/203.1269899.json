As an initial matter, the district court had jurisdiction over the issues raised in this habeas petition. <em>See INS v. St Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 314, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Idokogi\u2019s argument that his prior convictions for theft do not qualify as aggravated felonies under the Immigration and Naturalization Act is meritless. Each prior conviction involved the receipt of stolen property, and he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of at least one year on each conviction. <em>See Lopez-Elias v. Reno, </em>209 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Idokogi\u2019s arguments surrounding the process he received at the removal proceeding is likewise without merit, as he fails to make a showing of substantial prejudice. <em>See Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). As Idokogi is not entitled to habeas relief from the removal order, neither is he entitled to have his removal held in abeyance while he collaterally challenges his 1998 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
