He argues that the district court erred in upwardly departing to the statutory maximum of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment because the departure effectively negated his three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. He also argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">There was no error in the district court\u2019s determination that Colunga\u2019s criminal history category significantly underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history. Additionally, the district court properly found that Colunga\u2019s recent similar crimes indicated a high likelihood of recidivism and demonstrated that prior punishment had not been an effective deterrent. Thus, whether the standard of review is abuse of discretion or de novo, the district court did not err in departing upward. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. and 5K2.0, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">The district court\u2019s reasons for departure were acceptable. <em>See United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 807 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). Furthermore, Colunga has demonstrated no error regarding the extent of the departure. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Daughenbaugh, </em>49 F.3d 171, 174-75 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">Colunga acknowledges that his argument regarding the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>323 F.3d 320, 322 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 124, 157 L.Ed.2d 86 (2003). Nevertheless, he raises the issue to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. Colunga\u2019s argument is indeed foreclosed by <em>Jimenez. See United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, his conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
