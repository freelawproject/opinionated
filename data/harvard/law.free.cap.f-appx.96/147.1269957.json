Dew appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to comply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires a party to provide \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim.\u201d The district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice is not appealable. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). A dismissal without prejudice is a final order only if \u201c\u2018no amendment [to the complaint] could cure the defects in the plaintiffs case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1067 (quoting <em>Coniston Corp. v. Village of Hoffman Estates, </em>844 F.2d 461, 463 (7th Cir.1988)). In ascertaining whether a dismissal without prejudice is reviewable in this court, we must determine \u201cwhether the plaintiff could save his action by merely amending his complaint.\u201d <em>Domino Sugar, </em>10 F.3d at 1066-67. In this case, as the district court explained, Dew can \u201ccure the defect by amending his complaint to comply with Rule 8.\u201d Therefore, the dismissal order is not appealable. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
