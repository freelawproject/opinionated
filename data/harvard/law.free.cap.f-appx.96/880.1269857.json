Harris, Inc. and The Fastest Car Wash, L.L.C. (\u201cHarris\u201d). We dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">In its amended complaint, Harris contended that Drake Petroleum breached a contract between the parties by failing to remediate contamination on property sold to Harris by Drake Petroleum (and to obtain paperwork certifying the remediation), and it requested judgment \u201cin the amount of .not less than $300,000, plus interest, costs and attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, and for such further relief as the Court may deem just and equitable.\u201d (J.A. 22). As the case progressed in the district court, Harris filed a \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment on Kenyon\u2019s Liability for Breach of Contract,\u201d in which it stated that it was seeking \u201ca judgment that [Drake Petroleum] is contractually liable for the environmental remediation of the Property and all associated costs,\u201d and that it \u201cdo[es] not seek summary judgment on damages, which will remain an issue for trial.\u201d (J.A. 145). Harris appears to have consistently argued throughout the district court proceedings that it was seeking summary judgment only on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">The district court granted Harris\u2019 motion for summary judgment and ordered that judgment be entered in Harris\u2019 favor. The district court explained that the contract requires (among other things) Drake Petroleum to remediate the contamination. However, nowhere in the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion or order is there any grant of monetary (or injunctive) relief for Harris. The district court thus ruled on the only issue presented by <em>Harris </em>\u2014 ie., Drake Petroleum\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-23\">\u201c[W]hen our appellate jurisdiction is in doubt, we must <em>sua sponte </em>raise and address the matter.\u201d <em>Snowden v. Check-Point Check Cashing, </em>290 F.3d 631, 635 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1087, 123 S.Ct. 695, 154 L.Ed.2d 631 (2002). Subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>to certain exceptions not applicable here, our appellate jurisdiction extends only to appeals from \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of the district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201c[A] decision is ordinarily considered final and appealable under \u00a7 1291 only if it \u2018ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 712, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996) (quoting <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945)). A summary judgment decision that is limited to a determination of liability is not considered to be \u201cfinal\u201d until the damages or other relief has been determined. <em>See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 744, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976) (\u201cSuch judgments are by their terms interlocutory ... and where assessment of damages or awarding of other relief remains to be resolved have never been considered to be \u2018final\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Because the district court has not yet determined the relief to which Harris is entitled as a result of the breach of contract, the summary judgment from which Drake Petroleum appeals is not final under \u00a7 1291. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-8\">We note that without discussing the issue in terms of jurisdiction, Drake Petroleum (the appellant) has argued to us the lack of finality of the summary judgment order. <em>See Brief of Appellant, </em>at 46 (\"the trial court erred in entering final judgment ... where the only relief sought was partial summary judgment establishing liability for breach of contract and there was no evidence before the court relating to damages\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
