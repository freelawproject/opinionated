His argument that the district court clearly erred in increasing his offense level for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 is without merit. In addition to other instances, Bates used the Harris alias when he appeared before the magistrate judge for his detention hearing. The two-level adjustment was therefore appropriate. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(f)); <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>964 F.2d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">There is no merit in Bates\u2019 argument that the district court should have awarded him a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Although Bates entered a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial, his failure to reveal the source of the narcotics or how they got into the car was construed by the court either as a failure to admit the conduct comprising the offense of conviction or as a false denial of relevant conduct (i.e., denial of knowledge that others hid the narcotics in the car). See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.3). The court\u2019s reliance on the PSR for this determination was not error. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 242 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, the two-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 indicates that Bates was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">Bates\u2019 argument that the district court erred in not awarding him a \u201csafety valve\u201d reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 is without merit. The district was free to adopt the PSR\u2019s conclusion that Bates did not provide information regarding the source of the cocaine or how it got into the vehicle but instead denied any knowledge of such facts. <em>See Brown, </em>54 F.3d at 242. He was therefore disqualified by \u00a7 501.2(a)(5) from receiving a safety valve reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-12\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
