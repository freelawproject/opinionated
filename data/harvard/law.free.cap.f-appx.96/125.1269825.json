Newton\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although concluding that such allegations lacked merit, counsel asserted that the district court clearly erred when it reached its finding. Newton has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Section 4245 provides for the hospitalization of an imprisoned person suffering from a mental disease or defect. The district court properly grants a \u00a7 4245 motion if the government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the inmate currently suffers from a mental disease or defect requiring \u201ccustody for care or treatment in a suitable facility.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>45 F.3d 837, 840 (4th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s determination of this issue is one of fact that we review under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United States v. Steil, </em>916 F.2d 485, 487 (8th Cir.1990). A finding is clearly erroneous when \u201cthe reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Faulconer v. Commissioner, </em>748 F.2d 890, 895 (4th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">The district court relied on two independent written psychiatric evaluations of Newton as well as the live testimony of a psychiatrist at FCI-Butner. The unanimous expert conclusion was that Newton suffered from a mental disease or defect for which he required treatment in a suitable facility. Newton did not present any evidence to the contrary. We therefore conclude the district court did not clearly err when it found Newton needed to be placed in a suitable facility for care or treatment of his mental illness under \u00a7 4245. We also conclude Newton received all of the procedural protections to which he was entitled. <em>See Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 494-96, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980) (identifying minimum procedural safeguards for commitment under \u00a7 4245).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the decision of the district court. The court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>tation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
