The record does not contain a transcript of the evidence presented at trial that day. An appellant has the burden of including in the record on appeal a transcript of all parts of the proceedings material to the issues raised on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b); 4th Cir. R. 10(c). An appellant proceeding on appeal in for-ma pauperis is entitled to transcripts at government expense only in certain circumstances. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (2000). By failing to produce a transcript or to qualify for the production of a transcript at government expense, Owens has waived review of the issues on appeal that depend upon the transcript to show error. <em>See Powell v. Estelle, </em>959 F.2d 22, 26 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Keller v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>827 F.2d 952, 954 n. 1 (4th Cir.1987). As no error appears on the record before us, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
