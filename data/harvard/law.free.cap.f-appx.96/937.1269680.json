This Court previously denied Spotts a certificate of appealability in his appeal of the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss Spotts\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Spotts, </em>89 Fec.Appx. 824 (4th Cir.2004). We therefore dismiss Spotts\u2019 present appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Spotts filed motions seeking transcripts of the grand jury proceedings, a request previously denied by this Court in No. 03-7794 and in case No. 04-6256. He also seeks consolidation of this case with No. 03-7794, a case decided as noted above. We dismiss these motions and Spotts\u2019 motions for a stay of proceedings and to expedite proceedings as moot. We deny Spotts\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauper-is. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
