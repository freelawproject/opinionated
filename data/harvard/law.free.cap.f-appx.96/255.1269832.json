Carr contends that the district court relied upon inaccurate facts in denying his petition, complains that the district court abused its discretion in not allowing him to file a reply, and asserts that the record does not show that he was given a credit toward his state sentence for the time spent in federal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-25\">Carr is not entitled to double credit. Therefore, his complaint that the BOP\u2019s records are inaccurate is without merit, because even if true, Carr would not be eligible for credit toward his federal sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585; <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 334, 337, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992); Vignera <em>v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>455 F.2d 637, 637-38 (5th Cir.1972). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by not allowing Carr to file a reply. For Carr\u2019s contention that he should receive state credit for the time spent in federal custody, Carr has not met his initial burden of showing that he did not receive such credit. <em>See Orman v. Cain, </em>228 F.3d 616, 619 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Because Carr has not briefed whether the district court erred in dismissing the remainder of his claims for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, that issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
