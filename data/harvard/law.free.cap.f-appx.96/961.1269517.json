Pettigrew appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against Ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>non Arrell, the Commissioner of the Texas Rehabilitation Commission (TRC). Pettigrew argues that the district court had jurisdiction over his claims against Arrell pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">In the district court, Pettigrew explicitly-abandoned his claim that the district court had jurisdiction over his claims against Arrell pursuant to the Social Security Act as provided for in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3). Moreover, the district court\u2019s grant of Arrell\u2019s second motion to dismiss was based not on lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 but on the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that Pettigrew failed to argue in his brief to the district court that Arrell unconstitutionally used the framework analysis. Pettigrew does not argue on appeal that the district court erred when it dismissed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331-based claims against Arrell based on Pettigrew\u2019s abandoning them by failing to brief them in the district court. He has therefore waived this issue on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Pettigrew\u2019s argument that he should not be required to exhaust administrative remedies on remand lacks merit inasmuch as he has already exhausted his administrative remedies, <em>see Harper v. Bowen, </em>813 F.2d 737, 739 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-40\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
