Doza disputes the IJ\u2019s negative credibility finding and asserts that he established his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Upon our review of the administrative record, we find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Doza failed to establish eligibility for the relief sought. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b) (2003); <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). Doza thus cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See INS v. Cardozcir-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-14\">.

Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is still applicable under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
