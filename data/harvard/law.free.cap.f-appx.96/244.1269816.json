Counsel appointed to represent Hernandez has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief as required by <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Hernandez has received a copy of counsel\u2019s brief and has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-22\">Hernandez challenges his indictment and conviction on the ground that he had not \u201centered\u201d or been \u201cfound in\u201d the United States. He further argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the facts of his case and challenge his indictment and conviction on that same ground. Hernandez also argues that counsel appointed to represent him on appeal was ineffective for failing to raise this same argument on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-23\">In this case, the record was sufficiently developed for us to review Hernandez\u2019 claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Our independent review of the brief, the record, and Hernandez\u2019 response discloses that there is no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
