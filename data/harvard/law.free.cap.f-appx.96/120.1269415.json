We dismiss the appeals for lack of jurisdiction because Appellant\u2019s notices of appeal were not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-18\">In civil cases such as the present one, parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-20\">The district court\u2019s order, issued August 26, 2003, was entered on the docket by the clerk on September 16, 2003. Appellant\u2019s first notice of appeal, designated No. 03-7717, was filed October 17, 2003, one day out of time. Appellant\u2019s second notice of appeal, apparently filed in response to the judgment of September 16 that entered the August order on the docket, was filed on November 9, 2003. This second appeal, designated No. 03-7911, was also untimely. Because Appellant failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
