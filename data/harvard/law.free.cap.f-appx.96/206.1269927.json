Gutierrez-Morales also argues that the arrest which prompted his removal was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Gutierrez-Morales waived the opportunity to submit his application for cancellation of removal when he missed the imposed filing deadline. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.31(c) (2003). His motion to reopen was properly denied because he was informed of his right to apply for cancellation of removal, and he was provided an opportunity to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.23(b)(3) (2002). Thus, the Immigration Judge did not violate Gutierrez-Morales\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Gutierrez-Morales\u2019 challenge to his arrest does not warrant relief because even if he could demonstrate that his arrest was illegal, it would have no bearing on the validity of his subsequent removal. <em>I.N.S. v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1040, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Gutierrez-Morales' petition for review is therefore denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-20\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
