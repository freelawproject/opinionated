Tubbs appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court clearly erred in including the weight of the \u201cbones\u201d in the drug quantity attributed to him. Because bones, a byproduct of the methamphetamine manufacturing process, can be injected by users without separating the methamphetamine, bones constitutes a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine for purposes of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.1). The district court did not clearly err in including the entire weight of the bones in the drug quantity attributed to Tubbs. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), comment. (n.A); <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>271 F.3d 611, 612 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-24\">Tubbs also argues that the district court erred in denying his request for appointment of an expert chemist to testify at the sentencing hearing. Tubbs failed to make the necessary showing to obtain appointment of an expert witness. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>724 F.2d 1128, 1130 (5th Cir.1984); <em>see also Moore v. Johnson, </em>225 F.3d 495, 503 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
