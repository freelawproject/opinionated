Reedy seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order and order on reconsideration dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition. Reedy cannot appeal these orders unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certificate of appealability, and a certificate of appealability will not issue absent a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A habeas appellant meets this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 326, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Reedy has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Reedy\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
