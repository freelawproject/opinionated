Lasa-Garcia argues that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his political opinion. Lasa-Garcia asserts that the murder of his father constitutes <em>de facto </em>past persecution. He contends that this form of persecution is so severe that asylum should be granted, regardless whether changed conditions have dispelled any well-founded fear of future persecution. Although Lasa-Garcia identifies the standard of review for withholding of removal applications, he fails to address this issue in the body of his brief. Accordingly, the withholding of removal claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986) (issues not briefed are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-22\">When, as in this case, the BIA adopts without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Here, the IJ\u2019s determination that LasaGarcia had not shown past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to El Salvador was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Gomez-Mejia v. I.N.S., </em>56 F.3d 700, 702 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, Lasa-Garcia\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
