Anzueto-Veliz does not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s finding that he failed to file his application within one year of his arrival. Thus, he has waived his claim for asylum. See <em>Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-25\">We also conclude that the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying withholding of removal was supported by substantial evidence. Anzueto-Veliz alleges that he got into a fight with gang members in Guatemala because he refused to join their gang; however, he admits that he had no further direct contact with any gang members after the initial altercation. Anzueto-Veliz merely alleges that he left Guatemala <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>because the gang members continued to inquire about his whereabouts after he had moved several times within Guatemala. Anzueto-Veliz\u2019s isolated encounter with gang members did not constitute persecution and was not indicative of the likelihood of future persecution upon his return to Guatemala. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Anzueto-Veliz\u2019s petition for review is therefore denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-17\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
