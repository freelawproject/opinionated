For the following reasons, we uphold the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-23\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b984-24\">Leewright was arrested after authorities discovered more than 100 computer files of images depicting various post-pubescent females under the age of 18 on Lee-wright\u2019s home computer. Leewright later pleaded guilty to use of an interactive computer service for receipt of obscene matter in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-25\">According to the Presentence Report, the base offense level for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462 is 15 when the sexual exploitation of a minor is involved. Two additional offense levels were added because the crime involved the use of a computer. An additional two offense levels were added because Leewright\u2019s computer contained at least 10 images. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2). Finally, Leewright received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, leaving him with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>base <em>offense level of 16. </em>With Leewright\u2019s criminal history category of I, the guideline range for imprisonment was 21 to 27 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Leewright objected to the Presentence Report, arguing that the two-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2) for his computer containing at least 10 images was inappropriate. Leewright argued that the term \u201citem,\u201d as it is used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2), refers not to individual images, but to computer disks. Essentially, Leewright wanted the hard drive in his computer to count as one item for the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The trial court denied Leewright\u2019s objection and sentenced him to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">APPLICATION OF U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Leewright argues on appeal that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2) should not apply because prior to its amendment, the guideline was unclear as to the meaning of the term \u201citem.\u201d He further argues that Amendment 592, the amendment that explicitly includes individual computer files in the definition of \u201citem\u201d for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2), was enacted following his crime. Leewright argues that because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2) was ambiguous prior to its amendment, the district court should have interpreted the term \u201citem\u201d to exclude individual computer files. According to Leewright, the application of Amendment 592 would violate the ex post facto clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">Leewright did not present his ex post facto argument to the district court. Thus, we review the argument for plain error. <em>United States v. Musa, </em>45 F.3d 922, 924 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.1995). This court may correct forfeited errors only when the appellant shows that (1) there is an error; (2) the error is clear or obvious; and (3) the error affects the appellant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">To avoid ex post facto problems, the district court must apply the version of the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense. <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>18 F.3d 301, 301 n. 1 (5th Cir.1994); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(1). Amendment 592 became effective November 1, 2000. <em>United States v. Reedy, </em>304 F.3d 358, 366 n. 11 (5th Cir.2002); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2, comment. (n.2). Thus, to avoid an ex post facto problem Leewright\u2019s offense must have predated the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">The Government contends that Lee-wright\u2019s crime followed the effective date of the amendment. Leewright also conceded this point by pleading guilty to receiving obscene matter between the August 1, 2001 and October 26, 2001. The suggestion by Leewright that his subscription to the child pornography computer service from which he downloaded the obscene files ended in August of 2000, is insufficient to show plain error. Thus, Leewright has not shown that the conclusion that his offense predated Amendment 592 is clearly obvious or erroneous. <em>See Calverley, </em>37 F.3d at 162-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-16\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b985-17\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the sentence and conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-16\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
