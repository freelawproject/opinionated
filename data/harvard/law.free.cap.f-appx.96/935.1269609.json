We find that mandamus relief is not warranted at this time because the district court has recently ordered the Government to respond to the petition, which should lead to resolution of the motion. Accordingly, although we grant McCoy\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the mandamus petition without prejudice to the filing of another mandamus petition if the district court does not act seasonably. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b967-15\"> The Government did not receive a copy of the petition when it was filed in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
