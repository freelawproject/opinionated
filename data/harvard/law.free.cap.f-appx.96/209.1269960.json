INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). And, because Lemma is not eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Faddoul, </em>37 F.3d at 188. Moreover, Lemma failed to exhaust his claim for relief under the CAT, therefore this court is without jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Lemma\u2019s claim that the IJ erred in excluding evidence under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.33 and 287.6 (certification of foreign documents and translations) fails because he has not demonstrated substantial prejudice as a result of the exclusion. <em>See Molina v. Sewell, </em>983 F.2d 676, 678 (5th Cir.1993). His claim that his due process rights were violated by such exclusion under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.6(b) fails for the same reason. <em>See Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
