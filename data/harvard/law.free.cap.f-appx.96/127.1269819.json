We previously granted Mobley a certificate of appealability on this issue. In the same order, we denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed Mobley\u2019s appeal with respect to all other issues. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the district court\u2019s order as to the issue on which we granted a certificate of appealability and remand for resentencing. We also grant Mobley\u2019s motion to take judicial notice of our decision in <em>United States v. Gadsen, </em>332 F.3d 224 (4th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Mobley pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine. In establishing a criminal history category of II, the district court assessed two criminal history points for a September 1990 North Carolina conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. The district court sentenced Mobley to a 169-month prison term, the middle of the applicable sentencing guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">In the post-conviction proceedings in the district court, Mobley replied to the Government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 2255 motion on August 21, 2000, and stated that the state court had overturned his 1990 conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. The state court \u201cset aside and removed [the conviction] from [Mobley\u2019s] criminal record\u201d on February 11, 2000, concluding that \u201cthe record does not disclose that [Mobley] voluntarily and understanding^ entered this plea.\u201d Because two criminal history points were assessed for the 1990 conviction, Mobley argued that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994), and <em>Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001), he should be resentenced without those points. He asserted that, with one criminal history point remaining, his criminal history category should be I. With an offense level of thirty-three, the applicable guideline range should be 135 to 168 months. The district court denied Mobley\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-17\">Mobley contends on appeal that calculating his criminal history category of II using the expunged state court conviction resulted in a harsher sentence than that to which he would have been subject with a criminal history category of I. The Government has responded,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Mobley replied. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 22(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-18\">In denying Mobley\u2019s claim as untimely, the district court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Gadsen, </em>332 F.3d at 229 (holding that \u201cthe federal statute of limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tions begins running when the state court conviction is conclusively invalidated\u201d). Under <em>Gadsen, </em>Mobley timely filed his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Turning to the merits of Mobley\u2019s claim, we conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Custis </em>and <em>Daniels </em>allow a prisoner, like Mobley, to seek reopening of his federal sentence when a state court conviction, for which criminal history points were assessed, has been overturned. <em>Gadsen, </em>332 F.3d 228; <em>United States v. Doe, </em>239 F.3d 473, 474-75 (2d Cir.2001). Moreover, we find that, in declining to reopen Mobley\u2019s federal sentence, the district court erred by according no weight to the state court\u2019s opinion overturning the conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. <em>See United States v. Cox, </em>245 F.3d 126, 130 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Mateo v. United States, </em>276 F.Supp.2d 186, 193 (D.Mass.2003); <em>cf. Fisher v. Angelone, </em>163 F.3d 835, 844 (4th Cir.1998). Giving the state court\u2019s order setting aside the conviction the appropriate legal effect, Mobley is entitled to have his federal sentence reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Having concluded that Mobley\u2019s federal sentence should be reopened, we turn to the question of whether the state court conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was expunged for purposes of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(j) &amp; comment. (n.10) (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cConvictions reversed or vacated for reasons related to constitutional invalidity, innocence, or errors of law are expunged for purposes of the Guidelines and therefore cannot be included in criminal history calculations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>83 F.3d 336, 339 (10th Cir.1996); <em>see United States v. Dobovsky, </em>279 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Hines, </em>133 F.3d 1360, 1363 (10th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>991 F.2d 866, 871 (D.C.Cir.1993). Because the state court set aside the conviction based upon the constitutional invalidity of Mobley\u2019s guilty plea, we find that the sentence was expunged and should not be included in the calculation of Mobley\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order on the issue for which we granted a certificate of appealability and remand for resentencing without the assessment of two criminal history points for the expunged conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\">. To the extent that the Government suggests for the first time on appeal that Mobley\u2019s claim is procedurally defaulted, we find that dle Government is precluded from asserting such defense. <em>See United States v. Metzger, </em>3 F.3d 756, 757-58 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. The current version of this provision is identical to the provision in effect in 1994 when Mobley was sentenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
