We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision, designated by the Board as the final agency determination, and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Zeng failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 </em>U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, 502 </em>U.S. at 483-84). We do not find the record so compelling so as to reverse the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In addition, we find no error in the Board\u2019s decision to affirm without opinion the immigration judge\u2019s oral decision. <em>See Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We deny Zeng\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
