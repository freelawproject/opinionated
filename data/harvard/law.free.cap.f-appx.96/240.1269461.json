Ewing appeals his sentence, following his guilty-plea conviction of possession of marijuana by a federal inmate, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2). Ewing contends the district court clearly erred by denying a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Although Ewing timely pleaded guilty and admitted to the Probation Office his role in the offense, the Probation Office reported that Ewing subsequently was again involved in possessing marijuana and other unauthorized items while he was an inmate. The district court upheld the Probation Office\u2019s withdrawal of an earlier recommendation that Ewing be granted an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, because he had not \u201cvoluntarily terminat[ed] or withdraw[n] from criminal conduct\u201d. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n.l(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The district court\u2019s finding that Ewing failed to show that he had accepted responsibility was not \u201cwithout foundation\u201d, <em>see United States v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247, 264 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. <em>denied </em>525 U.S. 973, 119 S.Ct. 426, 142 L.Ed.2d 347 (1998), as it was supported by unrebutted information in Ewing\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 286 (5th Cir.2002) (under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3, p.s., PSR information bears \u201c \u2018sufficient indicia of reliability\u2019 \u201d in making factual determinations under the Sentencing Guidelines, \u201c \u2018especially when there is no evidence in rebuttal\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
