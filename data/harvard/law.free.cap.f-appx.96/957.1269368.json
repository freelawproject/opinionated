The district court, however, did not rule on whether Allen should be granted a COA to appeal the dismissal of his habeas corpus claims. Although Allen has not requested a COA to appeal the dismissal of his habeas corpus claims, this court may construe his notice of appeal as such a request. <em>See </em>fed. r. app. p. 22(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">Until the district court issues a COA ruling, this court lacks jurisdiction to address Allen\u2019s appellate COA request. <em>See United States v. Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d 1113, 1115 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the district court for the LIMITED PURPOSE of determining whether a COA should issue in accordance with Fed. R.App. P. 22(b) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). <em>See Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d at 1115. Once the district court has issued such a ruling, this court will consider both Allen\u2019s COA request and his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-18\">LIMITED REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
