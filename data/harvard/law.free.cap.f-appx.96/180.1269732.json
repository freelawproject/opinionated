The money-laundering offense level was based in part on the fraud offense level. Petty\u2019s ultimate sentence was based on the offense level for the money-laundering counts, which was higher than the offense level for the fraud counts. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2S1.1, comment. (n.6) (directing application of \u00a7 3D1.2(c) in money-laundering cases), \u00a7 3D1.2(e) (directing grouping of fraud and money-laundering accounts), \u00a7 3D1.3(a) (directing use of highest offense level where offenses are grouped pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.2(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The sentencing court did not exceed its \u201cgreat latitude\u201d in making a \u201creasonable estimate\u201d that the amount of loss exceeded $7 million. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(K) &amp; comment. (n.2(C)); <em>United States v. Ravitch, </em>128 F.3d 865, 870 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cgreat latitude\u201d). The calculation was in accord with <em>United States v. Deavours, </em>219 F.3d 400, 402 (5th Cir.2000), and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.2(F)(iv)). The court committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The finding of the number of victims is reviewed only for plain error because Petty failed to apprise the district court specifically of the ground for his objection. <em>See United States v. Maldonado, </em>42 F.3d 906, 910-12 (5th Cir.1995); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A). The PSR found, and the record shows, that there were more than 2000 victims. Petty stipulated that more than 50 investors had not received repayment, and he provides no reasonable basis for excluding any of them from the number of victims. Petty fails to show that the determination of the number of victims was erroneous in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Petty\u2019s offense level was increased because he was participating in a relocation of his scheme to Canada in order to evade law enforcement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8). Petty admitted that he was relocating his operation, and his unsworn assertions of a legitimate motive for the relocation failed to rebut the PSR\u2019s findings that indicated Petty was hoping to evade law enforcement. Absent rebuttal evidence, the district court was entitled to rely on the PSR\u2019s findings without further inquiry. <em>See United States v. Huerta, </em>182 F.3d 361, 364-66 (5th Cir.1999). The district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Petty makes no argument on appeal relevant to the increase of the money-laundering offense level based upon Petty\u2019s role as \u201can organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). He waives appeal of this issue by failing to address it. <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 558 n. 2 (5th Cir.2002) (failure to provide legal or factual analysis of issue results in its waiver). The arguments Petty does make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>about the role-adjustment pertain only to the fraud counts. Lowering the fraud-count offense level based on the role adjustment would not reduce Petty\u2019s sentence because this adjustment was not used to calculate the money-laundering offense level or, therefore, the total offense level. Accordingly, any error would be harmless under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a). In any event, Petty failed to show any error in the court\u2019s finding that he was the leader or organizer of a criminal activity that was extensive. <em>See United States v. Full-wood, </em>342 F.3d 409, 414-15 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"AoA\">Petty\u2019s claim concerning the adjustment for abuse of a position of trust pertains only to the fraud offense level and would not affect his sentence. Nonetheless, we hold that the district court committed no error, clear, plain, or otherwise by concluding that Petty used a \u201cposition of trust\u201d to further his crime. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3; <em>United States v. Buck, </em>324 F.3d 786, 793 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Dahlstrom, </em>180 F.3d 677, 685 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b212-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
