We find that the Board\u2019s conclusion that Worede failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to qualify for relief from deportation was not \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Huaman-Comelio v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-20\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
