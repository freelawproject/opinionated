For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Matto challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that he failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We have reviewed the immigration judge\u2019s decision and the administrative record and find that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that although Matto\u2019s testimony was credible, he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum on a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish his eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). As the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief that Matto seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Matto\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Matto fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">Finally, we conclude that Matto has failed to prove that it is more likely than not that he would be subjected to torture upon his return to Niger, in violation of the Convention Against Torture. Based on our review of the record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying relief, we find that Matto failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d or to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would face torture if returned to Niger. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003) (stating that to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, an alien must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
