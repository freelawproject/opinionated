We have a duty, <em>sua sponte, </em>to examine our appellate jurisdiction. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Culbert\u2019s first post-judgment motion, the motion for reconsideration, was filed within 10 business days of the entry of judgment. It thus suspended the time for filing a notice of appeal until the motion was denied. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv); <em>Harcon Barge Co., Inc. v. D &amp; G Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 665, 667 (5th Cir.1986). Culbert did not file a notice of appeal from the judgment, or from the denial of the first post-judgment motion, within the next 30 days, however. Instead, he filed his second post-judgment motion, the motion for \u201crehearing.\u201d This second motion, filed more than 10 days after entry of final judgment, did not toll the time in which Culbert had to file a notice of appeal from the final judgment or the denial of the first post-judgment motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A); <em>Harcon Barge, </em>784 F.2d at 667; <em>see also Latham v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>987 F.2d 1199, 1203 (5th Cir.1993) (litigant may not use second Rule 60(b) motion to circumvent time limits for the appeal). However, because Culbert\u2019s notice of appeal was filed within 30 days of the denial of the second post-judgment motion, it was timely with respect to the denial of that motion. Our jurisdiction is thus limited to the denial of the second post-judgment motion. Review is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Latham, </em>987 F.2d at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-22\">Culbert argues. that the district court erred in denying his second post-judgment motion without hearing the merits of his civil rights claims. Whether Culbert\u2019s complaint set forth the elements of a civil rights claim is immaterial to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>court\u2019s denial of his post-judgment motion given that the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Culbert thus has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion by denying the motion. (Gilbert's motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
