See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b154-13\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">Khalid Elhaj, a native and citizen of Sudan, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBoard\u201d) order affirming an immigration judge\u2019s decision finding that Elhaj\u2019s asylum application was untimely filed and denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations\u2019 Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). For the following reasons, we deny Elhaj\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">Elhaj first argues that the Board erred in utilizing its streamlining regulations in his case, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(i) (2003). Counsel for the Government responds that the Board\u2019s decision was issued pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) (2003) and contained no error of fact or law. We agree with the Government\u2019s position and find no merit to Elhaj\u2019s arguments to the contrary. Moreover, to the extent that Elhaj attacks the constitutionality of the Board\u2019s streamlining regulations as a violation of due process, we recently found such a claim without merit. <em>See Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">Next, Elhaj claims the immigration judge erred in finding that his asylum application was not timely filed, and the Board likewise erred in affirming the immigration judge\u2019s ruling on this point. We may not review the immigration judge\u2019s and the Board\u2019s determinations that an asylum applicant has failed to file a timely application. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), the Attorney General\u2019s decision regarding whether an alien has complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary or changed circumstances justifying waiver of that time limit is not reviewable by any court. Moreover, a number of other circuits have held that this jurisdiction-stripping provision precludes federal appellate court review. <em>See Haoud v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 201, 205 (1st Cir.2003); <em>Castellano-Chacon v. INS, </em>341 F.3d 533, 542-44 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180,185 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Mo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>lina-Estrada, v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Finally, Elhaj contends the Board erred in affirming the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the denial of his withholding of removal claim and protection under the CAT. We have reviewed the immigration judge\u2019s and the Board\u2019s decisions and conclude that the reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to decide to the contrary. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000); <em>Rush v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Accordingly, we deny Elhaj\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
