King has also filed a motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-24\">For the first time in this court, King relies upon the Bureau of Prisons Policy Statement 1560.05 and argues that the Regional Inmate Systems Manager did not consider all of the relevant factors outlined in PS 1560.05. He also asserts for the first time in this court that the district court judgment in a criminal case should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>be construed as indicating no objection to a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>designation of the state prison as the place of federal confinement. The contentions that King now seeks to present in this court were not raised in the district court and will not be considered on appeal. <em>See Free v. Miles, </em>333 F.3d 550, 552 n. 4 (5th Cir.2003). As there is no argument properly before this court, the appeal is frivolous and is dismissed as such. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. King\u2019s motion to supplement the record is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b987-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
