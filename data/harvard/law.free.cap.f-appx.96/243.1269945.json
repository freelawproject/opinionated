In his petition he asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>a claim that he was a national of the United States. The district court denied Hajjaoui\u2019s habeas corpus petition and transferred Hajjaoui\u2019s nationality claim to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-25\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 permits a transfer if this court would have been able to exercise jurisdiction on the date that the case was filed in the district court, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case, and the transfer is in the interest of justice. Hajjaoui filed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court prior to the date that the immigration judge issued the removal order and he did not appeal the removal order to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Therefore, this court could not have exercised jurisdiction over the petition on the date that Hajjaoui filed the petition in district court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>of the final order of removal); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies as of right); <em>Emejulu v. INS, </em>989 F.2d 771, 771 (5th Cir.1993) (noting that this court would not assume original jurisdiction over habeas corpus claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
