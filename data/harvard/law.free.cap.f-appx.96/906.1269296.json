The district court concluded Sar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>tori\u2019s claims sounded in habeas, dismissed Sartori\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983 (2000), and instructed him to particularize his complaint to comply with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). Sartori\u2019s amended complaint failed to comply with the district court\u2019s instruction, and the district court denied relief. Sartori moved for reconsideration. The district court noted that Sartori \u201cshows the court that his previous motion to amend actually sought to amend the relief requested\u201d and that Sartori \u201cargues that his claim should now be construed as a discrimination suit under \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983, and not as a petition for habeas corpus.\u201d The district court nonetheless denied the motion for reconsideration, holding that \u201c[r]egardless, the plaintiffs claim will still be dismissed.\u201d Sartori appeals from the district court\u2019s order and order on reconsideration denying relief on his amended complaint. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. See <em>Sartori v. Cooper, </em>No. CA-02-875-5-F (E.D.N.C. filed Sept. 26, 2003; entered Sept. 29, 2003 <em>&amp; </em>filed Oct. 23, 2003; entered Oct. 27, 2003). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
