Torres contests the merits of the IJ\u2019s determination that he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal on the ground of continuous presence and because he faded to demonstrate the requisite hardship. The Respondent has filed a motion requesting that we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction because the IJ\u2019s determination on hardship is a discretionary one that is immune from judicial review. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that Torres\u2019s children would not suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if Torres were deported to Mexico. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D); 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Bravo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 590, 592 (5th Cir.2003). As the IJ\u2019s determination on hardship is fatal to Torres\u2019s application, and that determination is not subject to judicial review, it would be a hollow act for us to consider the IJ\u2019s finding on continuous presence, much less rule on it. The Respondent\u2019s motion is therefore GRANTED and Torres\u2019s petition DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
