Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, this Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1166-9\">PRADO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1166-10\">This appeal arises from the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s appeal of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order lifting an automatic stay. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order allows Appellee to pursue enforcement of a state court injunction. The injunction enforces Appellee\u2019s right to use a public road over Appellant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-17\">Appellant\u2019s arguments on appeal focus on a state-court contempt order and a state court-of-appeals sanctions order regarding a state-court judgment, but the only appealable issue before this Court is whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Appellant\u2019s appeal of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order lifting the bankruptcy stay. Appellant, however, failed to address this issue. Ordinarily when an appellant fails to address a potential error in the district court\u2019s analysis it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Appellant failed to raise the one issue appealable to this Court, Appellant waived that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-18\">To the extent Appellant complains about the state court actions, a federal court is precluded, under the <em>Rooker/Feldman </em>doctrine, from appellate review of state-court determinations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of this well-settled principle, Appellee seeks sanctions under Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-19\">Rule 38 provides for sanctions if the court of appeals determines an appeal is frivolous, so long as the party to be sanctioned receives notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>is frivolous because Appellant waived the only appealable issue and because a federal court has no jurisdiction to consider what Appellant seeks to challenge. Appellant received notice by virtue of Appellee\u2019s motion, but failed to respond despite adequate time. Appellant has \u201cunjustifiably consumed the limited resources of the judicial system and this Court,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201cneedlessly put [Appellee] to the expense of defending [his] judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For these reasons, this Court GRANTS Appellee\u2019s motion for sanctions and AWARDS double costs to Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\">The record indicates the district court properly dismissed Appellant\u2019s appeal under Bankruptcy Rule 8006 because Appellant failed to comply with the rule. Consequently, this Court AFFIRMS the district court\u2019s dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1166-12\">. <em>See Brinkmann v.
