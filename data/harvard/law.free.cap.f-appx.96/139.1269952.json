The district court sentenced Kirby to a total imprisonment term of 138 months of imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Kirby\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of whether Kirby received ineffective assistance of counsel. Kirby raises the same issue in his pro se supplemental brief. We have reviewed the record and conclude that Kirby\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be brought, if at all, in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), because the record in this appeal does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Kirby\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
