That case resulted in the dissolution of Mountain Health Care. The district court granted Oliva leave to intervene for purposes of appeal. Oliva challenges the Government\u2019s compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)-(h) (2000) (the Tunney Act), but he does not challenge the terms of the final judgment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">We conclude Oliva has not shown he has suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is both concrete and particularized, rather than an interest shared by the public at large. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Accordingly, he cannot establish that he has standing to bring this appeal. We therefore dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
