We have reviewed the record and find that this appeal is frivolous. Accordingly, we deny Harris\u2019s motions for a stay, to supplement the record with circuit court transcripts, and for a continuance, and we dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Harris v. Green, </em>No. CA-03-565-7 (WD.Va. filed Aug. 29, 2003; entered Sept. 2, 2003 &amp; Nov. 18, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
