We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Curry\u2019s pending motions to proceed in forma pauperis and to expedite and dismiss for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Curry v. Pocahontas Times, </em>CA-03-106-2 (N.D.W.Va. Dec. 12, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
