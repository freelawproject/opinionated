As the district court held, Amendment 640 to the Sentencing Guidelines is a substantive amendment, which cannot be retroactively applied absent express authorization in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a) (2002); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>No. CR-95-262 (M.D.N.C. Oct. 28, 2003). Amendment 640 is not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-26\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-18\"> Hernandez correctly argues that a certificate of appealability is not required for review of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to modify his term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2000). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
