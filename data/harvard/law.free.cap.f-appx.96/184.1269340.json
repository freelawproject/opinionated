Tatum, Jr. (\u201cTatum\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Dale N. Atkins (\u201cAtkins\u201d), the Clerk of the Civil District Court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana, in his civil action. Tatum argues that he was not properly served with Atkins\u2019 motion for summary judgment and the notice of a hearing on that motion because the motion and notice were \u201cother process\u201d that had to be served on him personally pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-20\">The relevant definition of \u201cprocess\u201d is \u201c[a] summons or writ, esp. to appear or respond in court.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 1222 (7th ed.1999). The motion and notice in this case were not process. <em>See id. </em>Rather, the motion and notice were a \u201cwritten motion\u201d and a \u201cwritten notice\u201d that were allowed to be served upon Tatum by mailing a copy to his last known address. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(a) &amp; (b)(2)(B). This appeal is frivolous and we dismiss it as such. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Tatum is WARNED that sanctions may be imposed if he files frivolous appeals in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b216-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
