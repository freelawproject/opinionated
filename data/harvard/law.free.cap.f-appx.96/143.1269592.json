Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two issues but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Evans has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-20\">Counsel first questions whether the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. \u201cThe verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>see United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (defining \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that no plain error resulted from the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (discussing standard of review); <em>United States v. Russell, </em>221 F.3d 615, 618 (4th Cir.2000) (discussing elements of offense); <em>United States v. Lamarr, </em>75 F.3d 964, 973 (4th Cir.1996) (finding that possession of 5.72 grams of crack, combined with other circumstantial evidence, was sufficient to support jury\u2019s inference of intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-21\">Counsel also questions the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Evans\u2019 motion for a downward departure. Where, as here, the district court was aware of its authority to depart and declined to do so, the court\u2019s refusal to depart is not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238-39 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-22\">Finally, Evans challenges in his pro se supplemental brief the district court\u2019s classification of him as a career offender. We have reviewed Evans\u2019 claims and find no plain error. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 731-32,113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-23\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no m\u00e9rito<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>rious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Evans\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his chent, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
