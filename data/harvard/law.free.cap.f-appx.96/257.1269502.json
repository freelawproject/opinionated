Hoang, who pleaded guilty in 1998 to the Louisiana crime of being an accessory after the fact, argues that this court should look beyond the fact of conviction and the definition of the offense to determine whether he actually committed an aggravated felony. However, this court does not allow the review of immigration proceedings to be used as a forum for collateral attacks on related convictions. <em>See Howard v. INS, </em>930 F.2d 432, 434-35 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Zinnanti v. INS, </em>651 F.2d 420, 421 (5th Cir. 1981). Because Hoang was convicted of an aggravated felony, this court lacks jurisdiction over his petition. <em>See Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 420, 433 (5th Cir.2001). The petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The Respondent has filed a motion for summary affirmance of the BIA\u2019s decision. That motion is DENIED as UNNECESSARY. Petitioner\u2019s motion to amend is DENIED as MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
