Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading. An amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision is satisfied and, <em>unthin the period provided by law for commencing the action </em>against him, the party to be brought in by amendment (1) has received such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>notice of the institution of the action that he will not be prejudiced in maintaining his defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against him.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Civ.R. 15(C) sets forth three requirements that must be met before an amendment relates back to the original pleading. First, the amended complaint must arise from the same events which support the original complaint. Second, the party \u201cbrought in\u201d by the amendment must receive, \u201cwithin the period provided by law for commencing the action,\u201d such notice of the action that the party is able to maintain a defense. Third, within the same period as provided in the second requirement, the new party must have or should have known that but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity, the action would have been brought against the new party.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">There is no question that the first requirement of Civ.R. 15(C) has been met. In their second amended complaint, appellants sought to change only the middle initial of the defendant from James C. to James L.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The controversy in this case is whether the second and third requirements of Civ.R. 15(C) were met \u201cwithin the period provided by law for commencing the action.\u201d Interpreting this language, the court of appeals held that the trial court properly determined that Donna\u2019s personal injury action was time-barred. In reaching this conclusion, the court of appeals found that Donna\u2019s cause of action was time-barred because appellee did not receive notice of the lawsuit <em>before </em>the expiration of the two-year limitations period set forth in R.C. 2305.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">We do not agree with the conclusion reached by the court of appeals. As amended, Civ.R. 3(A) provides that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court, if service is obtained within one year from such filing upon a named defendant, <em>or upon an incorrectly named defendant whose name is later corrected pursuant to Rule 15(C) </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">By its very terms, Civ.R. 3(A) provides two conditions for commencement of a civil action. The complaint must be filed and service obtained within one year from the filing. Further, Civ.R. 3(A) must be read <em>in pari materia </em>with Civ.R. 15(C). <em>Amerine v. Haughton Elevator Co. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 57, 537 N.E.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">If we were to accept the conclusion reached by the court of appeals, we would create an anomalous situation in that an accurately named defendant may be served up to one year after the limitations period has expired but a misnamed defendant must receive notice prior to the running of the limitations period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>conclusion reached by the court of appeals is a type of situation this court sought to correct when we accepted the amendment to former Civ.R. 3(A) from the Rules Advisory Committee in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The Editor\u2019s Note found in Page\u2019s Ohio Revised Code<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to amended Civ.R. 3(A), though not official, provides a useful guide in this area, specifically delineating the interplay between Civ.R. 3(A) and Civ.R. 15(C). In particular, the Editor\u2019s Note points out that \u201cif a plaintiff timely files his action within the limitations period <em>and perfects service within one year on the proper defendant, but inadvertently misspells that defendant\u2019s name in the complaint, </em>plaintiff may amend his complaint in order to set forth defendant\u2019s correct name, and that amendment, <em>pursuant to Civ.R. 15(C), </em>will relate back to the time of the commencement of the action if the statute of limitations has intervened.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">It is apparent to us that Civ.R. 3(A) read in <em>pari materia </em>with Civ.R. 15(C) does not require that service be made on a <em>misnamed </em>defendant <em>before </em>the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Rather, we find that the language, \u201cwithin the period provided by law for commencing the action,\u201d as used in Civ.R. 15(C), includes the time for service allowed by Civ.R. 3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Keeping the foregoing in mind, we believe that'the second and third requirements of Civ.R. 15(C) have been met. This case indeed warrants application of the general recommendation posited in Civ.R. 15(A) that \u201c[IJeave of court [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The record here shows that the defendant sought to be sued was given timely notice of the lawsuit. It is undisputed that James C. and appellee resided at the same address when the original complaint was served at the family residence on September 7, 1989. The lawsuit was served by certified mail, pursuant to Civ.R. 4.1(1), two days after the original complaint was timely filed. On the same date that the original complaint was served, appellee was informed by James C., appellee\u2019s father, that a lawsuit had been brought by appellants as a result of the September 5, 1987 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Notice is the essential reason for service. There is no question that under the facts and circumstances of this case, the party intended to be sued was indeed provided adequate notice of such suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">The mistake in this case is that appellants merely called the appellee by a different name, substituting the wrong middle initial. There is no confusion as to the identity of the defendant sought to be sued. Prior to the time the original complaint was filed, a letter was sent by appellants\u2019 attorney to appellee requesting that appellee, appellee\u2019s insurance carrier or appellee\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>contact him (appellants\u2019 counsel) so that the matter could be settled without the necessity of litigation. Further, the insurance carrier adjusting the claim was given notice of the suit. In addition, the original complaint, by its very terms, reveals that appellants never intended to sue James C. but, in fact, intended to sue the driver, James L. Cottrill. This is evident by the fact that the body of the original complaint referred only to the driver of the vehicle. Thus, it is clear to us \u201cfrom the original complaint who the intended defendant was, and if [appellee] did not infer this from the summons and the complaint, [he] should have done so.\u201d <em>Hardesty v. Cabotage </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 114, 117, 1 OBR 147, 149, 438 N.E.2d 431, 434. Moreover, \u201c[s]uch a result comports with the purpose of the Civil Rules. \u2018The spirit of the Civil Rules is the resolution of cases upon their merits, not upon pleading deficiencies.\u2019 <em>Peterson v. Teodosio </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 161, 175 [63 O.O.2d 262, 269, 297 N.E.2d 113, 122]. Decisions on the merits should not be avoided on the basis of mere technicalities; pleading is not \u2018 \u201ca game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome[;] * * * [rather,] the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson </em>[1957], 355 U.S. 41, 48 [78 S.Ct. 99, 103, 2 L.Ed.2d 80, 84].\u2019 <em>Foman v. Davis </em>(1962), 371 U.S. 178, 181-182 [83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222, 226].\u201d <em>Hardesty, supra, </em>1 Ohio St.3d at 117, 1 OBR at 149, 438 N.E.2d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, we find that appellants\u2019 second amended complaint related back to the date of the original complaint and that the proper defendant received timely notice of the pending action. Therefore, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed with respect to Donna\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-6\">Moyek, C.J., A.W.

Appellants\u2019 personal injury claim with respect to injuries sustained by Donna is subject to the two-year limitations period set forth in R.C. 2305.10. The loss of consortium claim is not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b532-11\">. The court of appeals even noted that its decision on this issue resulted in a \u201clegal inequity.\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\">. An official Staff Note was not released with the 1986 amendment of Civ.R. 3(A). An Editor\u2019s Note was provided by Page\u2019s Ohio Revised Code in lieu of a Staff Note.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b534-8\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AkS\">dissenting. The majority is concerned that acceptance of the court of appeals\u2019 construction would \u201ccreate an anomalous situation in that an accurately named defendant may be served up to one year after the limitations period has expired but a misnamed defendant must receive notice prior to the running of the limitations period.\u201d I share that concern. However the majority\u2019s construction merely replaces one legal inequity with another legal inequity. Under the majority\u2019s ruling a plaintiff who incorrectly names a defendant can receive more time to correct the error and serve the correct defendant than a plaintiff who initially names the correct defendant or names an unknown \u201cJohn Doe\u201d as the defendant. Under the majority\u2019s construction it could be years after the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>filing before the correct defendant is properly named. Indeed in the present case, the plaintiff did not serve the correct defendant until more than seventeen months after the initial filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">I believe there is another way to read Civ.R. 15(C) <em>in pan materia </em>with Civ.R. 3(A) without solving one legal inequity by creating another. I agree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of Civ.R. 3(A) that \u201ccommencement of a civil action\u201d means the complaint must be filed within the period of the statute of limitations and service obtained within one year of the filing. I also agree that reading Civ.R. 15(C) <em>in pari materia </em>with Civ.R. 3(A) means that the language contained in Civ.R. 15(C) \u201cwithin the period provided by law for commencing the action\u201d includes the one year for obtaining service. However, I would construe the additional language in Civ.R. 15(C) \u2014 \u201chas received such notice of the institution of the action that he will not be prejudiced in maintaining his defense on the merits\u201d \u2014 to mean that <em>within the one year after the initial filing </em>an amended pleading must be filed and served on the unnamed defendant. I recognize that a motion for leave to file an amended pleading may have to be filed with the amended pleading. The trial court may not rule on the motion until after the one year has passed. That is why I would require service of the amended pleading on the incorrectly named defendant within the one year. When the trial court rules on the motion, even if after the one-year period, the amended pleading properly can be related back to the original pleading because the incorrectly named defendant will have received notice within the one year. I realize that Civ.R. 15(C) uses the word \u201cnotice\u201d rather that \u201cservice.\u201d I think this is the proper choice of words because the use of the word \u201cnotice\u201d avoids the technical problem of whether the pleading is considered to have been actually \u201cserved\u201d until the trial court grants the motion to amend. This avoids any problem of a plaintiff being unable to obtain a ruling from the trial court on the motion for leave to amend prior to the expiration of the one-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">This construction resolves the legal inequity recognized by the trial court, the court of appeals and the majority between filings with correctly named and \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants, who may be served up to one year after the initial filing, and filings in which the proper defendant is incorrectly named. The same amount of time would be permitted to obtain service on the proper defendant: one year after filing of the original pleading. Just as with a John Doe filing, a diligent attorney should be able to discern, within one year of the filing of the complaint, whether the proper defendant has been named.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff filed the original complaint on September 5, 1989. The plaintiff had until September 5, 1990 to correctly name James L. Cottrill as the defendant, but did not serve James L. Cottrill until February 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>1991.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, I would find that the plaintiff did not timely correct the error and the amended complaint did not relate back under Civ.R. 15(C). I believe that the majority, in interpreting Civ.R. 15(C) in a way which allows the Cecils\u2019 complaint against James L. Cottrill to be timely, is reacting to a perceived injustice in this case and correcting it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the Rules of Civil Procedure should not be interpreted to deal with the \u201cbad facts\u201d of a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"ADY\">For the above reasons I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">. It appears from the record that the error may have been discovered within the one-year period. Apparently, the Cecils changed counsel three times during the pendency of this action. It is unclear whether this contributed to the delay in filing the amended complaint correctly naming James L. Cottrill as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b536-11\">. I agree it would be unfortunate if this case were terminated on a pleading error rather than on its merits. I believe there is another argument available to the Cecils and that is that James L. Cottrill waived the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense based on the discussions between the Cecils\u2019 counsel and Cottrill\u2019s insurance agent concerning the granting of an extension to file Cottrill\u2019s answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
