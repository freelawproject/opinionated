William Sweeney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8X\">In our view, the court of appeals majority did nothing more than reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact. Therefore, for the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">The version of R.C. 4123.68 in effect at the time of decedent\u2019s death provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">\u201cEvery employee who is disabled because of the contraction of an occupational disease as defined in this section, or the dependent of an employee whose death is caused by an occupational disease as defined in this section, is entitled to * * * compensation* * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-13\">\u201cThe following diseases shall be considered occupational diseases and compensable as such when contracted by an employee in the course of the employment in which such employee was engaged and due to the nature of any process described in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-14\">\u201cSCHEDULE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-15\">\u201cDescription of disease or injury and description of process:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201c(BB) All other occupational diseases: A disease peculiar to a particular industrial process, trade, or occupation and to which an employee is not ordinarily subjected or exposed outside of or away from his employment.\u201d Am.H.B. 1282, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3954, 3960.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In the syllabus of <em>State ex rel. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Krise </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 247, 71 O.O.2d 226, 327 N.E.2d 756, this court interpreted the scope of the foregoing statutory language as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201cAn occupational disease is compensable under R.C. 4123.68(BB) where the following criteria exist: (1) The disease is contracted in the course of employment; (2) the disease is peculiar to the claimant\u2019s employment by its causes and the characteristics of its manifestation or the conditions of the employment result in a hazard which distinguishes the employment in character from employment generally; and (3) the employment creates a risk of contracting the disease in a greater degree and in a different manner than in the public generally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The court of appeals held that while the first prong of the <em>Krise </em>test was satisfied, the evidence was \u201cinsufficient\u201d to satisfy the second and third prongs of <em>Krise. </em>We disagree. It appears that the appellate court majority lost sight of the requirement of R.C. 4123.95 that R.C. 4123.68 \u201cshall be liberally construed in favor of employees and the dependents of deceased employees.\u201d Instead, the court of appeals majority simply concentrated its attention on whether the evidence was sufficient to overcome a Civ.R. 50 motion for a directed verdict, and failed to even acknowledge the requirement to liberally construe all workers\u2019 compensation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">As pointed out by appellate Judge Leo Spellacy in his dissenting opinion below, appellants submitted the videotaped testimony of two physicians who opined that decedent\u2019s \u201cpulmonary embolism was peculiar to his work and that he had a greater risk of contracting it in a different manner than did the public generally.\u201d A review of appellants\u2019 expert testimony in light of the elements set forth in <em>Krise, supra, </em>reveals that sufficient evidence was presented to support the award of benefits granted to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">That appellants satisfied the first prong of <em>Krise </em>is virtually unchallenged. With respect to the second and third prongs of <em>Krise, </em>Dr. Harris testified that \u201cthe thrombosis that developed someplace in [decedent\u2019s] lower body * * * [was] due to the sedentary nature of his activity for the previous six or eight hours, however long he was on the shift, prior to coming home,\u201d and that \u201cthere was a direct relationship between his duties on that shift and the development of the thrombosis of the lower extremities or the pelvis and the hemorrhagic infarct that was found at postmortem examination, and that was agreed upon as the cause of his death.\u201d Dr. Harris further testified that the basis of his opinion was his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u201cknowledge in the field of cardiovascular disease that [decedent] was exposed to a significant risk factor prior to his death, risk factor in the development of thrombophlebitis, and that there was no other risk factor that was presented to me that could have caused [the condition of decedent] found at postmortem.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Harris responded in the affirmative to the question whether decedent was more likely to develop thrombosis and the resultant pulmonary embolism than the public in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Dr. Levine also testified that it was his opinion that decedent \u201cdefinitely had a greater risk and likelihood of developing a \u2014 a blood clot in his legs and a pulmonary embolism than the general public and general occupation.\u201d Dr. Levine stated that the basis of his opinion was that \u201cthe work which Mr. France did required periods of immobility and lack of activity causing stagnation of blood in his \u2014 the veins of his leg, which by mechanism, which I previously described, led to formation of blood clots and pulmonary embolism.\u201d In addition, Dr. Levine testified that the blood clots and pulmonary embolism which caused decedent\u2019s death \u201cwere definitely work-related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We believe that the foregoing testimony was sufficient to satisfy R.C. 4123.-68(BB) as explained in the syllabus of <em>Krise. </em>In addition, the evidence proffered by appellants was substantial, competent evidence on which reasonable minds could differ. Therefore, the trial court correctly denied the city\u2019s motions for a directed verdict. See, <em>e.g., Ramage v. Cent. Ohio Emergency Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 97, 109, 592 N.E.2d 828, 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Here, the court of appeals majority simply substituted its judgment for that of the jury. While it is true that in the abstract, reasonable minds could reach different conclusions concerning whether decedent suffered an occupational disease that caused his death, it is also true that every tribunal reviewing this particular cause, save the court of appeals majority, concluded that decedent\u2019s death was due to a compensable occupational disease, and that, therefore, appellants were entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. In light of <em>Krise, </em>R.C. 4123.68(BB) and the liberal-construction directive of R.C. 4123.95, we hold that the evidence in the record is sufficient to support the award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is hereby reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-11\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
