In his first argument, plaintiff contends that an evidentiary conflict exists between defendant\u2019s deposition testimony and her affidavit in support of her summary judgment motion, which raises a genuine issue of material fact and thereby precludes summary judgment in her favor. Plaintiff next argues that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that no such evidentiary conflict exists, summary judgment for defendant was still improper because (1) plaintiff was competent to testify as to whether it was necessary for defendant to brake in order to avoid colliding with the car traveling ahead of their car, and (2) through his affidavit and deposition testimony, plaintiff met his burden of setting forth evidence of his mother\u2019s negligence sufficient to withstand her motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">Movant\u2019s Evidentiary Conflicts</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriately rendered when \u201c(1) [n]o genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274. Accord <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Because summary judgment represents a shortcut through the normal litigation process by avoiding a trial, \u201cthe burden of establishing that the <em>material </em>facts are not in dispute and that no <em>genuine </em>issue of fact exists is on the party moving for the summary judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 120, 570 N.E.2d 1108, 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Determination of the materiality of facts is discussed in <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202. \u201cAs to materiality, the substantive law will identify which facts are material. Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d at 211. See, also, <em>Perez v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 215, 218-219, 520 N.E.2d 198, 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>whether defendant\u2019s car would have struck the car ahead of her had she not braked may affect the outcome of her son\u2019s lawsuit against her. For instance, if defendant had no other choice but to brake in order to avoid a collision, her conduct will be deemed reasonable. If defendant could have continued in her lane of traffic without striking that car, a jury may find that she was negligent in suddenly applying her brakes. Quite obviously, resolution of this factual dispute determines the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Having found that a material question of fact exists, we next consider, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), whether there is a genuine issue. Whether a genuine issue exists is answered by the following inquiry: Does the evidence present \u201ca sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury\u201d or is it \u201cso one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law[?]\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, supra, </em>477 U.S. at 251-252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Plaintiffs first argument is based on an alleged evidentiary conflict between his mother\u2019s affidavit and her deposition testimony on a factual issue: whether her car would have struck the car traveling ahead of her had she not pressed the brakes. In seeking summary judgment, defendant submitted an affidavit containing the following statement: \u201cIn view of the emergency created by the car in front of me when it lost control, I felt that I had to apply my brakes to avoid a collision.\u201d Defendant, however, had been less certain that she needed to brake when she was deposed on that factual issue three weeks earlier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201cQ. * * * My question has been, if you didn\u2019t hit the brakes, would you have hit his car. And your answers have been I don\u2019t know; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u201cA. Well, I really don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">\u201cQ. Okay. So you don\u2019t know. So, if someone were to say yes, you would not have hit that car, you wouldn\u2019t know otherwise, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">\u201cA. <em>Well, I feel there was a possibility I could have hit it and a possibility I could have missed it. </em>How\u2019s that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201cQ. You mean if you hadn\u2019t braked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\u201cA. If I hadn\u2019t \u2014 tell me again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">\u201cQ. Sure, absolutely. See, what this is trying to do is figure out since you\u2019re there\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">\u201cA. See, I really don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know. Even I don\u2019t think you could answer that question saying that if you would have hit that car or you wouldn\u2019t have hit that car. I mean, I did what I felt was right, I braked.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">In deciding whether an evidentiary conflict exists so as to preclude summary judgment, a trial court must adhere to Civ.R. 56(C) and view the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Kunkler v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 135, 138, 522 N.E.2d 477, 480. Even the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in the affidavits and depositions must be construed in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor. <em>Hounshell v. Am. States Ins. Co. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 427, 433, 21 O.O.3d 267, 271, 424 N.E.2d 311, 315. Bearing this in mind, we must construe defendant\u2019s equivocal responses made in her deposition testimony to mean that she does not know whether braking was necessary to keep from hitting the car that spun out of control ahead of her. Therefore, even though defendant\u2019s affidavit does not <em>explicitly </em>contradict her earlier statements made while being deposed, we nonetheless find an evidentiary conflict concerning the necessity of braking.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">It appears that the court of appeals determined the credibility of the evidence, contrary to the purpose of Civ.R. 56(C). Credibility issues typically arise in summary judgment proceedings when one litigant\u2019s statement conflicts with another litigant\u2019s statement over a fact to be proved. Since resolution of the factual dispute will depend, at least in part, upon the credibility of the parties or their witnesses, summary judgment in such a case is inappropriate. However, as demonstrated by the case <em>sub judice, </em>credibility questions also arise when an unambiguous statement contained in the affidavit of the party moving for summary judgment is controverted by that party\u2019s earlier deposition testimony. Such a discrepancy over a material fact can be resolved only by the trier of fact and, on this basis, the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we hold that when a litigant\u2019s affidavit in support of his or her motion for summary judgment is inconsistent with his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>earlier deposition testimony, summary judgment in that party\u2019s favor is improper because there exists a question of credibility which can be resolved only by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Competency</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The second question presented for our determination is whether the court of appeals erred when it affirmed the trial court\u2019s action that disregarded Ricky\u2019s affidavit and his deposition testimony where he gave his opinion that his mother did not have to brake in order to avoid colliding with the car in front of her. The trial court had before it plaintiffs affidavit and his deposition testimony. Both contain statements that refute defendant\u2019s argument that she acted reasonably in braking her car because it was necessary to do so in order to avoid hitting the car ahead of her car. Plaintiff opined differently. In his affidavit, plaintiff stated, \u201cMy mother did <em>not </em>have to brake in order to avoid hitting the car which was in front of hers at around the State Route 611 exit from Interstate 90 and which, all of a sudden, slid to the left out of her car\u2019s lane of travel and quickly into the median.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>This statement is consistent with plaintiffs prior deposition testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">\u201cQ. * * * How do you feel that your mother was negligent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">\u201cA. She didn\u2019t have to stop when the car in front of us kept going. She could have kept on going and she did stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">\u201cQ. You\u2019re saying she was negligent because she stopped in that lane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">\u201cA. She didn\u2019t have to stop. I think that she could have kept going.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">The court of appeals held that plaintiff failed to show that he was competent to testify on this matter, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(E).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court stated three factors that negatively affected Ricky\u2019s competency to testify as to his mother\u2019s negligence: (1) he is visually impaired because he suffers from glaucoma, (2) he admitted that his vision was further impaired on the night of the accident due to the snowy weather conditions, and (3) he does not have a driver\u2019s license, nor has he ever driven a car. The court of appeals erred in holding that this evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>was excludable on the basis of plaintiffs incompetency under Civ.R. 56(E). Since this evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was improperly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">It is significant that the trial court never found that plaintiff was incompetent to testify to the matters stated in his affidavit and deposition testimony. The trial court summarily ruled against Ricky on the motions for summary judgment and dismissed his lawsuit without holding a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Proper judicial procedure requires the trial judge to conduct a voir dire examination prior to determining a witness\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The Civ.R. 56(E) requirement that all affidavits \u201cshow affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify\u201d is consistent with the general rule of competency contained in Evid.R. 601. Evid.R. 601 provides that \u201c[ejvery person is competent to be a witness\u201d and then states exceptions. The rule favors competency, conferring it even on those who do not benefit from the presumption, such as children under ten, if they are shown to be capable of receiving \u201cjust impressions of the facts and transactions respecting which they are examined\u201d and capable of \u201crelating them truly.\u201d Evid.R. 601(A). (See <em>State v. Frazier </em>[1991], 61 Ohio St.3d 247, 574 N.E.2d 483, at syllabus, for factors to be taken into consideration by the trial court in determining whether a child under age of ten is competent to testify; <em>State v. Wilson </em>[1952], 156 Ohio St. 525, 529-530, 46 O.O. 437, 439, 103 N.E.2d 552, 555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">In cases where the witness is under the age of ten or is of unsound mind, the presumption is of incompetency and the burden of proving competency is on the party offering the testimony of that witness. Visual impairment or blindness is not a basis designated by Evid.R. 601 for the exclusion of a witness\u2019s testimony and cannot support a trial court\u2019s decision not to consider a party\u2019s affidavit or other evidentiary material offered against an opponent\u2019s motion for summary judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">All of the factors cited by the court of appeals in affirming the trial court relate to the credibility of the statements made by Ricky, not his competency to testify. We have held that an affidavit containing opinion testimony by a lay witness offered in support of a motion for summary judgment may be considered by a trial court or a reviewing court when it meets the requirements set forth in Civ.R. 56(E) and Evid.R. 701. <em>Tomlinson v. Cincinnati </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 66, 4 OBR 155, 446 N.E.2d 454, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Evid.R. 701 provides the standards for admissibility of the opinion testimony of a lay witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">\u201cIf the witness is not testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Plaintiffs statements made in his affidavit and deposition testimony are helpful to the determination of the disputed material facts. Despite his sight impairment and lack of driving experience, his opinion is relevant as a witness to the collision. His opinion should have been sufficient to avoid summary judgment against him. Whether his lay witness opinion is accurate and worthy of belief is not a test of admissibility under Evid.R. 601 or 701. Instead, it is for the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-7\">A.W.
