When is it permissible to combine or stack uninsured/underinsured motorist policies? To what extent do underinsurance policies provide coverage to their own named insureds facing inadequate compensation from a tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer?</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Mary Savoie, administrator, contends that the decedents\u2019 parents and sister are each entitled to recover up to $100,000 under the tortfeasor\u2019s \u201cper person\u201d limitations in his liability policy and are collectively subject to the $300,000 per occurrence limit. Grange argues that the multiple claimants must be merged under the wrongful death statute into a single cause of action brought by the administrator and are, therefore, confined to a single combined \u201cper person\u201d recovery limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">In a refreshing moment of candor, Motorists\u2019 attorney in oral argument urged this court to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">\u201c * * * use the statute in a wrongful death [claim] to get to a position where all the insurance companies know that when there is a death claim, no matter what the policy says, we have in fact a full policy exposed. That would reduce so much litigation. It would reduce so much complexity. It would allow us in the insurance industry to at least focus on what the claim is and then we would know. That\u2019s the posture that Motorists Mutual would like to present to the court in this case, and if the court takes that posture, then, certainly Grange Mutual owes $225,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">The liability policy issued by Grange provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-12\">\u201cThe limit of liability shown in the Declarations for \u2018each person\u2019 for Bodily Injury Liability is our maximum limit of liability for all damages, including damages for care, loss of services or death, arising out of bodily injury sustained by any one person in any one auto accident. Subject to this limit for \u2018each person\u2019, the limit of liability shown in the Declarations for \u2018each accident\u2019 for Bodily Injury Liability is our maximum limit of liability for all damages for bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>injury resulting from any one accident. * * * This is the most we will pay regardless of the number of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201c1. Insureds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201c2. Claims made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201c3. Vehicles or premiums shown in the Declarations; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201c4. Vehicles involved in the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">In an attempt to narrowly interpret its own insurance policy provision, Grange ignores the elevated status of wrongful death claims in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">To manage the presentment of wrongful death claims the General Assembly enacted R.C. 2125.02, which charges the estate\u2019s administrator with the responsibility of consolidating the wrongful death damages of all claimants into one action. The statute also provides that \u201cthe surviving spouse, the children, and the parents of the decedent\u201d all \u201care rebuttably presumed to have suffered damages\u201d resulting from wrongful death. R.C. 2125.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Previously, in <em>Wood v. Shepard </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 86, 526 N.E.2d 1089, this court held that an underinsured motorist policy could not consolidate all the wrongful death claims of those presumed to have suffered damages under R.C. 2125.02 and subject them to a single per person limit in that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">The General Assembly and this court have expressed the view that damages for wrongful death claims should not be limited. Even the Ohio Constitution in its Bill of Rights provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-13\">\u201cThe amount of damages recoverable by civil action in the courts for death caused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of another, shall not be limited by law.\u201d Section 19a, Article I, Constitution of Ohio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">Consistent with this view, each person who is presumed to have been damaged as a result of a wrongful death, to the extent of his or her damages, may collect from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy up to its per person limits subject to any per accident limit. Liability policy provisions which purport to consolidate wrongful death damages suffered by individuals are unenforceable because they directly violate the policy expressed by the General Assembly and this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">Because this court in <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Rose </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 528, 575 N.E.2d 459, and in paragraphs one and two of the syllabus of <em>Burris v. Grange Mut. Cos. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 84, 545 N.E.2d 83, has misinterpreted the legislative status of wrongful death claims in Ohio, these cases are overruled accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-16\">By applying our analysis to the facts in the case before us, we find the mother, father and the sister of the decedent are individually entitled to recover, to the extent they prove damages, a maximum of $100,000 each up to $225,000, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the balance of the Grange liability policy limits available to the Savoie claimants. On this issue, the holding of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The Savoies ask this court to declare that antistacking clauses contained in two separate uninsured/underinsurance policies are both unenforceable. Motorists, the insurer under both of these policies, urges that the clauses be enforced. The antistacking provisions in both policies are identical. They provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201cOTHER INSURANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201cIf there is other applicable similar insurance available under more than one policy or provision of coverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u25a0 \u201c1. Any recovery for damages for bodily injury sustained by an insured may equal but not exceed the higher of the applicable limit for any one vehicle under this insurance or any other insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">\u201c2. Any insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any other collectible insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">\u201c3. We will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">The Motorists policy also attempts to prohibit the stacking of multiple uninsured/underinsured policy limits which have been purchased by the same family:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">\u201cTwo or More Auto Policies</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-14\">\u201cIf this policy and any other auto insurance policy issued to you by us apply to the same accident, the maximum limit of our liability under all the policies shall not exceed the highest applicable limit of liability under any one policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">This antistacking language in the policies passes the \u201cunambiguous,\u201d \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cconspicuous\u201d test as delineated in <em>Dues v. Hodge </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 46, 521 N.E.2d 789, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">However, we no longer support the analysis of antistacking language used in <em>Dues v. Hodge. </em>Our discomfort is rooted in a concern that liability insurers are collecting multiple premiums for multiple policies, while limiting recovery by antistacking language \u2014 the import of which is not known or understood by the insured consumer until tragedy strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-17\"><em>Dues v. Hodge </em>and its progeny broadly contravened the line of cases which was developing prior to the enactment of R.C. 3937.18(E), now 3937.18(G), in 1980. In <em>Curran v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 33, 54 O.O.2d 166, 266 N.E.2d 566, this court in a unanimous decision announced that antistacking provisions were \u201crepugnant\u201d to the purpose of the uninsured/underinsured motorist statute when they are used by an insurer to deny coverage to an insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>because other uninsured coverage is available to the insured under a different policy from a different insurer. In <em>Grange Mut Cas. Co. v. Volkmann </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 58, 8 O.O.3d 70, 374 N.E.2d 1258, this court again unanimously held antistacking provisions in an uninsured policy to be unenforceable when separate coverages were available from separate policies covering different vehicles. Time after time, this court held antistacking provisions to be in contravention of R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The General Assembly responded to this developed line of cases by adding the following provision to the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">\u201cAny automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance that includes uninsured motorist coverage may include terms and conditions that preclude stacking of uninsured motor vehicle coverages.\u201d 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1458, 1459.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">This court, in <em>Karabin v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 163, 10 OBR 497, 462 N.E.2d 403, held that this amendment was \u201cunambiguous,\u201d and expressed the will of the General Assembly to permit insurers to preclude stacking in all circumstances. In later cases the court held that R.C. 3937.18(G) gives insurance companies a license to contractually preclude the stacking of separate uninsured/underinsured coverages, irrespective of the number of policies involved, the number of premiums paid, or the number of vehicles covered, provided that the antistacking language is \u201cunambiguous,\u201d \u201cclear,\u201d and \u201cconspicuous.\u201d <em>Dues v. Hodge, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The current version of the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">\u201c(G) Any automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance that includes coverages offered under division (A) of this' section [uninsured and underinsured coverages] may include terms and conditions that preclude stacking of such coverages.\u201d 139 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2936, 2938.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">The present statute permits insurance companies to contractually preclude the stacking of coverages in \u201cany * * * liability policy.\u201d We find this provision to be ambiguous. It is unclear whether R.C. 3937.18(G) is intended to allow the contractual preclusion of intra-family stacking, inter-family stacking, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">\u201cIntrafamily\u201d stacking occurs when an individual or an entire family is insured by several separate uninsured/underinsured policies insuring different vehicles. When the individual or a family member is injured by an uninsured or underinsured motorist, he or she will try to combine, or stack, each of the policies\u2019 underinsurance limits to compensate the injured individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">\u201cInterfamily\u201d stacking occurs when an individual has paid a premium for an uninsured/underinsured motorist policy and is riding in an automobile, which is owned by someone other than a family member living in the same household and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>is insured by a separate uninsured/underinsured motorist policy. When the individual is injured by an uninsured or underinsured motorist while riding in this automobile, he will seek to recover compensation from the policy insuring the automobile in which he was riding and his own uninsured/underinsured motorist policy for which he has paid a premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In light of the disfavor which antistacking provisions have received by this court in cases such as <em>Curran, supra, </em>and <em>Volkmann, supra, </em>we conclude that R.C. 3937.18(G) should be narrowly construed. Insurers may contractually preclude intrafamily stacking \u2014 the stacking of uninsured/underinsured limits of policies and coverages purchased by family members in the same household. Insurers may not contractually preclude interfamily stacking \u2014 the aggregation of uninsured/underinsured limits of policies purchased by two or more people who are not members of the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In intrafamily stacking situations, insurers can provide reduced premiums for clients who purchase multiple uninsured/underinsured policies for separate vehicles. If the premium has been reduced, it logically follows that benefits can be restricted. However, the injured individual in an interfamily stacking scenario seeks to combine the limits of two policies for which premiums have not been reduced because of their mutual existence. Because insurers are attempting to prevent the full payment of two policy limits resulting from the full, unadjusted premium payment of two unrelated insurance policies, the contractual preclusion of interfamily stacking is unconscionable. We do not believe that the legislature intended to sanction such a practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">With this reading of R.C. 3937.18\u2019s scope, the cases decided prior to the 1980 enactment of division (E) breathe renewed life to the extent they apply to interfamily stacking. Because <em>Hower v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 442, 605 N.E.2d 15, involves interfamily stacking, it is overruled. The case of <em>Karabin, supra, </em>and paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Dues v. Hodge, supra, </em>are limited to apply to intrafamily stacking only.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">This interpretation of R.C. 3937.18(G) is consistent with the concerted effort of the General Assembly to force all motorists to maintain liability insurance coverage on motor vehicles being operated within the state of Ohio. The Financial Responsibility Act requires that all motorists have the \u201cability to respond in damages for liability,\u201d and provides severe penalties for failure to comply. R.C. 4509.01(K).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Regrettably, the General Assembly has not succeeded in its effort to force every motorist to maintain liability insurance coverage. While it is impossible to accurately measure the number, the best insurance industry estimate would indicate that fifteen to twenty-five percent of Ohio motorists are driving without any liability insurance coverage. New York Times, September 3, 1990, A-10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The purchase of full uninsured/underinsured coverage is the only possible means for responsible motorists to protect themselves and their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">By applying the above holding to the facts in this case, we conclude that Mary and Donald, because they are members of the same household, may not stack the limits of their two uninsured/underinsured policies with Motorists. Because Debbie Savoie is only an insured in one of these policies, she does not qualify to stack the limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The holding of the court of appeals on the issue of stacking is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Finally, this court considers how the money paid by the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer affects the Savoies\u2019 ability to collect from their underinsurance carrier. In Part I of this opinion, we held that the Savoies were entitled to collect up to $225,000 from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carrier, Grange.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The Savoies are insureds in two uninsured/underinsurance policies with Motorists, each having limits of $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident limits. As a result of their wrongful death claims, the Savoies seek to recover from these policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Motorists argues that it is not liable to the Savoies at all because the $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence limits of its underinsurance policy are identical to the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy, and hence the tortfeasor was not underinsured. <em>Hill v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 243, 553 N.E.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">In order to arrive at the proper conclusion in this case, it is critical to review the purpose of R.C. 3937.18, which explains how monies received from a tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer reduce, or do not reduce, the limits of an underinsurance policy. An individual covered by an underinsurance policy is entitled to receive compensation in an amount no less than what he would receive if he had been injured by an uninsured motorist. <em>James v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 386, 18 OBR 440, 481 N.E.2d 272. Thus, underinsured motorists who suffer from injuries caused by an automobile accident are entitled to collect up to the full limits of their underinsurance policy to the extent that their damages exceed the amounts which the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer has already paid to them. The Savoies may collect up to the limits of their policy with Motorists to the extent that their damages exceed the $225,000 which they are entitled to receive from Grange.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">In <em>Hill v. Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>a majority of this court held without elaboration that an underinsurance carrier avoids responsibility to its insureds when the limits of its policy are identical to the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>policy. This decision incorrectly construes R.C. 3937.18, and is now expressly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In Part I of this opinion, we concluded that the claim of each of the Savoies is a separate claim and is entitled to its own per person policy limit under the terms of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy. We have not addressed whether each of the Savoies, who are also insureds in an underinsured policy, is entitled to a separate per person limit or whether all claims must be consolidated into one per person policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">This court\u2019s holding in <em>Wood v. Shepard, supra, </em>is completely dispositive of this issue. According to <em>Wood, </em>each insured, who under an underinsured motorist policy has the right to have a wrongful death action brought in his or her name pursuant to R.C. 2125.01, has a separate wrongful death claim subject to a separate per person policy limit. See, also, <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Andrews </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 362, 604 N.E.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Despite previous attempts by this court to restrict the application of <em>Wood, </em>we hold today that it remains good law in Ohio. Each person who is covered by an uninsured/underinsured policy and who is presumed to be damaged pursuant to R.C. 2125.01 has a separate claim subject to a separate per person policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Two cases, <em>Burris v. Grange Mut. Cos., supra, </em>and <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Rose, supra, </em>narrow the holding in <em>Wood. </em>To the extent they do so, they are overruled. Paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>Dues v. Hodge, supra, </em>is limited to apply only to cases involving a single bodily injury which has not resulted in wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">By applying the holding in <em>Wood v. Shepard, supra, </em>to the facts in this case, we conclude that Mary, Donald, and Debbie Savoie are each entitled to recover up to the $100,000 \u201cper person\u201d policy limits in the Motorists underinsurance policy, to the extent that each family member\u2019s damages exceed the payments which each has received from Grange; however, in no event should Motorists be obligated to pay more than a total of $300,000. The holding of the court of appeals addressing the extent that underinsured motorist coverage is set off by the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b671-11\"><em>AM. </em>Sweeney, Douglas, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b671-12\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b671-13\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABS\">concurring. For far too long now various majorities of this court have been attempting, in interpreting liability, uninsured and underinsured automobile insurance policies, to place square legal pegs in round legal holes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Because of this, the law in this area has become increasingly confused. Today, despite caustic dissents, Justice Pfeifer has attempted to bring some semblance of order to what most reasonable persons with knowledge and interest in the field concede is an area of the law that badly needs clarification. Justice Pfeifer inherited this problem \u2014 he was not a part of creating the admitted confusion. While not all of us in the majority agree with every detail in Justice Pfeifer\u2019s opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his valiant effort will be of immeasurable help.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">It is important to now recognize that this court has been attempting to apply the same law to differing fact patterns and that the approach has not, cannot and will not work. We should recognize, and Justice Pfeifer\u2019s opinion does so, that <em>un </em>insured-motorist cases are different from <em>under </em>insured-motorist cases; that multiple-claimant cases are different from single-claimant cases; that cases involving wrongful death are different from those where death is not involved; and that cases where there is a tortfeasor liability policy are different from those where there is no liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Thus, we have cases (1) where the tortfeasor is insured and there is only one injured claimant; (2) where the tortfeasor is insured and there is more than one injured claimant; (3) where the tortfeasor is insured and there is a single wrongful death; (4) where the tortfeasor is insured and there are injured claimants <em>and </em>a wrongful death claimant or claimants; (5) where a tortfeasor is uninsured and there are single or multiple injured claimants and single or multiple wrongful death claimants and any or all of such claimants have <em>un </em>insured-motorist coverage and <em>under </em>insured-motorist coverage. While this list is not exhaustive, it makes the point that given different fact patterns, the law, as applied to cases with differing facts, will also be different when <em>all </em>of the language \u00f3f R.C. 3937.18 is considered and when R.C. -2125.01 and 2125.02 are factored into the equation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">While there are many examples of how this court, in this field, has taken the law applying to one fact pattern and forced that law onto another differing fact pattern in order to reach a desired result, one such example will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\"><em>Wood v. Shepard </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 86, 526 N.E.2d 1089, was a case where (1) the tortfeasor was insured; (2) one victim was killed; (3) three victims were injured; and (4) the killed and injured parties had an <em>under </em>insured-automobile insurance policy which was the <em>subject of </em>the action. <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Rose </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 528, 575 N.E.2d 459, involved (1) an insured tortfeasor with a liability policy; and (2) one victim of wrongful death. The issue involved the extent of the coverage available under the <em>tortfeasor\u2019s liability </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>policy \u2014 and had nothing to do with <em>under </em>insured-motorist coverage, the question presented by <em>Wood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Notwithstanding this, the majority in <em>Rose, </em>in its zeal to weaken, in some way, the holding in <em>Wood, </em>said, at 532, 575 N.E.2d at 462, that \u201c * * * we further limit the holding in <em>Wood v. Shepard, supra, </em>and find it applicable only to those instances where the policy limitations in uninsured or underinsured motorist provisions do not track the corresponding limitation on liability coverage, and are ambiguous on their face\u201d \u2014 whatever that means. The majority clearly took apples and compared them with oranges, thereby bringing about the exact result predicted by Justice Asher Sweeney in his dissenting opinion in <em>Rose, </em>wherein he said that \u201c[b]y further \u2018limiting\u2019 the well-reasoned decision in <em>Wood v. Shepard </em>* * *, the members of the present majority create more uncertainty in this area of law at the expense of the policyholders who will receive less than Ohio law entitles them to in their policies of automobile insurance.\u201d <em>Rose, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 533, 575 N.E.2d at 462-463 (A.W. Sweeney, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">At the very least, the majority opinion is returning us to square one, whence we can move step-by-step in a logical, properly reasoned and statutorily based manner. Justice Pfeifer\u2019s contribution to this salutary goal should be applauded \u2014 not maligned.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b673-7\">F.E.

I respectfully dissent from Part II of the majority\u2019s opinion because I believe it contradicts the clear intent of the General Assembly and overrules recent, well-reasoned decisions of this court recognizing that intent. In cases preceding 1980, this court held that provisions barring the stacking of uninsured and underinsured coverages violated public policy and were thus unenforceable. <em>Grange Mut Cas. Co. v. Volkmann </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 58, 8 O.O.3d 70, 374 N.E.2d 1258; <em>Curran v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 33, 54 O.O.2d 166, 266 N.E.2d 566. In 1980, the General Assembly enacted what is now R.C. 3937.18(G), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">\u201cAny automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance * * * may include terms and conditions that preclude stacking of [uninsured and underinsured] coverages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">This court correctly and unanimously interpreted this statute as a legislative countermand of <em>Volkmann </em>and <em>Curran. Karahin v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 163, 10 OBR 497, 462 N.E.2d 403. In <em>Karahin, Dues v. Hodge </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 46, 521 N.E.2d 789, and most recently in <em>Hower v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 442, 605 N.E.2d 15, we held that such clauses were enforceable when clear, conspicuous, and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Now, a majority of this court holds that such clauses are unenforceable to preclude \u201cinterfamily\u201d stacking of coverages in separate policies. The action of the majority defies not only logic and sound jurisprudence but also, more importantly, the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The majority no longer supports the reasoning of <em>Dues </em>because it is concerned that insurers are taking advantage of insureds who purchase insurance policies without knowing the import of the antistacking language they contain. Yet, the very purpose of the standard we enunciated in paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Dues, </em>that these provisions must be \u201cunambiguous,\u201d \u201cclear,\u201d and \u201cconspicuous,\u201d was to ensure that those who purchased policies did understand the import of the antistacking language. The majority even admits that the language in the Motorists policies satisfies the <em>Dues </em>test. Although the majority properly holds that appellant may not stack coverages in this case, it does not adequately explain why <em>Dues </em>does not protect all insureds. Even in an interfamily situation, the policy language cannot simultaneously be clear, unambiguous, and conspicuous on one hand, but on the other be so confusing that insureds do not understand its import.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The majority further asserts that <em>Dues </em>\u201cbroadly contravened the line of cases which was developing prior to the enactment of R.C. 3937.18(E), now 3937.18(G), in 1980.\u201d This is simply not so. Rather, the General Assembly in enacting R.C. 3937.18(E) countermanded those cases. <em>Karabin </em>and <em>Dues </em>merely recognized that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The distinction is pivotal. When the General Assembly enacts a valid, constitutional law that reverses or alters law that this court has announced, this court is bound to follow that law. To do otherwise violates the fundamental principle of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The majority admits that the enactment of R.C. 3937.18(G) was a \u201cresponse\u201d to our pre-1980 cases holding antistacking provisions unenforceable. It further admits that this court, in <em>Karabin, supra, </em>a unanimous decision, recognized this statute to be a declaration permitting antistacking provisions. The majority then concludes, however, that R.C. 3937.18(G) is somehow ambiguous and in need of judicial construction. Specifically, the majority contends that the words \u201cany * * * liability policy\u201d are \u201cunclear\u201d and \u201cnot clarified anywhere in the statute.\u201d What is there to clarify? The word \u201cany\u201d is defined as: \u201cconcerning a being or thing of the sort named, without limitation as to which, and thus constructively of <em>every </em>one of them, since every one may in turn be taken as a representative * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 Oxford English Dictionary (2 Ed.1989) 539. Nevertheless, the majority finds \u201cany * * * liability policy\u201d to be ambiguous and uses this perceived ambiguity to conclude that the phrase refers, not to any liability policy without restriction, but only to those liability policies held within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>single family. In creating this distinction, the majority\u2019s muse outshines even that of appellant\u2019s counsel, who never argued or briefed it <em>at any stage in this </em>;proceeding. Furthermore, we rejected a similar distinction, between interpolicy and intrapolicy stacking, in <em>Karabin. </em>There is likewise scant justification for the majority\u2019s distinction between interfamily and intrafamily stacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">By its tortured reading of R.C. 3937.18(G) and its resurrection of reasoning similar to that rejected in <em>Karabin, </em>the majority \u201cbreathe[s] renewed life\u201d into the pre-1980 cases that held antistacking clauses unenforceable. In resuscitating these cases, however, the majority reads the statute partially out of existence. R.C. 3937.18(G) traveled through two committees, the House of Representatives, the Senate, and across the Governor\u2019s desk before it became law. It should take more than a simple majority of the members of this court to unmake it.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In addition to the disrespect that the majority shows for <em>stare decisis, </em>its rulings violate an even more fundamental tenet of our system of government\u2014 that of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The framers of the federal Constitution well understood the importance of the separation of powers. The issue was a central concern in the constitutional debates, and received significant attention in The Federalist Papers. James Madison, according to one commentator, advocated the independence of each branch of government as a counterpoise against any one branch imposing its will on that of the others. White, Philosophy, The Federalist, and the Constitution (1987) 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Madison\u2019s own words confirm this view: \u201cThe accumulation of all powers legislative, executive, and judiciary in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\u201d The Federalist (1788), No. 47. And further, \u201c[i]n framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.\u201d The Federalist (1788), No. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Maintaining separation of powers concerned Alexander Hamilton as well. He wrote in The Federalist (1787), No. 9, \u201c[t]he regular distribution of power into distinct departments; the introduction of legislative balances and checks * * * are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided.\u201d In The Federalist (1788), No. 71, Hamilton wrote, \u201c[t]he same rule, which teaches the propriety of a partition between the various branches of power, teaches us likewise that this partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent of the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The Supreme Court of the United States has emphasized the necessity of maintaining separation of powers. It has stated that it is \u201cessential to the successful working of this system\u201d to prevent the encroachment of one branch upon the powers of another. <em>Kilboum v. Thompson </em>(1881), 103 U.S. 168, 191, 26 L.Ed. 377, 387. In <em>Myers v. United States </em>(1926), 272 U.S. 52, 47 S.Ct. 21, 71 L.Ed. 160, Justice Brand\u00e9is, in dissent, wrote that although friction between the branches of government is inevitable, this friction has the salutary effect of precluding any one branch from exercising arbitrary power over any other. <em>Id. </em>at 293, 47 S.Ct. at 85, 71 L.Ed. at 242-243 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). And Justice Sutherland stated the following in <em>Humphrey\u2019s Exr. v. United States </em>(1935), 295 U.S. 602, 629-630, 55 S.Ct. 869, 874, 79 L.Ed. 1611, 1620: \u201cThe fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others * * * is hardly open to serious question. So much is implied in the very fact of' the separation of the powers of these departments by the Constitution; and in the rule which recognizes their essential co-equality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that although Ohio has no specific constitutional provision embodying the concept of separation of powers, the doctrine is implicit in the entire framework of the Constitution. <em>S. Euclid v. Jemison </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 157, 28 OBR 250, 503 N.E.2d 136. This court has long recognized the importance of the principle of separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government. In 1919, this court stated, \u201c[pjrobably our chief contribution to the science of government is the principle of the complete separation of the three departments of government, executive, legislative and judicial. No feature of the American system has excited greater admiration.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Greenlund v. Fulton </em>(1919), 99 Ohio St. 168, 187, 124 N.E. 172, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">This court has considered the argument that the common law could limit or supersede validly enacted statutes. In <em>Leis v. Cleveland Ry. Co. </em>(1920), 101 Ohio St. 162, 128 N.E. 73, a party asserted that two city ordinances were invalid because they created a degree of care greater than that which existed at common law. This court rejected the argument, reasoning that \u201cthere is no guaranteed right in the rules of the common law as guides of conduct and they may be added to or repealed by legislative authority * * *. \u2018The law itself, as a rule of conduct, may be changed at the will * * * of the legislature, unless prevented by constitutional limitations. Indeed, the great office of statutes is to remedy defects in the common law as they are developed, and to adapt it to the changes of time and circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 128 N.E. at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">This court has also considered, and consistently rejected, the argument that a particular Act of the General Assembly should not be enforced because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>unwise or unreasonable. In <em>Pohl v. State </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 474, 475, 132 N.E. 20, 21, reversed on other grounds (1923), 262 U.S. 404, 43 S.Ct. 628, 67 L.Ed. 1047, for example, a party challenged a statute that prohibited certain types of instruction in public and parochial schools. This court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201cCourts do not sit to review the wisdom of legislative acts, nor do they possess such power. On the contrary, the policy, the advisability, and the wisdom of all legislation, subject to the veto of the governor and the referendum of the people, are subjects for legislative determination exclusively. The inexpediency, injustice or impropriety of a legislative act is not a ground upon which the court may declare the act void. The remedy for such evils must be sought by an appeal to the justice and patriotism of the legislature itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The legislature is the primary judge of the needs of public welfare, and this court will not nullify the decision of the legislature except in the case of a clear violation of a state or federal constitutional provision. <em>Williams v. Scudder </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 305, 131 N.E. 481, paragraphs three and four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">For its own part, this court has been fervent in protecting its own branch from encroachment by the legislature. Accordingly, this court has invalidated numerous enactments of the General Assembly that intrude into the exclusive powers of this court. Relying specifically on the doctrine of separation of powers, this court invalidated R.C. 4509.101 to the extent that it permitted an appeal from a decision of a trial court to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. <em>S. Euclid v. Jemison, supra, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Cincinnati Polyclinic v. Balch </em>(1915), 92 Ohio St. 415, 111 N.E. 159, paragraph two of the syllabus (invalidating a portion of a statute to the extent that it purported to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the court of appeals); <em>Schario v. State </em>(1922), 105 Ohio St. 535, 138 N.E. 63, paragraph four of the syllabus (invalidating an Act purporting to establish a time limit within which a court of appeals had to perform a judicial function); <em>Rockey v. 84 Lumber Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 221, 611 N.E.2d 789 (invalidating R.C. 2309.01 as in conflict with Civ.R. 8[A]). In a case following the holding of <em>Rockey, supra, </em>this court, in an opinion written by a member of the majority in the instant case, reaffirmed its \u201cgreat respect for the General Assembly and * * * great deference to its enactments * * *.\u201d <em>In re Coy </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 215, 219, 616 N.E.2d 1105, 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Conversely, this court has not been unaware of the limitations upon its own power to create or alter certain rules, even those that directly affect the judicial system. Thus we held that the court lacked power to alter a statute concerning the physician-patient privilege. We reasoned that we must defer to the legislature when the rule involves a substantive, and not procedural, right. <em>State v. Smorgala </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 222, 553 N.E.2d 672, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The teaching of these eases is that for generations this court has recognized the distinction between the roles of the legislative and judicial branches. It has enforced this distinction both against itself and against Acts of the General Assembly. Having steadfastly protected the judicial branch from encroachment by the legislature, this court should now reciprocate and refrain from judicially limiting legislation whose result it simply does not like.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">I dissent also from paragraphs one, three and four of the syllabus. My primary objection to these holdings, which overrule three recent decisions and limit another, is this court\u2019s continued disrespect for <em>stare decisis. </em>I wrote to oppose this trend in another recent case, <em>Gallimore v. Children\u2019s Hosp. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 244, 617 N.E.2d 1052 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting), and those principles apply equally here. There has always been tension between certainty and stability in the law and the drive to satisfy a judge\u2019s individual desire to \u201cdo justice.\u201d I am concerned, however, with that aspect of justice that requires that the same fact pattern be treated in a similar manner. To do otherwise is to abandon \u201cjustice\u201d completely. This rule applies with special force in cases of statutory interpretation, where the legislature is the appropriate body to make any needed corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In <em>Burris v. Grange Mut. Cos. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 84, 545 N.E.2d 83, and <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Rose </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 528, 575 N.E.2d 459, this court considered arguments similar to those raised here but refused to extend <em>Wood v. Shepard </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 86, 526 N.E.2d 1089, to apply to liability coverage. The majority overrules these cases, asserting that the framers of the Ohio Constitution, the General Assembly and this court have all indicated that \u201cdamages for wrongful death claims should not be limited.\u201d Section 19a, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, however, states only that wrongful death damages shall not be limited <em>\u201cby law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This means that there may be no artificially imposed cap, by statute or judicial decision, on total damages recoverable for wrongful death. See <em>Kennedy v. Byers </em>(1923), 107 Ohio St. 90, 96, 140 N.E. 630, 632-633. It does not mean, nor does any pronouncement by this court or the General Assembly mean, that no insurance policy \u2014 a contract between the insured and the insurer for which the insured has paid a premium for certain levels of coverage \u2014 may limit a provider\u2019s liability if that policy clearly and unambiguously so provides. Indeed, if a provider\u2019s liability cannot be limited by contract, might one argue that the $300,000 per accident limits of the Grange and Motorists policies are unenforceable \u201climitations\u201d of wrongful death damages? Even the majority does not contend that to be the case. To do so would eviscerate the insurance law of Ohio created by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Citizens, whose conduct is bound by it, expect the law to be certain, speedy and relatively inexpensive. We frustrate this goal by creating a climate in which it is impossible to predict what this court will do next.</p>\n<judges id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b679-5\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APX\">dissenting. I admire the measured tone adopted by the Chief Justice in his incisive and compelling dissent, and certainly concur in same.
