Our analysis begins with a review for \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s. order. According to claimant, not only is there no medical evidence of a physical capacity for work, but, to the contrary, medical evidence uniformly shows a complete inability to work. If the latter allegation proves correct, further consideration of nonmedical factors under <em>Noll </em>is pointless. See <em>State ex rel. Galion Mfg. Div., Dresser Industries, Inc. v. Haygood </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 38, 573 N.E.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Two medical reports \u2014 those by Drs. Mysiw and Sheridan \u2014 are before us. Dr. Sheridan\u2019s report is not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s denial of permanent total disability compensation, since this report found that claimant could not do any work. Dr. Mysiw\u2019s report, on the other hand, indicates that claimant retains some capacity for doing work. Contrary to claimant\u2019s representation, however, Dr. Mysiw does not merely state that claimant is amenable to rehabilitation; Dr. Mysiw states the claimant can do light work as well. Dr. Mysiw\u2019s report is thus \u201csome evidence\u201d which can be combined with nonmedical factors to produce a finding that claimant can perform sustained remunerative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">This evidentiary conclusion leads us to consider whether the commission adequately explained its reasoning in its order as <em>Noll </em>demands. The appellate court cautiously found compliance with <em>Noll. </em>Noting that <em>Noll </em>required only a \u201cbrief\u2019 explanation, the appellate court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201cThe order of the Industrial Commission denying permanent total disability compensation for Mr. Murray certainly qualifies as a <em>brief </em>explanation of the reasoning for the decision. We are not prepared to say that the explanation is <em>too </em>brief, but a more detailed explanation would be preferable. Thus, a limited writ is not necessary.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In this case, the commission\u2019s explanation, although brief, does suggest that claimant\u2019s \u201crelatively young\u201d age and education were considered to be assets to re-employment. Coupled with the commission\u2019s reference to the rehabilitation division\u2019s favorable assessment, this order meets the minimum standard of compliance with <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-10\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
