It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">\u201cAll conveyors, where exposed to contact, shall be equipped with means to disengage them from their power supply at such points of contact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">The commission found no violation, having deemed Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-05(C)(2) inapplicable. We agree, but for reasons distinct from those given by the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-05(0(2) mandates a disengagement device at points \u201cexposed to contact.\u201d An object is \u201cexposed to contact\u201d when its location, \u201cduring the course of operation, is accessible to an employee in performance of his regular or assigned duty.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(B)(ll). 4121:1-5-05(C)(2), therefore, will not apply if the accident occurred in a spot that was not accessible during the course of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">Because neither \u201caccessible\u201d nor \u201ccourse of operation\u201d is defined in the Revised or Administrative Code, the interpretation of these terms is within the commission\u2019s final jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Berry v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>193, 4 OBR 513, 448 N.E.2d 134. In this case, decedent was killed inside an enclosed conveyor. If the conveyor and its attached drag buckets had been moving at the time, decedent could not have entered the enclosure. <em>Only </em>if the conveyor was <em>first </em>stopped could decedent have gained access to the area in which he died. Given the commission\u2019s duty to strictly construe specific safety requirements in the employer\u2019s favor <em>(State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>[1989], 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216, 1219), the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that a location which is accessible only during cessation of operation was not \u201caccessible\u201d in the \u201ccourse of operation,\u201d and was not made so merely because the conveyor <em>subsequently </em>start\u00e9d running. The commission did not err in refusing to construe the disputed safety requirement in its most literal, and liberal <em>sense </em>\u2014 i.e., the conveyor was \u201caccessible\u201d because decedent was there and in the \u201ccourse of operation\u201d because it was on.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
