Power Co., supra. </em>On the authority of that case, we sustain CG&amp;E\u2019s first proposition of law, find its second proposition to be moot, and overrule the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Further, consistent with our decision in <em>Columbus S. Power Co., </em>we instruct the commission on remand to fix rates which provide CG&amp;E the gross annual revenues determined in accordance with R.C. 4909.15(B) and (D)(2)(b), and to provide a mechanism by which CG&amp;E may recover those revenues deferred to the time the order on remand is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">As set forth in R.C. 4909.05 and 4909.15(A)(1), the value of a utility\u2019s property, or its rate base, \u201c \u2018consists of the actual net investment in the assets of a utility, including the original cost of long term assets [R.C. 4909.05(C), (D), (E), (F) and (G) ], less depreciation and contributions of capital [R.C. 4909.05(H) and (I) ], plus short term assets in the form of cash working capital [R.C. 4909.15(A)(1) ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Babbit v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 81, 89-90, 13 O.O.3d 67, 72, 391 N.E.2d 1376, 1381, quoting <em>Franklin Cty. Welfare Rights Org. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 1, 11, 9 O.O.3d 1, 6, 377 N.E.2d 990, 997. In authorizing the working capital allowance, R.C. 4909.15(A)(1) provides for \u201ca reasonable allowance for materials and supplies and cash working capital.\u201d We have recognized that, \u201c[b]y omitting a specific formula in R.C. 4909.15(A)(1), the General Assembly has vested the PUCO with broad discretion in determining the appropriate allowances for working capital in utility rate cases.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 263, 265, 513 N.E.2d 243, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">In computing the working capital allowance, the commission traditionally determines an amount for the materials and supplies component and an amount for the cash component (determined by using a lead-lag study<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) and adds, or nets, those sums as the case may be. Although the record in this proceeding is somewhat confused by the commission staffs omission of the traditional line item for \u201ccash working capital\u201d in its staff report, we find its omission to be one of form and its methodology in computing the working capital allowance to be the same as in previous cases, as is recognized by the parties on appeal. According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ly, for purposes of our review, we accept that the lead-lag study adopted in this case resulted in a \u201cnegative cash working capital\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">This negative requirement was derived from the lead-lag study by netting the revenue lag dollars (which represent a need for cash working capital) against the expense lag dollars (which represent a source of cash working capital).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The negative amount of $27,335,000 was then effectively netted against the material and supplies (and miscellaneous working capital) requirement of $128,800,000 to arrive at a total working capital allowance of $101,465,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">CG&amp;E argues that it is unlawful to net the negative cash working capital requirement against the remaining working capital components. It reasons that R.C. 4909.15(A)(1) expressly distinguishes between materials and supplies and cash working capital and that a separate allowance must be established for each. Assuming as much, and relying on our decision in <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util Comm. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 263, 513 N.E.2d 243, CG&amp;E argues that the <em>cash </em>working capital \u201callowance\u201d cannot be a negative amount, but must be set at zero. We reject CG&amp;E\u2019s arguments and, for the reasons which follow, affirm the commission on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">While it is true that R.C. 4909.15(A)(1) differentiates between the materials and supplies and the cash component of the working capital allowance, it does not require that a separate allowance be set for each for ratemaking purposes. Rather, its plain language requires only that \u201ca reasonable allowance\u201d composed of both components be determined. Recognizing as much, this court has permitted offsets to materials and supplies by what would strictly be construed as \u201ccash\u201d items, when they were not otherwise considered by the commission\u2019s working capital methodology. See <em>Cincinnati v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 395, 53 O.O. 304, 119 N.E.2d 619, paragraph five of the syllabus, in which we held that \u201c * * * customers\u2019 contributions in the form of accurals [sic] for the payment of taxes, deposits to secure the payment of customers\u2019 bills for service or as advances on installation charges, and collections of rents to be paid at future dates, which will be constant with reasonable certainty in the foreseeable future and which are available for investment in materials and supplies, or for use as working capital, should be used as an offset on the allowance for working capital, including investments in materials and supplies necessary for the normal operations of the company and for plant maintenance and repair.\u201d As we recognized in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 111, 113, 4 OBR 358, 360, 447 N.E.2d 749, 752, \u201c[t]he principle underlying this holding is that investors in public utilities should be permitted to earn a return only on that property for which they have supplied funds, not on funds contributed by customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">There is no question on appeal but that the expense lag dollars at issue represented non-investor funds and were available to offset CG&amp;E\u2019s cash working capital needs. Consistent with R.C. 4909.15(A)(1) and our established precedent, the commission\u2019s determination that those funds were also available as an offset to the materials and supplies requirement was neither unlawful nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">So finding, we also reject CG&amp;E\u2019s argument that <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>(1987) is controlling. There, as here, the commission determined the utility\u2019s materials and supplies requirement to be a positive amount and its cash working capital requirement, using a lead-lag study, to be a negative amount. However, unlike this case, the sum of the requirements resulted in an overall negative figure of $8,367,000. The commission set the overall working capital allowance at zero, permitting the negative cash component to offset the materials and supplies requirement. See <em>In re Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. </em>(Oct. 29, 1985), PUCO No. 84-1272-TP-AIR, at 8. On appeal, the Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel (\u201cOCC\u201d) argued that the commission erred by failing to authorize a negative working capital allowance under R.C. 4909.15(A)(1). We rejected this argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201cWe agree with the PUCO\u2019s conclusion that R.C. 4909.15(A)(1) does not contemplate a \u2018negative\u2019 working capital allowance in a rate base determination. The plain and clear language of the statute requires an \u2018allowance\u2019 for working capital requirements. We can only interpret that language to mean a positive allowance, or in appropriate circumstances such as found by the PUCO in [this] case, an allowance of zero working capital.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d at 266-267, 513 N.E.2d at 247.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Contrary to CG&amp;E\u2019s assertions, this language does not recognize a separate allowance for <em>cash </em>working capital, nor does it provide that a negative cash working capital requirement cannot be used as an offset to the materials and supplies requirement. Rather, it stands only for the proposition that R.C. 4909.15(A)(1) does not contemplate an overall negative working capital allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Finally, CG&amp;E relies on our adoption of the commission\u2019s statement in <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>(1987) that \u201cneither the General Assembly nor the Ohio Supreme Court intended that a negative result from a lead-lag study be deducted from rate base.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 513 N.E.2d at 249. It argues that the offset to the materials and supplies requirement in this case will have the same effect, and thus is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>CG&amp;E\u2019s argument ignores that the commission\u2019s offset to the materials and supplies component in <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>(1987) also had the effect of reducing rate base. Moreover, it ignores that the statement was made in response to OCC\u2019s alternative argument that, if R.C. 4909.15(A)(1) did not contemplate a negative working capital allowance, the negative cash component should be deducted directly from rate base under R.C. 4909.05(J) and (I).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whether such funds should also be considered as available to offset the original cost of the company\u2019s long-term assets is not an issue before us. We hold only that it was lawful and reasonable for the commission to offset the materials and supplies requirement with these customer-provided funds in determining the company\u2019s working capital needs under R.C. 4909.15(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b684-6\">A.W.

I concur with the majority (subject to my concurrence in <em>Columbus S. Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>[1993], 67 Ohio St.3d at 549-551, 620 N.E.2d at 846-847) in the holdings found in Part I of the opinion. I concur, reluctantly, with the holding in Part II of the opinion and do so in order to obtain a majority for a decision of this court. I agree with, and have generally supported, the commission\u2019s broad discretion in ratemaking matters. I have reservations in this case on this issue, however, because I think R.C. 4909.-15(A)(1) does not permit the commission (nor do I think it makes any accounting sense) to set \u201ccash working capital\u201d at a negative figure. It is difficult for me to understand how the terms \u201ccash\u201d and \u201callowance\u201d can equate to a negative number. The proper action, I believe, was for the commission to set the cash working capital allowance at zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>I am not as ready to accept and assume, as has the majority, that \u201c * * * the commission staffs omission of the traditional line item for \u2018cash working capital\u2019 in its staff report * * * [is] one of form and its methodology in computing the working capital allowance * * * .\u201d I have always found the commission, its staff and its legal representation to be exceptional in their work. In every previous case that I can recall, such a line item (by necessity, of course) was included. If such an entry had been included, it would have shown, because of the accepted lead-lag study, a \u201cnegative cash working capital\u201d figure. It is more likely, I think, that the line item was \u201coverlooked\u201d because the staff recognized that in <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 263, at 266-267, 513 N.E.2d 243, at 247, this court stated: \u201cWe agree with the PUCO\u2019s conclusion that R.C. 4909.15(A)(1) does not contemplate a \u2018negative\u2019 working capital allowance in a rate base determination. The plain and clear language of the statute requires an \u2018allowance\u2019 for working capital requirements. We can only interpret that language <em>to mean a positive allowance, or </em>in appropriate circumstance such as found by the PUCO in Cincinnati Bell\u2019s case, <em>an allowance of zero working capital.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">As it does with the retroactive ratemaking issue, the majority strives to talk its way around the working capital issue, but I find it difficult to subscribe, without comment, to these positions of the majority. Accordingly, I continue to adhere to the position I have taken in <em>Columbus S. Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., supra, </em>on the question of retroactive ratemaking and the position set forth above on the issue of working capital. In doing so, however, I concur in the judgment of the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
