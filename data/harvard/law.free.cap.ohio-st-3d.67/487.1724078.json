However, since we have determined that the trial court\u2019s failure to properly instruct the jury that flag burning as a mode of expression enjoys the full protection of the First Amendment, our review will be limited to only that error, mandating reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Appellant was charged and convicted for -violating R.C. 2917.01(A)(1), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201c(A) No person shall knowingly engage in conduct designed to urge or incite another to commit any offense of violence, when either of the following applies]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\u201c(1) Such conduct takes place under circumstances which create a clear and present danger that any offense of violence will be committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The prosecution\u2019s theory of the case was not that appellant made statements directing either her fellow demonstrators or members of the audience to commit acts of violence. Officer Deli, in fact, agreed with defense counsel on cross-examination that Lessin neither said \u201c[g]o and assault someone,\u201d \u201c[cjommit violence against these other people in the crowd\u201d or \u201cburn down Terminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Tower.\u201d Instead, the state sought to prove that Lessin violated R.C. 2917.-01(A)(1) by pushing, shoving and punching people as she rushed through an angry crowd after already having raised its intensity level by denouncing United States foreign policy and by burning the United States flag. According to the state\u2019s theory, Lessin violated R.C. 2917.01(A)(1) by provoking the use of force against herself and her fellow demonstrators. Lessin\u2019s actions thus suggested that she willingly made herself the target of the hostile crowd\u2019s violent reactions in order to dramatize the strength of her convictions and, perhaps, draw sympathetic attention to her cause. Also implied by the state\u2019s theory is that Lessin intended to provoke a violent episode in order to secure coverage of the antiwar demonstration by the local television news media. Since her conduct was directed towards inciting violence under potentially explosive conditions where violence was very likely to occur, the state urged the jury to find Lessin guilty of violating R.C. 2917.01(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">It is evident from our review of the record that Lessin was partly engaged in expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment during the August 10, 1990 demonstration at Public Square. Her burning of the flag is afforded the same protection against criminal punishment under the First and Fourteenth Amendments as are her words spoken in public criticism of United States foreign policy. A seminal United States Supreme Court opinion, <em>Texas v. Johnson </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342, determined that flag desecration is \u201csufficiently imbued with elements of communication\u201d to implicate the constitutional right to free speech.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Johnson\u2019s political expression (burning the American flag at a staged political demonstration in Dallas during the 1984 Republican National Convention) was \u201crestricted because of the content of the message he conveyed,\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>491 U.S. at 412, 109 S.Ct. at 2543, 105 L.Ed.2d at 359, the court held that his First Amendment rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>In rejecting Texas\u2019s argument that the state\u2019s interest in preventing breaches of the peace justifies prohibition of Johnson\u2019s selected manner of protest, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cThe State\u2019s position, therefore, amounts to a claim that an audience that takes serious offense at particular expression is necessarily likely to disturb the peace and that the expression may be prohibited on this basis. Our precedents do not countenance such a presumption. On the contrary, they recognize that a principal \u2018function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.\u2019 [Citations omitted.] It would be odd indeed to conclude <em>both </em>that \u2018if it is the speaker\u2019s opinion that gives offense, that consequence is a reason for according it constitutional protection,\u2019 [citation omitted] <em>and </em>that the Government may ban the expression of certain disagreeable ideas on the unsupported presumption that their very disagreeableness will provoke violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201cThus, we have not permitted the government to assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot, but have instead required careful consideration of the actual circumstances surrounding such expression, asking whether the expression \u2018is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\u2019 <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 447 [89 S.Ct. 1827, 1829, 23 L.Ed.2d 430, 434, 48 O.O.2d 320, 322] (1969) (reviewing circumstances surrounding rally and speeches by Ku Klux Klan).\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>491 U.S. at 408-409, 109 S.Ct. at 2542, 105 L.Ed.2d at 356-357.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">While Lessin\u2019s right to verbally criticize her government\u2019s foreign policy and her right to burn the United States flag without urging people to commit violent acts can in no way form the basis of a conviction under R.C. 2917.01, Lessin\u2019s alleged assaults of passersby are not constitutionally protected from criminal sanction under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Our duty is to ensure that the jury\u2019s guilty verdict neither transgressed nor contravened Lessin\u2019s freedom of expression. In this regard, the United States Supreme Court has cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\u201c[W]hen a single-count indictment or information charges the commission of a crime by virtue of the defendant\u2019s having done both a constitutionally protected act and one which may be unprotected, and a guilty verdict ensues without elucidation, there is an unacceptable danger that the trier of fact will have regarded the two acts as \u2018intertwined\u2019 and have rested the conviction on both together.\u201d <em>Street v. New York </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 576, 588, 89 S.Ct. 1354, 1363-1364, 22 L.Ed.2d 572, 582-583.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The risk that a jury will premise its guilty verdict on constitutionally protected conduct is reduced, if not completely eliminated, by an accurate and thorough set of jury instructions which direct the jury to refrain from considering certain evidence as proof of guilt. In this case, the role of the jury instructions was critical in obviating the possibility that each juror would convict based on his or her personal prejudices against flag burners and Communists. Accordingly, the question is whether the jury instructions sufficiently guarded against a guilty verdict being rendered, in whole or part, upon constitutionally protected political expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that the trial judge shall charge the jury in accordance with Crim.R. 30.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Construing Crim.R. 30(A), we have stated that \u201c[a]fter arguments are completed, a trial court must fully and completely give the jury all instructions which are <em>relevant and necessary for the jury to weigh the evidence and discharge its duty as the fact finder.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Comen </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 206, 553 N.E.2d 640, paragraph two of the syllabus. It is not crucial that the instruction given contain the precise verbiage as proffered by a party:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">\u201cIn a criminal case, it is not mandatory upon a trial court to give requested instructions to the jury verbatim, but if the requested instructions contain a correct, pertinent statement of the law and are appropriate to the facts they must be included, at least in substance, in the court\u2019s charge to the jury. * * * \u201d <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 79, 65 O.O.2d 222, 303 N.E.2d 865, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Appellant submitted a proposed jury instruction on free speech which was either rejected in part or amended in part by the trial judge. The rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>portion of appellant\u2019s proposed instruction, which we find constitutes reversible error, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">\u201cThe First Amendment protects free speech. The state cannot prosecute someone for exercising her right to free speech. <em>The law applicable to this case is that </em>speaking &amp; <em>burning the flag are protected speech and are protected by the [F]irst [AJmendment &amp; the defendant] cannot be convicted for such activity.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In determining whether the trial judge erred in failing to give appellant\u2019s proposed instruction relating to the First Amendment and protected speech, the court of appeals erroneously employed the abuse of discretion standard of review. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 149. We previously applied the abuse of discretion standard to review a trial court\u2019s decision not to give a defendant\u2019s requested instruction that his inebriated condition negated the specific intent element of the crime of murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.02, and held that it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine whether the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to require that instruction be given. <em>State v. Wolons </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 64, 541 N.E.2d 443, paragraph two of the syllabus. However, unlike <em>Wolons, </em>the determination of whether the trial court erred in failing to give Lessin\u2019s proposed instruction concerning flag burning does not involve an inquiry going to the sufficiency of the evidence to support that specific instruction. Here, the fact that Lessin burned the United States flag is uncontroverted. Therefore, the trial court had an obligation as a matter of law to give Lessin\u2019s proffered instruction on flag burning because, in the absence of this instruction, the jury could consider protected speech as evidence that Lessin was guilty of R.C. 2917.01(A)(1). Accordingly, we hold that when a criminal offense charged arises from conduct that encompasses both a constitutionally protected act and an act that is not constitutionally protected, failure of the trial court to instruct the jury that it may not consider evidence of the constitutionally protected act as proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt is reversible error. See <em>Williams v. North Carolina </em>(1942), 317 U.S. 287, 292, 63 S.Ct. 207, 210, 87 L.Ed. 279, 282:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201cTo say that a general verdict of guilty should be upheld though we cannot know that it did not rest on the invalid constitutional ground on which the case was submitted to the jury, would be to countenance a procedure which would cause a serious impairment of constitutional rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We cannot uphold Lessin\u2019s conviction for the crime of inciting violence because it is impossible to say with any degree of certainty that her burning of the United States flag was disregarded by the jury in reaching its verdict. The trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>instruction given to the jury on free speech<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> did not serve to adequately protect the defendant\u2019s rights because it did not inform the jury that (1) flag burning in the absence of a call to violence is protected speech under the First Amendment and (2) the jury is not to consider the fact that Lessin burned the flag in determining whether she is guilty of inciting violence. Without being instructed in accordance with the law set forth in the above-emphasized portion of appellant\u2019s proffered instruction, there is an unacceptable possibility that the jury considered a constitutionally protected act in finding her guilty under R.C. 2917.01(A)(1). The necessity of giving a more precise instruction is further underscored because of the following exchange which occurred between defense counsel and the trial judge during voir dire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201cMR. ROSSMAN: How many of you are aware of recent Supreme Court cases that says [sic] it\u2019s okay to burn the flag?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cMR. LONJAK: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: The objection is sustained. <em>There has been no Supreme Court case, to my knowledge, that permits under any circumstances that it\u2019s okay to bum the flag. </em>That\u2019s why the lawyers have been instructed not to discuss the issues of law. And don\u2019t do it again, Mr. Rossman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">\u201cMR. ROSSMAN: May I discuss it at sidebar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, you may not.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">The trial court\u2019s statement is clearly error because it is in direct conflict with the holding in <em>Texas v. Johnson. </em>Having determined that the trial judge failed to guard against the possibility that the jury would consider constitutionally protected speech in convicting appellant for inciting violence, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction. Our decision rests in large part on our awareness of the depth of those personal convictions that consider flag desecration as a repugnant and intolerable act. This is the reason persons unhappy with governmental decisions find burning the United States flag an irresistible method of communicating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>degree of their dissatisfaction. Therefore, in circumstances like those now before us, the jury must be instructed in accordance with <em>Texas v. Johnson </em>so that it does not encroach upon the defendant\u2019s freedom of expression when returning a guilty verdict. We should not presume that, absent an instruction on flag burning, a jury will disregard such disgraceful and irreverent action in its deliberations on whether the flag burner incited a crowd to violence in violation of R.C. 2917.01(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals affirming appellant\u2019s conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b658-6\">A.W.

Recognizing that the right to freedom of speech is a more generalized guarantee of freedom of expression, Justice Brennan, writing for the majority in <em>Johnson, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\u201cThe First Amendment literally forbids the abridgment only of \u2018speech,\u2019 but we have long recognized that its protection does not end at the spoken or written word.

This case is <em>not </em>about flag burning. This case is <em>not </em>a <em>Texas v. Johnson </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 case. This case is <em>not </em>about the right to assemble publicly. This case is <em>not </em>about free speech. This case <em>is </em>about a woman who was charged, tried and convicted of violating R.C. 2917.01(A)(1), which law prohibits any person from inciting another person(s) to commit any offense of violence. The record here, even as set forth in the majority opinion, leads to the inescapable conclusion that appellant\u2019s actions (with or without the flag burning) could reasonably be construed by a jury to contravene the proscription of R.C. 2917.01(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Appellant was not merely expressing a provocative idea. She was also <em>acting </em>and it is this behavior that offends the statute. There has been much discussion in this case concerning <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430. I believe the proper emphasis from <em>Brandenburg, </em>in the context of the case at bar, should be on <em>Brandenburg\u2019s </em>language that the states may not prohibit the advocacy of the use of force or of law violation \u201c * * * <em>except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\u201d </em>(Footnote omitted and emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 447, 89 S.Ct. at 1829, 23 L.Ed.2d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">That is exactly what happened here \u2014 appellant\u2019s actions incited and brought about imminent lawlessness. In this regard, I find <em>State v. Hoffman </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 129, 11 O.O.3d 298, 387 N.E.2d 239, both instructive and helpful. The jury in the instant case, the trial judge, and two judges of the court of appeals believed, and I believe, that appellant crossed the line and, thereby, clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>violated R.C. 2917.01(A)(1). Her <em>actions, </em>for which she was convicted, have nothing to do with her burning the flag or with free speech. The verdict of the jury, the judgment of the trial court and that of the court of appeals should be affirmed. Because the majority does not do so, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b659-6\">Resnick and Gwin, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b659-7\">Gwin, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AU3_\">dissenting. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the act of burning the national flag is <em>per se </em>protected expression under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and that the jury could not consider Lessin\u2019s act of burning the national flag in determining whether she was guilty of inciting violence in violation of R.C. 2917.01(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">To read the majority opinion, the citizens of Ohio would conclude that a person who burns the American flag is granted absolute immunity from criminal prosecution. In fact, it would appear the majority is giving the act of burning our national flag more protection than what is afforded free speech under the First Amendment. The United States Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201c[W]e reject the view that freedom of speech * * * as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, are \u2018absolutes,\u2019 'not only in the undoubted sense that where the constitutional protection exists it must prevail, but also in the sense that the scope of that protection must be gathered solely from a literal reading of the First Amendment. Throughout its history this Court has consistently recognized at least two ways in which constitutionally protected freedom of speech is narrower than an unlimited license to talk. On the one hand, certain forms of speech, or speech in certain contexts, has been considered outside the scope of constitutional protection. See, <em>e.g., Schenck v. United States, </em>249 U.S. 47 [39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470]; <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568 [62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031]; <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 494 [71 S.Ct. 857, 95 L.Ed. 1137]; <em>Beauhamais v. Illinois, </em>343 U.S. 250 [72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919]; <em>Yates v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 298 [77 S.Ct. 1064, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356]; <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476 [77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498]. On the other hand, general regulatory statutes, not intended to control the content of speech but incidentally limiting its unfettered exercise, have not been regarded as the type of law the First or Fourteenth Amendment forbade Congress or the States to pass, when they have been found justified by subordinating valid governmental interests, a prerequisite to constitutionality which has necessarily involved a weighing of the governmental interest involved.\u201d <em>Konigsberg v. State Bar of California </em>(1961), 366 U.S. 36, 49-51, 81 S.Ct. 997, 1006-1007, 6 L.Ed.2d 105, 116-117.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">It has been well established that the First Amendment does not afford protection to a person who screams \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theater. Nor does the right to free speech allow a person to defame another or utter fighting words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>which are likely to incite imminent violence. See <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430. Under the same logic, the government has a valid interest in regulating speech and expression which under certain circumstances are likely to create \u201ca clear and present danger.\u201d <em>Schenck v. United States, supra, </em>249 U.S. at 52, 39 S.Ct. at 249, 63 L.Ed. at 473. Accordingly, it is of utmost importance in measuring the protection afforded to free expression to carefully consider the surrounding circumstances of the expression to determine whether it is directed toward inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. <em>Brandeburg, </em>395 U.S. at 447, 89 S.Ct. at 1829, 23 L.Ed.2d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Although, it is well established that the First Amendment does not afford absolute protection for all speech and expression, the majority of this court is of the opinion that all instances of burning the United States flag are constitutionally protected from criminal sanction. In reaching this decision, the majority relies on <em>Texas v. Johnson </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342. In that case, Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted under a Texas statute prohibiting a person from intentionally or knowingly desecrating a state or national flag. In affirming the reversal of Johnson\u2019s conviction, the United States Supreme Court determined that the Texas statute impermissibly infringed .upon a person\u2019s right to freedom of speech and expression because such person could be convicted for burning a flag even though this act did not threaten to disturb the peace. In other words, a resident of Texas could have been charged with violating the criminal statute for burning a national flag in the privacy of his own home or under circumstances where it offended no one. This statute clearly infringed upon that person\u2019s right to freely express his opinions under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court did not hold that in every instance a person who burns a flag is afforded absolute protection from criminal prosecution. The First Amendment certainly does not afford protection to a heckler who would appear at a United States war veterans\u2019 ceremony screaming epithets against the United States and burning the national flag on stage. This situation would likely create imminent lawlessness in the form of a riot. The heckler\u2019s right to free speech and expression would be outweighed by the state\u2019s interest in preserving the peace, and, under those circumstances, the state would be permitted to criminally charge the heckler with inciting violence. Under today\u2019s ruling, the state of Ohio has no recourse in preventing this imminent lawlessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The statute upon which Lessin was charged and convicted reads that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly engage in conduct designed to urge or incite another to commit any offense of -violence * * * when * * * [s]uch conduct takes place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>under circumstances which create a clear and present danger that any offense of violence will be committed[.]\u201d R.C. 2917.01(A)(1). This statute is specifically and narrowly designed to protect the state from expression which is directed toward inciting or producing imminent lawlessness action and which is likely to incite or produce such action. This statute complies with the law set forth in <em>Brandenburg, supra. </em>Therefore, in determining whether a person has violated the Ohio statute which proscribes inciting violence, the totality of the circumstances must be considered.- These circumstances include, but are not limited to, Lessin\u2019s: screaming of obscenities; hollering, \u201cFuck the United States[,] I hate this country\u201d; running through the crowd; and burning the national flag.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Therefore, it was not reversible error for the trial court to decline instructing the jury that it may not consider evidence of the burning the United States flag as proof of Lessin\u2019s guilt of inciting violence. The \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test would instead require the trial court to instruct the jury that in some instances flag burning is a constitutionally protected act, but under other circumstances it is not.</p>\n<judges id=\"b661-5\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
