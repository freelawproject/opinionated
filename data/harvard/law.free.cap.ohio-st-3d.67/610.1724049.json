For \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d however, a claimant could switch the,, election. R.C. 4123.57(A). \u201cGood cause\u201d requires \u201c(1) unforeseen changed circumstances subsequent to the initial election, and (2) actual impaired earning capacity.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Combs v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 378, 381, 582 N.E.2d 990, 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">The first element, \u201cunforeseen changed circumstances,\u201d is \u201cdeliberately flexible in order to accommodate the many possible situations that could merit a change of election.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Long v. Mihm </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 527, 529, 597 N.E.2d 134, 136. It, too, has two components, \u201cwith changed circumstances being a condition precedent to consideration of foreseeability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To date, we have identified three examples of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d sufficient to trigger a foreseeability inquiry: (1) recognition of additional conditions after election <em>(Combs)-, </em>(2) significant worsening of claimant\u2019s condition <em>(State ex rel. Simpson v. Indus. Comm. </em>[1991], 62 Ohio St.3d 162, 580 N.E.2d 779); or (3) transformation of a nonwork-preventive injury into a work-prohibitive one <em>(Simpson).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">None of these prerequisites has been met in this case. Neither the status of claimant\u2019s allowed conditions nor his employment has changed since he made his election. As to the former, no post-election conditions have been recognized. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>to the latter, claimant\u2019s injury-related inability to perform his former duties predated his election. The district hearing officer specifically found that claimant\u2019s pre-election retirement was injury-influenced. Claimant, therefore, knew at that time that his earning capacity was likely impaired, but he chose R.C. 4123.57(B) benefits nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">We also do not find that claimant\u2019s increase in disability from twenty-one to thirty-nine percent, standing alone, demonstrates a \u201csignificant worsening\u201d of claimant\u2019s condition. Our holding is supported by <em>Simpson, supra, </em>in which a twenty-percent increase in disability, in and of itself, did not justify an election change. To define \u201csignificant\u201d in purely numerical terms is untenable because no two claimants, or the circumstances accompanying their change of election requests, are the same. A claimant with an already high percentage of disability may finally be forced from the work force by a small increase in disability. A different claimant, on the other hand, with a low percentage of disability may be virtually unaffected by such an increase. The significance of a disability increase, therefore, must be decided on a case-by-case basis, based on the totality of the attendant circumstances. In this case, absent nothing more than a sheer mathematical increase in percentage of disability, we decline to find that claimant has established that his condition has sufficiently changed so as to warrant further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Claimant offers a fourth criterion, asserting that election without the benefit of an attorney constitutes \u201cgood cause.\u201d Claimant stresses that he had a non-attorney union representative when he made his election, and contends that <em>State ex rel. Nicodemus v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 58, 5 OBR 115, 448 N.E.2d 1360, supports his position. Claimant\u2019s reliance on <em>Nicodemus, </em>however, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\"><em>Nicodemus </em>involved an employer\u2019s right to belatedly appeal an order received by the employer\u2019s actuarial representative, but not by the employer itself. We upheld the employer\u2019s appeal rights, finding that the employer\u2019s non-attorney actuarial representative did not sufficiently understand the importance of the order so as to impute notice and waiver of appeal to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Contrary to claimant\u2019s representation, however, <em>Nicodemus </em>did not specify that <em>any </em>decision by a claimant made without attorney consultation is voidable. We note that Ohio Adm.Code 4121-2-01 (A)(1) requires that <em>any </em>representative, attorney or otherwise, who practices before the commission <em>\u201cshall </em>make himself competent to handle such matters by becoming familiar with the statutes, decisions of the courts, and rules of the bureau and industrial commission relating to workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Claimant has failed to demonstrate that his union representative lacked the requisite competency or was otherwise unqualified to represent claimant\u2019s interests. We, therefore, decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>find that \u201cgood cause\u201d for a change of election has arisen from claimant\u2019s representation by a non-attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In conclusion, we find that claimant has failed to establish the \u201cunforeseen changed circumstances\u201d required of a finding of \u201cgood cause.\u201d Accordingly, the writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b775-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
