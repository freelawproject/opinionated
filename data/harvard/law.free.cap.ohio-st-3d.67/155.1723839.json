See R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(b) and (d). We also affirm that court\u2019s finding that certain witness statements were exempt from release as \u201ctrial preparation records\u201d under R.C. 149.43(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">At the outset, we reject Martin\u2019s effort to require that a public document, within its four corners, specify the promise of confidentiality to witnesses or the threat to their physical safety in order to be exempt from release under R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(b) or (d). As the court of appeals noted, it would be \u201cunwise to abrogate promises of confidentiality, to burden the police with further procedures, or to take unnecessary risks with people\u2019s safety. * * * Extended written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>procedures could also * * * [curtail] citizen cooperation\u201d and \u201ccause the police to lose chances to apprehend perpetrators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Here, the court of appeals acted upon adequate evidence to exempt these documents from public release. Moreover, \u201creversal of the factual determinations of the appellate court relative to disclosure made during its <em>in camera </em>review would be inappropriate absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Vindicator Printing Co. v. Watkins </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 129, 136-137, 609 N.E.2d 551, 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Despite Martin\u2019s claims to the contrary, witness statements can be exempt trial preparation records. <em>State ex rel. Hamblin v. Brooklyn </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 152, 616 N.E.2d 883; <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Cleveland </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 331, 332, 603 N.E.2d 1011, 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Here, the court of appeals properly found certain witness statements to be exempt \u201ctrial preparation\u201d records. Other facts confirm a homicide detective\u2019s assertion that these statements were \u201cprepared for no other reason than for the use of the prosecutor.\u201d In form, these statements were verbatim, first person, typewritten narratives which were reviewed, sworn to and signed by the witnesses. That form, useful both to refresh recollection or impeach a witness, was similar to what lawyers use to \u201clock in\u201d a witness for trial. Moreover, detectives mostly took the statements after the investigation had focused on Martin and he had been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Finally, we reject Martin\u2019s claim that the city may have waived its exemption to public release. We need not consider a claim never raised before the trial court. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364. Also, the passage of time does not alter the exempt status of documents. <em>State ex rel. Polovischak v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 51, 552 N.E.2d 635; <em>State ex rel. Thompson Newspapers, Inc. v. Martin </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 28, 546 N.E.2d 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Thus, \u201cthe court of appeals\u2019 decision was reasoned, logical, and based on precedent. Its decision followed and applied our previous decisions * * *.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Zuern v. Leis </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 20, 22, 564 N.E.2d 81, 83. Accordingly, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-12\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
