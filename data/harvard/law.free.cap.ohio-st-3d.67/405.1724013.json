First, having lawfully detained defendant for a traffic violation, did the police officers have the authority to conduct a pat-down search of defendant\u2019s body after ordering him out of his car? Second, if the officers had legal authority to search defendant, did they exceed the permissible scope of that pat-down search for weapons?</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The propriety of the initial stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle cannot be reasonably disputed under the facts of this case. The officers\u2019 suppression hearing testimony, indicating that defendant was pulled over because of a burned-out headlight, is uncontroverted and served as the lawful basis for the stop. The focus of our inquiry, therefore, is on the officers\u2019 request that defendant step out of the vehicle and on the ensuing pat-down search for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms </em>(1977), 434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331, held that a police officer may order a motorist to get out of a car, which has been properly stopped for a traffic violation, even without suspicion of criminal activity. What is now referred to as a <em>\u201cMimms </em>order\u201d was viewed by the court as an incremental intrusion into the driver\u2019s personal liberty which, when balanced against the officer\u2019s interest in protection against unexpected assault by the driver and against accidental injury from passing traffic, is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. In this regard, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">\u201c * * * We think this additional intrusion can only be described as <em>de minimis. </em>The driver is being asked to expose to view very little more of his person than is already exposed. The police have already lawfully decided that the driver shall be briefly detained; the only question is whether he shall spend that period sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his car or standing alongside it. Not only is the insistence of the police on the latter choice not a \u2018serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the person,\u2019 but it hardly rises to the level of a \u2018 \u201cpetty indignity.\u201d \u2019 <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>[ (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 17, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1877, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 903], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>What is at most a mere inconvenience cannot prevail when balanced against legitimate concerns for the officer\u2019s safety.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. at 111, 98 S.Ct. at 333, 54 L.Ed.2d at 337.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Other courts have relied on <em>Mimms </em>in holding constitutional a police officer\u2019s <em>additional </em>order that the driver be seated in the patrol car. See <em>State v. Mertz </em>(N.D.1985), 362 N.W.2d 410, 413, where the Supreme Court of North Dakota held that this \u201cadditional increment of intrusion\u201d into a driver\u2019s personal liberty \u201cdoes not outweigh public-policy concerns for the safety of police officers and in North Dakota, with its varying weather conditions, concerns for the protection of both the officer and driver.\u201d See, also, <em>United States v. Manbeck </em>(C.A.4, 1984), 744 F.2d 360, 377-378.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\"><em>Mimms </em>merely dispenses with the requirement that the police officer possess reasonable suspicion of criminal activity before the officer may order the driver out of an already lawfully stopped vehicle. Accordingly, the ordering of defendant to get out of his car was proper even if the officers were unable to articulate a reasonable suspicion which prompted this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Contrary to the lower court\u2019s opinion, the order to step out of the vehicle is not a stop separate and distinct from the original traffic stop. It is so minimal and insignificant an intrusion that the <em>Mimms </em>court refused to apply the requirements for an investigatory stop. Unlike an investigatory stop, where the police officer involved \u201cmust be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion,\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 906, a <em>Mimms </em>order does not have to be justified by any constitutional quantum of suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">We turn now to the propriety of a police officer\u2019s pat-down search for weapons \u2014 a search governed by the dictates of <em>Terry v. Ohio,, supra. </em>Under <em>Terry, </em>a limited protective search <em>of the </em>detainee\u2019s person for concealed weapons is justified only when the officer has reasonably concluded that \u201cthe individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others * * <em>Id. </em>at 24, 88 S.Ct. at 1881, 20 L.Ed.2d at 908. Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Terry </em>emphasizes that \u201cthe right to frisk must be immediate and automatic\u201d where the lawfully stopped detainee is under suspicion for a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 88 S.Ct. at 1886, 20 L.Ed.2d at 913. \u201cThe purpose of this limited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence * * <em>Adams v. Williams </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612, 617. \u201cWhere a police officer, during an investigative stop, has a reasonable suspicion that an individual is armed based on the totality of the circumstances, the officer may initiate a protective search for the safety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>himself and others.\u201d <em>State v. Bobo </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 177, 524 N.E.2d 489, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">A <em>Mimms </em>order does not automatically bestow upon the police officer the authority to conduct a pat-down search for weapons. In analyzing the ensuing <em>Terry </em>frisk, the question we must ask is whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, the officers had a reasonable, objective basis for frisking defendant after ordering him out of the car. See <em>State v. Andrews </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 86, 565 N.E.2d 1271. \u201cThe touchstone of our analysis under the Fourth Amendment is always \u2018the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mimms, supra, </em>434 U.S. at 108-109, 98 S.Ct. at 332, 54 L.Ed.2d at 335, quoting <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 19, 88 S.Ct. at 1878-1879, 20 L.Ed.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The transcript of the suppression hearing reveals that the officers\u2019 actions were motivated by two possible concerns: (1) the information received from the radio broadcast, and (2) the defendant\u2019s failure to properly identify himself by producing his driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Green agreed -with defense counsel on cross-examination that the request to defendant to step out of the car and the frisk were the result of what he had heard from the police dispatcher. On redirect, however, Officer Green stated that these actions were taken because defendant\u2019s inability to produce a driver\u2019s license meant that the officers had to place him in the back seat of the patrol car. The apparent inconsistency was later clarified for the fact finder by Officer Green\u2019s testimony that <em>both </em>concerns prompted his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Next to testify was Officer Travano. According to his suppression hearing testimony, after defendant was ordered out of the car, he was patted down as an incident to his failure to produce a driver\u2019s license. The officers wanted to run defendant\u2019s name through the computer to verify the existence of his driver\u2019s license as well as ascertain the car owner\u2019s identity. Officer Travano further stated that the protective search was conducted because he wanted to be sure that defendant did not possess weapons while being detained in the patrol car. Officer Travano stressed that defendant was searched on this basis alone. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>radio broadcast, according to his testimony, was not the motivating reason for either asking defendant to get out of his vehicle or the pat-down protective search for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We recognize that one of the realities of police work is that an officer\u2019s conduct is not always guided by a single objective. An additional motive, later determined to be improper, will not taint an otherwise lawful search. Here, the officers\u2019 pat-down search of defendant was in accordance with standard police procedure which dictates that protective measures be taken before a person is to be held in the back seat of a squad car. A determination as to the reasonableness of a particular police procedure depends \u201con a balance between the public interest and the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.\u201d <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 873, 878, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 2579, 45 L.Ed.2d 607, 614-615. Certainly, it is reasonable that the officer, who has a legitimate reason to so detain that person, is interested in guarding against an ambush from the rear. \u201cA court reviewing the officer\u2019s actions must give due weight to his experience and training and view the evidence as it would be understood by those in law enforcement.\u201d <em>Andrews, supra, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 88, 565 N.E.2d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We, therefore, find that the police officers\u2019 proffered justification in patting down the driver \u2014 their own personal security \u2014 is legitimate. When balanced against the driver\u2019s minimal privacy interests under these circumstances, we can only conclude that the driver of a motor vehicle may be subjected to a brief pat-down search for weapons where the detaining officer has a lawful reason to detain said driver in the patrol car. <em>Terry </em>wisely instructs that \u201cit would be unreasonable to require that police officers take unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 23, 88 S.Ct. at 1881, 20 L.Ed.2d at 907. The state\u2019s obligation not to violate the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights does not command that the police officer forsake reasonable precautionary measures during the performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The court of appeals, however, held that the police officers\u2019 search of defendant\u2019s person was unlawful because their actions were motivated <em>solely </em>by what was relayed to them on the radio broadcast. We disagree. Officer Travano testified contrary to this position. The testimony of Officer Green, while at times inconsistent, can hardly be interpreted with the court of appeals\u2019 degree of certainty. It is well to note that only the trier of fact, who is in the unique position to observe a witness face-to-face, can make such factual inferences as elusive as the witnesses\u2019 subjective motives. According to one expert on communication techniques for trial attorneys, ninety percent of the total meaning of testimony is interpreted through nonverbal behavior, such as voice inflection, hand gestures, and the overall visual demeanor of the witness. The witnesses\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>choice of words accounts for only ten percent of the meaning of their testimony. Rasicot, New Techniques for Winning Jury Trials (1990) 28-29. Therefore, nonverbal information, incapable of being transcribed into the record by the court stenographer, significantly influences the fact finder\u2019s determinations. After reviewing the police officers\u2019 suppression hearing testimony, we find that the court of appeals\u2019 position cannot be maintained. The record is simply not as unequivocal as the appellate court believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\"><em>Alabama v. White </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301, heavily relied on by the court of appeals in reversing defendant\u2019s conviction, presents facts bearing some resemblance to the facts of the case <em>sub judice. </em>Both cases concern a police officer\u2019s reliance on tips given by an anonymous informant involving drugs. However, unlike the case <em>sub judice </em>where defendant\u2019s car had already been lawfully stopped for a traffic violation, the anonymous tip in <em>White </em>formed the basis for stopping a car being driven by the defendant. In <em>White, </em>an anonymous individual phoned the police department and informed it that \u201cVanessa White\u201d would be leaving a certain apartment at a particular time. She would be driving a brown Plymouth station wagon with a broken right taillight lens to a specific motel with about an ounce of cocaine in her possession. Police arrived at the designated apartment, observed a woman get in the station wagon, and then followed her as she drove the most direct route to the motel identified by the caller. Police stopped the vehicle just short of its destination and informed White that she had been stopped for suspected cocaine possession. After White consented to the search of the vehicle, the officers discovered cocaine and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The issue in <em>White </em>was whether the anonymous tip exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop. In resolving this issue, the court applied the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach (which had been adopted as a test for probable cause in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>[1983], 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to decisions involving the less demanding standard of reasonable suspicion. The court observed that, under the facts of the case, \u201csignificant aspects of the informer\u2019s predictions\u201d had been independently corroborated by the police in the course of following the defendant. <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. at 332, 110 S.Ct. at 2417, 110 L.Ed.2d at 310. This \u201cimparted some degree of reliability to the other allegations made by the caller.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>Id. </em>The court observed that the anonymous informant\u2019s tip under this set of facts generated reasonable suspicion because the informant was able to accurately predict White\u2019s <em>\u201cfuture </em>behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The court of appeals\u2019 reliance on <em>White </em>is misplaced. Initially, it is important to emphasize that the court in <em>White </em>did not depart from its well-established \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. <em>White </em>does not establish a categorical rule conditioning a <em>Terry </em>stop (when police are acting on an anonymous tip) on corroboration of predictive information. The critical inquiry is more broadly focused on the existence of reasonable suspicion, as the following language from <em>White </em>indicates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cReasonable suspicion, like probable cause, is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability. Both factors\u2014 quantity and quality \u2014 are considered in the \u2018totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture]\u2019 \u201d <em>White, </em>496 U.S. at 330, 110 S.Ct. at 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d at 309.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Unlike the defendant in <em>White, </em>Evans was subjected to a stop because of a traffic violation. The police officers\u2019 testimony at the suppression hearing clearly reveals that they were authorized to stop defendant\u2019s car because they witnessed him driving with only one operable headlight, a violation of R.C. 4513.04. Since the reason for the traffic stop was a violation of traffic laws, the court of appeals erred in finding <em>White </em>was the controlling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Even if we were to draw the same factual inferences from the officers\u2019 suppression hearing testimony as did the court of appeals \u2014 that the pat-down search was motivated <em>solely </em>by the information received by the radio broadcast\u2014 we would conclude that a rational trier of fact could find that the officers had a reasonable suspicion to justify a <em>Terry </em>search. Here, a routine and innocuous stop for an equipment violation turned into a situation fraught with danger. While speaking to defendant in regard to the burned out headlight, both officers received a message over their portable radios that a person fitting defendant\u2019s description \u2014 a male wearing a red Reebok jogging suit and driving westbound on Glynn Road in a gray Datsun 280Z \u2014 had participated in a drug transaction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Being in close proximity to the officers, defendant may have even been alerted by this information. Because these details of the anonymous tip were corroborated by what the police officers had already observed, they were justified in suspecting that the remainder of the broadcast\u2019s information was accurate as well \u2014 namely, that defendant had been involved in a drug deal. \u201c[Reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause.\u201d <em>White, </em>496 U.S. at 330, 110 S.Ct. at 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d at 309. In this regard, we observe that while <em>this </em>anonymous informant\u2019s tip may not provide a sufficient basis either to arrest or to stop a car lawfully driven, it is certainly reliable enough to justify a pat-down search for weapons. The right to frisk is virtually automatic when individuals are suspected of committing a crime, like drug trafficking, for which they are likely to be armed. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 58, 554 N.E.2d 108. See, also, <em>United States v. Ceballos </em>(E.D.N.Y.1989), 719 F.Supp. 119, 126: \u201cThe nature of narcotics trafficking today reasonably warrants the conclusion that a suspected dealer may be armed and dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The court of appeals\u2019 opinion implies that a critical factor in determining whether the officer had reasonable suspicion that the detainee was armed is whether the officer is in fear for his or her safety. We disagree. The following language from <em>United States v. Tharpe </em>(C.A.5, 1976), 536 F.2d 1098, is on point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201cWe know of no legal requirement that a policeman must feel \u2018scared\u2019 by the threat of danger. Evidence that the officer was aware of sufficient specific facts as would suggest he was in danger satisfies the constitutional requirement. <em>Terry </em>cannot be read to condemn a pat-down search because it was made by an inarticulate policeman whose inartful courtroom testimony is embellished with assertions of bravado, so long as it is clear that he was aware of specific facts which would warrant a reasonable person to believe he was in danger. Under the familiar standard of the reasonable prudent man, no purpose related to the protective function of the <em>Terry </em>rule would be served by insisting on the retrospective incantation T was scared.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cSome foolhardy policemen will never admit fear. Conversely, reliance on such a litany is necessarily prone to self-serving rationalization by an officer after the fact. It would be all too easy for any officer to belatedly recite that he was scared in situations where he neither had any reason to be scared, nor was indeed seared. * * * \u201d <em>United States v. Tharpe, supra, </em>536 F.2d at 1101, overruled on other grounds, <em>United States v. Causey </em>(C.A.5, 1987), 834 F.2d 1179.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Therefore, had the radio broadcast been the sole reason behind the officer\u2019s pat down of defendant, the limited search would have been lawful and evidence subsequently discovered would not be subject to the sanction of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Our final task concerns the scope of the pat down conducted by the police. Because the court of appeals held that the officers did not have the authority to frisk defendant for weapons, it did not answer that question. As we have held the officers were entitled to pat down defendant for weapons, we must address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Under <em>Terry </em>and its progeny, the police may search only for weapons when conducting a pat down of the suspect. \u201cA search for weapons in the absence of probable cause to arrest, however, must, like any other search, be strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation. * * * Thus it must be limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others nearby * * <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 25-26, 88 S.Ct. at 1882, 20 L.Ed.2d at 908. The protective pat down under <em>Terry </em>is limited in scope to this protective purpose and cannot be employed by the searching officer to search for evidence of crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Adams, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 146, 92 S.Ct. at 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d at 617. Obviously, once the officer determines from his sense of touch that an object is not a weapon, the pat-down frisk must stop. The officer, having satisfied himself or herself that the suspect has no weapon, is not justified in employing <em>Terry </em>as a pretext for a search for contraband. The specific question raised by the facts of this appeal concerns what future actions are permissible under <em>Terry </em>if the searching officer is unable to determine from the pat down that the suspect is not carrying a weapon.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>In answering this question, it is important first to emphasize that <em>Terry </em>does not require that the officer be absolutely convinced that the object he feels .is a weapon before grounds exist to remove the object. At the same time, a hunch or inarticulable suspicion that the object is a weapon of some sort will not provide a sufficient basis to uphold a further intrusion into the clothing of a suspect. When an officer removes an object that is not a weapon, the proper question to ask is whether that officer reasonably believed, due to the object\u2019s \u201csize or density,\u201d that it could be a weapon. 3 LaFave, Search and Seizure (2 Ed.1987) 521, Section 9.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u201cUnder the better view, then, a search is not permissible when the object felt is soft in nature. If the object felt is hard, then the question is whether its \u2018size or density\u2019 is such that it might be a weapon. But because \u2018weapons are not always of an easily discernible shape,\u2019 it is not inevitably essential that the officer feel the outline of a pistol or something of that nature. Somewhat more leeway must be allowed upon \u2018the feeling of a hard object of substantial size, the precise shape or nature of which is not discernible through outer clothing,\u2019 which is most likely to occur when the suspect is wearing heavy clothing.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Officer Travano testified that, upon patting down defendant, he discovered a \u201clarge bulk\u201d in the left front pocket which \u201cfelt like a rock substance.\u201d The following dialogue occurred between the officer and the defense attorney on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">\u201cQ. There was no question there wasn\u2019t a weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201cA. At the time, to be honest with you, I didn\u2019t know due to the fact of the big wad because he had like a thousand some dollars on him all in the same pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">\u201cQ. But what I am saying is, when you felt his pocket, you knew it wasn\u2019t a gun, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">\u201cA. Yes, I knew it wasn\u2019t a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">\u201cQ. And it would be accurate to say you knew it wasn\u2019t a knife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">\u201cA. I couldn\u2019t say that because I\u2019ve seen knives come in all shapes and sizes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">We conclude that Officer Travano acted within the scope of <em>Terry </em>in reaching into defendant\u2019s pocket to retrieve the object because it was reasonable for him to believe the object could be a weapon. Here, through his sense of touch as well as his experience on the police force, Officer Travano was unable to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the object was not a knife or other weapon. \u201cIf by touch the officer remains uncertain as to whether the article producing the bulge might be a weapon, he is entitled to remove it.\u201d <em>United States v. Oates </em>(C.A.2, 1977), 560 F.2d 45, 62 (removal of an overstaffed wallet justified when the officer could not determine what caused the bulge by feeling it through defendant\u2019s outer clothing). Accordingly, we hold that when an officer is conducting a lawful pat-down search for weapons and discovers an object on the suspect\u2019s person which the officer, through his or her sense of touch, reasonably believes could be a weapon, the officer may seize the object as long as the search stays within the bounds of <em>Terry v.

While <em>Dickerson </em>and the case at bar both involve the reliability of the sense of touch of a police officer conducting a protective pat-down search, that is where the similarity ends. <em>Dickerson </em>answered the question whether police may enter a suspect\u2019s pockets during the course of a <em>Terry </em>pat down on the basis of something other than a belief that the individual is carrying a weapon. Drawing an analogy to the plain view doctrine, the court held that police, conducting a lawful Terry-type search, may seize nonthreatening contraband when its incriminating nature is \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d to the searching officer through his sense of touch. <em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2137, 124 L.Ed.2d at 345. In other words, the officer may not manipulate the object, which he has previously determined not to be a weapon, in order to ascertain its incriminating nature. This limitation on the \u201cplain feel\u201d exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment ensures that police will search only within the narrow parameters allowed for a Terry-type search.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Dickerson </em>has no relevance to circumstances, like the ones brought before our court, where personal safety is the reason behind the officer\u2019s entering the suspect\u2019s pocket.

Therefore, since Officer Travano removed this object in order to protect himself, the seizure cannot be struck down under <em>Dickerson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b578-10\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADo\">dissenting. I must respectfully dissent because the majority\u2019s analysis fails in two critical, interrelated respects. First, it is apparent from the testimony of the officers that they did not have a reasonable belief there was a weapon in Evans\u2019s left front pocket. Thus, the search of the interior of the pocket and the subsequent seizure of a small amount of cocaine went beyond the constitutional limits set by <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Second, and more important, the record is clear that the officer pressed beyond the limits of a <em>Terry </em>search when he put his hand into Evans\u2019s pocket and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>removed the contents because of his <em>suspicion </em>that the pocket contained drugs, not a weapon. Therefore, the constitutionality of the search of the interior of the pocket must be analyzed in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s very recent ruling in <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson </em>(1993), 508 U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334. In <em>Dickerson, </em>the court held that an officer must have probable cause, not just reasonable suspicion, to extend a <em>Terry </em>pat-down search for weapons into a search for contraband. I believe that <em>Dickerson </em>is dispositive of this matter, yet the majority relegates <em>Dickerson </em>to a footnote. A full analysis of <em>Dickerson </em>is contained <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The majority bases its decision on <em>Terry </em>and its progeny. There are three steps to a <em>Terry </em>analysis. First, to justify the investigatory stop the officer must have a reasonable suspicion that \u201ccriminal activity may be afoot.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d at 911. Next, <em>if </em>the officer <em>reasonably </em>believes the person \u201cmay be armed and presently dangerous,\u201d the officer may engage in a limited frisk comprised of a pat down of the person\u2019s <em>outer clothing </em>to discern whether the person is carrying a gun or other weapon so that the officer may proceed with the investigation without fear for the officer\u2019s safety. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884-1885, 20 L.Ed.2d at 911. Finally, the officer is permitted to proceed beyond this limited pat down of the outer clothing of the detained person only if the officer has a reasonable belief that the object he or she is reaching for is a weapon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The determination of whether the officer\u2019s belief is reasonable is an objective, not subjective, test. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 58, 60, 554 N.E.2d 108, 111. In other words the mere incantation of the magic words \u201cI believed the object was a weapon\u201d is not enough to make a warrantless search constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Applying the three steps of a <em>Terry </em>search to the present case, I agree with the majority that the initial stop for the broken headlight was permissible. However, I believe that there is support for the conclusion by the court of appeals that the officers never had a reasonable belief that Evans was armed and, thus, a pat-down search was inappropriate. I reach this conclusion based on a number of points raised by the majority, with which I agree. I agree that \u201c[a] <em>Mimms </em>order does not automatically bestow upon the police officer the authority to conduct a pat-down search for weapons\u201d and the officers must have \u201ca reasonable, <em>objective </em>basis for frisking defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) All must agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>that <em>Terry </em>requires that the officer reasonably conclude that \u201cthe individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is aimed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others * * <em>Id., </em>392 U.S. at 24, 88 S.Ct. at 1881, 20 L.Ed.2d at 908. The majority correctly notes that we have stated that an officer must have \u201ca reasonable suspicion that an individual is armed based on the totality of the circumstances * * *.\u201d <em>State v. Bobo </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 177, 524 N.E.2d 489, paragraph two of the syllabus. But be that as it may, these proper statements of the law do not lead the majority to a correct conclusion in this case. Surprisingly, the majority points to <em>no </em>evidence that the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that Evans was armed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">This leads me to conclude, as did the court of appeals, that the real motivation for the search was the radio broadcast and the real purpose of the search was to look for drugs. The majority appears to misunderstand or ignore the full significance of the radio broadcast and its effect on the actions of the police officers, a significance which Judge Harper understood full well in her opinion for the court of appeals. One can debate whether the radio broadcast was the real reason for the <em>Terry </em>pat-down search or whether the reason somehow involved a routine police procedure to frisk Evans before placing him in the back of the police car while the officers ran a computer check on his license and car registration. One can, perhaps, debate whether the radio broadcast, following a lawful stop, permitted a <em>Terry </em>pat-down frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>What cannot be debated, however, is the fact that the radio broadcast, referring to an alleged drug transaction, affected the officers\u2019 actions concerning the <em>extent </em>of the search of Evans. This can be seen from the testimony of both of the police officers. Officer Green testified that the real reason for the search was the radio broadcast. Officer Travano stated that he conducted an extended search because of the radio broadcast\u2019s reference to drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Officer Green testified concerning police practice with regard to persons who have been stopped on minor traffic violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cQ. They don\u2019t arrest on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t take people out of the car and search them for that also, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">\u201cQ. And the sole purpose of taking him out of the car and frisking him was based on the alleged information you received from the radio broadcast, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">\u201cQ. <em>Would it be safe to say, but for the radio broadcast, you would have never taken him out of the car, out of the car and patted him down. That would be accurate, wouldn\u2019t it?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">\u201cA. <em>Correct.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">After this testimony during cross-examination, on redirect Officer Green testified that the reason he initially asked Evans to get out of the car was because Evans did not have his driver\u2019s license and that he would have searched him for this reason also. <em>The trial court made its own inquiry to clarify the officer\u2019s testimony:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-16\">\u201cQ. <em>The question, Officer, is what was the reason on this very occasion that you did conduct the search on the gentleman.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-17\">\u201cA. <em>On this particular occasion the reason he was searched, it was due to the radio broadcast.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-18\">Officer Travano repeatedly testified that he intended to conduct a more extensive search than a <em>Terry </em>pat-down frisk because of the radio broadcast. In reality, Officer Travano intended to conduct two searches: one, a <em>Terry </em>pat-down frisk for weapons which he justified on the basis that Evans would be placed in the back of the police vehicle while the officers ran a computer check on his license and car registration and, two, a more extensive search for contraband because of the information contained in the radio broadcast. Officer Travano testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKa-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u201cA. Before we put anybody in the police car, we do a weapon search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">\u201cQ. Do you do a search for anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">\u201cA. If our call is <em>like </em>\u2014 depending <em>on the call. If it is drug related, </em>the search could possibly be more extensive due to the fact we checked the back seat of the police car before and after we put somebody in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\"><em>\u201cSo if the call came over that narcotics were involved </em>or any kind of contraband, there would be a <em>more, you know, search </em>I would say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In a series of questions to Travano by the prosecutor concerning the practice of detaining persons who do not have a driver\u2019s license with them, the prosecutor asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201cQ. * * * Would you normally search that person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">\u201cQ. And the purpose of doing that, would it be necessarily for a weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">\u201cQ. Would it be for anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-13\">\u201cA. Like I stated, <em>depending on the call. </em>You know, <em>especially if there\u2019s contraband possibly involved.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-14\">\u201cQ. In this particular instance, was there an indication of contraband being involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-15\">\u201cA. By the radio broadcast, yes. It gave us reason to believe that this male possibly had some contraband on his person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-16\">Subsequently, in response to questions from defense counsel, Travano testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-17\">\u201cQ. Now, you also said that <em>at certain times you do more extensive searches than others.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-18\">\u201cA. Yes. Right. <em>Right, based on the probable cause and plus the radio broadcast. </em>Our <em>suspicion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-19\">\u201cQ. Your <em>suspicion?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-20\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-21\">\u201cQ. And the radio broadcast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-22\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-23\">Although Officer Travano denied that the radio broadcast \u201ctriggered\u201d the search, it is apparent that the radio broadcast affected the <em>scope </em>of the search. Travano intended to engage in an extended search for the purpose of finding contraband. But <em>Terry </em>permits only a \u201cstrictly circumscribed\u201d search, <em>id., </em>392 U.S. at 25, 88 S.Ct. at 1882, 20 L.Ed.2d at 908, the purpose of which \u201cis not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence * * <em>Adams v. Williams </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Officer Travano\u2019s testimony describing the actual search confirms that he went into Evans\u2019s pocket not because he had a reasonable belief there was a weapon in the pocket, but because he suspected there were drugs in the pocket. To reach its contrary conclusion, the majority resorts to a selective editing of the actual testimony. The majority appears to distort the testimony when it states that the officer \u201cupon patting down defendant, [Officer Travano] discovered a \u2018large bulk\u2019 in the left front pocket which \u2018felt like a rock substance.\u2019 \u201d The actual testimony of the officer was: \u201cUpon patting down the defendant over there, there was a large bulk in his pocket. While feeling the left front pocket, it felt like a rock substance might be in his pocket. That is when I dug in his pocket and I pulled out a large wad of money. On top of that was a little packet which was a white substance believed to be crack cocaine.\u201d The officer never testified, as the majority states, that the <em>large bulk </em>felt like a rock substance. Instead, it is apparent from the officer\u2019s testimony that he is describing two separate items: a large bulk <em>and </em>a rock substance. We also know from the officer\u2019s testimony that the large bulk was money. A wad of money is a soft object. <em>The majority states a rule it chooses not to follow: </em>\u201c \u2018Under the better view, then, a search is not permissible when the object felt is soft in nature.\u2019 \u201d The second object, the rock substance, we know from the officer\u2019s testimony was a little packet believed to be crack cocaine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Again, according to the majority\u2019s own rule, </em>\u201c \u2018[i]f the object felt is hard, then the question is whether its \u201csize or density\u201d is such that it might be a weapon.\u2019 \u201d It is not objectively reasonable to believe, as <em>Terry </em>and its progeny require, that a little packet of rock substance might be a weapon. The purpose of <em>Terry </em>is to protect the officer from danger. Not even the majority can suggest that the officers were in danger from an object so small.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Despite the majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[o]ur holding today does not authorize the removal of a soft object that the officer knows or reasonably should know is not itself a weapon on the grounds that it may contain a small weapon such as a razor blade,\u201d that is indeed what the majority has done.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Since the officer\u2019s intrusion into Evans\u2019s pocket was not justified under <em>Terry </em>as a pat-down search for weapons, it remains to determine whether it was</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>justified under the \u201cplain feel\u201d exception recognized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dickerson. </em>Because of its direct relevance to the disposition of this case, as stated above, I will discuss <em>Dickerson </em>in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In <em>Dickerson, </em>the Minnesota Supreme Court had ruled that the seizure of a small packet of cocaine from the defendant\u2019s pocket during a <em>Terry </em>pat-down search was unconstitutional for two reasons: First, the court refused to recognize a \u201cplain feel\u201d exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment and, second, even if such an exception existed, the intrusion into the defendant\u2019s pocket was outside the permissible scope of <em>Terry. </em>The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court. The court disagreed with the Minnesota Supreme Court concerning recognition of a .plain feel exception, but agreed that the search exceeded the limits of <em>Terry </em>and was therefore unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In rendering its decision, the Supreme Court again reviewed the requirements of <em>Terry </em>and its progeny. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">\u201cTime and again, this Court has observed that searches and seizures \u2018 \u201c \u2018conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 One such exception was recognized in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), which held that \u201cwhere a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot\u2019 the officer may briefly stop the suspicious person and make \u2018reasonable inquiries\u2019 aimed at confirming or dispelling his suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\"><em>\u201cTerry </em>further held that \u2018[w]hen an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others,\u2019 the officer may conduct a patdown search \u2018to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon.\u2019 \u2018The purpose of this limited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence * * <em>Rather, a protective search </em>\u2014 permitted <em>without a warrant and on the basis of reasonable suspicion less than probable cause </em>\u2014 must <em>be strictly \u2018limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others nearby.\u2019 </em>If the protective search goes beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed, it is no longer valid under <em>Terry </em>and its fruits will be suppressed.\u201d (Emphasis added and citations omitted.) <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2135-2136, 124 L.Ed.2d at 343-344.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The Supreme Court then considered whether a plain feel exception could be analogized to the plain view exception. Under the plain view exception, \u201cif police are lawfully in a position from which they view an object, if its incriminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>character is immediately apparent, and if the officers have a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize it without a warrant. * * * If, however, the police lack probable cause to believe that an object in plain view is contraband without conducting some further search of the <em>object </em>\u2014 i.e., if \u2018its incriminating character [is not] \u201cimmediately apparent,\u201d \u2019 * * * \u2014 the plain-view doctrine cannot justify its seizure.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2136-2137, 124 L.Ed.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The court found that there was an analogy between the plain view doctrine and \u201ccases in which an officer discovers contraband through the sense of touch during an otherwise lawful search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2137, 124 L.Ed.2d at 345. Just as with the plain view doctrine, the object\u2019s identity must be <em>\u201cimmediately apparent.\u201d </em>\u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that the officer have probable cause to believe that the item is contraband before seizing it ensures against excessively speculative seizures.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">The court then applied the above principles to the facts in <em>Dickerson. </em>The court found that \u201cthe dispositive question before this Court is whether the officer who conducted the search was acting within the lawful bounds marked by <em>Terry </em>at the time he gained probable cause to believe that the lump in respondent\u2019s jacket was contraband.\u201d <em>Dickerson </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2138, 124 L.Ed.2d at 347. The court agreed with the Minnesota Supreme Court that the officer \u201coverstepped the bounds of the \u2018strictly circumscribed\u2019 search for weapons allowed under <em>Terry. </em>* * * Where, as here, \u2018an officer who is executing a valid search for one item seizes a different item,\u2019 this Court rightly \u2018has been sensitive to the danger ... that officers will enlarge a specific authorization, furnished by a warrant or an exigency, into the equivalent of a general warrant to rummage and seize at will.\u2019 * * * [The search] therefore amounted to the sort of evidentiary search that <em>Terry </em>expressly refused to authorize, * * * and that we have condemned in subsequent cases.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Dickerson </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2138-2139, 124 L.Ed.2d at 347-348. This clear-cut holding is why I must offer my vigorous dissent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">The Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Dickerson </em>requires that we also find that the search into Evans\u2019s pocket was outside the strictly circumscribed limits of a <em>Terry </em>search. \u201cAlthough the officer [in Dickerson] was lawfully in a position to feel the lump in respondent\u2019s pocket, because <em>Terry </em>entitled him to place his hands upon respondent\u2019s jacket, the court below determined that the incriminating character of the object was not <em>immediately apparent </em>to him. Rather, the officer determined that the item was contraband only after conducting a further search, one not authorized by <em>Terry </em>or by any other exception to the warrant requirement. Because this further search of respondent\u2019s pocket was constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>tionally invalid, the seizure of the cocaine that followed is likewise unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Dickerson </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2139, 124 L.Ed.2d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">There is <em>no </em>testimony in this case that when the officer patted down Evans\u2019s front pocket it was <em>\u201cimmediately apparent\u201d </em>to him that either the soft wad or small rock substance items were drugs. The state must carry the burden of proof to show that the warrantless search and seizure were constitutionally permissible. <em>Xenia v. Wallace </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 216, 524 N.E.2d 889, paragraph two of the syllabus. The officer had only a \u201csuspicion\u201d that the items in the pocket were contraband; <em>he did not have probable cause to believe that the items were contraband. </em>Therefore, under <em>Dickerson, </em>the intrusion into the pocket was unconstitutional as was the subsequent seizure of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">I fear that today\u2019s decision will cause the lower courts to grievously misapply\u2014 or, worse yet, feel no need to <em>apply </em>\u2014 Dickerson. A majority of this court evidently does not understand that the plain feel exception, like the plain view exception, requires probable cause. This is an error that the United States Supreme Court must quickly correct, lest the plain feel exception devour the probable cause rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Had I been in the majority I would have engaged in an independent analysis of the Ohio Constitution to determine whether our state Constitution would permit a plain feel exception. This decision particularly troubles me because other state supreme courts are analyzing their state constitutions and finding protections greater than the protections afforded under the United States Constitution. With this decision, the majority is not affording Ohio citizens even those rights which the United States Supreme Court recognizes under the United States Constitution. As Justice A.W. Sweeney said in his dissenting opinion in <em>State v. Smith </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 255, 268, 544 N.E.2d 239, 250, reversed (1990), 494 U.S. 541, 110 S.Ct. 1288, 108 L.Ed.2d 464:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cWhile we as a society must endeavor to deal with the scourge of illegal drugs in a quick and effective manner, we must never sanction a solution that dispenses with the constitutional guarantees and personal liberties that have made ours the most enduring government on the face of the Earth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">For all these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b586-9\">A.W. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\">. For a discussion of the application of this standard, see 3 LaFave, Search and Seizure (2 Ed.1987) 521, Section 9.4(C), and Katz, Ohio Arrest, Search and Seizure (3 Ed.1992) 244, Section 14.04. The majority recognizes this standard in paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b580-5\">. The majority justifies the search on two separate, independent grounds: (1) police procedure to frisk individuals for weapons prior to placing them in the back seat of the cruiser, and (2) the radio broadcast description of a person who had allegedly engaged in a drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The majority focuses on the proffered policy of frisking suspects before placing them in the rear seat of the cruiser. This may be a reasonable police procedure, but the majority does not analyze whether it was reasonable to place Evans in the back of the cruiser while checking for a valid driver\u2019s license. I would conclude the officers did not need to place Evans in' the cruiser during such a check. As indicated by Officer Green\u2019s testimony, the officers did not actually consider Evans to be a threat while in his own car. Officer Green testified that Evans \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything to make me feel afraid of him, no.\u201d Moreover, there were two officers present. One officer could have stayed with Evans while the other officer went to the cruiser to obtain the information they sought. Such a check would, and apparently did, reveal that Evans did in fact have a valid driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">With regard to the second purported justification for the search, contrary to the conclusion of the majority, the radio broadcast did not provide the officers with the requisite reasonable belief that Evans was armed and dangerous so as to justify the search. The information available to the officers from the broadcast and from their own observations distinguishes this ease from <em>Alabama v. White </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 100 L.Ed.2d 301. In <em>White, </em>the information relayed in a telephone tip provided more details concerning the defendant\u2019s conduct than the radio broadcast in this case. Even if the radio broadcast justified <em>detaining </em>Evans it did not provide the officers with any reasonable belief that Evans was armed and dangerous. What the majority fails to emphasize about <em>White </em>is that the defendant in that case <em>consented </em>to the search after she was stopped by the police, which certainly is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\">. Officer Green agreed that it was \u201ca very small amount\u201d of cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\">. This is the very type of justification proffered by the police officer in this case. Officer Travano testified he knew the object was not a gun but did not know whether or not it was a knife \u201cbecause I\u2019ve seen knives come in all shapes and sizes.\u201d A blanket statement such as this, that anything could be a knife, does not meet the <em>objective </em>requirement that the officer have a <em>reasonable </em>belief the item could be a weapon. Acceptance of such a justification destroys even the illusion that there are constitutional limits to a <em>Terry </em>pat-down search.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
