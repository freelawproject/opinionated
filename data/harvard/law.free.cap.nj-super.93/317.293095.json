The several charges made at that time alleged that Patrolman Massey:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">OASE NO. 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u2018\"\u00ae * * prior to his appointment to the Newark Police Dejtartment * * * did co-sign a note the balance being $460.21.

M. on the southwest corner of Broad and Market Streets, the location of a police call box, upon being questioned by Sergeant Bernard O\u2019Leary, his Superior Officer, relative to his absence from post, did respond by willfully and contemptuously slamming the door of said call box.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">(b) \u201c* * * on November 1, 1964, while assigned to the intersection of Broad Street and Market Street, from 4:00 P. M. to 12:00 m., did, without just cause or proper authority, absent himself from said assigned fixed post from about 10 :50 P. M. to about 11:00 r.

M., having received a lawful order from Sergeant Bernard O\u2019Leary his Superior Officer, to submit a report at the eonipletiou of his assigned tour of duty, relative to his alleged absence from said assigned post, did willfully fail and neglect to comply with such order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">(d) \u00ab# * * oa November 2, 19(&gt;t, at or about 12:05 A. M., in the First Precinct station did behave with disrespect toward Lieutenant John B. Dunsmuir, desk officer, in that he did disrespectfully toss two blank report sheets on the business desk, behind which Lieutenant Dunsmuir' was present, and contemptuously stated to him, \u2018Tell Sergeant O'Leary, I was on post and I\u2019m not going to submit any <em>reports,\u2019 </em>or words to that effect, and further stated, disrespectfully and contemptuously, T quit, shove the job up your * * *, I\u2019ve been writing since I came here,\u2019 or words to that effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">(e) <em>\u201c* </em>* * on November 2, 1964 in the First Precinct station, at or about 12:10 A. m., did willfully and wrongfully toss a firearm, to wit: his fully loaded police service revolver, on the counter of the business desk, under circumstances suelvas to endanger human life.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>(f) \u201c* * * on November 2, 1964, in the First Precinct station, at or about 12:10 a. m., did, contrary to good order and discipline, willfully and disrespectfully, toss liis service revolver on the business desk, behind which Lieutenant John B.

In doing so he followed <em>Town of West New York v. Bock, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>500, 526 (1962), in which a six-month limitation on suspension, <em>R. S. </em>11:15-6, was held to be a policy mandate of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">On appeal to the Civil Service Commission, Massey was again found guilty of all charges, but the penalty was reduced to a suspension for six months. The matter was reviewed by the Commision on a stipulated record which included, primarily, a transcript of the testimony of witnesses at the hearing conducted by the police director. While purely formal proof may always be stipulated or presented to the Commission on an agreed record, if the weight of testimony must be evaluated, credibility decided, and impressions as to candor and forthrightness received, the agency \u201cshould have the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses.\u201d <em>Moorestown Tp. v. Armstrong, </em>89 <em>N. J. Super. </em>560, 565 <em>(App. Div. </em>1965), certification denied 47 <em>N. J. </em>80 (1966). See also <em>Town of West New York v. Bock, supra, </em>38 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>507, <em>n. </em>1; <em>R. S. </em>11:22-39. Here, we have a statement by the attornejr for Massey before the Commission that \u201cwe do not quarrel with the findings of guilt by the Director * <em>* </em>*. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>is our contention that the penalty was harsh and too severe.\u201d In essence, the appeal to the Commission was a plea for clemency and reinstatement based on the record of the departmental proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The Commission plainly considered the several offenses vliich occurred on November 1 and 2, 1964 as contemporaneous acts of misconduct constituting a singlo malefaction. Its decision concluded with the statement that, \u201cTechnically, they might he deemed separate and distinct. In fact, they were not.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">There was an adequate lapse of time, between the episode of insubordination and contemptuous attitude toward Sergeant O\u2019Leary and the subsequent acts of disrespect and misconduct manifested before Lieutenant Dunsmuir, for Massey to have \u201ccooled off\u201d and reflected upon the seriousness of his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The sergeant testified that Massey was absent from his assigned post at Broad and Market Streets on the night of November j, 1964 for approximately 25 minutes and refused to give any reason for such absence; he also refused, at the close of his tour of duty, to submit a report with respect thereto, as requested by the sergeant. The reasons advanced at the municipal hearing were not convincing. The director stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe what he [Massey ] said.\u201d When his counsel characterized the charges against his client as \u201crather trivial,\u201d the director explained the necessity for constant police protection against street crimes at that location, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u201cThe minute we put a policeman there in uniform that was deterrent enough to stop ninety-nine percent of them. * * Now, as to him being tired and that he has to contend with pe.ople, this is the job of a policeman and discipline is a primary and basic consideration that a policeman must have. We are a semi-military organization, and without discipline and without respect for your superior, whether you like him or not, we cannot have a police department, and I must have one.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The conduct of Massey in leaving his post, like that of the suspended policeman in <em>City of Asbury Park v. Depart</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>ment of Civil Service, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>419 (1955), indicated \u201can attitude of mind and approach, to the obligation of his office fundamentally at variance with his sworn duty.\u201d At <em>pp. </em>429-430. In that case, Civil Service reversed the decision of the city manager, but our Supreme Court overruled the Commission and reinstated a six months\u2019 suspension without pay. In <em>Eisberg v. Borough of Cliffside Park, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>260 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1922), an officer was dismissed from the local police force for failure to \u201cring in to headquarters from certain specified police boxes * * The penalty was sustained by our former Supreme Court and, on appeal, abandoned by default, a judgment of affirmance was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Massey\u2019s original offense was compounded by his subsequent defiance of the orders properly issued by his sergeant and later by his lieutenant to make out a report immediately as to his \u201cwhereabouts.\u201d Generalty, insubordination warrants a dismissal. See 4 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed. </em>1949), \u00a7 12.240, <em>p. </em>272. <em>State v. Naglee, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>209, 221 (1965), jurisdiction postponed, appeal on the merits pending <em>sub nom. Garrity v. New Jersey, </em>383 <em>U. S. </em>941, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1194, 16 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>205 (1966) (case argued November 10, 1966, 385 <em>U. S. </em>-, \u2014, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>616, 17 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d-,-), involved an officer who failed to cooperate in an investigation of his official conduct, and it was held that his actions were inconsistent with his police duties and that he was properly subjected to dismissal. The obligation to cooperate \u201cis intrinsic to the position of a police officer.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">A patrolman was charged, <em>inter alia, </em>in a New York ease, with a refusal to obey the order of his superior officers to return to his post. The court concluded that such behavior, standing alone, constituted insubordination which \u201cnot only justified but required his dismissal from the force.\u201d <em>Krause v. Valentine, </em>268 <em>App. Div. </em>788, 48 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>901, 902 <em>(App. Div. </em>1944). See also <em>McCain v. Sheridan, </em>160 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>174, 324 <em>P. 2d </em>923 <em>(D. Ct. App. </em>1958), where appellant, who refused to comply with an order of the police chief to complete a polygraph test, was found guilty of insubordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>nation, disobedience and conduct unbecoming a police officer. The court there said, \u201cRefusal to carry out a valid order concodedly would be ground for dismissal,\u201d and then made the observation, \u201cThe efficiency of our system of administration of justice depends, in large part, upon police officers\u2019 faithful discharge of the trust reposed in them. * * <em>* </em>Whatever weakens that trust tends to destroy our system of law enforcement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>160 <em>Cal. App. 2d, </em>at <em>pp. </em>176, 177, 324 <em>P. 2d, </em>at <em>pp. </em>925, 926. Accord, <em>In re Emmons, </em>63 <em>N. J. Super. </em>136, 140 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The disrespect that Massey manifested toward his superiors was subversive of discipline and was conduct unbecoming a police officer. Note <em>Alcutt v. Board of Police Commissioners, </em>66 <em>N. J. L. </em>173 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1901), affirmed o. b. 67 <em>N. J. L. </em>351 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1902). As the director pointed out, a police force and its responsible officers in many respects constitute a military-type organization and discipline must be enforced. See 16 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed., </em>revised 1963), \u00a7 45.16, <em>p. </em>675, and Gourley, \u201cPolice Discipline,\u201d 41 <em>J. Crim. L., C. &amp; P. S. </em>85, 86 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Additionally, Massey was charged with the offense of tossing a loaded service revolver on liis lieutenant\u2019s desk, an incident plainly detached from his earlier demonstration of resentment toward liis sergeant. The Commission dismissed that charge with the comment that \u201cthe record shows clearly that the revolver could not have gone off because it contained a safety lock which was functioning properly.\u201d However, on cross-examination, Lieutenant Dunsmuir testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201cQ. In other words, you cun pull this hammer back as far as it will go without catching and let it go, like that, and there would be no firing of the revolver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">A. Let me see how you did that again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">Q. Pull the hammer back as far as it will go without catching'\u2014I mean, not this way. A. I wouldn\u2019t want to try it the way you are doing it. It could possibly go off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">Q. This is loose here and I think it\u2019s made for that purpose, right? A. Yes. Tf you drop it now, I believe that gun will discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Q. Shall we try it? All right. A. I\u2019d also like to add that there is certain procedures in the handling of firearms that all officers should follow; safety procedures, and he [Masses'] did not handle his firearm using those safety procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The careless handling of a loaded revolver by any person in the presence of another is inexcusable; <em>a fortiori </em>by a law enforcement officer who should have the temperament and training always to respect its potentiality for danger, even if the safety mechanism be property positioned. In <em>City of Newark v. Civil Service </em>Commission, 115 <em>N. J. L. </em>26 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), an off-duty patrolman, while engaging in \u201cgood natured raillerj',\u201d thought he had ejected all the bullets from his service pistol, but there was one remaining which discharged, mortally wounding a friend. The Civil Service Commission sustained a charge of misconduct against the officer but reduced the penalty of removal imposed by the director to a suspension without pay. On appeal the court held: \u201cThe drastic action taken by the director of public safety was fully warranted by the facts.\u201d At <em>p. </em>32.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The necessity for utmost competency and strict adherence to safety procedures by police officers, with respect to firearms, is emphasized by the decisions imposing civil liability upon municipalities for the negligence of their employees. See <em>Peer v. City of Newark, </em>71 <em>N. J. Super. </em>12 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certification denied 36 <em>N. J. </em>300 (1962), a tort action predicated upon alleged inadequate training of a policeman, which resulted in a judgment for substantial damages against the city. Those in charge of maintaining a competent police force in a municipality exposed to such liability must be continuously vigilant in the fulfillment of their supervisory obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In disciplinary actions, when an officer has been adjudged guilty of misconduct, the penalty, determined by the department head \u201cupon whom, in the final analysis, rests the responsibility of sedulously maintaining departmental morale and discipline and adequate standards of service,\u201d should not be disturbed unless the discipline visited upon the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>victed offender is so \"utterly disproportionate to the offense\u2019\u2019 as to amount to a clear abuse of discretion. <em>City of Newark v. Civil Service Commission, supra, </em>115 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>pp. </em>30, 31. The director of a police force has a duty to \u201crid his department of irresponsible members.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at <em>p. </em>32. And see <em>Moorestown Tp. v. Armstrong, supra, </em>where a patrolman was removed from office by the township, the penalty was reduced by Civil Service to six months\u2019 suspension without pay, and this court reversed the Commission reinstating the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Commission should bear in mind, as stated in <em>Borough of Park Ridge v. Salimone, </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>28, 44 (1956), that the primary object and purpose of the civil service law is to secure for government, at its various levels and in all its many functions, efficient public service\u2014\u201cThe welfare of the people as a whole, and not specifically or exclusively the welfare of the civil servant, is the basic policy underlying the law.\u201d The provisions of such laws, as they relate to discharge or removal, \u201care designed to prevent the disturbance of the system, not to benefit individuals in the service except as it may assure them of a recognition of faithful and capable conduct.\u201d 4 <em>McQuillin, op. cit., </em>\u00a7 12.247, <em>p. </em>286. Note <em>Maxwell v. Board of Com\u2019rs of City of Wildwood, </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>181, 186 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1933), affirmed o. b. 113 <em>N. J. L. </em>404 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934). <em>Cf. City of Plainfield v. Simpson, </em>50 <em>N. J. Super. </em>250, 259-260 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We are convinced that the original penalty of removal imposed upon Massey was not excessive but, to the contrary, was appropriate and justified. We perceive no valid basis to support the Commission in minimizing the seriousness of the charges and in modifying the penalty. The police director\u2019s order of dismissal should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
