Based thereon, we have come to the conclusion that plaintiff did not sustain its burden of proving the ordinance arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Basic to the trial judge\u2019s decision was this finding, made in the trial judge\u2019s comprehensive opinion under the heading \u201cSuitability of Land\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201cAt the trial before rue plaintiff adduced credible testimony to the effect that the most appropriate use of the Mountain Ridge District is for low density garden apartments, that otherwise the land is likely to go undeveloped since it is entirely rockbound, that it cannot be used for one-family residences, and that, in any event, such residential development is unlikely since it is costly and the mass of apartments partially surrounding the area would deter property owners from developing one-family residences. To the extent that defendant\u2019s witnesses contradicted plaintiff\u2019s witnesses on this issue or otherwise testified that these lands could be used for one-family residences that testimony is discredited. This discrediting is predicated, <em>inter alia, </em>on my observation of defendant\u2019s witnesses and their demeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">We find that the evidence does not support the finding that the land \u201ccannot be used for one-family residences,\u201d or \u201cis likely to go undeveloped\u201d or that the apartments are so near to plaintiff\u2019s land or so situate that they make the land unsalable for one-family residences. It is doubtless true that plaintiff\u2019s land is rocky and that the cost of digging a cellar in it would be greater than in average soil. However, no figures were given of the actual comparative costs, or the economically permissible relation of such costs to the value of the land if sold for residential use. It is possible to sell residential plots for a price fair to the seller even when the soil presents problems such as rock or water. There was no proof that these lots could not be so sold. Beyond this, there was no proof that homes could not be built without cellars on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>land and sold at a fair profit. <em>Cf. Guaclides v. Borough of Englewood Cliffs, </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>405 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We have examined the other reasons given by the trial judge for his decision, but we find the record does not justify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
