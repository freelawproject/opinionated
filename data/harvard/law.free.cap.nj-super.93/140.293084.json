A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AJC\">The State by leave of court appeals from an order of the County Court ordering that a \u201cMotion to Suppress Evidence be * * * granted.\u201d The evidence consisted of a -quantity of heroin and associated narcotics paraphernalia intended to be used by the State in the trial of defendants upon a joint indictment for possession of a narcotic drug. <em>B. S. </em>24:18-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">At the hearing on defendants\u2019 motion, only two witnesses testified. They were Hugh E. McNulty, Jr. and David McCummings, both members of the Newark Police Department narcotic squad. Their testimony established the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">On January 27, 1966, at 10 a. m., while these officers were investigating a possible narcotics violation in the building at 22-24 West Kenney Street, Newark, they saw defendant Charles Orr at the doorway of apartment D-9 located on the fourth floor of these premises. During the course of a conversation then had with McNulty, Orr stated that <em>\u201che </em>had been living in the apartment\u201d and that \u201che was going down to change his address right then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Thereupon the detectives returned to police headquarters and checked their narcotics files, from which they ascertained that Orr had not changed his address from his last-known residence, 581 Hunterdon Street, Newark. Knowing Orr to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>have been involved with narcotics and to be a person required to register a change of address within 24 hours under <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A :169A\u20146, they returned to his apartment at or about 12:40 p. m., specifically \u201cto affect the arrest of Orr for failure to change address\u201d (sic). However, the officers did not secure an arrest warrant for Orr, even though their office was in the same building as the municipal court which was in session at the time. They had no warrant for the arrest of Williams, whose presence was unanticipated, nor did they have any search warrant for the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On this second visit McNulty proceeded to Orr\u2019s apartment and McCummings remained downstairs in the vicinity of an alley which was overlooked by the windows of that apartment. This was done as a part of a preconceived \u201cplan\u201d on the part of the officers so that McCummings could \u201cascertain if anything was thrown out of the window.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">McNulty waited a couple of minutes and then knocked on the apartment door and announced \u201cIts McNulty. Open the door.\u201d Orr knew who McNulty was. Thereupon, \u201c[TJhere was a lot of commotion and running around and then the door was opened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Upon entering the apartment McNulty found only Orr and Williams therein and he \u201cmade\u201d them sit upon a bed. In open view upon a table the officer saw an eye dropper and a bottle cap, and on the floor was a plastic bag containing two hypodermic needles and other paraphernalia. McNulty further observed that a window overlooking the alley was open. However, when he entered the apartment neither defendant was near this window and he did not see either of them throw anything out of it. At or about this time McCummings came into the apartment and related what he had observed (hereinafter discussed), left and returned in a few moments with a package.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">McNulty had been in the building \u201ca couple of minutes\u201d when McCummings, who, as above noted, was stationed by the alley below, observed a white object \u201cthrown\u201d from the window of Orr\u2019s apartment and which landed in the alley. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>officer did not retrieve the package at that time because the entrance gate to the alley was locked, but he quickly went to Orr\u2019s apartment and informed McNulty of his observation. He then returned downstairs, entered the alley from the apartment building, and secured the \u201cpackage,\u201d which was a white napkin containing glassine envelopes in which was contained the heroin herein involved. McCummings then returned to the apartment with this evidence and at that time he observed the open window from which the napkin had been thrown.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The officers then took both defendants to headquarters and booked them for unlawful possession of hypodermic needles (a disorderly person offense) and for the crime of possession of narcotics. Orr was also charged with failing to register a change of address as a narcotics offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">After hearing, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion to suppress upon the ground that \u201cthe arrest of defendant Orr was illegal, and all evidence flowing from their illegal arrest is the fruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d The only evidence referred to by the court in its opinion was the \u201cglassine envelopes containing heroin.\u201d While the motion made by defendants is not reproduced in the appendix, counsel for both sides at oral argument agreed that the motion comprehended suppression not only of the heroin but also the paraphernalia found by the officers in Orr\u2019s apartment. Eor that reason, and in order to avoid delay, we shall consider on this appeal the admissibility of both the heroin and the paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The order of the trial court was based upon the theory that the arrest of Orr, being for a mere disorderly persons offense, was illegal because the offense was not committed in the presence of the officers and no arrest warrant had issued. The State first contends that the arrest of Orr although without a warrant, was nevertheless legal and valid, and therefore any search and seizure made incidental thereto was valid. It argues that Orr was guilty of a violation of <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A :169A-6, in that he failed timely to register a change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>address, and that even though this be a mere disorder!}7 persons offense they could arrest him without a warrant by virtue of the provisions of <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:169-3 because it was committed in the presence of the officers. The point is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\"><em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:169A-6 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201cIn event that any such person so registered shall change his place of address either within or without the State, he shall, within twenty-fonr hours thereafter, notify the chief of police of the municipality or the office of the State Police with which he is registered of his change of residence by description and street number, if any, in such manner as to identify the same. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> Assuming that the information in the officers\u2019 possession justified the belief that Orr had been living in his new abode for over 24 hours and therefore was guilty of a violation of the statute, we disagree with the State\u2019s contention that the offense was committed in the officers\u2019 presence. That notion is founded upon the subordinate premise that this was a continuing offense. We do not agree. The offense proscribed in the statute is not the changing of address or the day-to-day living at the new address. Bather, the offense is the failure to notify the police within 24 hours after moving. <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:169A\u20147. This offense would be consummated forthwith upon, and at the moment of, the expiration of the time limit set forth in the statute. The record fails to disclose when this occurred. Therefore the offense cannot be said to have occurred in the \u201cpresence\u201d of officers McNulty or McCummings. Thus, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:169-3 would not authorize either of them to arrest Orr on the stated charge without a warrant. For these reasons we agree with the trial court that <em>his </em>arrest for the violation of <em>N. J. S. </em>2A.T69A-6 without such a warrant was invalid and illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The rule is firmly established that evidence secured as a result of a search and seizure incidental to an unlawful arrest, and without a search warrant, will be suppressed and is not admissible in a subsequent trial of the person arrested. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Henry v. United States, </em>361 <em>U. S. </em>98, 80 <em>S. Ct. </em>168, 4 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>134 (1959); <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 <em>U. S. </em>471, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>407, 9 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>441 (1963). <em>Cf., State v. Smith, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>481, 492 (1962), <em>certiorari </em>denied 374 <em>U. S. </em>835, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1879, 10 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>1055 (1963); <em>State v. Doyle, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>334, 342 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The State does not dispute this doctrine but asserts that defendants\u2019 arrest was valid since it was based upon probable cause, and. therefore the officers \u201cmay legally embark upon an incidental search of defendant\u2019s person and premises.\u201d This position rests upon the contention that after the napkin was thrown McCummings or anyone else had a right to pick it up and examine the contents. Therefore, argues the State, it could reasonably be inferred that the officer had probable cause 'to believe that defendants had the narcotics in their possession, since they were the occupants of the apartment from which the napkin was ejected. This probable cause, postulates the State, arose independently from the acts of McNulty. This last thesis is essential to the State\u2019s position, since it is undeniable that if the State\u2019s acquisition of the package with the heroin was the causal product of the arrest transaction, the package and its contents were subject to suppression. See <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">While the record does not disclose the precise moment when the formal arrest took place, it clearly establishes that the arrest was made by McNulty, not by McCummings, and that it was made before the latter initially entered the apartment and advised the former that an object had been thrown, and certainly before he returned to the apartment with, the glassine envelopes. McNulty testified that he arrested defendants \u201cafter I had entered the apartment.\u201d He further testified that when he entered he \u201cmade Orr and Williams sit on a bed\u201d and that McCummings did not come into the apartment for the first time until \u201ca minute or two\u201d after he did, and that McCummings \u201csaw that everything was under control.\u201d This restraint of the persons of defendants and the restriction of their liberty of movement by McNulty almost immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>upon entering into the apartment constituted an arrest. <em>Doyle, supra, </em>42 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>342. The arrest having been made before McNulty knew of the existence of the glassine envelopes, the finding of the Latter could not have been the true cause for his arrest of defendants. Moreover, the record indicates that the'sole reason for Orr\u2019s arrest as well as for the second trip to the apartment, the knock on the door and the demand for admission, was the alleged violation of <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:169A-6. Thus we conclude that both the arrest and the intent to arrest preceded the search of the apartment and the finding of the narcotics. The search and its product having been the result of an illegal arrest, the separate arrest, if deemed such, for the narcotics offense cannot be justified by the incriminating product of the tainted search. <em>Cf., Doyle, supra, </em>42 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>342.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Even were it conceded that MeCumming\u2019s finding of the narcotics preceded, technically, the formal arrest of Orr and Williams, the same result must follow. The evidence supports a strong inference that the napkin was thrown out of the window after the knock on the door by McNulty and as a result thereof and of Orr\u2019s knowledge of McNulty\u2019s identity. The State conceded this at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In <em>State v. DeGrazio, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>268 (1963), the court affirmed the granting of a motion to quash a search warrant ant suppress resultant evidence. When police officers went to defendant\u2019s apartment with a defective search warrant for betting material, they stationed a policewoman outside the premises. She retrieved a paper bag which she saw thrown from defendant\u2019s window, which contained betting slips. The court held: \u201cThere is no question that under the precedents the contents of the bag were the fruit or product of the unconstitutional search and as such were inadmissible in evidence.\u201d (at <em>pp. </em>269-270)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The fact that in <em>DeGrazio </em>the bag was thrown \u201cat the time\u201d of the illegal search and that in the present case the object was thrown before McNulty entered the apartment does not alter the applicability of the rule enunciated in <em>DeGrazio. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The court in that case said that the constitutional design of <em>Mapp [Mapp v. </em>Ohio, 367 <em>U. S. </em>643, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>1684, 6 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>1081] undoubtedly dictates the exclusion of tangible materials obtained, as here, during or <em>as a ctirect result </em>of an unlawful infringement of the sanctity of the home\u201d (at <em>p. </em>271; emphasis added). Here, as above noted, it is conceded the napkin was thrown as a direct result of the knock on the door. McNulty came to defendant\u2019s apartment with the specific intent to arrest Orr for the alleged statutory offense, and for no other purpose. He knocked on the door of defendant\u2019s apartment in order to gain admission thereto for the purpose of making that arrest. That knock was an integral step in the attempted execution of the illegal arrest. <em>Cf., Work v. United </em>States, 100 <em>U. S. App. D. C. </em>237, 243 <em>F. 2d </em>660 <em>(D. C. Cir. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The court in <em>DeGrazio </em>cited a number of authorities in support of its conclusion (39 <em>N. </em>J., at <em>p. </em>270). Among them were <em>Hobson v. United </em>States, 226 <em>F. 2d </em>890 (8 <em>Cir. </em>1955), and <em>Beale v. </em>State, 230 <em>Md. </em>182, 186 <em>A. 2d </em>213 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In <em>Hobson </em>the defendant, as here, threw a package of heroin out of the window after the police had knocked, but before they gained admission to defendant\u2019s residence. The court found that the throwing was the direct result of the unlawful intrusion (illegal search) and that the contents of the package could not be received in evidence. The Government there argued that the heroin was obtained by voluntary disclosure of defendant and not as a result of search and seizure. The court in rejecting this argument said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">\u201cConsidering the total atmosphere of the case * * *, we can not separate the throwing of the package from the unlawful search. The defendant\u2019s action in throwing the package was not voluntary but was forced by the actions of the officers. That the officers anticipated such a result is evidenced by the fact that they stationed a man in the back yard to receive any person or evidence that might come out. The throwing of the package was directly caused by the actions of the officers. * * *\u201d (226 <em>F. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>894)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Likewise, in <em>Beale </em>the same result was reached, even though defendant threw the incriminating evidence out a window after the officer who illegally sought to arrest him rang defendant\u2019s bell, but before he gained admittance.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Finally, we find no support for the State\u2019s position from the fact that Orr opened the dor to his apartment and allowed McNulty to enter after the latter knocked and identified himself. Orr knew McNulty and knew he was a police officer. The entry was granted in submission to authority rather than as an understanding and intentional waiver of a constitutional right. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>333 <em>U. S. </em>10, 13, 68 <em>S. Ct. </em>367, 92 <em>L. Ed. </em>436 (1948). See <em>State v. King, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>346, 352-356 (1965), <em>State v. Parsons, </em>83 <em>N. J. Super. </em>430, 443 <em>(App. Div. </em>1964). The State has not argued to the contrary, either below or here.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Based on all of the above, we conclude that the search and seizure of both the heroin and the paraphernalia found in the apartment were incidental to an unlawful arrest and the product thereof. Therefore, all of this evidence must be suppressed and excluded from admission at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The State does not contest defendant Williams\u2019 standing to challenge the legality of the evidence. He was a guest in Orr\u2019s apartment and was indicted for possession of the heroin so seized. The State proposed to use this evidence against him. <em>State v. Parsons, supra, </em>83 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>443, <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 <em>U. S. </em>257, 267, 80 <em>S. Ct. </em>725, 4 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>697 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
