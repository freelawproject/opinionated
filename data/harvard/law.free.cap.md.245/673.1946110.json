Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478 (1964), this point will be dealt with separately. The Supreme Court has held in <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em>384 U. S. 719 (June, 1966) that the principles set forth in both <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (June, 1966) do not apply in cases, such as the applicant\u2019s, where the trial began before <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda </em>were decided. Moreover, no objection was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>to admission of the confession at trial, no appeal was taken from the resulting conviction, and the applicant\u2019s trial counsel testified that his client told him his confession was voluntary. In these circumstances, the applicant cannot now prevail on this point. Finally we point out that the applicant did not comply with the requirements of Rule BK 46 b and, barring unusual circumstances, not here present, this alone is ground for denial of the application. <em>Sturgis v. </em>Warden, 241 Md. 728 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
