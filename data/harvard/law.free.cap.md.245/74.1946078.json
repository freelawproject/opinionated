On appeal, the judgment and sentence were affirmed in <em>Ralph v. State, </em>226 Md. 480 (1961), <em>cert. denied, sub nom, Ralph v. Maryland, </em>369 U. S. 813 (1962). The applicant thereafter brought an application under the Maryland Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act and a federal habeas corpus application, both of which were denied. On a second federal habeas corpus application, Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland stayed execution to allow petitioner tO' raise a question of the retroactive application of <em>Schowgurow v. State, </em>240 Md. 121 (1965). Pursuant to that stay, applicant instituted a new application under the post conviction statute. Judge Kathryn Shook of the Montgomery County Circuit Court denied petitioner\u2019s application. He raised three contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">1. That the court should set aside applicant\u2019s indictment under the ruling in <em>Schowgurow v. State, 240 </em>Md. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">2. That the judges who tried him had been required to declare their belief in the existence of God.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">3. That a confession which was admitted in evidence against him should not have been admitted in view of <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The applicant\u2019s first contention has been rejected in <em>Young v. Warden, </em>245 Md. 76 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The second contention was fully disposed of by Chief Judge Thomsen\u2019s opinion in the habeas corpus proceeding, <em>Ralph v. Brough, </em>248 F. Supp. 334 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">The third contention has been laid to rest by <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em>384 U. S. 719, 16 L. Ed. 2d 882 (1966). Applicant\u2019s trial began long before June 22, 1964, the limit on retroactivity which has been established for <em>Escobedo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The dismissal of Ralph\u2019s application for post conviction relief will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
