He has appealed from the granting of a directed verdict in favor of the employer and its insurer by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County at the close of the claimant\u2019s case, thereby affirming the decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission against the claimant. The sole question in the case is whether a jury could reasonably find that the injury was \u201caccidental\u201d within the meaning of Code, Article 101, sec. 15 and, therefore, compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\">Mize, a carpenter of 31 years experience, was employed by Beauchamp in the construction of a concrete building. Carpenters were used to install a wooden framework (form) for the pouring of concrete, a type of work which Mize had done \u201cright much of\u201d in the course of his trade. On November 26 and 27, 1964, Mize\u2019s \u201cparticular job was to put up the framing for the roof\u201d of the building. This work was done in the following manner: a framework of parallel joists (beams), spaced 16 inches apart, was erected using 2\" x 4\"s or 4\" x 4\"s. Standing or kneeling on a joist, Mize would turn to receive pieces of plywood from a helper who would pass them from below or behind the carpenter. The plywood was then laid across the joist and secured to it, forming part of a deck, on which concrete later would be poured. Mize would then kneel on a different part of the joist, or on the finished decking, turn to receive more plywood and install it, thus adding to the deck. Where columns w~ere encountered, a \u201clow head\u201d or \u201cdrop head\u201d (a recessed level deck, four feet by five feet) was constructed around it, so that the rest of the decking was about five inches higher than the \u201cdrop head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">While constructing one of these drop heads, Mize turned to receive a piece of plywood and felt a sharp pain in his lower back. Mize testified that in laying out other drop heads on this job, the plywood had been \u201cshoved up from down below.\u201d At the time of the injury, the plywood was handed to him from behind, but Mize had been required to twist around to get plywood at other times either on the day of the injury or at other times on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ant, we believe, as did the court below, that a jury could not reasonably have found the injury to Mize\u2019s back was \u201caccidental.\u201d We have often reiterated our strict construction of tire term \u201caccidental injury\u201d: \u201c[It]n Maryland, unlike many other jurisdictions, the phrase \u2018accidental injury\u2019 does not include unexpected results not produced by accidental causes, and this Court consistently has held that for injury to be accidental it must result from some <em>unusual </em>strain or exertion of the employee or some <em>unusual </em>condition of the employment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). <em>Vaughan v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>229 Md. 547, 550-51, 184 A. 2d 842 (1962) and cases therein cited; <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Golombieski, </em>231 Md. 124, 188 A. 2d 923 (1963); <em>Kelly-Springfield Tire Co. v. Daniels, </em>199 Md. 156, 85 A. 2d 795 (1952); <em>Commercial Transfer Co. v. Quasny, </em>245 Md. 572, 227 A. 2d 20 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">On the evidence thus far discussed, unlike <em>Golombieski, supra, </em>a jury could not reasonably have found the injury to result from unusual exertion of the employee or some unusual condition of his employment. Mize, as his testimony shows conclusively, was thoroughly accustomed to turning to receive plywood. He was also completely familiar with the working conditions involved in constructing drop heads, although their construction required \u201ca little extra work\u201d compared to installing the rest of the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Introduced at trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> however, was the \u201cEmployers\u2019 First Report of Accident,\u201d which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\u201cWorking on roof, picked up 4 x 8 sheet of plywood. Wind caught plywood, and twisted Mr. Mize, hurtin [sic] his back. * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The report, signed by \u201cEdward L. Morris, Treasurer,\u201d tends to show that Mize\u2019s injury was caused by an unusual and unexpected strain. The following colloquy with respect to the report occurred at the Commission hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">\u201cCOMMISSIONER PAPER:* * * Now listen to me \u2014 * * * is this [report] true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u201cTHE WITNESS [Mize] : I had no part of that report so help me. I had no part. I didn\u2019t tell that to anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">\u201cMR. GEREL: Mr. Mize, listen to the Commissioner. Don\u2019t argue with anybody. He is asking you a question \u2014 just answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201cTHE WITNESS : I didn\u2019t have any part in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cCOMMISSIONER PAPER: You didn\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201cTHE WITNESS : No. I had no part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201cMR. GEREL: You didn\u2019t say the wind caught the piece of plywood twisting and hurting your back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">\u201cBY MR. GEREL: Q. Who is Edward L. Morris? Do you know him? * * * A. No. Unless it is one of the officers that works in the company\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">\u201cQ. You are not familiar with the office people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-15\">\u201cMR. GEREL: And what can you tell us about the weather that day ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-16\">\u201cTHE WITNESS : It was fairly calm that day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">No claim is made that the report is inadmissible, as not within the liberal business records exception to the hearsay rule, provided by statute. Code, 1957, Article 35, sec. 59. Cf. <em>Aravanis v. Eisenberg, </em>237 Md. 242, 262, 206 A. 2d 148 (1965). The information contained in the report is, without dispute, part of the evidence of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-18\">The general rule in workmen\u2019s compensation cases is that before a motion for directed verdict may be granted for the employer, the court must assume the truth of the evidence presented by the claimant and all the inferences of fact fairly deducible from it. <em>Coates v. J. M. Bucheimer Co., Inc., </em>242 Md. 198, 218 A. 2d 191 (1966) and cases therein cited. Where the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses is in direct conflict on a material issue of fact, the resolution of the factual conflict is usually left to the jury. <em>Ferguson v. Wootten, </em>240 Md. 186, 190-91, 213 A. 2d 498 (1965). This rule, however, was formu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>lated without consideration of the statute carving an exception for business records from the hearsay rule, without requiring production, or even identification, of the extrajudicial declarants who supplied the information. We think it necessary that the new liberality in the admission of hearsay evidence should be coupled with an increased willingness on the part of our courts to examine the finality of such evidence on the issue of sufficiency. See Weinstein, <em>Probative Force of Hearsay, </em>46 Iowa L. Rev. 331, 341-42, 350-52 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The only evidence tending to show Mize\u2019s injury was \u201caccidental\u201d was the accident report prepared by the company treasurer. The official was not produced at trial, so that he could be examined as to the sources of the information in the report, compare <em>Commercial Transfer Co. v. Quasny, supra, </em>or even so he could verify that the report was accurately made in the regular course of the employer\u2019s business. The description of the \u201caccident\u201d in the report was totally contradicted by the claimant\u2019s own testimony. Even though the admissibility of the hearsay statements contained in the report may not now be challenged, they emerged so inherently weak as to be legally insufficient to support a jury finding of \u201caccidental injury.\u201d Cf. <em>Danahy v. Cuneo, </em>130 Conn. 213, 216-17, 33 A. 2d 132 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-10\">. The report was introduced in evidence at the hearing before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, and the record before the Commission was, without objection, made part of the record at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
