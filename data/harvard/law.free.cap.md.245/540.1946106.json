On the first appeal, reported as <em>Fowler v. Benton, </em>229 Md. 571, this Court reversed the trial court\u2019s granting of a directed verdict for the defendant, Benton, and awarded the plaintiffs a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">The plaintiff-appellants are Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth L. Fowler and their eleven children. Mrs. Fowler, who is not a member of the bar, represented herself and her family in proper person at the trial below and on this appeal. On February 14, 1957, Mr. and Mrs. Fowler contracted with the defendant-appellee, Benton, a builder by trade, to purchase a partially completed house and lot owned by him in a subdivision known as Seabrook Acres in Prince George\u2019s County. Several months previously, at a time when the building plans for the house called for four bedrooms, Benton had installed on the property a septic tank system under a permit issued to him by the Prince George\u2019s County Health Department. The contract between Benton and the Fowlers provided that he make certain alterations in the second floor layout of the house to provide more sleeping accommodations for the Fowlers\u2019 large family, the size of which was known to Benton. (At the time of the contract there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>nine children.) When the alterations were completed the house had \u201cfive or six\u201d bedrooms, to serve which the Health Department regulations required a larger septic tank (900-gallon capacity) than the tank Benton had already installed (750-gal-lon capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Mr. Fowler testified that before executing the contract he told Benton that he \u201chad a large family and did he feel that the septic 'tank system would accomplish [accommodate] a large family?\u201d According to Mr. Fowler, Benton replied that <em>\u201cthe septic tank had been put in according to the Health Department regulations and he saw no reason why the septic tank wouldn\u2019t work and it would be perfectly adequate for the size family I had.\u201d </em>Actually, however, the septic system had never been approved for the increased accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The Fowlers moved into the premises on March 25, 1957. Shortly thereafter the septic tank system, apparently overburdened, overflowed and otherwise proved to be considerably less than \u201cadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The substance of the appellants\u2019 claim, as contained in their second amended declaration, was that Benton knowingly misrepresented to them that their septic tank system would be adequate for them. Among other claimed damages the declaration alleges that \u201cthe major injury resulting from the <em>defendant's fraudulent representation of the septic tank system </em>was, and still is, the serious illness with which the plaintiff, Kenneth Leo Fowler, was, and is, afflicted because of the unsanitary and hazardous conditions under which the plaintiffs were compelled to live.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) There was evidence in the case from which the jury could have found that the source of Mr. Fowler\u2019s illness (amebiasis) was the unsanitary conditions caused by faulty septic systems generally in the neighborhood as well as the unsanitary conditions caused by the faulty septic system on the Fowler lot alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">At the new trial the trial judge in his instructions to the jury submitted the case on two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">1. Was there any fraud imposed by the defendant upon the plaintiffs regarding the septic system ?</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">2. Was Mr. Fowler\u2019s illness proximately caused by the alleged faulty septic system on their property ?</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The jury answered \u201cYes\u201d to the first issue and awarded the Fowlers damages in the amount of $2,500. The jury\u2019s answer to the second issue was \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In this appeal the appellants allege numerous grounds for reversal and remand. One of them, that the verdict in special issue No. 2 was against the weight of the evidence, is not within the scope of review by this Court and cannot be considered. The issue presented to the jury was one of fact and while the Court of Appeals will review a case tried by the lower court without a jury on the evidence as well as on the law, the verdict of a jury on a question of fact is conclusive on appeal. The jury alone have the right and power to judge of the weight of the evidence. <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Barrack, </em>210 Md. 168, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Before the retrial date the appellee filed a \u201cMotion for Separate Trial of Issue of Law\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 502. Upon consideration of the motion Judge Powers (who did not preside at the retrial) passed the following order, filed March 30, 1965:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cORDERED, that testimony of damages in this cause is limited to those damages which the plaintiffs incurred up to the time of their discovery of the inadequacy of the septic tank system on their property, and that the time of the discovery of the inadequacy of said system by the plaintiffs shall be a matter for the jury to determine; that no evidence of damages shall be admitted in evidence in the trial of this case which occurred subsequent to a reasonable period of time after January 3, 1958 within which plaintiffs could have connected their system to the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission line, the date of January 3, 1958 being the date the plaintiffs received notice from the Health Department of Prince George\u2019s County that the septic tank system installed on their property was inadequate; that testimony of damages occurring subsequent to the time herein before outlined shall not be admitted in evidence unless such damages bear a causal relationship to damages incurred prior to the time as herein set forth; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201cORDERED, that damages for the cost of correcting the alleged inadequate septic tank system shall be limited to the cost of connecting their property to the line of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The first question presented for our review is whether or not the lower court erred \u201cin placing upon the appellants the limitations which were set forth\u201d in the above quoted order \u201cand then continued in the two special issues submitted to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The appellants argue that \u201cWith the Order of Court governing the trial, many legitimate items of damage were discarded by the trial judge.\u201d We deem it unnecessary to decide, <em>in vacuo, </em>whether or not the order in all respects correctly stated the law of the case concerning allowable damages, for it is evident from an examination of the record that the order did not \u201cgovern\u201d the trial judge in his rulings on the evidence or his instructions to the jury. Moreover, appellants refer us to no specific \u201citem of damage\u201d offered by them, nor do we find any in the record, which the trial judge \u201cdiscarded\u201d because of Judge Powers\u2019 order. As will be seen later in this opinion, the trial judge\u2019s rulings on evidence were based on considerations quite apart from any \u201climitations\u201d contained in the order. Under these circumstances, any possible error in the content of the order itself does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Furthermore, as we understand the appellants\u2019 argument on this point, their real complaint is that special issue No. 2 and the trial judge\u2019s accompanying instructions were erroneous in that they did not allow the jury to award damages for Mr. Fowler\u2019s illness unless it first found that the illness was \u201cproximately caused by the faulty septic system <em>on the Fowler property.\" </em>(Emphasis supplied.) It is the appellants\u2019 theory of the case that Benton\u2019s alleged fraud consisted not only of actively misrepresenting the septic system on the Fowler lot but consisted also of his failure to inform the appellants of the faulty septic systems on the other lots in the development. From this premise, appellants argue that they are entitled to monetary damages for Mr. Fowler\u2019s illness if the illness resulted from unsanitary conditions caused by faulty septic systems generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>in the neighborhood, and not only if the illness resulted from the unsanitary conditions caused by the faulty septic system on the Fowler lot. Failure of the trial judge to so instruct the jury was, say appellants, reversible error. The difficulty with appellants\u2019 argument on this point is that, in spite of Mrs. Fowler\u2019s vigorous insistence to the contrary, this alleged error, as a ground for appeal, was not properly preserved at the trial below for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The record shows that immediately after instructing the jury and submitting the issues the trial judge directed Mrs. Fowler and appellee\u2019s counsel to approach the bench, whereupon the following proceedings were had out of the hearing of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201c(The Court) Dictate to the reporter any objections you may have to the instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201c(Mrs. Fowler) The only objection I have is the exclusion of punitive damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">There then followed further colloquy at the bench between the judge and Mrs. Fowler during which she made no objections to the issues submitted or the instructions given. Nor did she request that they be amended or supplemented in any manner. There being nothing in the record<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to show that the appellants requested the trial judge to instruct the jury or submit issues on their theory of the case, we are unable to pass upon the correctness of the theory on this appeal. Rules 554 and 560 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure. Moreover, even if we assume that the question were before us we find no merit in the appellants\u2019 theory regarding this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The basis of Benton\u2019s alleged fraud consisted of his active misrepresentation of the adequacy of the septic system on the Fowler lot alone. As this Court said in the first appeal <em>(Fowler v. Benton, supra, </em>p. 581), <em>\u201cThis assertion by Benton </em>* * * <em>re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>ferred specifically to the septic tank system actually installed by Benton </em>[italics ours], and was tantamount to an assertion that he, a man of many years\u2019 experience as a builder, knew of no reason why the plaintiffs would not find the system \u2018adequate,\u2019 and one of the reasons why they should find it adequate was that it had been approved by the Health Department.\u201d As further pointed out in that opinion, the material fact misrepresented by Benton was that the Health Department had approved the installation, when in actuality the system had not been approved with regard to adequacy and capacity for a family of eleven.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Benton was not asked and volunteered no information concerning the septic system on any other lots in the development. Other than his own testimony at the trial that \u201cat times\u201d property owners \u201cin the whole area were having trouble with their septic systems,\u201d the evidence does not show precisely what he 'knew about these other septic systems <em>in February, 1957, when he made his allegedly fraudulent statement. </em>While it may be presumed Benton was aware that the \u201ctrouble\u201d on the other lots was overflowing septic systems, there is no evidence that <em>at that time </em>he knew the cause or causes of the trouble, much less that he knew that this cause or these causes also applied to the Fowler septic system. Obviously, there are many reasons why a .septic tank system on a particular lot might overflow. The reasons applicable to one lot may be entirely different than those \u25a0applicable to another. Moreover, there is no expert testimony in the record regarding the precise cause of overflowing on <em>any </em>\u25a0of the other lots. Under the particular circumstances revealed by the record before us, we agree with the learned trial judge that, <em>as a matter of law, </em>when Benton was asked about the adequacy of the septic system on the Fowler lot he was under no legal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> duty to disclose that other lot owners were having difficulties with their septic systems. This being so it would have been error to instruct the jury in a manner allowing it to award \u25a0damages resulting from the faulty septic systems on the neighboring lots. As this Court said in <em>Dorough v. Lockman, </em>224 Md. 168, 171, \u201cA litigant is entitled to have his theory of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>case presented to the jury only if it is a correct exposition of the law and there is testimony in the case which supports it.\u201d In our view the appellants\u2019 theory does not meet that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The next question presented for our review is this: \u201cDid the lower court err in discussing the law of the case and the prayers, and in formulating the special issues in chambers <em>without the presence of the court stenographer; </em>and in allowing discussion at the bench without having it reported by the court stenographer?\u201d (Appellants\u2019 italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The record shows that at the close of the evidence, the trial judge invited Mrs. Fowler and appellee\u2019s counsel to his chambers to \u201cconsider what the Court will instruct the jury as to the law in this case.\u201d There is no record of the conference that took place. Obviously, however, instructions were discussed, and at some length, for upon resuming the bench the judge told the jury, \u201c(A)s sometimes happens, we have taken longer than we had anticipated to go over the question of prayers.\u201d It then being late in the day the judge recessed court until the next morning at which time, according to the record, the jury was seated and there was a \u201cdiscussion at the bench off the record.\u201d The judge then instructed the jury and submitted the two issues, after which, <em>before the jury retired to consider its verdict, </em>the colloquy previously referred to herein took place in which both sides were told <em>out of the hearing of the jury to \u201cdictate to the reporter any objections you may have to the instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The practice of court and counsel of informally discussing in chambers proposed prayers and jury instructions is widespread in this state. Nothing in the Maryland Rules prohibits it. Such informal discussion promotes agreement on the law of the case, segregates the points of difference, and tends to limit the issues \u2014 all of which has the salutary effect of promoting errorless instructions and more orderly jury arguments on the part of counsel. During the \u201csifting process\u201d of such discussions it very often happens that opinions initially held concerning the instructions that should be given are revised or abandoned altogether. To require in all cases that a court stenographer be present during the discussion seems to us unnecessary, and in any event a matter properly left to the sound dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>cretion of the trial judge. So long as the record shows, as it does in this case, that after such discussion in chambers opportunity is given counsel to make their <em>final </em>objections on the record, in the manner and at the time required by Rule 554 d, we see nothing wrong with the procedure followed by the trial judge in the case at bar. Especially is this true where, as here, the record fails to disclose that the appellants were in any wa}' prejudiced by the procedure, or that the trial judge abused his discretion in any manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">As further grounds for their appeal, appellants allege error by the trial judge in numerous rulings on the admissibility of evidence :</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">1. The trial judge refused to admit evidence, as an element of damages, of appellants\u2019 expenses involved in their litigation against the developer of Seabrook Acres and the real estate agent who, in addition to Benton, were originally defendants in this case. Directed verdicts in favor of the developer and the real estate agent were affirmed by this Court in <em>Bowler v. Benton, supra. </em>The trial judge also refused to admit evidence of appellants\u2019 expenses involved in their litigation against the Board of County Commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County. In that case this Court affirmed the action of the trial court in sustaining a demurrer to the declaration <em>(Fowler v. Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs, </em>230 Md. 504). In order that expenses of so-called \u201ccollateral litigation\u201d be allowed as damages to a plaintiff, \u201csuch expenses must be the natural and proximate consequence of the injury complained of and must have been incurred necessarily and in good faith and the amount thereof must be reasonable.\u201d 25 C.J.S. <em>Damages </em>\u00a7 50. In our view the litigation expenses for which appellants claim reimbursement do not meet this test. The trial judge was correct in his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">2. Appellants complain that the lower court \u201cerred in ruling out certain evidence and testimony * * * relating to Kenneth Fowler\u2019s arrest, jailing and fine.\u201d The appellants\u2019 contention here is that Mr. Fowler\u2019s \u201carrest, jailing and fine,\u201d on a warrant charging that on January 3, 1958, he violated the state health laws \u201cby failing to correct the overflowing septic system,\u201d were caused by Benton\u2019s fraud and are proper elements of damages which the jury should have been allowed to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>sider. Even if we assume, without deciding, that they would be proper elements of damage, the proof was insufficient. The trial judge allowed in evidence, as Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 10, a \u201ctrue test copy\u201d of proceedings before a Trial Magistrate for Prince George\u2019s County showing Mr. Fowler\u2019s arrest on the charge, but as he prayed a jury trial it does not show the outcome of the matter. In admitting the exhibit the judge remarked that it could \u201cbe seen by the jury at the proper time,\u201d and declined to allow it to be read by a witness on the stand on the ground that \u201cit will speak for itself.\u201d The exhibit was never seen by or read to the jury during the trial. During Mr. Fowler\u2019s testimony he was asked no questions concerning any aspect of the charge or its outcome. However, a proffer was made of \u201cjail expenses, costs involved in that,\u201d but no amounts were mentioned in the proffer and it was not stated in the proffer whether the \u201cjailing\u201d was before or after final disposition of the charge. The judge refused the proffer. After the judge had instructed the jury at the conclusion of the case, he also refused Mrs. Fowler\u2019s request to allow the jury to take Plantiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 10 to the jury room. We think both rulings were correct. Except for Mrs. Fowler\u2019s statement during one of the numerous colloquies at the bench that \u201cWe had a jury trial and they found him guilty\u201d (which of course is not evidence) there is no proof in the record extract showing that Mr. Fowler was ever convicted of the charge. In the absence of such proof, the mere fact that he was arrested on what, so far as the evidence shows, may have been a groundless charge, was immaterial and of no probative value as far as damages in this case are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">3. The trial judge excluded from the evidence any evidence regarding the death of the Fowlers\u2019 dog. Mrs. Fowler testified that several months after they moved onto the property the dog became ill and died. As there was no evidence from which the jury could do more than speculate that the faulty septic system caused the dog\u2019s death, the judge\u2019s action was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">4. The trial judge granted appellee\u2019s motion to strike out the answer of a medical witness giving his prognosis of Mr. Fowler\u2019s illness. At that stage of the case evidence of a causal connection between the illness and the faulty septic system was at most very meager. In any event we find no prejudicial error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>in the court\u2019s ruling since the witness had already testified, without objection, that Mr. Fowler \u201cwill require medical care for an indefinite period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">5. \u201cThe lower court erred in refusing to allow the pamphlet on amebiasis and the actuarial tables to be admitted into evidence, and in refusing to allow the short film on \u2018The Life Cycle of Entamoeba Histolytica\u2019 to be shown to the jury.\u201d We find no reversible error in any of these rulings:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">(a) The pamphlet is a \u201cTechnical Bulletin\u201d of the Armed Forces on \u201cAmebiasis\u201d describing all forms of the disease, its causes, diagnosis and treatment. In its pertinent parts the pamphlet merely repeated, \u201cin technical English,\u201d the information contained in the medical testimony. Its admissibility was clearly within the sound discretion of the court. <em>Cf. </em>31A C.J.S. <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 166, <em>Unnecessary Evidence,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">(b) In view of the jury\u2019s answer to special issue No. 2, the rejection of the actuarial tables was not prejudicial \u2014 even assuming, without deciding, their admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">(c) The movie film is said to \u201cdemonstrate more graphically * * <em>* how </em>this disease invades the human body.\u201d If so, <em>our </em>ruling as to (a) above also applies here. See also <em>State for use of Emerson v. </em>Poe, 171 Md. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Appellants further contend that the lower court erred in not instructing the jury on the matter of punitive damages. As we have seen, the record shows that appellants objected to this omission before the jury retired, but no grounds for the objection were stated as required by Rule 554 d. The objection is therefore not properly before us for review. Rule 554 e; <em>Fiege v. Boehm, </em>210 Md. 352. However, even if we assume the question to be properly presented, we find no error in the omission.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">\u201cIn ordinary cases the recovery of exemplary, punitive, or vindictive damages will not be allowed in an action of deceit; but such damages may be allowed where the wrong involves some violation of duty springing from a relation of trust or confidence, or where the fraud is gross, or the case presents other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances clearly indicating malice and wilfulness and calling for an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>tension of the doctrine.\u201d <em>Russell v. Stoops, </em>106 Md. 138, 143-44.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">This case as presented does not come within any of the exceptions named.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Appellants\u2019 final contention on this appeal is that their cause was prejudiced by a certain remark made <em>out of the presence of the jury </em>by the trial judge to a medical witness. At the time, the judge was assisting Mrs. Fowler in keeping the doctor present to testify later in the trial. The remark was a veiled reference to the old adage (upon the validity of which we decline comment) that \u201cA person who represents himself has a fool for a client.\u201d Appellants claim the remark reflected an \u201cattitude of the judge\u201d which <em>\u201cmight </em>have been very prejudicial to their case.\u201d (Italics ours). We find nothing in the record manifesting an attitude on the part of the judge which resulted in any prejudice to the appellants. No claim is made that the testimony of the doctor or any other witness was in any way affected by the remark, and since the jury did not hear the remark, we rule that it was not prejudicial. Moreover, in his instructions to the jury, the judge, quite properly we think, told the jury that \u201cin this State an individual has a perfect right to represent himself. This is a right afforded to every citizen. If a citizen should elect to try his own case rather than to have some attorney represent them they have a perfect right to do so. The fact that they do retain an attorney or not should not affect your decision in any way in this case. You must weigh and consider this case without regard to sympathy, prejudice or passion for or against any of the parties to this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Finding no reversible error in the rulings and instructions of the trial court, we shall affirm the judgment entered on the jury\u2019s answers to the special issues submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed. Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\">. There was filed with appellants\u2019 brief an affidavit of Mrs. Fowler, joined by Mr. Fowler, in which it is stated that objections were made in chambers to the issues and that instructions were requested consistent with appellants\u2019 theory. However, the matter was not certified by the trial judge and a motion to \u201cCorrect Omission in Record\u201d was denied by this Court on March 29, 1966.
