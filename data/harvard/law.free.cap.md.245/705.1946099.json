Here the mother has not overcome the strong presumption that she should not, under the circumstances outlined, have the children. <em>Hild v. Hild, </em>221 Md. 349; <em>Parker v. </em>Parker, 222 Md. 69; <em>Palmer v. Palmer, </em>238 Md. 327.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Judge Jones found, in addition, that the mother\u2019s temperament, character and past attitude towards the children did not qualify her as a fit mother and, judging the future by the past, was unwilling to \u201cgamble with the future welfare of these young children by letting them remain with their mother.\u201d The father was found to be a fit parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">We think the testimony permitted the findings of the chancellor and see no reason to disturb her exercise of judgment and discretion under the circumstances. <em>Cupps v.
