According to Bradshaw the building soon became too small for his expanding business. He acquainted Brown with his problem. Brown, being both sympathetic and cooperative, employed an architect to develop plans which would have doubled the size of the building but, said Brown, \u201cit worked out to more money than Mr. Bradshaw w\u2019anted to tackle\u201d and he [Bradshaw] \u201cbacked away from it.\u201d Bradshaw thought he might be able to solve the problem himself if he could build on or otherwise use the vacant lot adjoining the building. The lot had been specifically excluded from the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">On 11 March 1960, just before the lease expired, Brown and Bradshaw <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> executed an agreement the effect<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of which was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>extend the lease for a term of 13 years and add the vacant lot to the leased premises. <em>Md. Theatrical Corp. v. Manayunk Trust Co., 157 </em>Md. 602, 610-14, 146 Atl. 805 (1929). Bradshaw was given the right to terminate the lease during the last 3 months of the third year and, if not then terminated, during the last three months of the eighth year. Termination was to be accomplished by \u201cnotice in writing\u201d of Bradshaw\u2019s \u201cintention to vacate and surrender the premises.\u201d In the absence of such a notice he would continue to be bound by the lease. Bradshaw agreed also to pay more rent, all of the real property taxes and all of the hazard insurance premiums. \u201cAll other terms and conditions of the [original] lease * * * [were] declared to be a part\u201d of the extension agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">On 28 December 1962 Bradshaw mailed to Brown the letter reproduced below. It will be noted that the third year of the extension expired on 31 March 1963. Brown received the letter on 2 January 1963 and that this was \u201cwithin three (3) months of\u201d 31 March 1963 is not disputed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>December 28th, 1962.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cMr. R.

He was alone, he said, but Brown thought he was accompanied by one of his employees. The conversation was \u201cvery brief.\u201d Brown told \u201cBradshaw that if he held over after the 31st of March that * * * [he] would hold him to the terms of the lease.\u201d He told Bradshaw, however, that although the lease did not give him the right to sublet the premises or assign the lease \u201cwithout the written consent of the Landlords\u201d he would give his consent if Bradshaw could get \u201ca decent tenant.\u201d According to Brown Bradshaw replied, in substance, \u201cif that\u2019s it, that\u2019s it.\u201d Brown said \u201cthey thanked me and left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">Bradshaw did not contradict Brown\u2019s statement that he would be held to the terms of the lease. He said he told Brown \u201cthe store just wasn\u2019t large enough\u201d for him. In his testimony he said he \u201cfelt that the letter * * * [he] had sent him [Brown] was reasonable enough notice for me to discontinue rental from him at a later date and * * * [he] felt that he [Brown] would extend the lease.\u201d He admitted Brown told him he would be permitted to sublet if he \u201ccould find a tenant that he [Brown] was agreeable on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Counsel for Bradshaw made much of the fact that Brown is an attorney and that he prepared both the original lease and the extension agreement. Whether, on either occasion, Bradshaw had the benefit of counsel is not a matter of record but there can be no doubt that counsel was available to him. What has greater significance, however, is the fact that Bradshaw consulted the attorney who appeared for him in this appeal <em>after </em>his conversation in January with Brown but <em>before </em>31 March 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Brown heard nothing more from Bradshaw but \u201csometime in the summer of 1963\u201d Bradshaw\u2019s attorney told Brown that in his opinion the lease ran from year to year. Brown told him he was \u201call wet\u201d and that he was \u201cgoing to hold Bradshaw to\u201d the terms of the lease except that he would let him sublet. On 17 September 1963 Bradshaw\u2019s attorney wrote the following letter to Brown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201cR.

This followed Murray\u2019s earlier personal letter to you of December 28, 1962.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">\u201cAs you may know, Murray has made an agreement with Lawson King to move into and occupy a more desirable property in Gaithersburg for his store. This new premises will be available sometime this coming spring and will alleviate for Murray the problems he has with the present location; being a shortage of floor space, a lack of merchandise loading space, and will give him facilities for tire changing and other work which he now does not have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">\u201cI should like to advise you at this time, therefore, that Murray will vacate the premises now leased to him by you on or before March 31, 1964, which will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>be the expiration of his current term as I view the lease.

I also advised him that he could sub-let the building with my consent; that I would not unreasonably withhold that consent, and that he should be prepared to continue with his lease whether he moved or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-16\">\u201cI am at a loss to understand how you read into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>lease that the current terra expires on March 31, 1964, and should appreciate your advice in this regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\u201cWith kindest regards, I am</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">R. Edwin Brown\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">There was no response to Brown\u2019s letter of 18 September. Some time during the month of March 1964 Bradshaw, as predicted by his attorney, vacated the premises. He had the key delivered to Brown but Brown refused to accept it. Later on the key arrived in the mail but Brown did not return it. He said he \u201cdidn\u2019t see any sense in carrying it back up the street and putting it on Charlie\u2019s [Bradshaw\u2019s attorney] desk.\u201d He referred prospective tenants to Bradshaw and, on one occasion, Ire reminded Bradshaw of his obligation to maintain the property. When \u201cit became obvious they [Bradshaw] weren\u2019t going to do anything\u201d Brown tried \u201cto find a new tenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">In July 1964 Brown sued to collect the rent for April, May, June and July. In November, upon the petition and affidavit of Bradshaw, the case was removed to Carroll County. On 1 March 1965, after necessary repairs, Brown rented the property to Earl Daymude. In April 1965 Brown amended his declaration so as to claim rent from 1 April 1964 to 28 February 1965 ($2475), State and County taxes ($317.95), Gaithersburg Town taxes ($54.93) and the cost of the repairs ($1601.-40). The case was tried before Weant, J. and a jury on 30 November 1965. After the denial of Brown\u2019s motion for a new trial the clerk entered a judgment ($1000) on the verdict in Lis favor against Bradshaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The first of Brown\u2019s three contentions concerns Bradshaw\u2019s Prayer No. 1, which the court read to the jury and which follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">\u201cIf you find from the evidence in this case that the landlord expressly or impliedly consented to the tenant remaining for a temporary period after the expiration of the term of the lease, or that the landlord and tenant were engaged in negotiations as to the renewal of the lease, then the landlord cannot hold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tenant for the full term of five years, but rather the landlord can treat the tenant as a trespasser or as a tenant from year to year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We have found in the record no evidence which could support a finding that Brown agreed, expressly or impliedly, to allow Bradshaw to remain on the property for \u201ca temporary period\u201d after 31 March 1963. Bradshaw asked only for \u201can extension * * * through October 31st 1963.\u201d He went on to say, of course, that \u201cwe will have vacated your property\u201d before 31 October but this was nothing more than an inducement to Brown to grant the extension. Brown\u2019s answer to this request was short and emphatic and it has not been contradicted. Moreover Bradshaw admitted, when he testified, that Brown told him he was willing to relax the prohibition against subletting, a concession quite inconsistent with the language of the prayer. Nor do we find any evidence that Brown and Bradshaw were engaged in \u201cnegotiations as to the renewal of the lease.\u201d We think \u201cnegotiations\u201d connotes something more than the flat refusal of a simple request. <em>Attrill v. Patterson, </em>58 Md. 226, 245 (1882). See also the quotation from <em>Tonkel v. Riteman, </em>163 Miss. 216, 141 So. 344 (1932) in <em>Donnelly Adver. Corp. v. Flaccomio, </em>216 Md. 113, 123-4, 140 A. 2d 165 (1958). In any event, there was no need to negotiate for the \u201crenewal of the lease.\u201d The lease was in full force and effect and it was not about to expire. Felting <em>Etc. Co. v. Waltz, </em>160 Md. 50, 152 Atl. 434 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">After the conversation in Brown\u2019s office early in January Bradshaw had available to him two alternatives. He could have given Brown proper written notice of his intention to terminate the lease or, by standing mute, he could have allowed the lease to move automatically into its next stage. Since he consulted counsel it must be assumed that his choice of the latter alternative was deliberate and intentional. If, however, as the record seems to suggest, he was advised that his letter of 28 December was notice sufficient to terminate the lease on 31 March-1963, we think he was given incorrect advice. In our judgment, to say that asking for a concession not contemplated by the lease has the same effect as giving the notice of an intention to terminate required by and described in the lease is quite like-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>confusing chalk with cheese. Had he pursued the other alternative (i.e., terminated the lease by proper notice) he could have remained in possession, leaving the next move to Brown. This would have forced Brown to elect whether to treat him as a tenant from year to year or to proceed against him, as a tenant holding over, in the Montgomery County People\u2019s Court under the provisions of Code, Art. 53, \u00a7 1 or in the Circuit Court under Maryland Rule T 40. <em>Messall v. Merlands Club, </em>244 Md. 18, 29, 222 A. 2d 627 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Bradshaw does not contend that Brown was negligent or dilatory in mitigating his damages or that he did not act in good faith. Nor was any such showing made in the court below. In the circumstances we think Brown was entitled to his rent for the 11 months the property was without a tenant and the trial judge should have so instructed the jury. It follows, of course, that Bradshaw\u2019s Prayer No. 1 should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Brown next contends that the trial judge should not have granted Bradshaw\u2019s Prayer No. 4, which follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cWhen a landlord has the election as to whether he will treat a tenant holding over after the expiration of his term as a trespasser or as a periodic tenant, the landlord is required to make his election known to the tenant within a reasonable time <em>and it is up to you to determine whether such election was made known to the defendant.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">When Judge Weant read Prayer No. 4 to the jury he added the italicized language. As indicated in our discussion of Brown\u2019s first contention there is no evidence in this case to which such an instruction could be applied. Since Bradshaw\u2019s term had not expired he could not be treated as a tenant holding over. There being no election for Brown to make there was nothing to make \u201cknown to the defendant.\u201d The instruction was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Brown\u2019s final contention is that Bradshaw\u2019s Prayer No. 3, which the court read to the jury, ignores a covenant in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>lease which requires the tenant to \u201cmaintain said building as well as the heating, plumbing and electrical systems therein, in a good state of repair.\u201d Prayer No. 3 follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201cIn order for the landlord to recover from the former tenant the amount expended for repairs and reconditioning the building because of an alleged breach of a covenant concerning the condition of the premises at the termination of the tenancy, the landlord must show that the covenant has been breached and a connection between that breach and the need for repairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cIf you find that the repairs made upon the property, after the tenant vacated it, were required because of reasonable and proper use, then you must find for the defendant as to the damages claimed for such repairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Brown argues that, since the jury awarded him only $1000 of the $1601.40 he says he proved, he must have been prejudiced by the instruction. We doubt that this is so because the court granted two instructions offered by Brown both of which recognize reasonable wear and tear as a proper exception to Bradshaw\u2019s duty to return the premises \u201cin as good condition as they were on April 1, 1955.\u201d In our judgment Bradshaw\u2019s Prayer No. 3 is a reasonably compatible paraphrase of Brown\u2019s Instructions Nos. 8 and 9. Even if it could be said that the granting of the Bradshaw prayer was tinged with error, the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Bradshaw insists that we cannot consider Brown\u2019s contentions because his objections to the court\u2019s instructions were made <em>before </em>they were read to the jury. Bradshaw is catching at straws.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">At the conclusion of the evidence Brown offered 9 \u201cinstructions.\u201d Bradshaw offered 4 \u201cprayers.\u201d Judge Weant told counsel that he would grant all of Brown\u2019s \u201cinstructions\u201d except No. 1 and No. 7. He announced also that he would grant all of Bradshaw\u2019s \u201cprayers.\u201d When he asked if there were any exceptions, Brown\u2019s attorney dictated to the reporter his exceptions, and the grounds thereof, to the granting of Bradshaw\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Prayers 1, 3 and 4. After the jury returned to the court room Judge Weant read, verbatim, the granted prayers and instructions to the jury. He made a few minor additions none of which are material to issues before us. Otherwise the court made no comment. There were no objections made after the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Bradshaw cites, in support of his argument, Maryland Rule 554 d, the language of which follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cIf a party has an objection to any portion of any instruction given, or to any omission therefrom, or to the failure to give any instruction, he shall before the jury retires to consider its verdict make such objection stating distinctly the portion, or omission, or failure to instruct to which he objects and the ground of his objection. Opportunity shall be given to make the objection in open court out of the hearing of the jury upon application either orally or in writing, made before or after the conclusion of the charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Counsel must surely have misread the rule, which states with precise clarity that the objection (exception) may be made <em>\u201cbefore or after </em>the conclusion of the charge.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Ritterpusch v. Lithographic Plate,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>208 Md. 592, 119 A. 2d 392 (1956) is also offered in support of Bradshaw\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ment. Judge Hammond (now Chief Judge, in that case, remarked :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201cClearly, the controlling objection and the one to which appellate review is restricted, is that made <em>after </em>the charge has been delivered.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Id. </em>at 602.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Counsel neglects to point out, however, that the appellant in <em>Ritterpusch </em>was caught between conflicting legal theories, one raised by his request for an instruction which was refused and the other by the exception taken after the charge. In those circumstances, we held, the objection made after the charge, rather than the refused instruction, was the subject of appellate review. Since there were no objections made after the charge in the instant case, we have nothing before us except those made before the charge. In any event, it will readily be perceived that where the trial judge confines his charge to the reading of the prayers and instructions offered by counsel it matters little whether the objection is registered before or after the reading. <em>Merritt v. Darden, </em>227 Md. 589, 596-98, 176 A. 2d 205 (1962). See <em>Town of Somerset v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>245 Md. 52, 225 A. 2d 294 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The manner in which the trial judge instructed the jury in this case, while technically permissible under Maryland Rule 554, prompts us to repeat what we said in <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Wks. v. Catron, </em>186 Md. 156, 163, 46 A. 2d 303 (1946) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cThe practice adopted by the trial court in the case at bar, of granting prayers and supplementing them by an oral charge, does not commend itself to us, even though it is permitted by rule. We think the better practice, and the one least calculated to mislead the jury, is for the court to refuse all prayers, and make an oral charge, incorporating therein such portion, or all, of the requested instructions as the court may deem proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">In this connection a useful purpose may well be served by recalling fragments of a paper prepared by the late Morris A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Soper <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at the time of the promulgation of the predecessor of Rule 554.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201cIt is to be expected that at the close of the evidence, if not before, the judge will follow the usual salutary practice of asking counsel to submit the propositions of law which they desire him to include in his charge. It is likely that counsel will prefer to offer formal prayers, as has been their custom, setting out with precision the applicable rules of law in a hypothetical framework of facts. The judge may incorporate one or more of the prayers, as offered, in his charge, accompanying them with explanatory comments, or as is not infrequently and, some think, preferably done, he may reject all of the prayers, and yet use in his own words such of the offered material as constitutes a correct exposition of the law. The jury will more easily understand and more readily apply the rules of the law if they are couched in simple colloquial terms, with appropriate illustration and application to the facts of the controversy. Any lawyer, however able, who attempts to read the black letter of the Restatements of the Law, prepared by the leaders of the profession under the direction of the American Law Institute, realizes how difficult it is to understand the text without reference to the accompanying comment. How much more are jurors in need of lucid explanation. Moreover, there is an obvious advantage in a charge which contains all of the comments on the facts and all of the instructions on the law in one coherent statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u201cThe privilege and duty of charging the law in simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>understandable terms should also be accepted without hesitation. The judge need have no fear that his deliverance will be condemned because it is not phrased in formal, technical language, or because each sentence separated from the context does not state a rule of law completely with all its exceptions and qualifications. Such a feat, well nigh impossible, would have small practical value, if performed. The jury needs to have its attention called to the substance of the rules in every day language, with application to the facts of the instant case, and, if possible, with pertinent illustrations. Here too the judge may expect helpful suggestions from counsel at the end, which will enable him to correct errors of commission and omission. Finally, the judge may be reassured by the evident purpose of our highest court to ascertain in each jury trial under review, not whether all the refinements of the law have been observed, but whether justice in a practical sense has been done.\u201d <em>Charge to the Jury, </em>6 Md. L,. Rev. 43, 48 (1941).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">For the reasons herein expressed we shall reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings. Unless the parties can agree otherwise it will be necessary to impanel another jury to resolve Brown\u2019s claim for repairs to the property, now the only remaining issue. The trial judge will instruct the jury that Brown is entitled to rent in the amount of $2,475.00, State and County taxes in the amount of $317.95 and Gaithersburg taxes in the amount of $54.93, and that he is entitled to interest on these amounts from the date they became due and payable. <em>Dennison v.
