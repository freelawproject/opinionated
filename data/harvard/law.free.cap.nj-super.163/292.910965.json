The trial judge reasoned that the submission to the jury of the two theories of liability on these two allegations would be confusing. He determined that the circumstances of the case made it unnecessary to charge the jury with respect to negligence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The issue of whether a claimant has the right to have both strict liability and negligence go to the jury in the same case has not often been the subject of appeal. In <em>Howes v. Deere &amp; Co., </em>71 <em>Wis. </em>2d 268, 238 <em>N. W. </em>2d 76 (1976), the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in requiring the plaintiff to choose between strict liability or negligence before submitting questions to the jury. The court relied primarily upon <em>Greiton v. LaDow, </em>70 <em>Wis. </em>2d 589, 235 <em>N. W. </em>2d 677 (Sup. Ct. 1975) (concurring opinion actually majority) which attempted to point out the distinction between the two theories and their interaction. However, the <em>TLotves </em>court did not hold that plaintiff had the absolute right to always have both theories presented to the jury. Rather, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">* * #&gt; it may t,e appropriate to submit only one question, or it may be desirable to submit a question on each issue. Tbe decision must be on a case-by-case basis and at the time of trial. [71 <em>Wis. </em>2d at 272, 238 <em>N. W. </em>2d at 79]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In <em>Jiminez v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>4 <em>Cal. </em>3d 379, 93 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>769, 482 <em>P. </em>2d 681 (Sup. Ct. 1971), the court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">Prior cases of this court have assumed without discussing the point that a plaintiff in a products liability case could seek recovery at the same time on theories of strict liability in tort and in negligence. s\u2019 *\u2022 No valid reason appears to require a plaintiff to elect whether to proceed on the theory of strict liability in tort or on the theory of negligence. It is apparent that in this products liability case instructions on negligence in addition to those on strict liability might have been of great aid to the plaintiff, and we cannot agree with defendants\u2019 contention to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>Nor </em>does it appear that instructions on the two theories will he confusing to the jury. There is nothing inconsistent in instructions on the two theories and to a large extent the two theories parallel and supplement each other. * * * [93 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>at 774, 482 <em>P. </em>2d at 686; citations and footnote omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Again, the court did not hold that in all instances both instructions must be given, but rather stated \"in this case\u201d the two instructions may have helped plaintiff. The fact that the dual instructions are not mandatory is further exemplified in another California case, <em>Cracknell v. Fisher Governor Co., </em>247 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 857, 56 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>64 ,(D. Ct. App. 1967), where the court held that giving instructions 'both as to negligent and strict liability may itself be reversible error for confusing the jury. To the effect that the dual instruction is not mandatory, but rather should be decided on a case-by-ease method, see <em>Mather v. Caterpillar Tractor Corp., </em>23 Ariz. <em>App. </em>409, 533 <em>P. </em>2d 717 (Ct. App. 1975); <em>Greenland v. Ford Motor Co., Inc., </em>115 <em>N. H. </em>564, 347 A. 2d 159 (Sup. Ct. 1975); <em>Chestnut v. Ford Motor Co., </em>445 <em>F. </em>2d 967 (4 Cir., 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that under the circumstances of this case one could not be held liable under a negligence theory if a jury found no strict liability, is an opinion shared by other jurisdictions. For example, the court in <em>Halvorson v. American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co., </em>307 <em>Minn. </em>48, 240 <em>N. W. </em>2d 303 (Sup. Ct. 1976), notes, \"the common element in both negligence and strict liability theories of product liability is some kind of dangerous defect rendering the product unreasonably dangerous for its intended use.\u201d 240 <em>N. W. </em>2d at 307. The court then goes on to hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">Based on the above analysis, and under the facts in this case, the jury\u2019s findings of no strict liability but 25 percent negligence are inconsistent and irreconcilable. Implicit in the former finding is the conclusion that the crane was not a dangerous, defective product because of the absence of safety devices. Implicit in the latter finding is the contrary conclusion that the crane created an unreasonable risk of harm because of the absence of the same safety devices. These conclusions cannot be reasonably reconciled. If a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>product is not dangerous and defective in the absence of safety devices, it is not negligence to manufacture it that way. [240 <em>N. W. </em>2d at 307]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Thus, the <em>Halvorson </em>court found that, in the context of the case, one could not be negligent if one did not produce a defective product, unreasonably dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">IVe are satisfied that the trial judge exercised proper discretion in not instructing the jury on both theories in this case. Failing to charge the jury on the theory of negligence had no capacity for producing an unjust result. The omission of the negligence charge had the effect of holding plaintiff to a lesser burden. More importantly, under the facts of this case, the determination by the jury that defendant was not liable on the theory of strict liability eliminated the possibility that defendant could be guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
