A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ApV\">These consolidated appeals involve claims of discrimination in violation of the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>10:5-l <em>et seq. </em>In his complaint filed with the Division on Civil Rights (Division) in July 1972 Clifford A. Flanders, Ph.D., then 61 years old, alleged that he was not reappointed as Associate Professor of Chemistry and granted tenure at William Paterson College of New Jersey because of his \u201cage.\u201d He had before then followed the in-college grievance procedure, but to no avail. In her complaint filed with the Division in October 1972 May B. Hollinshead, Ph.D., then an Associate Professor of Anatomy at the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, charged that she was denied promotion to the rank of full professor of anatomy at the College because of her \u201csex.\u201d She had before then unsuccessfully pursued the in-college promotion procedure. She later amended the complaint to further charge that because of her sex she was being paid less as Associate Professor than some males at the College who were either lower in rank than she or who had less time in rank than she.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In each case the respective institution denied the charges. In Dr. Flanders\u2019 case the reason given for his nonretention for a fourth year, which would have given him tenure status, was that the Chemistry Department was \u201coverstaffed.\u201d In Dr. Hollinshead\u2019s case the reason given for not promoting her to a full professorship was, essentially, that while she had earlier in her career made important academic contributions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>her productivity seemed to have \u201cplateaued.\u201d Field investigation resulted in a finding in each ease of probable cause to credit the charges of discrimination. In each case a testimonial hearing was conducted by a hearing examiner in the Division, following which he submitted his recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\n<em>As to Dr. Flanders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The hearing examiner, after analyzing the testimony in the case found, among other things; that Flanders\u2019 performance at the College \u201cwas of high calibre and was never substantially challenged throughout his employment there\u201d; that \u201cthe Administration recognized his teaching ability and past contributions to the College\u201d; that the Chemistry Department Betention Committee in a rare unanimous decision had recommended in October 1971 that Flanders \u201cbe offered a new contract for a fourth year of employment to commence in September, 1972 (which would automatically entitle him to tenure)\u201d but that the Dean reversed that decision; that the Dean had \u201cstated in the presence of several witnesses produced by the State that either Dr. Flanders .(age 60) or Dr. Rivela (age 29) could not be renewed for over-staffing reasons and that it was more important to retain (and thereby tenure) Bivela because he was younger and would be able to produce more for the College in the future\u201d; that although the College Appeals Committee reversed the Dean\u2019s decision, the College president subsequently reversed the Appeals Committee determination and Flanders \u201cwas ultimately unable to obtain tenure or a new contract for the 1972-1973 school year,\u201d and that \u201con the basis of the evidence and his observation of the demeanor and credibility of all of the witnesses * * * age was at very least a conscious factor in the administration\u2019s decision to deny retention and tenure to the complainant [Flanders].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The hearing examiner concluded in his Becommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that the College <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>had practiced age discrimination in denying Dr. Elanders reappointment and recommended that Dr. Elanders be offered reinstatement (with its accompanying tenure) and receive back pay, less interim earnings, together with appropriate retirement plan contributions. The College hied exceptions to the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendations. The Director of the Division on Civil Rights concurred in the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendations, adopted them as his findings of fact and conclusions of law, and by order dated Eebruary 26, 1975 required the College, among other things, to offer Elanders reinstatement (with its accompanying tenure), to pay Elanders damages in the amount of $13,335 back pay, and to make appropriate contributions to Flanders\u2019 retirement plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">On its appeal to this court William Paterson College contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">(1) There is a lack of substantial credible evidence to support the findings of the Division on Civil Rights that William Paterson College was motivated by discrimination in granting tenure to Rivela rather than the appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">(2) Evidence essential to the defense of this matter was erroneously excluded by the hearing ofiicer and thus the College was denied a fair and impartial hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">(a) The hearing ofiicer erroneously excluded evidence submitted by the College relevant to the relative qualifications of Flanders and Rivela.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">(b) The hearing officer erred in denying the College the opportunity to discover information known to the Division on Civil Rights helpful to the defense of this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> We find no merit in the first of these contentions and no relevant force in any phase of the second. In support of its second contention the College argues that \u201cevidence concerning the relative qualifications of Dr. Elanders and Dr. Rivela\u201d, should have been allowed; that summaries of student evaluations should have been admitted in evidence, and that it should have been permitted to question the Division\u2019s investigator regarding the persons with whom he had discussed the case in the course of his investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>and the substance of their statements. The decision to exclude the \u201cevidence\u201d was in each instance within the discretion cf the hearing examiner. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>53:14B-10 (a). We discern no mistaken exercise of that discretion. Beyond this, while the College now argues that \u201cThe decision not to grant tenure to Flanders was based on the judgment by the College that the chemistry department was overstaffed <em>and </em>that Dr. Bivela was a better candidate than Dr. Flanders,\u201d the <em>sole </em>official reason given by the College Dean to Flanders for the failure to reappoint him was that \u201cthere is no need for you because your department is overstaffed.\u201d Thus, the overriding issue at the hearing in the Division was whether Dr. Flanders was not reappointed because of \u201coverstaffing\u201d in the Chemistry Department or because of the practice of age discrimination. From our review of the record we have no doubt that age discrimination was the deciding factor. The proofs before the Division clearly establish an unlawful discrimination in violation of the statute <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>10:5-13(a) and <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>10:5-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The Director\u2019s findings and conclusions are \u201csupported by substantial credible evidence on the whole record, allowing for agency expertise and evaluation of the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Parkview Village Ass\u2019n. v. Collingswood, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>21, 34 (1972). See also, <em>Jackson v. Concord Co., </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>113, 117 \u2014 118 (1969). We discern no reason or justification for disturbing them. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>146, 162 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>As to Dr. Hollinshead</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The hearing examiner, after reviewing the evidence in the case, found, among other things, that \u201cfor nineteen years, Dr. May Hollinshead has been a highly regarded teacher and an active faculty member at the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey at Newark, and its predecessors\u201d; that \u201cthere is no question as to the quality of Dr. Hollinshead\u2019s work being worthy of promotion to full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>professor\u201d; that there is \u201csex discrimination in the fact that in the nineteen year history of the respondent, there has never been a woman promoted to full professor, even though more than 10% of the faculty is female,\u201d and that \u201cthe complainant would probably have been promoted if she had been a male, and thus the denial of her promotion to full professor is the result of sex discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The hearing examiner recommended that the Director of the Division on Civil Rights find that the College \u201chas engaged in unlawful discrimination against the complainant.\u201d He also recommended that the Director order the College to \u201ccease and desist from such unlawful discrimination against Dr. Hollinshead and all other women employees,\u201d and that Dr. Hollinshead \u201cbe awarded a total of $4,251 ($3,751 for back pay and $500 for humiliation damages), with interest of 6% to run from July 1, 1972.\u201d He declined to recommend that the Director order the College to promote Dr. Hollinshead to full professor. Instead, he recommended \u201cthat the Director order Dr. Hollinshead\u2019s credentials be resubmitted to the Faculty Committee on Appointments and Promotions for a fair and nondiscriminatory review.\u201d Both the College and Dr. Hollinshead filed exceptions to the hearing examiner\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The Director of the Division on Civil Rights concurred in and adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law excepting only the recommended remedy since it failed to include immediate appointment of Dr. Hollinshead to full professor. He found that the College \u201chas engaged in a pattern and practice of sex discrimination against its female faculty members and such unlawful practice constitutes a violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>10:5-4 <em>&amp; </em>12(a),\u201d and by order dated March 11, 1975 required, among other things, that the College forthwith promote Dr. Hollinshead to the rank of full professor, retroactive to July 1, 1972, and pay her the sum of $4,704.33, consisting of $3,751 for hack pay, $500 for humiliation damages and $453.33 for interest from July 1, 1972 through June 30, 1975. The College was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>also required, among other things, to engage \u201cin the Affirmative recruitment, hiring, and promotion of qualified women\u201d; to direct \u201call appropriate individuals and/or committees to consider for faculty promotions any and all qualified women before giving consideration to any and all men who have substantially similar qualifications\u201d; to give, within ten days after a promotion is granted written notice of the reasons for her rejection to each woman not selected when the \u201cpromotion, other than one in rank is granted to a man for which women were qualified or applied\u201d; to give written notice of the reasons (with particularity) for any denial of promotion in rank to a woman faculty member whenever she is reviewed for such promotion and it is denied, and to \u201cestablish and maintain policies which will insure salary equity between comparable male and female faculty members in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">On its appeal to this court the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">(1) There is a lack of sufficient credible evidence to establish that failure to promote Dr. Hollinshead to the title of full professor at the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey was motivated by sex discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">(2) The portion of the order of the Director of the Division on Civil Rights mandating preferential treatment for women faculty exceeds the powers of the Division and should be declared void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">(8) The order of promotion to full professor without reference to the nature of the employment sought and without regard to established criteria and professional evaluations constitutes an inappropriate use of the Director\u2019s power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">From our review of the record in this case we are satisfied that each of the issues raised by the College is clearly without merit. Here, as in the Flanders matter, there is substantial credible evidence in the record to support the findings and conclusions of the Division Director. We perceive no sound basis for disturbing them. <em>Jackson v. Concord </em>and <em>State v. Johnson, </em>both <em>supra. </em>An unlawful sex discrimination in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>10:5-12 (a) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>N. J. S. A. </em>10:5-4 was clearly established by the proofs before the Division. Amply supported by the evidence, the Director found that Dr. Hollinshead was denied a promotion to full professor <em>solely </em>because of her sex. This being so, his order that the College forthwith promote her to the rank of full professor, retroactive to July 1, 1972, was in the circumstances an entirely reasonable exercise of authority granted to him by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>10:5-17 to require the respondent (College) to take affirmative action including the \u201cupgrading of employees.\u201d The hearing examiner, in his \u201cconclusions of law,\u201d observed in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">The record contains almost no derogatory information about her [Dr. Hollinshead], Moreover, witnesses for the respondent [College] admitted that males with less qualifications had been promoted in the past. In addition, at the exact same time that Dr. Hollinshead was being denied promotion, a male from the same department was promoted to full professor even though there is testimony that this male professor and Dr. Hollinshead were considered \u201con a par\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">Hi \u2756 Hi Ws*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">Respondent did deny promotion to Hollinshead while promoting males of inferior and equal qualifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">These findings and conclusions of sex discrimination which could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record, considering the proofs as a whole, support the Director\u2019s action in ordering the \u201cforthwith\u201d p\u201domotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The affirmative action provisions of the Director\u2019s order of March 11, 1975 are entirely consonant with the legislative policy expressed in <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>10:5-17:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">* * * it is patently clear that the Legislature intended to create an effective enforcement agency in order to eradicate the cancer of discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\"><em>[Jackson v. Concord Co., supra, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>at 124]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">We find no legal infirmity in any of those provisions of the Director\u2019s order so long as the provision therein requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>consideration for faculty promotions to be given first to women is not intended to prefer women above men or to subordinate the promotion of qualified men to women in a manner of reverse discrimination. If this directive is merely intended to insure women <em>consideration </em>of their applications, as the Attorney General appears here to argue, then we do not find it susceptible to a reverse discrimination charge. And see <em>Passaic Daily News v. </em>Blair, 63 <em>N. J. </em>474 (1973), wherein the Supreme Court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">This court has heretofore adopted a broadly sympathetic construction of the Law Against Discrimination and has interpreted the provisions thereof pertaining to the remedial powers of the Division on Civil Rights and the Director thereof with that high degree of liberality which comports with the preeminent social significance of its purposes and objects, [at 484]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In each of the matters herein, the final decision and order under review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
