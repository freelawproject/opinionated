A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A-q\">Claimant Shirley Schoenfeld appeals from a final decision of the Board of Review in the Department of Labor and Industry holding her ineligible for Special Unemployment Assistance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Claimant was employed as a Title I teacher\u2019s aide by the Lakewood Board of Education until June 25, 1976, when the schools closed for the summer. On July 10, 1976 she filed a claim for Special Unemployment Assistance (SUA). On July 22, 1976 she was held ineligible for SUA benefits for the reason that she was employed in an instructional capacity by an educational institution and had a contract or understanding to return to work for the board of education in the fall. She appealed to the Appeal Tribunal which, after a hearing, reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Her appeal to the Board of Review resulted in a remand for a rehearing. After rehearing, the Appeal Tribunal held that plaintiff had \u201cat least an understanding to return to work in the Fall, if not more\u201d and again held her ineligible for SUA benefits. The Board of Review affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Claimant\u2019s application for benefits was made under the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Act of 1974, as amended by the Special Unemployment Assistance Act of 1975. 26 <em>U. 8. C. A. </em>\u00a7 3304 n. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>(1978 pocket parts at 259 <em>et seq.). </em>The purpose of SUA is to \u201cestablish a temporary Federal program of special unemployment assistance for workers who are unemployed during a period of aggravated unemployment and who are not otherwise eligible for unemployment allowances under any other law.\u201d 26 <em>U. 8. C. A. </em>\u00a7 3304 n. \u00a7 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The statute has been amended several times (see, <em>Pub. L. </em>94-32; <em>Pub. L. </em>94-45; <em>Pub. L. </em>94-566). The section applicable to claimant\u2019s claim reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">An individual who performs services in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution or agency shall not be eligible to receive a payment of assistance or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>a waiting period credit with respect to any week commencing during the period between two successive acadamic years (or, when the contract provides instead for a similar period between two regular but not successive terms, during such similar period) if \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">(1) such individual performed services in any such capacity for any educational institution or agency in the first of such academic years or terms; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">(2) such individual has a contract to perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution or agency for the later of such academic years or terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">[ 26 <em>V. S. O. A. </em>\u00a7 3304, n. \u00a7 203(b)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">See, <em>Harvey v. Director, Department of Emp. Secur., R. I. </em>385 <em>A. </em>2d 1057 (Sup. Ct. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The Appeal Tribunal proceeded under the mistaken impression that ineligibility for benefits could be predicated upon the existence of \u201ca contract or understanding to return in the Fall\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and made the following factual findings,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">The employer testified that the school board was notified that Federal funds were allocated for the position of Title I teacher aides for the school year 1976-77 early in the Spring of 1976. She further testified that the claimant and all aides had been notified in a general discussion that these funds had been allocated and there was an oral agreement that they would return in the Fall providing nothing unforeseen happened. They normally work under a written contract, the current one ending June 30, 1976 and the new one was signed the end of September 1976 for the claimant to start October 1, 1976.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The Appeal Tribunal held that (1) claimant was employed in an instructional capacity and (2) she had \u201cat least an understanding\u201d to return to work in the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Our review of the record satisfies us that these factual findings are supported by ample credible evidence in the record, and wc will not disturb them. However, that is not the end of our inquiry for the statute limits ineligibility to the situation where an individual has a <em>contract to </em>perform such services upon the commencement of the new school year. 26 <em>U. 8. O. A. </em>\u00a7 3304, n. \u00a7 203(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Courts which have considered the construction of the word \u201ccontract\u201d as used in this statute have held it was not the intent of the Congress that \u201ccontract\u201d be given a strictly formal construction. In <em>Williamson v. Mississippi Employment Secur. Com\u2019n., </em>347 <em>So. </em>2d 978 (Miss. Sup. Ct. 1977), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u00cdC**!*\u00bb******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Given the background and stated purpose of the Act, it becomes apparent that the Legislature did not intend the word \u201ccontract\u201d in the context of the Act to be given a strictly formal construction. In light of this, where a teacher in a school system has previously contracted on an annual basis with the option to be paid in either nine or twelve month periods, and, there is a <em>reasonable ewpectation of employment </em>after the recess, such will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of a \u201ccontract\u201d for the purposes of the Emergency Employment Compensation Act. [at 980; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">A similar interpretation was given to the word \u201ccontract\u201d as used in this statute in the cases of <em>Harvey v. Director, Department of Emp. Secur., supra, </em>and <em>Robinson v. Administrator, Dept. of Employment, La., </em>356 <em>So. </em>2d 477 (Ct. App. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">In <em>Harvey v. Director, Department of Emp. Secur., supra </em>at 1062, the court said, \u201cCongress has manifested a clear intent to deny these [referring to SUA benefits] benefits to teachers who are temporarily unemployed during the period between terms * *</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">We conclude that the findings of the Appeal Tribunal concerning the nature of the understanding existing between claimant and her employer describes at least an implied contract sufficient to comport with the statutory intent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Giving a liberal interpretation to the word \u201ccontract,\u201d claimant is not eligible for SUA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The decision of the Board of Review affirming the Appeal Tribunal and holding plaintiff ineligible for Special Unemployment Assistance benefits is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The Appeal Tribunal erred in holding that the controlling statute was <em>Pub. L. </em>94-32. This statute had been amended by <em>Pub. L. </em>94\u2014 45. Further, the Appeal Tribunal, in both its decisions, incorrectly quoted the statute. Under the statute as quoted, ineligibility would occur if an individual had a contract or <em>understanding </em>to return to work in the fall. Actually, both statutes base ineligibility upon the existence of a \u201ccontract\u201d to perform services.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
