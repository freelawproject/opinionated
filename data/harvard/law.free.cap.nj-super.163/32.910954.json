J. S. A. </em>40:45B-2, was not void for failure to comply with the Open Public Meetings Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>10 :4-6 <em>et seq. </em>(Sunshine Law).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">[il] The appointment terminated at the time of the November 1977 election and therefore the question of the validity of the appointment <em>per se </em>is moot. Nevertheless, since the \u201cSunshine Law\u201d is of rather recent enactment and state and local bodies need guidance as to the proper construction of that act, that need justifies treatment of the moot issue. <em>Cf. Crifasi v. Oakland Governing Body, </em>156 <em>N. J. Super. </em>182 (App. Div. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We reject defendants\u2019 contention that a meeting \u201crecessed\u201d from one day to the next day may be resumed on the following day without any new notice to the public. The clear intent of the act is to allow adequate notice of all public meetings <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>10:L-7). Where no emergency exists, adequate notice in conformity with the statute <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>10:4-9 (a) and 10:4-8(d)) must be given. Even in emergency situations, the act specifically provides a substituted manner for giving notice. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>10:4-9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\"> Defendants\u2019 alternate contention, that the meeting was \u201cadjourned\u201d and therefore they need only comply with the notice provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>10:4-8(d) \u201cto the greatest extent possible under the circumstances,\u201d rests on the existence of this statement in the \u201cGuidelines on the Open Public Meetings Law,\u201d 98 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>1081, 1084 (1975). We do not think the \u201cGuidelines\u201d are particularly persuasive in this matter. We cannot accept the suggestion that anything less than the statutorily defined \u201cadequate notice\u201d may be given in a nonemergency situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">There is no indication that these \u201cGuidelines\u201d were promulgated by the Attorney General, whose interpretation would be persuasive with this court <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>52:17A-4(e); <em>Evans-Aristocrat Industries, Inc. v. Newark, </em>140 <em>N. J. Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>226, 229 (App. Div. 1976), aff\u2019d 75 <em>N. J. </em>84 (1977)), or by any person who had special knowledge of the legislative intent. We will not follow the path set down in the \u201cGuidelines,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>creation of an exception to notice requirements, absent clear necessity, because the act requires strict adherence to the letter of the law. <em>Polillo v. Deane, </em>74 <em>N. J. </em>562, 578 (1977); <em>cf. Rice v. Union Cty. Reg. High School Bd. of Ed., </em>155 <em>N. J. Super. </em>64, 70 (App. Div. 1977), certif. den. 76 <em>N. J. </em>238 (1978). Moreover, the act itself is silent on notice problems of an adjourned meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The only impetus that would necessitate a public body calling a meeting without 4-8-hour notice is the appearance of an emergency. In those cases N. <em>J. S. A. </em>10:4-9(b) sets forth the proper procedure to be followed in calling an emergency meeting and giving notice of it. If no emergency exists, there is no reason not to give adequate notice, under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>10:4-8(d), of a special meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">We reject the notion that an emergency existed here. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>10:4-9(b) allows an emergency meeting to be held where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">(1) such meeting is required in order to deal with matters of such urgency and importance that a delay for the purpose of providing adequate notice would be likely to result in substantial harm to the public interest * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The Attorney General has defined an emergency situation in terms of a \u201ccrisis.\u201d ITe states further, \u201cIt may be that the need for such a meeting is great but the emergency not of such nature as to require an immediate meeting.\u201d <em>Attorney General Formal Opinion </em>No. 29 ,(1976) at 8 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The alleged \u201csubstantial harm\u201d that would have -resulted from the failure to call an \u201cemergency\u201d meeting here would have been the holding of a municipal election at the cost of $1,200. Such election would have been necessitated by the council\u2019s failure to fill that body\u2019s vacancy within 30 days, as required by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:45B-2. The council had had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>one meeting on this matter two days before the meeting in question but had been unable to break a tie vote. The meeting in question was held on the last day of the 30-day limit for appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Certainly the holding of an election, part of the democratic process, does not constitute a harm as designated by the statute. Neither does the expenditure of $1,200 to finance the election constitute \u201csubstantial\u201d harm, especially when balanced against the harm done from failing to give adequate notice to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In any event, the council failed even to comply with the notice provisions of the emergency section of the act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>10:4 \u2014 9 (fo) (3), only notifying newspapers of the meeting the day after the meeting was held and three days after the meeting was \u201ccalled\u201d by vote of three-quarters of the members of the council. Further, the council failed to make an announcement of the fact that the meeting constituted an emergency and enter that announcement in the minutes. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>10 <em>-A </em>\u2014 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
