J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AYJ\">The defendant appeals his conviction of the offense of causing death by careless and heedless operation of an automobile, in violation of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:113-9, entered upon a jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">Defendant was arrested for driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, following an accident in which defendant\u2019s vehicle struck two pedestrians. During the police investigation at the scene and at police headquarters, and before defendant was given any <em>Mimnda </em>warnings, he made certain statements to the police concerning the circumstances surrounding the occurrence of the accident, including his consumption of alcohol prior to the accident. Subsequent to the making of said statements, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of the pedestrians died as a result of the injuries he suffered and, thereafter, defendant was charged with the present criminal offense. At the criminal trial defendant\u2019s statements were admitted into evidence by the trial jndge. Defendant contends that the statements were not admissible because they were not preceded by a notice or warning of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In essence, defendant urges that the statements should not have been admitted against him, since to do so was in violation of his rights as laid down in <em>Miranda v. </em>Arizona, 384 <em>U. S. </em>436, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The law in New Jersey is plain that <em>Miranda </em>warnings need not be given to a person arrested for or charged with a violation of the motor vehicle laws such as drunken driving, before investigatory questioning of him. <em>State v. M acule j 57 N. J. </em>1 (1970). In short, \u201cthe rules of <em>Miranda </em>should be held inapplicable to all motor vehicle violations,\u201d <em>Macule </em>at 16, and statements obtained from defendant are admissible against him in prosecutions for such motor vehicle violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> Here, of course, the statements were offered and admitted into evidence in the prosecution of a criminal offense arising out of the accident. This circumstance, however, affects neither the validity nor the admissibility into evidence of the statements. If, in the context of the circumstances attendant upon the making of the statements, the statements are valid and admissible, without <em>Miranda </em>warnings, in a prosecution of the charge as to which they were taken, they retain their valid character and are equally admissible in a subsequent prosecution of a criminal offense. As well stated in <em>Clay v. </em>Riddle, 541 <em>F. </em>2d 4-56 (4 Cir. 1976). in addressing a very similar situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">s' s' s- [g ]inee the challenged statement arose in the environs of the unlawful highway operation of an automobile, its statute is rated on that measure. Those, circumstances mold its character permanently. When lifted out of the milieu of its origin, obviously the initial character as a declaration in a traffic case is retained, [at 4591</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Accord, <em>People v. </em>Tale, 45 <em>Ill. </em>2d 540, 259 <em>N. E. </em>2d 791 (Sup. Ct. 1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 401 <em>U. S. </em>941, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>944, 28 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 222 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Defendant also contends that his sentence was excessive. The contention is clearly without merit. <em>B. </em>2:11-3 (e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
