On appeal, the defendant, Kenneth D. Slowik, claims that the court improperly rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Darin R. Dockter and Mia L. Dockter, because (1) there was no evidence that the plaintiffs actually, reasonably relied on his alleged misrepresentation when they entered into the contract for the purchase of the property, (2) the plaintiffs did not elect promptly the equitable remedy of rescission and (3) the court admitted expert testimony of a witness who had not been disclosed as an expert. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. In January, 2003, the plaintiffs filed an application for a prejudgment remedy against the defendant. The complaint attached to the application alleged that on or about July 1, 2002, the plaintiffs entered into a contract to purchase residential property at 29 Jacobson Farm Road in East Hampton from the defendant. It also alleged that to induce the plaintiffs to purchase the property, the defendant represented to them that the quantity and quality of the water supply was adequate. The complaint further alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>quantity of the water supply was not adequate, that the defendant\u2019s representations to the contrary were known by the defendant to be false and were made with the intention of inducing the plaintiffs to purchase the property, and that the plaintiffs relied on the defendant\u2019s representations. The plaintiffs paid a price far in excess of the value of the property, and expended sums in an effort to correct the problem of an inadequate water supply and to secure alternate living arrangements. The prayer for relief alleged damages, exemplary damages, attorney\u2019s fees and such other relief as the court deemed fair and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The parties presented evidence in September, 2003, and thereafter submitted briefs to the court, which heard arguments of counsel on December 18, 2003. The court rendered its judgment on January 7, 2004. The court found the following facts. The plaintiffs purchased the property from the defendant on August 29, 2002. Attached to the July 1, 2002 contract of sale was a residential property disclosure report, required by General Statutes \u00a7 20-327b,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which the defendant had completed. The defendant answered \u201cno\u201d to item ten, \u201cDrinking water problems? Quality or quantity? Explain.\u201d The defendant testified that he answered no to the question because, at the time he completed the report, there were no problems with the water and he did not know that he should have included information concerning past problems that were resolved by replacing the pump in 1995 and hydrofracting<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the well in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The plaintiffs looked at the house on July 1, 2002, and made an offer that was accepted. They twice returned to the property before the closing to take measurements and to meet with William Neal, who was hired to perform a well inspection. Neal submitted a report after testing the flow of water for one hour. The report indicated there was an average flow rate of 4.5 gallons per minute, which is suitable for family use. When he testified, Neal admitted that the statement in his report that the well recovery rate in and of itself \u201cdoes not determine the capacity of the well to produce water,\u201d was not completely accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">During one of the plaintiffs\u2019 visits to the property, the defendant tried to explain hydrofracting to Darin Dockter. Darin Dockter asked the defendant if there was a problem with the well. The defendant responded that there was no problem with the well but that he had hydrofracted it because his neighbors had hydrofracted their wells to increase the water flow. The plaintiffs moved into the property several days after the closing at the end of August, and the next day the well ran dry.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The plaintiffs called on Eastern Drill Company (Eastern) for assistance. Randall Auclair and Andre Barabe, both of Eastern, testified about the services they had performed on the well for both the plaintiffs and the defendant. They hydrofracted the well for the defendant in the fall of 2001 with little or no improvement in the recovery rate. In 2002, Auclair recommended that the plaintiffs deepen the well from 600 to 1000 feet and have a zoned hydrofracting performed. There was no guarantee of success. The recommended work was performed at a cost of $25,000, but it provided little improvement in the water flow rate. According to Auclair, wells previously had been dug in most areas of the property without success, and the only area in which a well had not been dug was near the septic field, which had to be skirted to avoid contaminating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>well. The cost of digging another well was $40,000, and there was no guarantee of success. The plaintiffs chose to wait. Auclair testified that the test performed by Neal prior to the closing demonstrated only how well the pump worked; it did not measure the well\u2019s recovery rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Barabe, a well driller and pump expert, had worked on the well for the defendant in 2001 and for the plaintiffs in 2002. He, like Auclair, saw the parts of two or three pumps lying in the area of the well in 2002 that were not present in 2001. The pump Barabe pulled out in 2002 was not the pump that he had worked on at the well in 2001. He thought that someone else had worked on the pump after he had provided services for the defendant in 2001 and before he did work for the plaintiffs in 2002. According to Barabe, the well can be filled with 11,500 gallons of water without recovery and that a pump bums out when it pumps dry. Barabe did not perform hydrofracting services for any of the neighboring properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Lori Slowik, the defendant\u2019s first wife, and the defendant purchased the property in 1990. Two weeks before closing in December, 1990, the well went dry. Another well was dug, but it too went dry. A third well then was constructed. The third well performed well until 1995 when the pump burned out. A new pump was installed, but Lori Slowik had to use her water consuming appliances with care. She could not operate them simultaneously. She divorced the defendant and moved from the property in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">According to the defendant, after the third well was dug in 1990, he had no problems with the water until 1995 when the pump burned out. Thereafter, there were no water restrictions for showers, laundry, hot tub, dishwasher, grass and shrubbery. In 2001, just before he married his second wife, the well failed, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>called Eastern. Representatives of Eastern recommended hydrofracting the well but stated that Eastern could not perform the services prior to the defendant\u2019s wedding. Because the wedding reception was to be held at the property, the defendant had a water supplier connect a water truck to the house for several days. According to the defendant, after the hydrofracting was performed, there were no restrictions on water use or problems with the well. Because the defendant and his second wife wanted to have a home of their own and to be closer to their places of employment, the defendant sold the property to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Dale Ursin, who has lived across the street from the subject property since 1994, testified that he saw a water wagon on the property on two occasions. The first instance occurred in the fall of 2001 when there was a party at the house, and the truck remained for several days. He saw a second water truck on the property about the time the house was sold to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Due to the property\u2019s limited water supply, the plaintiffs obtain their drinking water every weekend in gallon jugs from Salmon Brook, use a commercial Laundromat for washing their clothing, hand wash dishes \u2014 except for a sterilizing rinse in the dishwasher, use toilets two or three times per flush and rotate taking showers. Also, they cannot have a garden or entertain guests on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The court set out the elements of an action in fraud: A false representation made as a statement of fact, the statement was untrue and known to be untrue by the party making it, the statement was made to induce the other party to act on it and the other party acted on it to his injury. See <em>Kilduff v. Adams, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 314, 329, 593 A.2d 478 (1991). It noted that although the elements of fraud must be proved by clear and convine-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>ing evidence, damages may be proved by the preponderance of the evidence. See id., 326-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The court concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to rely on the defendant\u2019s statement in the residential property disclosure report that there were no water problems as to quality or quantity. The court noted that the report became part of the parties\u2019 contract of sale. The court found that the defendant had discussed with Darin Dockter the hydrofracting done in September, 2001. In response to Darin Dockter\u2019s question, \u201cWas there a problem with the well?\u201d the defendant falsely represented the fact that there was no problem. He volunteered that the well had been hydrofracted in 2001, saying that he had done so because his neighbors had hydrofracted their wells to increase the flow of water. In fact, the defendant had called in Eastern because there was little or no water coming from the well, and the recommended hydrofracting provided little improvement. The defendant obtained water from a water truck at the time of his second wedding. Furthermore, Eastern had not provided hydrofracting services to any of the neighboring properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The court, citing <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Gershman, </em>18 Conn. App. 652, 656-57, 559 A.2d 1171 (1989), reasoned that the defendant\u2019s failure to make a full disclosure about the condition of the well was a false representation to induce the plaintiffs to purchase the property. The defendant knew of the well\u2019s continuing problem as evidenced by Barabe\u2019s observations that someone other than he had worked on the well between September, 2001, and the time he worked on the well for the plaintiffs. The defendant also knew from his conversations with Auclair that the well could be filled with water from an outside source. Water from an outside source would be sufficient to provide a satisfactory water flow rate for the test performed by Neal. The defendant should have made a full disclosure of the condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the well, and his failure to do so was the equivalent of an intentional false representation made to induce the plaintiffs to purchase the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The court also concluded that there was no reason for the plaintiffs to change their reliance from the defendant\u2019s representations to those of Neal. Neal was hired to do the radon and septic tank testing. He used the same water to test the septic system\u2019s capacity that he used to record the well\u2019s water flow rate. The court considered the disclaimer in Neal\u2019s report that \u201cthis test is neither a guarantee nor a warranty of the ability of the well to provide water in similar amounts in the future,\u201d to conclude that there was no reason for the plaintiffs to switch their reliance on the defendant\u2019s representations of his twelve year experience with the water supply to a one hour test with such a disclaimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The court explained that generally, relief is restricted to reasonably foreseeable damages that flow from the character of the representation itself and the ability to mitigate damages but that there are exceptions. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>183 Conn. 51, 58, 438 A.2d 811 (1981). The situation at the property is not one with a guaranteed remedy. The only area on the property where a well had not been dug was in the area of the septic system, which presented the potential for pollution. There was no guarantee that a well dug in that area would provide an adequate water supply, and it would cost $40,000 to dig. The plaintiffs did not bargain to have a water truck or tower on their property, as the defendant suggested, even if they were permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">To make the plaintiffs whole as a result of the defendant\u2019s fraudulent conduct, the court ordered rescission of the contract and that the defendant pay the plaintiffs the purchase price of $317,000, $25,000 for the cost of deepening and hydrofracting the well, and attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>fees. The plaintiffs were ordered to convey the property back to the defendant. The defendant appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that he is entitled to a judgment in his favor, as a matter of law, because there was no evidence that the plaintiffs actually, reasonably relied on his misrepresentation when they entered into the purchase contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The defendant has not raised a claim regarding the court\u2019s factual findings or its legal conclusion that he committed fraud with respect to the well on the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, he argues that, as a matter of law pursuant to <em>Giametti </em>v. <em>Inspections, Inc., </em>76 Conn. App. 352, 824 A.2d 1 (2003), he cannot be held liable for the representations he made on the residential property disclosure report. We use the plenary standard to review a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>87 Conn. App. 699, 708, 867 A.2d 111, cert. granted on other grounds, 273 Conn. 934, 875 A.2d 545 (2005). \u201cWhere legal conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts found by the [court].\u201d <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Gershman, </em>supra, 18 Conn. App. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The simple answer to the defendant\u2019s argument regarding <em>Giametti </em>v. <em>Inspections, Inc., </em>supra, 76 Conn. App. 352, is that the facts are distinguishable. Unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the situation here, the defendant owner in <em>Giametti </em>did not know of the carpenter ant infestation at the time she signed the residential property disclosure report. The trial court there did not find that the defendant was guilty of fraud but that she made a negligent misrepresentation. Id., 357. In reversing the judgment, this court held that a plaintiff may seek relief under \u00a7 20-327b \u201conly for a <em>knowing </em>misrepresentation in the statutory report.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. In this case, the court found that the defendant had known for many years of the well\u2019s limited ability to produce water and that he was guilty of fraud. For this reason, <em>Giametti </em>does not control this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The defendant also argues that <em>Giametti </em>cannot be distinguished on the basis of fraudulent, as opposed to negligent, misrepresentation and that there was no finding that the plaintiffs relied on his misrepresentations. First, the court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to rely on the residential property disclosure report to sign the contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the court did not articulate the statement as a finding of fact, we cannot construe it in any fashion other than to address the element of reliance necessary to prove fraud. The court\u2019s finding is implicit, if not explicit. Second, the court found more than one instance in which the defendant misrepresented to the plaintiffs the condition or quality of the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">This court addressed a disquietingly similar factual situation and legal claim years ago in <em>Bernard, </em>v. <em>Gersh-man, </em>supra, 18 Conn. App. 652. In that case, the \u201cplaintiff purchased a house from the defendants in April, 1987. After her first visit to the house with an agent, she made an offer that was accepted. Before the closing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>she went to the house to take some measurements. At that time, the defendants showed her how to work the water pump. They told the plaintiff to be careful not to run more than one water using appliance at a time, but said that with regard to the water supply she could \u2018lead a normal life.\u2019 The day after she moved into the house, the system ran out of water after two flushes of the toilet and two showers. Even with minimal use, the system ran out of water. The plaintiff had the well tested for its recovery rate and discovered that the depth of the well and the recovery rate were not adequate for normal household purposes.\u201d Id., 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u201cUsually, mere nondisclosure does not amount to fraud. . . . Nondisclosure may, however, amount to fraud when there is a failure to disclose known facts under circumstances that impose a duty to speak. . . . In addition, once a vendor undertakes to speak on a subject, the vendor must then make a full and fair disclosure as to that subject.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 656. In <em>Bernard, </em>this court concluded: \u201cThere is no merit to the claim made by the defendants that once the plaintiff had signed the contract, their subsequent misrepresentations could not have induced the plaintiff to purchase the property. At least until title passed and the purchase price was paid, the plaintiff had the right to refuse to accept a deed and to recover any provable damages. ... An action will lie for a fraudulent nondisclosure that causes one to continue in a course of action.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 656-57; see also <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 56 (seller misrepresented capacity of septic system).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The conclusion of this court in <em>Bernard </em>is applicable to the facts of this case as well. First, the defendant misrepresented on the residential property disclosure form facts about the quality and quantity of the water on the property. Second, the defendant took the initiative to ask Darin Dockter about the result of the well test and responded in the negative to Darin Dockter\u2019s direct inquiry about ever having had a problem with the well. The defendant also misrepresented to Dockter the reason he had had the well hydrofracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">For these reasons, the court concluded properly that the plaintiffs relied on the defendant\u2019s representations that there was no problem with the quantity of water in the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court improperly awarded the equitable remedy of rescission despite the fact that the plaintiffs did not elect rescission promptly and offer to restore the parties to the status quo ante. We decline to review this unpre-served claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">We have gleaned the following procedural history from our review of the record and trial court file.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The complaint the plaintiffs served on the defendant to commence this action alleged a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation and money damages but did not allege the elements of rescission or include a prayer for rescission. The prayer for relief, however, included a request for \u201csuch other relief as the court deems fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>and proper.\u201d On June 2, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a motion for permission to amend their complaint to add two counts and, most relevantly, to add a prayer for rescission. The defendant did not file an objection to the request to amend but sent a letter about the request to amend the complaint to the court\u2019s case flow office, in which he claimed merely to be prejudiced, but without explanation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the motion to amend apparently was presented to two different courts,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> neither court ruled on the motion to amend in proceedings prior to the presentation of evidence, a practice this court does not condone.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>agreed to present evidence and to let the court decide whether to grant the amendment after it had heard all the evidence. See footnote 10. After the plaintiffs rested, the defendant did not move for a directed verdict on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 not having presented evidence of their offer to rescind the contract. At the conclusion of the evidence, the parties were instructed by the court to submit simultaneous briefs and thereafter to present oral argument. The substance of the argument in the defendant\u2019s posttiial brief was that the plaintiffs did not prove the element of reliance in their fraud case. The plaintiffs argued for rescission in their posttrial brief. At oral argument before the court, the defendant\u2019s counsel argued that the defendant did not have the mens rea to defraud the plaintiffs and that the court should not grant the extraordinary remedy of rescission because the plaintiffs had the option of placing a water tank on the property to supply water. At no time did the defendant argue that the plaintiffs failed promptly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>to elect to rescind the contract or that they had failed to plead or to prove that they had offered to rescind the contract.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">For the first time on appeal, the defendant claims that the plaintiffs did not elect promptly to rescind the contract. \u201c[T]he theory upon which a case is tried in the trial court cannot be changed on review .... Moreover, an appellate court should not consider different theories or new questions if proof might have been offered to refute or overcome them had they been presented at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>82 Conn. App. 505, 517, 844 A.2d 949 (2004). \u201cOur rules of procedure do not allow a [party] to pursue one course of action at trial and later, on appeal, argue that a path he rejected should now be open to him. ... To rule otherwise would permit trial by ambuscade.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pekera </em>v. <em>Purpora, </em>273 Conn. 348, 361, 869 A.2d 1210 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">This court has said many times that it will not review a claim that is not distinctly raised at trial. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201cA claim is distinctly raised if it is so stated as to bring to the attention of the court the precise matter on which its decision is being asked. ... A claim briefly suggested is not distinctly raised.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Hall-Brooke Foundation, Inc., </em>30 Conn. App. 129, 134, 619 A.2d 863 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\"><em>Baker </em>v. <em>Cordisco, </em>37 Conn. App. 515, 521-23, 657 A.2d 230, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 907, 659 A.2d 1207 (1995), is instructive. In <em>Baker, </em>the plaintiff claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the trial court improperly permitted \u201cthe defendant to file a special defense on the eve of trial and, in turn, ordered the plaintiff to respond to that defense.\u201d Id., 521. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the court \u201cdeprived her of constitutional due process and the fifteen day filing period provided by the rules of practice for filing responsive pleadings.\u201d Id. The plaintiff, however, did not assert before the trial court her claims of a violation of due process or the rules of practice. Id., 521-22. \u201cThe plaintiff did, however, assert before the trial court an argument that she would be prejudiced if the defendant were allowed to amend the pleadings by filing a special defense that claimed that the [motor vehicle collision at issue] was caused by the sole negligence of [a third party]. The plaintiff asserted that she might be required to seek a continuance or further discovery or to take other action in order to prevent surprise and prejudice.\u201d Id., 522. The plaintiff did not seek a continuance or demonstrate prejudice; id., 523; although the trial court agreed to meet those requests when and if they were made. Id., 522 n.5. This court declined to review the plaintiffs claims of a due process violation and a violation of the rules of practice because they were not distinctly raised in the trial court. Id., 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u201cWhen a party raises a claim for the first time on appeal, our review of the claim is limited to review under either the plain error doctrine as provided by Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, or the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>68 Conn. App. 303, 308, 791 A.2d 621, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 920, 797 A.2d 518 (2002). The defendant here, however, has not requested either plain error or <em>Golding </em>review of his unpreserved claim. This court often has noted that \u201cit is not appropriate to engage in a level of review that is not requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. When \u201cthe parties have neither briefed nor argued plain error [or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>Golding </em>review], we will not afford such review. See <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Granby Holdings, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 95, 99, 644 A.2d 325 (1994).\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Cordisco, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 522 n.4. For these reasons, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s second claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court abused its discretion by permitting a fact witness to render expert testimony because the witness had not been disclosed as an expert as required by Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (4).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree because even if we were to assume that the court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony, which we do not, the error was harmless because the defendant has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">During their case-in-chief, the plaintiffs called Auclair, a well drilling contractor, to testify. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel inquired about Auclair\u2019s background and experience without objection. Auclair testified that he has been in the well drilling business since 1952 and has been a principal of Eastern, a business that provides well drilling services, since 1967. During the respective times that they owned the property, both the defendant and the plaintiffs called on Auclair and his company to provide services for the well on the property. Auclair testified about water flow in a well, the type of test needed to assure adequate water flow, hydrofracting, soil composition, well repair in general and the type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>services he had provided to each of the parties. The defendant did not object to that portion of Auclair\u2019s testimony. Auclair, however, compared himself to a physician when assessing the situation at a well in that he observes the area of the well to determine the problem, if any. With respect to the well at issue here, he determined that it was a problem well. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected, stating that Auclair was giving expert testimony and that he had not been disclosed as an expert witness.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s counsel also objected when Auclair testified as to the reasons a pump may bum out.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u201cThe standard of review we apply to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is well settled. Such mlings are enti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>tied to great deference. . . . The trial court is given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>broad latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will not disturb such a ruling unless it is shown that the ruling amounted to an abuse of discretion. . . . Even when a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is deemed to be improper, we must determine whether that ruling was so harmful as to require a new trial. ... In other words, an evidentiary ruling will result in a new trial only if the ruling was both wrong and harmful.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>85 Conn. App. 383, 399, 857 A.2d 412, cert. denied, 272 Conn. 902, 863 A.2d 695 (2004). \u201c[B]efore a party is entitled to a new trial because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, he or she has the burden of demonstrating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>that the error was harmful. . . . The harmless error standard in a civil case is whether the improper ruling would likely affect the result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Uriah </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>261 Conn. 575, 580-81, 804 A.2d 795 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">On the basis of our review of Auclair\u2019s testimony that the defendant claims the court improperly admitted, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion and that the evidence was not harmful to the defendant. Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (4) is \u201cintended to furnish a [party] with the details of [another party\u2019s] reliance on expert testimony in order to assist him with the preparation of his case. The rules of discovery are designed to make a trial less a game of blindman\u2019s [buff] and more of a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest extent possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Co., </em>58 Conn. App. 225, 231-32, 753 A.2d 404, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 925, 761 A.2d 751 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In this instance, the defendant knew that Auclair was to testify at trial and, in fact, deposed him prior to trial. The defendant objected to Auclair\u2019s comparing the manner in which he evaluates a well to the way in which a physician may observe a patient for signs of illness or disease. On the basis of his having observed broken pump parts scattered at the site of the well in question, Auclair testified that he knew that it was a problem well. The first step in our analysis, to continue the physician analogy, is to note that this court has held that treating physicians who are not disclosed as expert witnesses are limited in their testimony to facts within their personal knowledge, such as observations of a patient\u2019s condition. <em>Sung </em>v. <em>Butterworth, </em>35 Conn. App. 154, 158-59, 644 A.2d 395 (1994), appeal dismissed, 235 Conn. 400, 665 A.2d 893 (1995). There is no reason that the same rule should not apply in this case. The defendant did not object to Auclair\u2019s testifying on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>basis of his observations. In rebuffing the defendant\u2019s objection, the court stated that Auclair testified, on the basis of his observations at the well after his services were requested by the defendant, that the well was a problem well. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Although we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Auclair to testify on the basis of his observations at the well, we also note that the defendant was not prejudiced by this testimony. Even though Auclair\u2019s testimony comparing himself to a physician was not responsive to the question asked, we agree with the plaintiff that in this instance, where the case was tried to the court, the testimony was harmless. Furthermore, the substance of Auclair\u2019s assessment that the well was a problem well was to state the obvious. One need not be an expert to know that a well intended to provide water for a single-family home is a problem well if it does not produce enough water. That question, however, is different from one asking why the well does not produce enough water. We note that the defendant did not object to the plaintiffs\u2019 questions concerning the reason the well did not produce water. We also observe that although the defendant objected to Auclair\u2019s providing expert testimony, he himself propounded hypothetical questions to the witness.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For these reasons, we conclude that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>properly admitted Auclair\u2019s testimony that the well in question was a problem well.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-327b (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, each person who offers residential property in the state for sale, exchange or for lease with option to buy, shall provide a written residential condition report to the prospective purchaser at any time prior to the prospective purchaser\u2019s execution of any binder, contract to purchase, option, or lease containing a purchase option. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> Hydrofracting is the process of putting pressurized water into a well to force out mineral deposits that may be clogging the geology surrounding the well.

The defendant has not distinguished the two in his brief but relies primarily on <em>Giametti </em>v. <em>Inspections, Inc., </em>76 Conn. App. 352, 824 A.2d 1 (2003), to argue that he cannot be held liable for his representations in the residential property disclosure report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b482-11\"> In a one sentence footnote, the defendant \u201cvigorously denies committing any fraud or misrepresentation, intentional or otherwise.\u201d He has not, however, raised a claim on appeal of insufficient evidence of fraud or that the court applied an improper standard of fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\"> Both plaintiffs testified that they relied on the defendant\u2019s disclosure on the residential property disclosure report, and Darin Dockter testified that he also relied on his conversation with the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> It appears that this case is another in the line of cases, including <em>Miller </em>and <em>Bernard, </em>that the Uniform Property Disclosure Condition Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-327b, sought to avoid. \u201c[T]his bill will help to resolve many problems of miscommunications which frequently complicate and sometimes prevent residential closings from going forward by making it clear what a seller has disclosed to the buyer about the property. 38 H.R.

What is the water situation there with respect to wells, and what are the options that are available to [the plaintiffs]?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: In my experience, the property that we speak of is a difficult piece of geology to construct the well in. There\u2019s several factors that create this one. It\u2019s a mica schist formation that sometimes \u2014 or many times we find mica schist more difficult to get water in than any other geology that I work in. . . . The \u2014 one of the problems [the defendant] had made me aware when I first talked to him was that they had to recase his well because of a cave-in condition, the rock was so soft.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: What does that mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: That means that additional casing had to be seated into the well to hold the well from collapsing upon itself. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: Okay. Did [the defendant] indicate to you, when you spoke with him, that he had had any other problems with his well or wells?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">\u201c[The Witness]: They \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk about other wells [the defendant] may or may not have drilled on his property. We pretty much stayed with this particular situation, but there were signs around his well that indicated to me that there was a problem well. We \u2014 and it\u2019s a rule in the well drilling business, the more debris and stuff \u2014 drill tools, pump part, etc., you see around the well, the more problematic the well probably is. And one of the things that caught my eye, like a doctor would notice somebody who\u2019s very uncomfortable or holding onto his chest or something, these are some of the indicators that I read when I go on a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, if I may, is the witness testifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>as to what his general observations in the business are or specific observations that he had on this property? It seems to me like he\u2019s almost going into expert testimony speaking as a doctor, but I\u2019m curious about specific\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u201cThe Court: I thought he . . . had already been qualified as an expert, and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Well, he hasn\u2019t been disclosed as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u201cThe Court: Pardon?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: He has not been disclosed as an expert witness. And I\u2019m not questioning his qualifications. I\u2019m questioning the area of testimony that we\u2019re getting in. If he\u2019s got specific . . . observations, I have no objection regarding this property. It\u2019s when he starts making comments about his abilities to diagnose, quote, unquote, a problem well, but he\u2019s not making specific observations about this property. And if there are specific observations, then I withdraw the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u201cThe Court: I thought this was an observation of this problem well on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: I\u2019m just speaking to the fact that he seems to be holding himself out as \u2014 like he said, as a doctor who could diagnose a situation or make observations about a property. Again, if he\u2019s got specific observations \u2014 I know he\u2019s got experience, I just want to know what the specific observations are. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: And Mr. Auclair, did you make any observations at this particular property that there was detritus around the well that indicated that this was a problem well?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: There were signs there to show me that this well had been worked on prior to my being there. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: Two thousand and one. Okay. Thank you. And that was when you were there with [the defendant]? Correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">\u201c[The Witness]: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: Alright. And what signs, at that time, did you see \u2014 -what physical things did you see that, based on your experience, indicated to you that this well had had problems in the past?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-18\">\u201c[The Witness]: I saw, on the ground next to the well, a pump \u2014 pump end; that is, the end of the pump that pumps, and I saw two motors that I assumed were burned out motors or motors that had worn out. Generally, a motor is damaged from heat. Heat could be from lightening or it could be from lack of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-19\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: Why would heat occur from lack of water?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-20\">\u201c[The Witness]: Well, what happens is that when a pump operates, it\u2019s pumping water. The \u2014 it needs\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b492-21\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object to this line of questioning again. He has not been disclosed as an expert witness. I have no objection to him [testifying] to his observations on this property. There\u2019s been no formal disclosure of him as an expert witness. Without that, I\u2019m <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>going to need time to get my own expert to give me my own opinions regarding conditions of wells and why pump motors would need to be replaced and things like 1hat. His observations I have no problem with; he\u2019s got a lot of experience, but he hasn\u2019t been disclosed as an expert, and we haven\u2019t had an opportunity to examine him as an expert. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: They did take his deposition, Your Honor. But it seems to me that, based on not a hypothetical but what he saw on this property, he has indicated that he has got enough experience to testify, based on what he saw on this property, as to this well, what the indicators were that there was a problem with the well. I don\u2019t think he necessarily had to be disclosed as an expert to testify as to that. He worked on the well. This isn\u2019t an expert we\u2019re calling in to judge somebody else\u2019s work; this is his own work he\u2019s testifying about.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: I would agree to the extent that he talks about the condition of the well that he worked on. Right now, lie\u2019s about to testify about pump motors and why they would have been and why they would have needed to be replaced. He didn\u2019t work on those pump motors. He didn\u2019t replace them. There\u2019s been no disclosure that he\u2019s a pump motor expert in any way. He worked on the well. He didn\u2019t work on the pump motors.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u201cThe Court: He\u2019s indicated that this is his observation. Even if he\u2019s not called as an expert, he\u2019s called as a witness, and, of course, he does have a certain expertise to indicate what he observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: For him to say that he saw them there, again, I have no objection. For him to start saying why they were there, I mean, unless he's got . . . some documents that says he\u2019s examined those pump motors. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">\u201cThe Court: He indicated that when he sees motors burned out near a well, in normal circumstances, that they\u2019ve burned out because of lack of water.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> On cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s counsel questioned Auclair, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A2B\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Okay. You testified about your experience with wells.</p>\n<p id=\"A9m\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"Aae\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Would you agree or disagree that if you\u2019ve got a \u2014 what a consumer or what a customer considers a problem well, that one of the possible courses \u2014 causes\u2014or one of the possible drains on that well could be, for example, a leaking toilet \u2014 chronically leaking toilet; in other words, a toilet that keeps running, never stops the floating device?</p>\n<p id=\"AXN\">\u201c[The Witness]: I can tell you that I have seen wells that are depleted of water because of a leaking toilet, and I would add to that, for your edification, that once that leaking toilet was taken care of, if the well had adequate water, then it would immediately recover.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
