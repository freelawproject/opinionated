The plaintiff, Althea S. Dinan, alleged that the testator, her husband Albert A. Garofalo, was under the undue influence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of his daughter, Anne Patten, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>when he executed a codicil to his will in anticipation of his marriage to the plaintiff. The codicil republished the will, which devised nothing to the plaintiff. The plaintiff appeals following the judgment of the Superior Court on appeal from the Probate Court, rendered in accordance with the jury verdict in favor of the defendant administrator, Donat C. Marchand. The plaintiff claims that the court, in addition to excluding improperly testimony regarding Patten\u2019s alleged threats, improperly deprived the plaintiff of a final closing argument, instead granting the defendant such argument. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">At the time the testator executed his will on December 4, 1995, he was a widower with one child, Patten, and three grandchildren. The will named as beneficiaries the testator\u2019s granddaughter, Nicole Toth, Patten, and a residuary trust of which Patten was trustee and Patten and the three grandchildren were beneficiaries. Patten was named executrix of the estate, and Toth was named successor executrix. On December 5, 1997, two days before his marriage to the plaintiff, the testator executed a codicil to his will. It provided in relevant part: \u201cI am executing this instrument in anticipation of my marriage to [the plaintiff] on December 7, 1997 and direct that my marriage subsequent to the execution hereof shall not be construed to revoke my will. . . . Except as [previously] specified [in the codicil], my Will shall continue in full force and effect as executed by me on and dated December 4, 1995, without other or further direct or implied amendment, modification or alteration. I hereby reaffirm and republish my Will subject only to the amendments thereof [in this codicil].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff and the testator were married as planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The testator died on July 21, 2000, survived by the plaintiff, Patten and his three grandchildren. Patten offered the will and codicil for admission to probate on July 25, 2000. The plaintiff challenged the admission of the instruments, but later withdrew her objections while reserving the right to appeal, at which time the instruments were admitted as the testator\u2019s will. The Probate Court granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition to appeal from the admission of the instruments. Additionally, upon the plaintiffs petition, the Probate Court removed Patten as executrix of the testator\u2019s estate and declined to appoint Toth successor executrix. The Probate Court instead named the defendant, an attorney with no beneficial interest in the estate, as administrator c.t.a., d.b.n. The plaintiff made a timely election against the will as surviving spouse. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-436.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court on the ground that the testator executed the codicil to his will \u201cwhile under the influence, domination and control of Patten, and as a result of this influence, domination and control, unduly and improperly exerted, the will and codicil were not the free and voluntary expression of the testamentary intent of the Decedent.\u201d Trial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>held from April 1 to April 8, 2004, following which the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, finding that the will and codicil were executed properly, that the testator had the proper testamentary capacity to execute the codicil and that the codicil was not procured by undue influence. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict after denying the plaintiffs motion to set it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly excluded testimony by three witnesses relating the wording of threats Patten allegedly made to the testator prior to his execution of the codicil. We reject the plaintiffs demand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">\u201c[W]e will set aside an evidentiary ruling only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion. . . . [B]efore a party is entitled to a new trial because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, he or she has the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. . . . The harmless error standard in a civil case is whether the improper ruling would likely affect the result. . . . When judging the likely effect of such a trial court ruling, the reviewing court is constrained to make its determination on the basis of the printed record before it. . . . In the absence of a showing that the [excluded] evidence would have affected the final result, its exclusion is harmless.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kalams </em>v. <em>Giacchetto, </em>268 Conn. 244, 249-50, 842 A.2d 1100 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">At trial, the plaintiff testified that she was unaware that the testator had executed the codicil until the two shared a conversation on their honeymoon. When counsel for the plaintiff inquired farther as to the conversation, counsel for the defendant objected and the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>was excused.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff made the following offer of proof:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Could you . . . tell the court what the conversation was with [the testator] when you found out about the codicil . . . the evening after you got married? . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: He said to me, I made a power of attorney to Nicole and I did a codicil to my will. And I said, how come? And he said, well, in case anything happened to me, he said, I had to give somebody the authority, and I didn\u2019t want to give it to Anne. And he said that Anne raised such holy hell about making a codicil that I had to make the codicil. He said a couple of more things after that, but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: What else did he say?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: He said that she threatened him. She wouldn\u2019t come to the wedding. She wouldn\u2019t bring the grandchildren to the wedding. She was never going to see him again. She wouldn\u2019t let the grandchildren have any contact with him or see him. She wouldn\u2019t give him the papers that he needed because there was a problem at the [convalescent home the testator owned]. The state was investigating and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office was getting involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: She had records of his?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes, she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: And she said she wouldn\u2019t \u2014 and he told you that she told him that she wouldn\u2019t give him the records?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: That\u2019s right. And [the testator\u2019s attorney] had problems getting the documents from her that were needed to protect [the convalescent home] from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>payback to the state of Connecticut for the problems that she [Patten] had created ....</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: This was told to you on Sunday night?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Sunday night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The defendant objected on several grounds, arguing that the testator\u2019s statements were inadmissible under <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>57 Conn. 127, 140, 17 A. 757 (1888), the dead man\u2019s statute; General Statutes \u00a7 52-172;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and because they constituted hearsay within hearsay.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff responded that the testator\u2019s statements were being offered not for the truth of the matter asserted therein, but as proof of the testator\u2019s state of mind when he executed the codicil several days before making the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The court excluded as inadmissible hearsay the portion of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony reporting the testator\u2019s statement regarding Patten\u2019s threats, concluding that the testator was not relating his state of mind, but rather, a conversation. In so doing, the court relied on <em>Vivian\u2019s Appeal, </em>74 Conn. 257, 50 A. 797 (1901), which similarly concerned the exclusion of hearsay declarations by the testator regarding the exertion of undue influence. Our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[e]vidence was properly excluded of declarations of the testator as to how he came to make the will; that it was made under constraint proceeding from his wife; and that in certain other matters he had acted under her domina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tion. They were mere hearsay.\u201d Id., 260-61. The court also excluded the testimony on the basis of the rule of <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 57 Conn. 140, audits progeny, which excludes from evidence the admissions against interest of one legatee that might affect adversely the interests of other legatees. See <em>Carpenter\u2019s Appeal, </em>74 Conn. 431, 434, 51 A. 126 (1902); <em>Livingston\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>63 Conn. 68, 76, 26 A. 470 (1893). The court in the present case relied on the dead man\u2019s statute and the nonhearsay use of \u201cstate of mind\u201d in allowing the plaintiff to testify about a significant portion of her conversation with the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">After the juiy returned, the plaintiff was allowed to testify as follows regarding the conversation she had with the testator:</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Did [the testator] say he had a conversation with [Patten]?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"pAzim\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Did he say how he felt or what he feared or anything of that nature as a result of these conversations with [Patten]?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: He was afraid that she would \u2014 he would not see her, he would not see his grandchildren, she would not give him the documents that he needed because the state was investigating [the convalescent home] .... He was frightened and he said [that] that\u2019s what he was afraid of.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: And did he say that fear had anything to do with signing the codicil?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes, that\u2019s the reason he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: . . . Did you have any further conversation about that on the honeymoon?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u201c[The Plaintiff]: He said he was sorry he did it.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Okay. Anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: He said that he\u2019d take care of it when we came back from the honeymoon.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Thereafter, the plaintiff sought to introduce testimony by Constantine Scarveles, a handyman and driver frequently employed by the testator, recounting the substance of a conversation he testified that he had overheard between the testator and Patten in the testator\u2019s office during the days immediately preceding the execution of the codicil. Patten previously had testified that she had not been to see the testator for at least three months prior to his executing the codicil. The court allowed Scarveles to testify as to what he had observed, but again excluded, on the basis of <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 57 Conn. 140, testimony of the words Patten actually used. Thereafter, Scarveles testified that he had observed a loud argument between the testator and Patten and that the testator used words to the effect of \u201cdon\u2019t threaten me, don\u2019t yell at me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Jean Hall, an employee of the convalescent home, also testified that she observed an argument between Patten and the testator in the days prior to the execution of the codicil. The court again excluded testimony regarding Patten\u2019s actual words<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but allowed Hall to testify that the testator spoke during an argument about \u201cchanging the paper.\u201d Hall testified on cross-examination that she recalled Scarveles being present at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>time of the argument and that, by \u201cchanging the paper,\u201d she was referring to the codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We first consider the admissibility of the proffered testimony of the plaintiff, Scarveles and Hall relating Patten\u2019s alleged threats in light of the rule of <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 57 Conn. 140. <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>does not apply, as its facts distinguish it from this case. The court, therefore, improperly excluded the testimony on the basis of that rule. The error, however, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\"><em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>was an appeal from probate involving both a challenge to the testatrix\u2019 testamentary capacity and a claim of undue influence. Id., 129. The Supreme Court held that the Superior Court properly excluded evidence of a legatee\u2019s earlier declaration before the Probate Court that the testatrix was without testamentaiy capacity. Id., 140. The court reasoned that the legatee\u2019s admission against interest would have potentially affected the inheritance of the other two legatees, thereby causing them to suffer an injustice. Id. \u201c[I]nasmuch as the law has compelled [the other legatees] to submit their several and individual rights of property in this estate to the issue of a proceeding which also determines those of [the declarant], it, in avoidance of great injustice, has suspended in their favor the operation of the rule that a party to a proceeding may prove the admissions of his adversary. Of necessity, the use of [the declarant\u2019s] admission against him would be to use it against all other legatees; and the appellant may not enforce his right against [the declarant] at the expense of [the other legatees]. If there be a misfortune in the situation, it must be upon the appellant.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\"><em>In Livingston\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 63 Conn. 76, the declarant was a legatee alleged to have unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>influenced the testatrix. The court excluded testimony of his admission against interest on the ground that it might have affected negatively the interests of the other legatees, with whom the declarant\u2019s interests were not aligned. Id. The court remarked that \u201cof necessity the use of the admission would be in effect to use it against all other legatees. Such would clearly have been the practical operation, since the contest was against the whole will, and the claimed statement related to the will as a whole.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In arguing in favor of the application of that rule, the defendant brings to our attention the practical result of the plaintiffs successfully contesting the codicil. The codicil prevented the revocation of the will by operation of law at the time of the plaintiffs marriage to the testator. See footnote 2. The successful contestation of the codicil, thus, would render the testator intestate. Application of the intestacy statutes would result in an equal distribution of the estate to the plaintiff and Patten. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-437<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 45a-438.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Toth, to whom the testator specifically devised his home, and the three grandchildren as beneficiaries of the residuary trust, would be disinherited.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">This case shares in common with <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>the fact that one legatee\u2019s words were offered into evidence in an effort to contest the validity of a will, and those words potentially had adverse effects on the interests of other legatees. Patten\u2019s interests under the will and codicil were not the only interests which the evidence, if admitted, might have affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>adversely. See <em>Carpenter\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, 74 Conn. 434. The rule of <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>however, applies more narrowly than that. It is distinguishable from this case because of the nature of the declarant\u2019s words. <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>and cases following it all have involved a statement, or admission, against pecuniary or proprietary interest by the legatee, in which the legatee stated that the testator lacked capacity or was under undue influence at the time of execution and then later sought to take under the will. Patten\u2019s alleged declaration, however, was not an admission against interest. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (3).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather than being an admission that the codicil was invalid, it is a statement by a legatee that the plaintiff asserts provides a basis on which the court should declare the codicil invalid. Patten has maintained at all times that the will and codicil were properly executed and never has stated that the testator was under the undue influence of herself or any other person. Had she made such a statement, the rule in <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>would apply. See, e.g., <em>In re Dolbeer\u2019s Estate, </em>153 Cal. 652, 662, 96 P. 266 (1908) (evidence of declaration against interest by legatee that testatrix was insane properly excluded). Thus, the court improperly excluded the witnesses\u2019 testimony relating Patten\u2019s alleged threats on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">On the issue of harmfulness, we conclude that the court\u2019s improper ruling was harmless with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the plaintiffs testimony because, as we conclude in part I B, it properly was excluded as hearsay. As for the testimony of Scarveles and Hall, because no offer of proof was made as to either, we cannot determine whether the court\u2019s ruling, assuming impropriety, was harmful.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We next consider whether the court improperly excluded the plaintiff\u2019s proffered testimony on the ground that it constituted inadmissible hearsay. We conclude that the court\u2019s decision was proper.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The plaintiff argues that her testimony relating the testator\u2019s description of Patten\u2019s alleged threats should not have been excluded as hearsay because it was offered not for the truth of the matter stated therein, but for the effect of the threats on the testator. Essentially, the plaintiff argues that the truth of whether Patten intended to carry out her threats was irrelevant, and instead, the fact that they were made is important to this case. Although we agree that the truth of Patten\u2019s intent to carry out the alleged threats is irrelevant and the issue of whether they were made is relevant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>plaintiff has failed to provide a hearsay exception or nonhearsay use for the second out-of-court statement, in which the testator related his argument with Patten to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">There are two out-of-court declarations in the plaintiffs proffered testimony. A hearsay exception or non-hearsay use is necessary for each. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-7; see also footnote 6. The first is Patten\u2019s alleged threats to the testator. The second is the testator\u2019s declaration relating the alleged threats to the plaintiff. We agree with the plaintiff that there is a valid nonhearsay use for the first out-of-court declaration, namely, that it is offered not for its truth, but for its effect on the testator. \u201cAn out-of-court statement is not hearsay . . . if it is offered to illustrate circumstantially the declarant\u2019s then present state of mind, rather than to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>70 Conn. App. 378, 390, 797 A.2d 1174, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 920, 806 A.2d 1056 (2002); see also C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 8.9.1, pp. 577-78. The plaintiff, however, attempted to testify as to the content of a conversation she had with the testator. In so doing, she attempted to testify to the truth of the matter that the testator related to her, which constitutes hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The plaintiff argues that Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (4),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the exception for a then-existing mental or emotional condition, provides an exception for the testator\u2019s declaration. We disagree. The two fatal flaws with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>argument are, first, that the testator\u2019s statement to the plaintiff did not relate his ifeen-existing mental or emotional condition, and second, that the excluded portion of the testator\u2019s statement was not one of his state of mind. Rather, it related his <em>past </em>mental or emotional condition following a conversation. \u201cTestimony of a statement of a decedent may be introduced to show his or her state of mind <em>at the time the statement was made.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 8.19.4 (a), p. 627. The testator\u2019s state of mind some three days after executing the codicil was not, therefore, admissible.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The plaintiff also claims that the court improperly sequenced closing arguments and allowed the defendant a final closing argument. Following the close of evidence, the defendant was allowed to make his closing argument first, followed by the plaintiff. The defendant then was allowed a final closing argument and the plaintiff was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The plaintiff argues, as she did to the trial court, that because she bore the burden of persuading the jury that the codicil was the product of undue influence, she was entitled to first and final closing arguments and that the defendant was entitled only to one closing argument. The defendant counters that, as the proponent of the instrument, he bore the burden of persuading the jury that the codicil was properly executed and that the testator had testamentary capacity, and, therefore, the court had the discretion to order first and final closing arguments to either party. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>We apply the standard of review applicable to similar claims in criminal cases because the wording of Practice Book \u00a7 42-35 is nearly identical to the section governing closing arguments in civil cases, namely, Practice Book \u00a7 15-5 (a). The plaintiff bears a heavy burden in demonstrating that the court abused its broad discretion in its ordering of closing arguments. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kellman, </em>56 Conn. App. 279, 286, 742 A.2d 423, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 939, 747 A.2d 4 (2000). \u201cIn reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is given to the trial court\u2019s decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness. . . . We will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling only if it could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 15-5 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[u]nless the judicial authority for cause permits otherwise, the parties shall proceed with the trial and argument in the following order: (1) The plaintiff shall present a case in chief. (2) The defendant may present a case in chief. (3) The plaintiff and the defendant may present rebuttal evidence in successive rebuttals, as required. ... (4) The plaintiff shall be entitled to make the opening and final closing arguments. (5) The defendant may make a single closing argument following the opening argument of the plaintiff. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">At trial, the defendant proceeded first with his casein-chief, in which he bore the burden of persuasion as to the testator\u2019s proper execution of the will and codicil and as to the testator\u2019s testamentary capacity at execution. The plaintiff then presented her case-in-chief as to her claim of undue influence. Thereafter, each side was allowed to put on rebuttal evidence, after which evidence was closed and the parties delivered their closing arguments as previously described.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Although the proper execution and testamentary capacity were not hotly contested issues, the defendant nonetheless had to prove them. Thus, the defendant bore an initial burden of persuasion to establish the validity of the will and codicil. Thereafter, the plaintiff bore the burden of persuading the jury that the codicil was procured by undue influence. Although the issue of undue influence was the primary issue of the case, we conclude that because each side bore a burden of persuasion, the court properly could have ordered closing arguments either way in its broad discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Furthermore, it has traditionally been the case that the will proponent proceeds prior to the will opponent. \u201cOn an appeal from the probate of a Will, the proponent should open and close even though he or she may be the appellee. The proponent has the affirmative burden of proof as to the validity of the Will.\u201d 8 R. Folsom, Connecticut Estates Practice, Probate Litigation (1992) \u00a7 7:9, p. 276. The court reasonably followed that traditional rule.

It is stated generally that there are four elements of undue influence: (1) a person who is subject to influence; (2) an opportunity to exert undue influence; (3) a disposition to exert undue influence; and (4) a result indicating undue influence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pickman v.

In it, she described the testator\u2019s account of his argument with Patten and that, as a result of the argument, he was afraid that he would suffer the allegedly threatened results unless he executed the codicil. Furthermore, Scarveles and Hall were allowed to testify, as noted, that they observed an argument between Patten and the testator and, further, recounted the testator\u2019s words which were damaging to the defendant\u2019s case. As such, given an adequate record for review, any error in excluding Patten\u2019s actual words likely would have been harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\"> If anything, the court improperly admitted more of the plaintiffs testimony relating the testator\u2019s statements than was proper, thus aiding the plaintiffs case.

Counsel thanked the jurors for their service, reminded the jury that closing arguments are not evidence, asked them to deliberate fairly and honestly, and concluded with the following retort to a statement made by counsel for the plaintiff in his closing argument. \u201cNow, [counsel for the plaintiff] stated in his closing argument . . . that [the plaintiff] never took much from the table. She brought much to the table in this two and one-half [year] marriage with [the testator], but she took very little from it.
