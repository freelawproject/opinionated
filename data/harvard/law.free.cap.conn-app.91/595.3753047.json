On appeal, the defendant claims, inter alia,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the court improperly relied on the testimony of police officers regarding the execution of a search warrant. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our discussion. Christopher Brody, a New Britain police officer, arranged a \u201ccontrolled buy\u201d of narcotics after meeting with a confidential informant. The informant knew of two individuals, one of whom was the defendant, who sold various illegal drugs, such as ecstasy, marijuana and cocaine. The defendant and his partner stored the drugs at a garage located at 205-207 Bassett Street. The defendant resided at 116 Lowell Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">The informant indicated to Brody that the procedure for obtaining drugs from the defendant involved a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>party identified only as \u201cAndy.\u201d The informant would call Andy and request a quantity of illegal drugs. After contacting the defendant or his partner, Andy would pick up the money from the informant, drive to the garage, known as a \u201cstash house,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on Bassett Street, and meet with the defendant or his partner to conduct the illegal transaction. Andy then would return to the informant and give him or her the drugs he had obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On August 8, 2001, Brody met with the informant, who contacted Andy and asked for a quantity of cocaine. Andy arrived and was observed going to the garage on Bassett Street, where he met with the defendant. Both men went into the garage for a short time and then left. Andy was observed returning to the informant, who subsequently turned over a bag containing a white powder later determined to be cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">On August 9, 2001, the garage owned by the defendant again was placed under surveillance. Jerry Chrostowski, a New Britain police officer, observed the defendant arrive, enter a gated area around the garage, proceed into the garage and, after a few minutes, exit the area. At that point, Chrostowski requested assistance, and the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle was stopped by the officers as he was exiting the property. As the defendant was removed from the vehicle, one of the officers noticed, in plain view, a plastic bag sticking out of the defendant\u2019s pocket. A field test indicated that the substance in the bag was cocaine, and the defendant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, applications for two search warrants were prepared by the investigating offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>cers. One of the warrants was for the garage on Bassett Street, and the other was for the defendant\u2019s residence on Lowell Street. The search of the garage, which occurred first, revealed the presence of cocaine and marijuana.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The officers then searched the defendant\u2019s residence and discovered large amounts of cash, a small amount of narcotics, a cellular telephone, a bank statement, a water bill and a rental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">On February 6, 2002, the defendant filed a motion to suppress tangible evidence, verbal statements and written statements. Specifically, the defendant argued that all of the evidence, including evidence from his garage and found on his person, as well as any of his statements made to the police officers, was subject to suppression as a result of unlawful searches and seizures. Following a hearing over the course of several days in July, 2002, the court, <em>Owens, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion on October 18, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>charge of possession of narcotics with the intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 2 la-278 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reserving his right to appeal from the denial of his motion to suppress. The court, <em>Handy, J., </em>sentenced the defendant to a term of incarceration of twenty years, execution suspended after twelve years, with five years probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The defendant raised claims on appeal that relate to three different docket numbers. As a preliminary matter, we must identify the issues raised by the defendant that are properly before us and require a substantive discussion of their merits. The issues raised in the defendant\u2019s brief that pertain to matters that have been waived by the defendant\u2019s nolo contendere plea are not properly before us and warrant no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Stemming from the activity of August 8 and 9, 2001, three separate dockets were generated, all of which contained criminal charges against the defendant. In docket number 197032, the defendant was charged with possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The docket number and accompanying charge appear to have originated from the initial stop of the defendant and subsequent discovery of the bag <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>of cocaine sticking out of his pocket. The state nolled that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Docket number 197033 contained nine counts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Those charges seem to have been lodged as a result of the search at the garage on Bassett street. Following the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the state filed a substitute information with respect to that docket number. The sole charge in the substitute information was possession of narcotics with the intent to sell. The defendant pleaded nolo contendr\u00e9 to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Finally, in docket number 197034, the defendant was charged with possession of narcotics in violation of \u00a7 21a-279 (a). That charge apparently was premised on the results of the search of the defendant\u2019s residence on Lowell Street. The prosecutor also nolled that charge. Thus, despite the multiple docket numbers and charges against the defendant, the only crime that the defendant was found guilty of by virtue of his nolo contendere plea, and received a sentence for, was possession of narcotics with the intent to sell. That judgment of conviction is the only judgment properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">On July 9, 2004, subsequent to the filing of this appeal, the state filed a motion to remand the case to the trial corut for a determination of whether the ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was dispositive of the case. This court granted the state\u2019s motion on September 13, 2004.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court, <em>Handy, J., </em>determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress was dispositive, subject to the following articulation. The initial stop and seizure of the defendant and the statements made by him thereafter were not dispositive, nor was the issue of the money and drugs recovered at the defendant\u2019s residence on Lowell Street. The dispositive issue concerned the drugs seized at the garage on Bassett Street.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">We conclude that the issue concerning the timing of the search of the garage is the only claim reviewable on appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In order to explain our determination, it will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>be helpful to discuss briefly the relationship between a nolo contendere plea and \u00a7 54-94a. \u201cIt is well established that an unconditional plea of guilty or nolo con-tendere, intelligently and voluntarily made, operates as a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects and bars the later assertion of constitutional challenges to pretrial proceedings. . . . Therefore, only those issues fully disclosed in the record which relate either to the exercise of jurisdiction by the court or to the voluntary and intelligent nature of the plea are ordinarily appealable . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasaga, </em>269 Conn. 454, 479, 848 A.2d 1149 (2004). The defendant in the present case entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere pursuant to \u00a7 54-94a. Nevertheless, \u201c[our Supreme Court] has been reluctant to invoke its authority to review an issue raised in connection with a conditional plea of nolo contendere when . . . that issue does not fall within the narrow scope of \u00a7 54-94a.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">A detailed explanation of \u00a7 54-94a is necessary for our discussion. Our Supreme Court has stated: \u201cWhen viewed in light of the definition of subject matter jurisdiction and the statutes that create such jurisdiction, it becomes clear that \u00a7 54-94a neither confers nor curtails appellate subject matter jurisdiction. What \u00a7 54-94a does is abrogate, in certain circumstances, the waiver of constitutional rights that is implicit in a guilty or nolo contendere plea. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\u201cIn enacting \u00a7 54-94a, the legislature created a new, expedited route to the appellate courts but it did not create a new jurisdictional doorway into those courts. Section 54-94a is intended to promote judicial economy by allowing the parties to litigate a suppression or dismissal issue fully in the trial court, and thereafter allowing the defendant to obtain review of an adverse ruling without the parties\u2019 or the court\u2019s expending additional resources.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Piorkowski, </em>236 Conn. 388, 401-402, 672 A.2d 921 (1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>206 Conn. 323, 334-35, 537 A.2d 483 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 98-99, 503 A.2d 136 (1985) (Supreme Court declined review of reserved claims outside scope of \u00a7 54-94a).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The appellate courts in this state consistently have required that \u00a7 54-94a be interpreted strictly. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>267 Conn. 414, 425, 838 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 809, 125 S. Ct. 36, 160 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 375-76, 521 A.2d 547 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>McGinnis, </em>83 Conn. App. 700, 705, 851 A.2d 349 (2004).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For that reason, and to prevent the abuse of the use of conditional pleas, we limit our review to the claim found by the trial court to be dispositive. In this case, the court found that the sole dispositive issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>was the search of the garage that was used as a stash house. We decline, therefore, to review the defendant\u2019s other claims pertaining to the initial stop and seizure of him or the search of his residence at Lowell Street.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, we limit our review to the claim regarding the police officers\u2019 execution of the search warrant for the defendant\u2019s garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The defendant claims that the court improperly relied on the testimony of police officers regarding the execution of the search warrant. Specifically, the defendant argues that the officers executed the search in an improper manner by entering the garage before the warrant had been obtained.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to the defendant, all of the evidence found by the officers was tainted by the premature search and, therefore, should have been suppressed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. The defendant\u2019s garage was enclosed by a fence and a locked gate. At the suppression hearing, Michael Sullivan, a New Britain police captain, testified that he was present at the garage on August 9, 2001. He stated that the search warrant was not obtained until after the defendant had been arrested. When asked how long after the arrest it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>took to obtain the warrant and to return to the garage to execute it, Sullivan estimated that it took \u201ca little less\u201d than two hours.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Using Sullivan\u2019s estimate of two hours, the defendant examined other testimony in an effort to demonstrate inconsistencies with respect to when the officers actually searched the garage. For example, Naik Hasit, the assistant dog warden, testified that he had been called to the garage by Sullivan after the defendant had been arrested. Hasit stated that he went to the other side of the fence and into the defendant\u2019s garage approximately thirty to forty-five minutes after arriving on the scene. Hasit also noted that before he went into the garage, the gate had remained closed and no one had gone over the fence prior to his entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Another witness to the search was the defendant\u2019s neighbor and tenant, Jasmine Sotomayor, who lived in the defendant\u2019s building with her mother. Sotomayor testified that she was in her bedroom at the time that the defendant was arrested. She claimed that while the defendant was present at the scene, she observed that the gate to his property was open and that police officers were on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Other police officers<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> testified that the locked gate was not opened and that the defendant\u2019s garage was not searched until the warrant had been obtained. The court found that although there were some inconsistencies with respect to the timing of the search, there was credible testimony that none of the officers had entered the defendant\u2019s garage before a warrant had been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly credited the testimony of the officers regarding the timing of the search of the defendant\u2019s garage. Specifically, he argues that Hasit arrived at the scene while the defendant was still present, and according to him, the search was conducted within thirty to forty-five minutes. That testimony contradicts, in the defendant\u2019s view, Sullivan\u2019s testimony that after the defendant was arrested, it took approximately two hours to obtain the warrant and to return to the garage to execute it. The defendant also points to the testimony of Sotomayor, who stated that she saw officers inside the fenced-in area while the defendant was present. Finally, the defendant notes that Officer Daniel McA-loon stated that he searched the garage a \u201cshort time\u201d after the defendant had been arrested. Put another way, the defendant contends that the sum of the testimony reveals that the search of the garage occurred before the officers obtained the warrant, and, therefore, any evidence obtained as a result of this invalid search should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">At the outset, we note that \u201c[u]nder both the federal and the state constitutions, the police must first obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>a warrant before conducting a search, unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies. . . . Entry by the government into a person\u2019s home ... is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Outlaw, 70 Conn. App. 160, 164, 797 A.2d 579 (2002). Of course, \u201c[illegally obtained evidence is inadmissible in a criminal trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>258 Conn. 501, 508, 782 A.2d 98 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>224 Conn. 627, 631-32 n.8, 620 A.2d 746 (1993). Finally, we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>70 Conn. App. 232, 797 A.2d 605, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 929, 806 A.2d 1067 (2002), that \u201cpolice may not conduct a search unless they first obtain a search warrant from a neutral magistrate after establishing probable cause. [A] search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is per se unreasonable . . . subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">\u201cUnder the exclusionary rule, evidence must be suppressed if it is found to be the fruit of prior police illegality. <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[371 U.S. 471, 485, 83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1963)].\u201d (Internalquotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>268 Conn. 575, 599, 848 A.2d 1183, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 957, 125 S. Ct. 409, 160 L. Ed. 2d 320 (2004). We have stated recently: \u201cOn appeal, we apply a familiar standard of review to a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress. <em>A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record. . . . </em>[W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision .... Because a trial court\u2019s determination of the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>of a . . . search [or seizure] implicates a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, however, we engage in a careful examination of the record to ensure that the court\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. . . . <em>However, [w]e [will] give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses.\" </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>85 Conn. App. 329, 335, 857 A.2d 376, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 942, 861 A.2d 517 (2004); see also 5 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (3d Ed. 1996) \u00a7 11.7 (c), pp. 399-400. In this case, because the defendant has limited his claim on appeal to the factual determination of when the search occurred, we employ the clearly erroneous standard of review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>supra, 70 Conn. App. 245-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The court heard testimony from Chrostowski that he did not enter the fenced-in area until after a warrant had been obtained. When he returned to the garage, the gate was closed, and, to his knowledge, no other members of the police department had entered the garage or fenced-in area. Additionally, McAloon twice stated that the search was not conducted until a warrant had been procured. Finally, Sullivan stated that no officer entered the area until he unlocked the gate after the search warrant had been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument focuses on the timing of the search. He further requests that we determine that the officers\u2019 testimony was more than contradictory but, in fact, \u201cobjectively false when viewed in light of the totality of the evidence.\u201d Of course, we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>81 Conn. App. 612, 618, 841 A.2d 237 (2004). \u201c[W]e are mindful . . . where there is conflicting testimony, it is uniquely the function of the trier of facts to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>trier of fact is free to accept part of a witness\u2019 testimony and reject another part.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>34 Conn. App. 492, 498, 642 A.2d 47, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 907, 644 A.2d 921 (1994); see also <em>Shah </em>v. <em>Cover-It, Inc., </em>86 Conn. App. 71, 75, 859 A.2d 959 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The court, in its decision, specifically addressed the issue that the defendant now raises on appeal. The court considered the inconsistencies of the officers\u2019 testimony. After reciting the testimony of the various officers, the court stated: \u201cAlthough there are some inconsistencies as to the timing of certain events, the court credits the testimony of the officers that no one entered the garage until a search warrant had been secured.\u201d The court implicitly discredited the statement made by Sotomayor and, as the trier of fact, was within its authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Furthermore, although the time frames provided by the officers appear to be slightly inconsistent, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s finding that the officers did not enter the garage until the warrant had been obtained was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cIf there is conflicting evidence . . . the fact finder is free to determine which version of the event in question it finds most credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">. . . This court cannot sift and weigh evidence. . . . Otherwise, [t]his court would then, by way of fact-finding, be required to adjudicate the validity and the reliability of that evidence. At this stage of the proceedings, we are incapable of making those necessary determinations. . . . Thus . . . the testimony was for the trial court to assess and we have no appropriate role at this level in determining which of the various witnesses to credit.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aloi, </em>86 Conn. App. 363, 375, 861 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>1180 (2004), cert. granted on other grounds, 273 Conn. 901, 867 A.2d 840 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The record reveals that there was substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that none of the officers entered the defendant\u2019s garage before the search warrant had been secured. Additionally, after a thorough and careful review of the record, we are not left with a firm and definite conviction that the court mistakenly made such a finding. As such, we conclude that the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-12\"> As we will discuss, the defendant raised several other claims on appeal that are not properly before us. Accordingly, we need not discuss the substantive merits of those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\"> Jerry Chrostowski, a New Britain police officer, testified that a stash house is a place where narcotics and illegal drugs are stored. Short, frequent visits are the type of behavior that is consistent with a location being used as a stash house. The purpose of a stash house is to prevent the loss of illegal substances by theft and to avoid police detection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\"> Thomas Steck, a detective with the New Britain police department, testified that after the defendant had been arrested, taken to the police station and advised of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), he stated that the officers could expect to find less than one pound of marijuana and approximately ten ounces of cocaine. The inventory from the search indicated that the officers recovered a significantly greater amount of cocaine and marijuana from the stash house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress or motion to dismiss, the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law provided a trial court has determined that a ruling on such motion to suppress or motion to dismiss would be dispositive of the case. The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress or the motion to dismiss. A plea of nolo contendere by a defendant under this section shall not constitute a waiver by the defendant of nonjurisdictional defects in the criminal prosecution.\u201d See also Practice Book \u00a7 61-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\"> \u201cA plea of nolo contendere, while not an express admission of guilt, is tantamount to a finding of guilt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Satti, </em>2 Conn.

App. 700, 705, 851 A.2d 349 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b627-5\"> The court made the following determination concerning the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress: \u201cSo, let me make it clear on the record that there appeared to be three issues in relationship to these motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\u201cIssue number one is the initial stop and the statements that flowed from that stop, dispositive. This court\u2019s response is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\u201cIssue number two, are the drugs that were seized from the stash house referred to as 205-207 Basset Street, New Britain, dispositive. The court\u2019s response is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">\u201cIssue number three, is the money and a small amount of cocaine which was seized from 116 Lowell Street, the parent\u2019s residence where, apparently, the defendant also resided, dispositive and the court\u2019s response to that is no.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\"> With respect to the initial stop and seizure, corresponding with the charge set forth in 197032, the defendant raised three issues on appeal. Specifically, the defendant claims that (1) the officers lacked probable cause to stop his vehicle in the driveway of Bassett Street on August 9, 2002, (2) the officers lacked probable cause to remove him from the vehicle following the stop and (3) Thomas Steck, a detective with the New Britain police department, testified untruthfully with respect to observing a bag containing drugs protruding from the defendant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The defendant also raises three issues on appeal associated with the search of the garage on Bassett Street, which correspond with the charge set forth in the substitute information in docket number 197033. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly (1) relied on the testimony of the officers regarding the execution of the search warrant, (2) concluded that he made statements while in police custody regarding ownership of certain properly and (3) determined that he properly had been advised of and had waived his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), prior to making certain statements while in police custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">The final issue raised by the defendant in his appellate brief concerns the charge contained in docket 197034 that related to the search of his residence on Lowell Street. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly found probable cause to issue a search warrant for that location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>256 Conn. 494, 775 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1052, 122 S. Ct. 639, 151 L. Ed. 2d 558 (2001), our Supreme Court explained that absent good cause, appellate courts should decline to review issues not raised properly within the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a. <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 503. The court also acknowledged that good cause will be established infrequently. Id. The three factors established in <em>Revelo </em>and used by our Supreme Court to find good cause in that case were (1) whether the issue raised by the defendant gives rise to an important issue that transcends the particular case, (2) whether the undisputed facts of the case result in a constitutional violation and (3) whether further clarification of an appellate opinion was necessary. Id., 503-504.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987), our Supreme Court reviewed an issue raised by the defendant\u2019s motion that was outside the ambit of \u00a7 54-94a. The court, using its supervisory powers over the administration of justice, reviewed the claim because the entire record was available, <em>both </em>the state and the defendant had an expectation of appellate review at the time of the plea, and review would preserve judicial resources. Id., 43-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">We conclude that the present case does not fall within the rare situations detailed in <em>Revelo </em>and <em>Chung. </em>The defendant, by entering a nolo contendere plea, effectively waived any nonjurisdictional issues except those within the scope of \u00a7 54-94a. As a result of the trial court\u2019s finding, the only issue properly before this court concerns the search of the defendant\u2019s garage. Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s other issues under the auspices of our supervisory authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> In <em>Madera, </em>the defendant\u2019s plea agreement was specifically conditioned on the right to challenge issues that were outside the ambit of General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a. <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 107 n.13. As a result of our Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that it could not review those claims, there was a failure of consideration in the plea bargain process and, therefore, the conviction was set aside, and the case remanded for further proceedings. Id., 107-108. In the present case, the record does not reveal that the defendant expressly conditioned his plea on the ability to obtain appellate review of specific issues, and, therefore, our refusal to consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s other claims does not unravel the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\"> We note that the defendant has not challenged the validity of the warrant to search the garage, but instead limited his appeal to the manner in which the warrant was executed and certain statements he gave following his arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> Defense counsel examined Sullivan as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Now, captain, how long would you estimate it took to \u2014 after [the defendant] was arrested, to go back to the police department, continue preparing the affidavit \u2014 prepare the affidavit, have a judge review it and sign it, and go back to Bassett Street to execute it?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: Well, anywhere up to two hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">\u201c [Defense Counsel]: So, your estimate is that from the time [the defendant] was arrested to the time you got back to execute the search warrant was about two hours?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: I do not know. I am just guessing. Roughly. Probably. Maybe a little less.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: You are a captain with the New Britain police department. You know, you have done this before, I taire it?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: That is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: All right, so this is a reasonable estimate on your part, two hours?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"> The court stated in its decision that Chrostowski testified that he was unaware of anyone entering the fenced-in area prior to the procurement of a search warrant. Additionally, Officer Daniel McAloon testified that the garage was not searched until the warrant was obtained. Both Steck and Sullivan stated that the locked gate was not opened until they received the search warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\"> Our Supreme Court has noted that \u201c [n] ot every inconsistency constitutes a falsehood.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>193 Conn. 35, 43 n.10, 475 A.2d 269 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
