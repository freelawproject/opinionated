The plaintiff property owners association, Cornfield Point Association (association), claims that the town received less than a fee interest by those deeds and sought to prevent the town from effecting certain improvements to the road ends. The association claimed that the town\u2019s planned uses for the road ends were inconsistent with the purpose for which they had been conveyed and impaired certain rights conferred on the association by a special act of the legislature. The defendant abutting landowners, by way of counterclaims and cross complaints, alleged that regardless of the town\u2019s interest, they had obtained title to three of the road ends by adverse possession. The trial court rendered judgment quieting title in the town, and the landowners and the association have filed separate appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our discussion of the issues on appeal. The road ends in question are strips of land forty feet wide and of varying lengths located at the ends of nine roads in Cornfield Point. The travel portion of each road terminates at its intersection with a perimeter road, and the road ends are short extensions of each road across the perimeter road onto the area abutting the association\u2019s reserved beach on Long Island Sound. The road ends are located at East Lane, Cottage Road, Saltaire Drive, Clearwater Road, Belleaire Drive, Mohican Road, Gates Road, Billow Road and Uncas Road.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They are shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>on a map dated November, 1922, and entitled \u201cCornfield Point Beach Club.\u201d The map, introduced into evidence as plaintiffs exhibit two, can be found in the town\u2019s land records in map volume one, pages 37 and 38, map numbers 130 and 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In its memorandum of decision dated November 26, 2003, the court found that \u201cprior to 1921, Elizabeth C. J. Beach owned the entire portion of Cornfield Point south of Town Beach Road .... On November 21, 1921, Beach conveyed to Gilbert Pratt, by warranty deed, a fee simple interest in twenty-five acres comprising the westerly section of Cornfield Point south of Town Beach Road (\u2018the west parcel\u2019). On August 16, 1922, Beach conveyed to James Jay Smith, by warranty deed, a fee simple interest in 33 acres east of the Pratt parcel (\u2018the east parcel\u2019). In November 1922, both of these parcels were subdivided into lots with various roads designated. On June 19, 1930, Smith conveyed by warranty deed to the Shore and Lake [Corporation] his fee simple interest in the east parcel. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">\u201c[I]n 1932, Pratt held fee simple title in the west parcel, including the roads and road ends at Gates Road, Billow Road and Uncas Road and . . . the Shore and Lake [Corporation] held fee simple title to the east parcel, including the roads and road ends at East Lane, Cottage Road, Saltaire Drive, Clearwater Road, Belleaire Drive and Mohican Road. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">\u201cOn September 28, 1932, the Shore and Lake [Corporation] executed a quitclaim deed that conveyed to the town of Old Saybrook \u2018for highway purposes\u2019 all its right and title in the streets, roads and drives known as East Lane, Cottage Road, Saltaire Drive, Clearwater Road, Belleaire Drive and Mohican Road.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>3, 1932, Pratt similarly executed a quitclaim deed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>conveyed to the town of Old Saybrook \u2018for highway purposes\u2019 all [his] right and title in the streets, roads and drives known as Gates Road, Billow Road and Uncas Road.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On that same day, at an annual town meeting, the town voted \u201c[t]o accept the roads at Cornfield Point, including Town Beach Road, so called.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Six years later, at a December 9, 1938 special town meeting, the town\u2019s board of selectmen voted to \u201cdiscontinue as highways, streets, or roads\u201d the road ends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>in question, which had been damaged by a storm earlier that year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As required by then General Statutes \u00a7 1442 (1930 Rev.),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> now General Statutes \u00a7 13a-49, the board of selectmen submitted their vote to a town meeting for approval. The majority of those in attendance at the town meeting, however, did not approve the board\u2019s proposed discontinuance. Instead, they voted that the town \u201crepair and put in proper condition the road ends at Cornfield Point, as they were before the storm</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Soon thereafter, at a special town meeting held on January 27, 1939, those in attendance \u201cvote[d] their approval . . . for the repairing and filling of the road-ends at Cornfield Point . . . [t]he money for such . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>repairs to road-ends to be used from the Dirt Road fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">On February 10, 1939, the Shore and Lake Corporation executed another quitclaim deed. This deed purportedly conveyed to the town all its right and title in the road ends and all its right and title in so much of the land marked \u201cReserved Beach\u201d on the aforementioned map as was necessary to enable the town to construct a seawall where the southern boundaries of the road ends met the northern boundary of the reserved beach. The deed also reserved to the Shore and Lake Corporation the right to pass and to repass, for all purposes, over the lands described therein in order to access the reserved beach. The purpose of the deed, as stated therein, was \u201cto convey to the [town] all the land necessary to enable the [town] to construct bulkheads or sea wall along the southerly line of [the road ends] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>On July 13, 1943, the legislature passed a special act incorporating the association and making it a body politic. Spec. Acts No. 467, \u00a7 1. The act vested in the association, among other things, \u201cexclusive charge and control of all roads within the limits as shown on the maps referred to in section two [of the act] which are not under state or town control.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Spec. Acts No. 467, \u00a7 12. The act also stated that \u201c[i]f any by-laws or regulation adopted by The Cornfield Point Association shall conflict with any lawful ordinance of the town of Old Saybrook, the ordinance of said town shall prevail and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>supersede the by-law or regulation of said association.\u201d Spec. Acts No. 467, \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Recently, the town developed plans for the improvement of seven of the nine road ends that are the subjects of this litigation. The seven road ends include those at East Lane, Cottage Road, Saltaire Drive, Clearwater Road, Belleaire Drive, Mohican Road and Gates Road. The town proposes to make those road ends more accessible and usable for the general public, primarily as scenic overlooks. The town wants to remove various hedges, fences and other alleged encroachments, and to install permanent markers identifying the boundaries of the road ends, bicycle racks, identification signs and four parking spaces, one at each of the road ends at Mohican Road, Belleaire Drive, Saltaire Drive and Cottage Road. The town also wants to install granite bollards<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> across six of the seven aforementioned road ends in order to prevent vehicles from accessing major portions of the road ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In a memorandum of decision dated November 26, 2003, the court found that the town possesses fee simple title to the road ends. In a second memorandum of decision dated January 29, 2004, the court found that the abutting property owners had failed to rebut the presumption that the road ends were held by the town for public use and that the road ends, in fact, were held by the town for public use.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court, therefore, held that the town was immune from the abutting landowners\u2019 claims of adverse possession. In a third memoran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>dum of decision dated March 15, 2004, the court ordered the town to refrain from installing bollards on the road ends because they unreasonably would interfere with the association\u2019s right of access to the beach,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but the court did not otherwise enjoin any of the town\u2019s proposed use of the road ends, including the installation of several parking spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The defendants James Keating and Salvatrice Keating (Keatings) and the defendants Virginia Dimmock, Carolyn Lyle and M. Allen Northrup (Dimmocks) filed separate appeals challenging the trial court\u2019s judgment quieting title to the road ends on Clearwater Road and East Lane in the town.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The association challenges the court\u2019s quieting of title in the town to all of the road ends. They claim that certain quitclaim deeds conveyed to the town only an easement in the road ends and, therefore, that the court improperly concluded that the town possesses fee simple title to the road ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The Keatings and the Dimmocks also challenge the court\u2019s determination that they failed to prove title by adverse possession to the road ends at Clearwater Road and East Lane. They claim that they proved the existence of each essential element of a successful adverse possession claim against a municipality, including the requirement that the town intentionally abandoned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>relevant road end portions, and, therefore, that the court improperly concluded that the town was immune from their claims of adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In its appeal, the association also challenges the court\u2019s determination that the town could implement all of its proposed improvements to the road ends except for the installation of bollards. The association claims that (1) the court\u2019s decision improperly allows the town to use the road ends in a manner inconsistent with the purpose for which they were acquired, (2) the court improperly concluded that the town\u2019s proposed parking spaces on the road ends do not interfere with the association\u2019s right of access and (3) the court improperly held that the association\u2019s ban on public parking in the streets at Cornfield Point, as authorized by 24 Spec. Acts 311, No. 467, \u00a7 12 (1943) (Spec. Acts No. 467), does not apply to the road ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">FEE SIMPLE</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The association, the Keatings and the Dimmocks all claim that the court improperly concluded that the town possesses fee simple title to the road ends. In support of their claim, they argue that the 1932 deeds were dedications and merely conveyed easements over the road ends to the town for public travel or, more specifically, for highway purposes. According to the association and the property owners, (1) the express conveyance of the \u201croads\u201d and not of the land on which the roads lie, (2) the language in each of the 1932 deeds indicating that the conveyance was intended \u201cfor highway purposes\u201d and (3) the circumstances surrounding the conveyances, in particular the fact that the town voted to accept the roads at an annual town meeting held on October 3, 1932, compel the conclusion that the interest conveyed by each deed was an easement and not fee simple title. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Multiple parties in this case claim a property interest in certain road ends in their entirety or in at least portions thereof. Determining whether the court properly determined each party\u2019s interest in the road ends requires us to construe the relevant terms of the two 1932 deeds and to discern whether they express an intent to convey to the town a fee simple interest in the road ends or merely an easement over them for highway purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\u201c[W]hen interpreting the language of a deed the question is not what the parties may have meant to say, but the meaning of what they actually did say.\u201d <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>215 Conn. 68, 75, 574 A.2d 796 (1990). \u201c[T]he determination of the intent behind language in a deed, considered in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, presents a question of law on which our scope of review is plenaiy. . . . Thus, when faced with a question regarding the construction of language in deeds, the reviewing court does not give the customary deference to the trial court\u2019s factual inferences. . . . The meaning and effect of the [paragraphs in a deed] are to be determined, not by the actual intent of the parties, but by the intent expressed in the deed, considering all its relevant provisions and reading it in the light of the surrounding circumstances .... The primary rule of interpretation ... is to gather the intention of the parties from their words, by reading, not simply a single clause of the agreement but the entire context, and, where the meaning is doubtful, by considering such surrounding circumstances as they are presumed to have considered when their minds met. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u201cFurther, [i]t is a well established principle of construction that wherever possible each part of the scrivener\u2019s phraseology should be given some import. . . . Every word, sentence and provision, if possible, is to have effect, and a construction which requires rejection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>of an entire clause is not to be admitted . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bird Peak Road Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bird Peak Corp., </em>62 Conn. App. 551, 557, 771 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 917, 773 A.2d 943 (2001). \u201cIn the determination of whether a particular conveyance transfers the fee or merely an easement, many courts follow the rule that the intention of the parties is to be gathered from the instrument as a whole.\u201d 23 Am. Jur. 2d 225, Deeds \u00a7 227 (2002); see <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>69 Conn. App. 538, 541, 795 A.2d 1280, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 916, 917, 806 A.2d 1055 (2002) (\u201c[i]n construing a deed, a court must consider the language and terms of the instrument as a whole\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cMoreover, the words [in the deed] are to be given their ordinary popular meaning, unless their context, or the circumstances, show that a special meaning was intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>244 Conn. 206, 215, 710 A.2d 746 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">As a preliminary matter, before analyzing the entire text of each deed to determine whether the court properly determined that each conveyed fee simple title in the road ends to the town, we note additional legal principles that will guide our analysis. First, at the time the deeds in this case were executed, \u201creferences to maps [had] the effect of incorporating them in the deeds referring thereto. . . . The identifying or explanatory features contained in them [were] as much a part of the deeds, and so entitled to consideration in their interpretation, as though they were expressly recited therein.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Barri </em>v. <em>Schwarz Bros. Co., </em>93 Conn. 501, 508, 107 A. 3 (1919). This rule applies even today. See <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>74 Conn. App. 286, 291-92, 812 A.2d 87 (2002), cert. denied, 263 Conn. 908, 819 A.2d 841 (2003); see also General Statutes \u00a7 7-31. With this in mind, we note that the deeds in question expressly reference the map dated November, 1922, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and entitled \u201cCornfield Point Beach Club.\u201d That map clearly includes the road ends as part of the roads, streets and drives to which they are attached. We therefore conclude that any reference in the deeds to a road, street or drive includes the road end attached thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Second, a quitclaim deed may convey fee simple title in real property if the grantor has such an estate. See <em>Villano </em>v. <em>Polimeni, </em>54 Conn. App. 744, 737 A.2d 950 (defendant quitclaimed fee interest in property to plaintiff), cert. denied, 251 Conn. 908, 739 A.2d 264 (1999); 23 Am. Jur. 2d 255-56, supra, \u00a7 276. With that in mind, we note, as stated in the facts discussed previously, that the grantors of the 1932 deeds held fee simple title in the pertinent road ends immediately prior to executing the deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Third, we note that a town may possess fee simple title to a public road. S<em>ee American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 68. The Keatings, relying on the venerable case of <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Conn. 103 (1814), argue that Connecticut law limits a town\u2019s interest in public roads to an easement for public passage and that the fee title to the roads is held by the adjoining landowners. Our reading of that case and of subsequent decisions on the subject, including <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc., </em>does not support such a stark conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 1 Conn. 103, the plaintiff appealed from the jury verdict in favor of the defendant, who, it was alleged, \u201ccontrary to the mind and will of the plaintiff, and without law or right, and with force and arms, entered into and upon the plaintiffs said land; and with the like force and arms erected upon said land one certain dram or grog shop . . . .\u201d Id. The trial court, apparently believing that the town of Waterford possessed title to the highway, instructed the jury that if it found that the acts complained of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>were done within the limits of the highway, the plaintiff could not maintain his trespass action, presumably because he was not the fee titleholder. The jury found in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed. Id., 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">To determine whether the court\u2019s instruction was proper, the Supreme Court considered whether the plaintiff or the town possessed fee simple title in the land on which the highway was located. Five of the eight justices held that the case was to be remanded for a new trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The majority of the court did not agree, however, that the plaintiff possessed fee simple title, nor did the court conclude that fee title to a road or highway could be held only by landowners abutting the highway. Our reading of <em>Peck </em>therefore leads us to disagree with the Keatings\u2019 argument that a town\u2019s interest in a public road is always limited to an easement for public passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Finally, we note that dedication by quitclaim deed can be the manner by which a town acquires, in trust for the public, fee simple title to a public road. See <em>Derby </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>40 Conn. 410, 433, 435, 438 (1873) (holding grantors renounced all claim to street and town held, in trust for public, title to street for purpose contemplated by deed); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Public Hall Co., </em>35 Conn. 430, 431 (1868) (holding that where land conveyed by warrantee deed to town for sole use and purpose as public highway, deed conveyed more than easement, and as long as premises continued to be used for highway, town had complete title in fee to land); 23 Am. Jur. 2d 25, Dedication \u00a7 25 (2002). That being said, some courts, including our Supreme Court, have held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u201cthe estate conveyed by a deed which basically purports to convey <em>land </em>is not cut down to a mere easement by the presence of a reference to \u2018right of way\u2019 or a recital of a purpose consistent with an easement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 23 Am. Jur. 2d 226, Deeds \u00a7 229 (2002); accord <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 72-76. Moreover, even when a deed purports to convey a \u201croad\u201d but does not expressly purport to convey the \u201cland\u201d on which the road lies, we conclude that it still may be construed as passing fee simple title if the deed indicates an intention to do so. See <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 541 (language and terms of deed to be construed as a whole). Once a town acquires fee simple title to a street or road for highway purposes, it is generally said to be held in trust for the benefit of all the public <em>for such purposes. </em>See <em>Winchesters v. Cox, </em>129 Conn. 106, 111-12, 26 A.2d 592 (1942) (by accepting conveyances, town became bound to observe provisions in conveyances concerning use to which land was to be put); 39 Am. Jur. 2d 714-15, Highways, Streets, and Bridges \u00a7 184 (1999).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn our attention to the text of each deed from 1932.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> First, the association and the owners argue that each deed\u2019s explicit reference to \u201croads\u201d and not also to the <em>land </em>on which the roads lie reflects an intention to convey only an easement and not the fee to the land. Recognizing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>our Supreme Court in <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 68, concluded that a deed conveyed fee simple title based in part on the fact that the deed expressly referenced its subject as \u201ca certain narrow strip of land(emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted) id., 73; the association and the owners attempt to distinguish the deeds in this case by pointing out that the deeds here do not expressly reference \u201cland,\u201d but expressly refer to \u201cstreets, roads and drives\u201d instead. Such references, they argue, do not include the land on which those streets, roads and drives lie. Accordingly, they argue that this language reflects an intent to convey only an easement and not the fee to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Even though the deeds do not expressly reference \u201cland,\u201d other segments of the deeds describe the streets, roads and drives in a maimer that we conclude includes the land on which they lie. Specifically, the latter portion of each deed twice describes the streets, roads and drives as \u201cpremises.\u201d The deed from Pratt to Old Say-brook states: \u201cTO HAVE AND TO HOLD, the premises unto it, the said TOWN OF OLD SAYBROOK, and to its successors and assigns, to the only use and behoof of the said TOWN OF OLD SAYBROOK, its successors and assigns forever, so that neither I, the said Releasor nor any other person or persons in my name and behalf, shall or will hereafter claim or demand any right or title to the premises or any part thereof, but they and every of them shall by these presents be excluded and forever barred.\u201d The deed from the Shore and Lake Corporation to Old Saybrook uses almost the exact same language.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Following the rule that words in a deed generally are to be given their ordinary popular meaning; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 215; we note that \u201cpremises\u201d is defined as \u201creal estate\u201d; Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969); or as \u201ca tract of land with the buildings thereon\u201d; Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>(Tenth Ed. 1999); and \u201cis generally said to include a tract of land in the context of conveyancing . . . .\u201d Barron\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed. 1996).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With those definitions in mind and considering the import of other language in the deeds, which we will discuss, we conclude that reference to streets, roads and drives includes the land thereunder, which in turn reflects an intent to convey fee simple title rather than an easement. Furthermore, even if each deed consistently referred to the subject of the conveyance as \u201cstreets, roads and drives\u201d and did not once use the term \u201cpremises,\u201d we still would conclude, for the reasons we will discuss, that the deeds express an intent to convey fee simple title to the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">As the court pointed out: \u201cThe two 1932 deeds use substantially similar language in conveying an interest in the identified roads to the town .... In [their respective] deed[s], the grantors, The Shore and Lake [Corporation] and Gilbert Pratt, \u2018justly and absolutely remise, release, and forever QUIT-CLAIM unto the said TOWN OF OLD SAYBROOK, its successors and assigns forever, for highway purposes, all such right and title as [the grantor] ha[s] or ought to have in or to the [designated] streets, roads and drives . . . .\u2019 The deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>from The Shore and Lake [Corporation] continues on to reserve to Allan T. Speirs and John J. Speirs \u2018the right and easement\u2019 of laying, maintaining and operating water mains, pipes and connections in the conveyed streets .... The deed from Pratt contains a similar reservation of a \u2018right and easement\u2019 to Allan T. Speirs and John J. Speirs to lay, maintain and operate water mains, pipes and connections.\u201d The deed from the Shore and Lake Corporation also reserves to itself, its successors and assigns \u201cthe right and easement of laying, maintaining and operating sewer pipes and connections\u201d in the designated streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Although the language \u201cfor highway purposes\u201d may constitute a recital of a purpose consistent with an easement, it does not, considered in the overall context of each deed, demonstrate an intent to convey only an easement to the town. Considering each deed in its entirety, we are convinced that each deed expresses an intent to convey fee simple title to the town. Looking beyond the \u201cfor highway purposes\u201d language, the court held that each deed\u2019s specific conveyance of \u201c \u2018all such right and title [as it, the said Releasor, has or ought to have]\u2019 in the designated \u2018streets, roads, and drives\u2019 . . . reflects an intent to convey fee simple title to the roads, rather than an intent to grant only [an easement].\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Looking beyond the \u201cfor highway purposes\u201d language ourselves, we also note, as recited previously, that the town and its successors were to have and to hold the premises \u201cto [their] only use and behoof ... so that neither the [grantors] nor any other person or persons in [their] name[s] and behalf, shall or will hereafter claim or demand any right or title to the premises or any part thereof, but they and every of them shall . . . be excluded and forever barred.\u201d That additional language, like that quoted by the court, reflects an intent to convey fee simple title to the town. Barring the reser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>vations to certain parties, including the Shore and Lake Corporation, of rights and easements entitling them to lay, maintain and operate water mains, sewer pipes and connections, both Pratt and the Shore and Lake Corporation expressly renounce <em>\u201cany right or title </em>to the premises or any part thereof . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Such language cannot be construed to reflect an intent to preserve their fee simple title.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">That the Shore and Lake Corporation used the word \u201ceasement\u201d to reserve unto itself and its successors the authority to lay, maintain and operate sewer pipes, and that both Pratt and the Shore and Lake Corporation used that same term to reserve a similar authority to the Speirs and their heirs is further evidence that the deeds conveyed fee simple title to the town. Given their apparent familiarity with the legal term \u201ceasement,\u201d the grantors just as easily could have used it to express the kind of interest they wanted to convey to the town. They chose, however, not to do so. That choice, in combination with the grantors\u2019 use of the other language previously discussed, clearly reflects an intent to convey lee simple title to the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In its decision, the court, drawing on reasoning from <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 74, also held that the grantors\u2019 reservations of easement rights demonstrated an intent to convey fee simple title to the town because if their intent was merely to convey easements in the roads to the town, they would not have needed to reserve easement rights in themselves or in the Speirs. In <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc., </em>our Supreme Court held that the deed in question conveyed fee simple title to the town, reasoning that the grantors\u2019 express reservation of a right to pass over and to cross the roadway \u201cwould have been unnecessary if the grantors had retained fee simple title to the roadway, since the right to use the property for purposes not inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>tent with a nonexclusive easement would have remained with the grantors.\u201d Id., 74. In other words, where the grantor intends to retain fee simple title and to convey a nonexclusive easement to the grantee, the grantor does not have to reserve a right to use the servient premises<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> for a purpose that does not conflict with the grantee\u2019s easement rights. The grantors\u2019 having reserved a right to pass over and to cross the roadway was then, according to our Supreme Court, evidence that they were conveying fee simple title to the town; it would have been unnecessary for them to have made the reservation if their intention was to convey to the town a nonexclusive easement. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The association and the owners argue, however, that the reservations in this case are distinguishable from the reservation in <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc., </em>because Pratt and the Shore and Lake Corporation, which according to the association and the owners conveyed highway easements to the town, anticipated that the Speirs and the Shore and Lake Corporation would conduct activities that would interfere with the town\u2019s use of the roads as highways, namely, laying, maintaining and operating water mains and sewer pipes. In other words, the association and the owners argue that because the anticipated installation and maintenance of pipes beneath the roads by the Speirs and the Shore and Lake Corporation would, at least temporarily, interfere with the town\u2019s rights under the alleged highway easement, it was necessary that Pratt and the Shore and Lake Corporation expressly reserve the right to lay and maintain pipes. As such, the association and the owners argue that the reservation language here does not reflect an intent to convey fee simple title to the town but merely an intent to protect the Shore and Lake Corporation\u2019s and the Speirs\u2019 right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>to perform an activity that, in the absence of a reservation, would impermissibly interfere with the town\u2019s alleged easement rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">We agree that if Pratt and the Shore and Lake Coipo-ration had wanted to retain fee simple title, to convey highway easements to the town and to protect the ability of the Shore and Lake Corporation and the Speirs to lay pipes beneath the roads, they would have been required to reserve expressly, in some fashion, the right to lay pipes beneath the roads, as such an act could arguably be construed as interfering with the town\u2019s alleged easement rights under the deed. As indicated previously, however, we find it compelling that the grantors did not use the word \u201ceasement\u201d to describe the interests of the town. With respect to the Shore and Lake Corporation deed, it is particularly noteworthy that the Shore and Lake Corporation, the grantor, chose to use the word \u201ceasement\u201d to describe <em>its own interests. </em>Considering each deed in its entirety and, in particular, in light of the aforementioned language in which the grantors renounced any right or title they had or may have had, we fail to see anything that would compel us to affix to the word \u201ceasement\u201d a meaning other than its ordinary popular meaning. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 215. We conclude that the reservation language in both deeds reserves easements in the Shore and Lake Corporation and in the Speirs and, thus, reflects an intent to convey fee simple title to the town, the grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">There is no merit to the association\u2019s and the owners\u2019 contention that the town\u2019s vote on October 3, 1932, to accept the roads at Cornfield Point indicates that an easement was intended. Although dedication of a highway easement in 1932 required formal acceptance by the town; see General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 1412; we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>agree with the court that the town\u2019s vote to accept the roads could just as easily be construed as acceptance of fee simple title thereto. Whether the town was voting to accept fee simple title to the roads and road ends or to accept the dedication of an easement was a question of fact for the court. We conclude, in light of each deed\u2019s language, that the court reasonably found that the deeds conveyed and that the town accepted fee simple title.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">ADVERSE POSSESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Alternatively, the Keatings claim that the court improperly concluded that they failed to prove title by adverse possession to a portion of the road end at Clearwater Road, and the Dimmocks claim that the court improperly concluded that they failed to prove title by adverse possession to a portion of the East Lane road end. The Dimmocks and the Keatings specifically challenge the court\u2019s finding that the town, since acquiring the road ends, continually has held for public use those portions that they claim to possess adversely without ever having intentionally abandoned them. The Keatings are aggrieved by the court\u2019s finding because it defeated their claim that they had acquired ownership, through adverse possession, of that portion of the road end at Clearwater Road from a hydrangea hedge to the east. The Dimmocks are aggrieved by the court\u2019s finding because it defeated their claim to have acquired ownership, through adverse possession, of that portion of the East Lane road end lying to the west and south of a hedge running along the eastern edge of their lot. Whether the town, since acquiring the road ends, continually has held for public use those portions that the Dimmocks and Keatings claim to possess adversely without ever having intentionally abandoned them is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>question of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\u201cIt is well established that [t]itle to realty held in fee by a state or any of its subdivisions for a public use cannot be acquired by adverse possession. ... A public entity may claim immunity from adverse possession, however, only to the extent that the property against which a claim has been asserted is held for public use.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 77. \u201c[L]and is . . . held for public use even when a municipality is not presently making use of the land but is simply holding it for development at some later time. Absent some evidence of municipal intention to abandon its plans for future development of the municipal property, the land is immune from claims of adverse possession.\u201d Id., 79-80. \u201cPublic use\u201d includes a myriad of uses, many of which do not involve a physical intrusion on the land. For example, \u201ca municipality might attempt to preserve the character of the community by acquiring open space land or greenbelts . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 80. \u201cIn light of the myriad of public uses that may be advanced through public ownership of undeveloped lands . . . property that is held in fee simple ownership by municipalities must be <em>presumed to be held for public use. . . . </em>[T] he party seeking title by adverse possession must bear the burden of rebutting that presumption. . . . Moreover, the rationale underlying the immunity of municipalities from adverse possession, that the public should not lose its rights to property as a result of the inattention of a governmental entity . . . applies with even greater force to situations involving undeveloped lands, which may, by their nature, gamer even less attention from local governments suffering from the constraints of scarce fiscal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>resources.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Because we agree with the court that the 1932 deeds conveyed fee simple title to the town in the road ends, the propriety of the court\u2019s decision rejecting the Dim-mocks\u2019 and Keatings\u2019 claims of adverse possession rests exclusively on the question of whether the town, after acquiring the road ends, has continually held them, including the disputed portions, for public use without ever having intentionally abandoned them. See id., 77, 79-80. That is a question of fact. See <em>Kelo </em>v. <em>New London, </em>268 Conn. 1, 67, 843 A.2d 500 (2004), aff'd, 545 U.S. 469, 125 S. Ct. 2655, 162 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2005); <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>74 Conn. App. 622, 631, 814 A.2d 396 (abandonment is question of fact and intent to abandon may be inferred as fact from circumstances), cert. denied, 263 Conn. 901, 819 A.2d 836 (2003); <em>Kroll </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>58 Conn. App. 262, 266, 753 A.2d 384 (2000) (describing issue in <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, </em>Inc.\u2014 whether land held for public use \u2014 as question of fact). \u201cTo the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The court found that the town, since acquiring the road ends, continually has held them and all disputed portions for public use without ever having intentionally abandoned them. Considering the legal principles previously set forth, we therefore examine whether this finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Held for Public Use \u2014 Intentional Abandonment (Keatings)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In contesting the court\u2019s finding that the town has always held for public use and never intentionally abandoned the disputed portion of the road end at Clearwater Road, the Keatings rely heavily on a statement from <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Quadrato, </em>142 Conn. 398, 404, 114 A.2d 687 (1955): \u201cThe controlling factor is the use to which the realty was put after its acquisition.\u201d The Keatings interpret that statement to mean that, after acquiring land, a municipality must actually use it for a public purpose in order to be considered as holding the land for public use. They then argue that \u201cthe record is devoid of either any evidence of repair or any evidence that the town took <em>any </em>action with respect to the Clearwater Road end from the hydrangea hedge to the east.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) They further state that \u201c[s]ince 1939, the town made no improvements to the area [and] <em>never </em>utilized the disputed portion of the Clearwater Road end for a public purpose . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Applying their interpretation of the aforementioned statement from <em>Goldman </em>to their rendition of the relevant facts, the Keatings contend that the town, at all relevant times, did not hold for public use that portion of the road end at Clearwater Road from the hydrangea hedge to the east and, therefore, that the town is not immune from their claim of adverse possession of that portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The Keatings\u2019 interpretation of the aforementioned statement in <em>Goldman </em>is inapposite, at least with respect to the facts of this case. First, we note that actual use by a town is not a requirement in order for it to successfully claim immunity from adverse possession. A town holds land for public use even when it has not yet undertaken such use as long as it holds it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>for development of a public use at some later time. <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 78-80. Second, \u201c[i]n <em>Goldman, </em>the property was a lot in a residential subdivision, and the city\u2019s acquisition of the property by foreclosure on a tax hen was intended only to protect the city\u2019s fisc from a delinquent taxpayer. That Waterbury had manifested no intention to develop the property, then or later, for any public purpose whatsoever, was clearly demonstrated by the fact that the city subsequently sold the property to a private party.\u201d Id., 81. In <em>Goldman, </em>because the land clearly was not dedicated to any public purpose or acquired for such a purpose, the presumption that the town held the land for public use could not stand; see id., 80; and the only way by which the town could have been considered as having held the land for public use was if it had actually done so. It was under that set of circumstances that the Supreme Court correctly stated: \u201cThe controlling factor is the use to which the realty was put after its acquisition.\u201d <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Quadrato, </em>supra, 142 Conn. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The circumstances in the present case are notably different from those in <em>Goldman </em>and render the aforementioned statement inapplicable here. The town in the present case acquired fee simple title to the road end at Clearwater Road not through a foreclosure on a tax lien or through some other similar means, but through a deed that expressly conveyed the land \u201cfor highway purposes . . . .\u201d Not only is the town in this case therefore presumed to hold the land for public use because it acquired fee simple title to the land; see <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 80; but it also should be seen as holding the land for public use because it acquired fee simple title to the land through a deed that expressly devoted the land to a public use, namely, \u201chighway purposes . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The court held that the Keatings had failed to overcome their burden of rebutting the presumption that the town held the disputed portion of the road end at Clearwater Road for public use. We agree. All they purportedly have shown is that, since 1939, the town has made no improvements to the road end at Clearwa-ter Road from the hydrangea hedge to the east. Even if we assume that to be true, it is insufficient to overcome the above mentioned presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The Keatings also attempt to demonstrate that the town abandoned the disputed portion of the road end at Clearwater Road. Abandonment is accomplished \u201cby nonuser by the public for a long period of time <em>with </em>the intention to abandon . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Greist </em>v. <em>Amrhyn, </em>80 Conn. 280, 285, 68 A. 521 (1907); accord <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 547. The court stated that \u201cintent [to abandon] can be shown by express statements of town officials or formal acts of abandonment. It can also be inferred from the circumstances, such as the lack of any express plan for the future development of the property.\u201d The Keatings argue that the town expressed an intention to abandon the disputed portion of the road end at Clearwater Road by (1) not maintaining it, (2) purportedly acknowledging twice in 1993 that the hedge formed the boundary line of the road end, (3) not developing any site plans for the road end until 2002, well after the Keatings and their predecessors had controlled the land for the requisite adverse possession time, (4) placing a \u201cscenic overlook\u201d sign not on the disputed area but to the west of the disputed area and (5) not requiring the Keatings to relocate a well that they had placed on the disputed portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We find those arguments unpersuasive. The first assertion has already been addressed. With respect to the Keatings\u2019 second assertion, which is that the town acknowledged twice in 1993 that the hedge formed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>eastern boundary of the road end, the court made no such finding. In fact, it implicitly found otherwise. After recounting the board of selectmen\u2019s proposal in 1938 to abandon the road ends and the subsequent rejection thereof by the electors in favor of \u201crepair[ing] and put[ting] in proper condition the road ends at Cornfield Point,\u201d the court stated that \u201c[n]o evidence was presented that the town ever formally considered again abandoning its use of the road ends.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The Keatings contend that the town acknowledged twice in 1993 that the hedge formed the boundary line because Angus L. McDonald, a surveyor retained by the town, reported on January 4, 1993, that the relevant boundary of the road end on Clearwater Road was \u201cevident left\u201d and on October 6, 1993, that the boundary was \u201calong hedge on left . ...\u201d A careful review of the exhibits reveals, however, that McDonald\u2019s reports were nothing more than preliminary reviews of the road ends at Cornfield Point. McDonald expressly states in the cover letter accompanying his October 6, 1993 review that it is \u201cpreliminary . . . .\u201d Moreover, they are not reports <em>from </em>the town but are reports <em>to </em>the town. The October 6, 1993 report also states that the purpose of the review was to evaluate, in relevant part, evidence of boundaries. It does not state that its findings represent the definitive boundaries. The only boundary survey of the road end at Clearwater Road in the record that was prepared as a class A-2 boundary survey, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 20-300b-1 through 20-300b-20 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, was a survey by Jeffrey A. Sanborn of Land Survey &amp; Technical Services, Inc. That survey unmistakably shows the boundary not as being the hydrangea hedge but as being the boundary originally laid out in the November, 1922 map entitled \u201cCornfield Point Beach Club.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">With respect to the Keatings\u2019 third assertion, that the town did not develop any site plans until 2002, we note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>that the court stated that intent to abandon <em>\u201ccan . . . </em>be inferred from . . . the lack of any express plan for the future development of the property\u201d; (emphasis added); not that it <em>must </em>be inferred from the lack thereof. The lack of an express plan for future development can be construed as intent to abandon where, for example, as in <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Quadrato, </em>supra, 142 Conn. 403-404, the land clearly had not been dedicated to any public purpose or acquired for such a purpose. Here, the land was dedicated to a particular public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">With respect to the Keatings\u2019 fourth and fifth assertions, which are that the town expressed an intent to abandon the disputed road end by placing a \u201cscenic overlook\u201d sign to the west of it and not on it and by not requiring the Keatings to relocate their well, we are not persuaded. There is sufficient, evidence to support the court\u2019s finding, and the Keatings offer of evidence does not leave us with the definite and firm conviction that the court has made a mistake. See <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 545. We therefore conclude that the court\u2019s finding that the town held the road end at Clearwater Road for public use, including that segment from the hydrangea hedge to the east, without ever having intentionally abandoned it is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Held for Public Use \u2014 Intentional Abandonment (Dimmocks)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The Dimmocks acknowledge that a municipality may be classified as holding land for public use when it is not presently making use of the land but argue that in order to be so classified, the municipality must at least have some plan to develop the land for a future public use. In support of their argument, the Dimmocks emphasize the following language in <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Conn. 79-80: \u201c[L]and is indeed held for public use even when a municipality is not presently making use of the land but is simply holding it for development at some later time. Absent some evidence of a municipal intention to abandon its plans for future development of the municipal property, the land is immune from claims of adverse possession.\u201d The Dimmocks also refer to <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Quadrato, </em>supra, 142 Conn. 403, in which our Supreme Court held that the city of Waterbury did not hold a certain parcel of land for public use because, as paraphrased by the Dimmocks, there was no evidence of a plan to develop the land for a future public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The Dimmocks maintain that there is no evidence of any plan by the town in this case, except for its recent plans that prompted this litigation, to develop that portion of the East Lane road end lying to the west and south of a hedge running along the eastern edge of their lot, which they claim to possess adversely, for a future public use. They argue, therefore, that the town has not held that segment for public use and, consequently, is not immune from a claim of adverse possession. Claiming to have satisfied the elements of adverse possession well before the town\u2019s recent plans arose, they therefore contend that the court improperly ruled against their claim for adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The Dimmocks assert that <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc., </em>requires a town, which is not presently making use of land that it owns, to have a specific plan to develop that land for a future public use in order to be considered as holding the land for public use. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The Dimmocks correctly note that our Supreme Court stated: \u201cAbsent some evidence of a municipal intention to abandon its <em>plans </em>for future development of the municipal property, the land is immune from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>claims of adverse possession.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 79-80. We do not believe, however, that by using the word \u201cplans,\u201d our Supreme Court was requiring a municipality to have a specific plan. Later, in holding that the town of Trumbull was immune from the plaintiffs claim of adverse possession, the court made no reference to the absence of any plan as a basis for its holding. It stated: \u201c[T]he plaintiff has presented no evidence indicating that the defendant holds the property for some nonpublic use or has abandoned its <em>intention to hold the roadway for public purposes </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 81-82. Previously in its opinion, the court also suggested that \u201can <em>intention </em>to develop [the land] at some time in the future,\u201d not a specific plan to develop it in the future, would be sufficient to satisfy the \u201c[held for] public use requirement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 79. Furthermore, without mentioning anything about a specific plan to develop the land for a future public use, our Supreme Couit held that \u201cproperty that is held in fee simple ownership by municipalities <em>must be presumed to be held for public use.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 80. In the context of these statements, we do not believe that the court was requiring the town to have a specific plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Moreover, in <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Quadrato, </em>supra, 142 Conn. 398, our Supreme Court did not, as the Dimmocks assert, conclude that the city did not hold the land for public use because there was no evidence of a plan to develop it for a future public use. As mentioned previously, the court concluded that the city did not hold the land for public use because, in addition to not having been actually used for any public purpose, the land \u201cpassed to the city ... by virtue of a judgment foreclosing a tax lien\u201d and, therefore, was not \u201cdedicated to any public purpose.\u201d Id., 403. \u201cIn <em>Goldman . . . </em>the city\u2019s acquisition of the property by foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>on a tax lien was intended only to protect the city\u2019s fisc from a delinquent tax payer.\u201d <em>American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">By contrast, the town in the present case acquired fee simple title to the East Lane road end not through a foreclosure on a tax lien but through a deed that expressly dedicated the land \u201cfor highway purposes . . . .\u201d Not only is the town therefore presumed to hold the land for public use because it acquired fee simple title to the land; see id., 80; but it should also be seen as holding the land for public use because it acquired the land through a deed that expressly devoted the land to a public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">As with the Keatings\u2019 claim to Clearwater Road, the court held that the Dimmocks failed to overcome then-burden of rebutting the presumption that the town held the disputed portion of the East Lane road end. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The Dimmocks puiportedly have shown that throughout the period of their alleged adverse possession, the town did not have a plan to develop for a public use the disputed portion of the East Lane road end. Even if we assume it to be true that the town had no specific plan until recently, it is, under the facts of this case, irrelevant and, therefore, insufficient to overcome the previously mentioned presumption. We therefore conclude that the court\u2019s finding that the town held the East Lane road end for public use, including that portion the Dimmocks claim to possess adversely, without ever having intentionally abandoned it, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">In light of our analysis, we conclude that the court\u2019s finding that the town held the road ends for public use, including the disputed portions, and did not intend to abandon nor ever did abandon them, is not clearly erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>neous. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court holding that the town is immune from the Dim-mocks\u2019 and Keatings\u2019 claims of adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">IMPROVEMENTS TO ROAD ENDS</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Finally, the association challenges the court\u2019s determination that the town could implement all of its proposed improvements to the road ends except for the installation of certain bollards.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The association essentially claims (1) that the court\u2019s decision improperly allows the town to use the road ends in a manner inconsistent with the purpose for which they were conveyed, (2) that the court improperly concluded that the town\u2019s proposed parking spaces on the road ends do not interfere with the association\u2019s right of access and (3) that the court improperly held that the association\u2019s ban on public parking in the streets at Cornfield Point, as authorized by Spec. Acts No. 467, \u00a7 12, does not apply to the road ends and does not prevent the town from installing parking spaces on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">In support of the association\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s decision improperly allows the town to use the road ends in a manner inconsistent with the purpose for which they were conveyed, it argues that a road that is deeded to a town for highway purposes may not be used for any other inconsistent purpose and that the proposed improvements in this case are inconsistent with the purposes for which the roads were conveyed, namely, for highway purposes. We agree with the asso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>ciation that the road ends, which the town holds in fee simple, are to be used for highway purposes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">As stated previously, once a town acquires fee simple title to a street or road for highway purposes, it is generally said to be held in trust for the benefit of all the public <em>for such purposes. </em>See <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>supra, 129 Conn. 111-12; 39 Am. Jur. 2d 714 \u2014 15, Highways, Streets, and Bridges \u00a7 184 (1999). The road ends here, which are part of the roads to which they are connected; see part I; are therefore held, like the entire road, in trust for the benefit of all the public for highway purposes. \u201cWhen the fee of [a road] has been transferred to [a town], the [town] may use the [road] for any public purpose not inconsistent with or prejudicial to its use for highway purposes.\u201d <em>Perlmutter </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>259 N.Y. 327, 329-30, 182 N.E. 5 (1932); see <em>Derby </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>supra, 40 Conn. 433, 435 (holding that grantors renounced all claim to street and that town held, in trust for public, title to street for purpose contemplated by deed); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Public Hall Co., </em>supra, 35 Conn. 431 (holding, where land conveyed by warrantee deed to town \u201cfor the sole use and purpose of a public highway,\u201d deed conveyed more than easement, and as long as premises continued to be used for highway, town had complete title to fee of land).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The question is, therefore, whether the proposed improvements are not inconsistent with or prejudicial to the town\u2019s obligation to use the road ends for highway purposes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That is a question of fact for the trial court, which is subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. The court, however, did not expressly find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the proposed changes were not inconsistent with or prejudicial to the town\u2019s obligation to use the road ends for highway purposes. Nevertheless, case law, certain statutes, subordinate facts found by the court and evidence in the record make inevitable the conclusion that the town\u2019s proposed improvements are not inconsistent with or prejudicial to the town\u2019s obligation to use the road ends for highway purposes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shashaty, </em>251 Conn. 768, 783, 742 A.2d 786 (1999) (allowing conclusions of fact to be drawn on appeal when subordinate facts found by trial court make conclusion inevitable or where uncontroverted evidence and testimony in record make factual conclusion so obvious as to be inherent in trial court\u2019s decision), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1094, 120 S. Ct. 1734, 146 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">\u201cIt has long been established that the essential feature of a highway is that it is a road or way open to the use of the public.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>163 Conn. 365, 369, 306 A.2d 857 (1972). \u201cHighways have existed from the earliest times and are constructed primarily for the passage of persons, on foot or in vehicles, and for the carriage of goods.\u201d 39 Am. Jur. 2d 583, supra, \u00a7 1. \u201cA highway may be a cul-de-sac, or even a mere approach to a court occupied by a group of houses. It is not essential to a highway that it be a thoroughfare, but rather it may terminate without connecting with another road at one end . . . .\u201d Id., p. 584. Where a deed conveys to a town a road for highway purposes, the town is not necessarily under an obligation to pave the road; see id., \u00a7 189, p. 719; or to use the road solely for vehicular access. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 214 (deed\u2019s requirement that street was to be used \u201cfor the purpose of a road and for no other purpose\u201d did not preclude city from restricting use of street to pedestrian travel and noting that \u201croad\u201d does not connote thoroughfare that necessarily remains open to vehicular traffic at all times); see also General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 14-286a and 14-288 (treating bicycling as activity within purview of activities performed on highways). Furthermore, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (C) (i) and (ii), respectively, a town has the power to \u201c[l]ay out, construct, reconstruct, alter, maintain, repair, control [and] operate . . . streets [and] highways,\u201d and the power to \u201c[k]eep open and safe for public use and travel and free from encroachment or obstruction the streets ... in the municipality . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">With that in mind, we conclude that none of the town\u2019s proposed improvements,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> excluding the aforementioned bollards,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is inconsistent with or prejudicial to the town\u2019s obligation to use the road ends for highway purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Whether installation of the proposed parking spaces would interfere with the association and its members\u2019 right of access<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is a question of fact to which we apply the clearly erroneous standard of review. After reviewing the entire record, we conclude that there is ample evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s finding. Moreover, we find compelling the court\u2019s reasoning with respect to that claim.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>that \u201c[t]he existence of the proposed public parking space [s] will not unreasonably interfere with the . . . association\u2019s right of vehicular access to the beach\u201d is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Finally, the association claims that the court improperly held that the association\u2019s ban on public parking in the streets at Cornfield Point, as authorized by Spec. Acts No. 467, \u00a7 12, does not apply to the road ends and does not prevent the town from installing parking spaces on them. Whether the association\u2019s ban applies to the road ends and prevents the installation of parking spaces is a question of law to which we apply plenary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The court acknowledged that \u201c[t]he General Assembly in 1943 through a special act . . . gave the board of governors of the association the authority to \u2018enact by-laws or ordinances ... to regulate the parking of motor vehicles . . . .\u2019 [Spec. Acts No. 467, \u00a7 12].\u201d The court also acknowledged that \u201cevidence presented before [it] indicated that the board of governors of the association has enacted by-laws prohibiting parking on the streets of Cornfield Point.\u201d What the association contests, however, is the court\u2019s conclusion that because the proposed \u201cparking spaces [will be] on the road ends themselves, which is land owned by the town, those parking spaces do not constitute parking on the streets of Cornfield Point.\u201d Implicit in the court\u2019s reasoning is that the road ends are not roads or streets within Cornfield Point and, therefore, are not subject to the association\u2019s parking ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>In light of our prior determination that the road ends <em>are </em>part of the roads to which they are attached, we find the court\u2019s reasoning to be less than compelling. As part of the streets and roads to which they are attached, the road ends are subject to any existing bylaws or ordinances of the association that prohibit parking on the streets of Cornfield Point. This does not mean, however, that the town is absolutely precluded from installing its proposed parking spaces on the road ends. As noted previously and as the court explained in its decision, Spec. Acts No. 467, \u00a7 18, provides that \u201c[i]f any by-laws or regulation[s] adopted by [t]he . . . [association shall conflict with any lawful ordinance of the town . . . the ordinance of said town shall prevail and supersede the by-law ... of said association.\u201d The town, therefore, is free to enact an ordinance that supersedes the association\u2019s ban on public parking and authorizes the town to install the proposed parking spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Because, however, there is no evidence before us that the town has yet enacted any such superseding ordinance, we hold, to the extent there is no such ordinance, that the court improperly concluded that the association\u2019s existing parking ban does not apply to the road ends and does not prevent the town from installing parking spaces on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">On the plaintiffs appeal, the judgment is reversed only as to the determination that the plaintiffs existing parking ban is inapplicable and does not prevent the town from installing the proposed parking spaces in question and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law. The judgment is affirmed in allother respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-5\"> As stated in the trial court,\u2019s November 26, 2003 memorandum of decision: \u201cThis lawsuit initially concerned ten road ends located at Cornfield Point.

Chief Justice Mitchell, who heard argument on the appeal, but evidently died before the decision was rendered, expressed the opinion that a new trial should be denied. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 1 Conn. 146.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> That is not to say that land acquired by a town for highway purposes may never be used for some other purpose. The state may take the land after making just compensation, for another purpose. \u201cAll property is, and must be, held subject to the right of the state to take and use it for public purposes; this includes property already devoted to a public use; and it is for the legislature primarily to determine when property so devoted to one public use may be taken for another.\u201d <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>supra, 129 Conn. 113.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\"> See footnotes 2 and 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> The word \u201cpremises\u201d may also \u201csignify the right, title, or interest conveyed.\u201d Barron\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, 385. We do not conclude, however, that that is the meaning of \u201cpremises\u201d within the context of the deeds in question. The deed from the Shore and Lake Corporation to Old Saybrook states in relevant part \u201cthat neither the said Releasor nor any other person or persons in its name and behalf, shall or will hereafter claim or demand any right or title to the premises or any part thereof . . . .\u201d The deed from Pratt to Old Saybrook uses almost the exact same language. Given that \u201cany right or title to\u201d immediately precedes \u201cthe premises,\u201d we are disinclined to infer that the grantors meant to say \u201cthat neither the said Releasor nor any other person or persons in its name and behalf, shall or will hereafter claim or demand <em>any right or title to the [right, title, or interest conveyed] </em>or any part thereof . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Such a statement is redundant and, in the context of the paragraph, makes little sense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\"> \u201cServient premises\u201d is defined as \u201c[l]and owned by one person which is subject to an easement in another.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b599-10\"> The association, the Keatings and the Dimmocks all state on their original appeal forms that they are appealing from the March 15, 2004 memorandum of decision, but only the association briefs the issue of whether the court properly concluded that the town could install parking spaces at the road ends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\"> See footnote 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\"> It is unnecessary for us to consider whether the town\u2019s proposed installation of certain bollards comports with the language, \u201cfor highway purposes,\u201d in the deeds. The town did not appeal from the court\u2019s judgment granting the association\u2019s request for an order that the town refrain from installing those bollards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> The town proposes to remove various hedges, fences and other alleged encroachments and to install permanent markers identifying the boundaries of the road ends, bicycle racks, identification signs and four parking spaces, one at each of the road ends at Mohican Road, Belleaire Drive, Saltaire Drive and Cottage Road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b602-9\"> See footnote 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> See footnote 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b602-11\"> The court reasoned: \u201cAlthough the designated parking space appears to extend the width of the road end, the existence of a designated parking area does not block access. It is a vehicle parking in the space, not the space itself, which could impede access and any vehicle parking in the space will be there only temporarily and for a short duration. Given the plaintiff\u2019s intermittent need for vehicular access to the beach, it is not unreasonable to expect the association to gain access to the beach during a time when no vehicle is obstructing access. Moreover, the association can simply ask the driver of an obstructing vehicle to move the vehicle so access can be achieved. Further, a single vehicle parked in the parking space would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>not obstruct vehicular access to the beach. The road end is forty feet wide, considerably wider than the length of a single automobile. Finally, public parking spaces are not proposed for all of the road ends. Only four of the nine road ends at issue in this case are designated for public parking. The Cornfield Point Association is free to use the other five road ends for vehicular access to the reserved beach.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
