The action arose from an accident in which the plaintiff, while on duty in his police vehicle, was struck by a negligent uninsured motorist. Because of the accident, the plaintiff was unable to work for approximately three weeks. He underwent physical therapy for several months and eventually made a complete recovery. The defendant stipulated to liability at the beginning of trial, and the court heard evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s damages. The parties stipulated that the plaintiff suffered economic damages in the amount of $8395.66, consisting of $4130.50 in medical expenses and $4265.16 in lost wages and overtime. The court concluded that the plaintiff also suffered $6000 in noneconomic damages, which the defendant does not challenge on appeal. The sum of the plaintiffs economic and noneconomic damages equaled $14,395.66. <em>Hassett </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>49 Conn. Sup. 7, 9, 858 A.2d 922 (2004). The parties also agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that the defendant is entitled to offset that sum by $3009.03 for medical bills paid by the defendant. The court awarded the plaintiff $11,386.63 in economic and noneconomic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly concluded that economic damages, determined pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h, included (1) the difference between the amount of medical bills incurred and the amount paid, which subsequently was forgiven by the medical care providers voluntarily, not pursuant to any insurance plan or contract and (2) lost wages paid by workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims, in the alternative, that the difference between the medical bills incurred and the amount paid should be deducted as a collateral source pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-225b. We disagree with the defendant and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Our examination of the record and briefs, and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuade us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issues were resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s well reasoned opinion. See <em>Hassett </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 49 Conn. Sup. 7. Because that opinion fully addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the issues and the applicable law concerning those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>267 Conn. 581, 582, 840 A.2d 552 (2004).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-10\"> The plaintiff also named as a defendant his personal insurance carrier, American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company. Because the plaintiffs damages did not exceed his maximum coverage under the city of New Haven's self-insured policy, there was no award of damages for which American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company was responsible. Only the defendant city of New Haven has appealed. We therefore refer in this opinion to the city of New Haven as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-9\"> The defendant asserts that the plaintiff is entitled to $964.17 for lost wages, which represents the difference between workers\u2019 compensation payments and the amount the plaintiff would have earned in wages and overtime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\"> Our decision to adopt the court\u2019s well reasoned opinion is informed further by our Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Piersa </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>273 Conn. 519, 871 A.2d 992 (2005), which specifically held that a self-insured entity, like the defendant, is not entitled to advantages by virtue of its position as both insurer and insured that are not open to commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>insurers. Id., 528-30. In so holding, our Supreme Court restated the goal of the legislature in creating a uniform scheme of uninsured motorist coverage, regardless of the nature of the insurer. Id. Although the trial court did not have the advantage of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Piersa </em>when it decided this case, its decision is consistent with <em>Piersa </em>and the propositions for which it stands.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
