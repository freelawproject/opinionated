Holcomb tied Holzapfel up and left. A stereo tape deck, and radio were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Harper testified that, believing Holcomb was going to another friend\u2019s room, he followed him to Holzapfel\u2019s hallway. Harper stopped for a drink of water \"about three or four minutes maybe\u201d and as he approached Holzapfel\u2019s open door he saw Holcomb \"sitting on [Holzapfel], he was beating, he was beating on him.\u201d Harper said that Holcomb directed Michenor to take \"the tape or something\u201d. As Harper left; Michenor handed him some of the stolen equipment. Harper and Michenor were then apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Holcomb testified that Holzapfel had sold him some \"bull drugs\u201d which made his \"head hurt.\u201d When Holcomb confronted Holzapfel with this charge, Holzapfel \"swung\u201d at him and told him he was in the wrong building. Holcomb denied entering Holzapfel\u2019s room with a gun, striking Holzapfel with the gun, or taking anything from the room. He made no demand on Holzapfel, but only <em>\"asked </em>for [his money]\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Holcomb said he tied Holzapfel up \"because he wouldn\u2019t give me no money back and [Holcomb] got mad\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Holcomb reiterated that he went to Holzapfel to get his money back, not to rob him: \"I am not guilty of armed robbery. I might have committed a crime, but the intention wasn\u2019t going to stick no one up. I went to ask for my money back, [and] there was a fight there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">In his short summation, Holcomb\u2019s lawyer ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>gued that Holcomb lacked the requisite felonious intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">\"The defendant has denied the armed robbery, he has admitted to an assault to recover some money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">\"[H]e has admitted the assault * * * for the purpose of recovering payment of money for defective drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In instructing the jury, the judge defined the crime of armed robbery as a taking with \"a felonious intent and without any claim or color of right\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">However, in elaborating on the requisite intent, he further instructed the jury that \"[wrongful acts, knowingly or intentionally committed can neither be justified nor excused on the grounds of innocent intent.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Felonious intent is a requisite element of armed robbery. This Court, in reversing a conviction in <em>People v Henry, </em>202 Mich 450, 455; 168 NW 534 (1918), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">\"If the defendant in good faith believed that the money which he demanded was his money, and that he was entitled to its possession, he could not be guilty of either robbery or larceny in taking it, because there would be no felonious intent, 'and if the defendant, for any reason whatever, indulged no such intent, the crime cannot have been committed.\u2019 <em>People v Walker, 38 </em>Mich 156 [1878]; <em>State v Koerner, </em>8 ND 292; 78 NW 981 [1899].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Holcomb testified that he went to Holzapfel\u2019s room \"to <em>ask </em>for [his] money back\u201d, he did not intend to rob Holzapfel. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">If a jury believes Holcomb, it may not properly convict him of armed robbery. A jury instructed that \"[wrongful acts\u201d are not \"excused on the ground of innocent intent\u201d, might feel compelled to return a verdict of guilty of armed robbery despite its belief that Holcomb\u2019s intent was \"innocent\u201d, not felonious.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The instruction given tended to negate the intent element of armed robbery* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to vitiate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Holcomb\u2019s defense. On retrial, that portion of the instruction on intent should not be given and a correct instruction on this essential element of the offense charged should be given.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">On the morning of trial, before a jury was impaneled, Holcomb moved to substitute counsel (\"I would like to have a new lawyer\u201d) or alternatively to proceed as his own counsel (\"I would like to defense this my own self\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The judge, after reading from Holcomb\u2019s psychiatric report prepared by the Forensic Center in evaluating his competency to stand trial, denied his motion because \"it would not be in the best interest of the defendant, would not afford him a proper defense, would not satisfactorily protect his constitutional rights if he were permitted to represent himself and not have the benefit of a trained experienced and skilled counsel, that if he were to attempt to defend himself his demeanor before the jury would probably result in irreparable prejudice against him\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Subsequently, near the completion of the people\u2019s case, the judge elaborated \"for the benefit of the appellate court\u201d his reasons for denying Holcomb\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">First, he noted that the defendant\u2019s right to proceed <em>in propria persona </em>is not, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ABA standards, an \"absolute right\u201d. Then he read portions of Holcomb\u2019s competency report into the record and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">\"[T]hat this man is not qualified mentally, properly to represent himself and secondly, that to attempt \u2014 for him to attempt to do so would clearly and without question result in disruption of trial proceedings and the probability of a mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">In <em>Faretta v California, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant in a criminal case has a Sixth Amendment right to refuse to be represented by a lawyer and to conduct his own defense. In so holding, the Court declared that in order to represent himself the accused must \"knowingly and intelligently\u201d forego the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel. The Court said: \"he should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that 'he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The record in that case affirmatively showed that Faretta was \"literate, competent, and understanding, and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">In this case, the record does not affirmatively show that Holcomb was literate, competent, understanding and voluntarily exercising his informed free will. But neither did the trial judge \u2014 no doubt because he could not anticipate <em>Faretta v California </em>\u2014 seek to establish on the record that Holcomb did not know what he was doing or that he was not literate, competent, understanding and voluntarily exercising his informed free will.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">We have considered remanding this case for determination whether Holcomb was at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>\"literate, competent, and understanding\u201d, and \"voluntarily exercising his informed free will\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We are of the view, however, that it is most improbable at this late date that it could satisfactorily be demonstrated that Holcomb could not have been adequately apprised of the nature of the right to proceed <em>pro se </em>and of the consequences of the exercise of that right and, therefore, the court was justified in depriving him of the right to represent himself. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">If Holcomb again requests to proceed <em>pro se, </em>the trial judge shall inform him of the \"dangers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>disadvantages of self-representation\u201d and seek affirmatively to establish on the record that Holcomb \"knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open\u201d. The record should show whether the defendant is \"literate, competent and understanding\u201d of the choice which confronts him and \"voluntarily exercising his informed free will\u201d in declining to be represented by counsel and in seeking to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Neither the quality of a defendant\u2019s advocacy skills nor his technical legal knowledge are \"relevant to an assessment of his knowing exercise of the right to defend himself\u2019. <em>Faretta v California, supra</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-6\">T.

You have to gather the intent from the character of the act, the circumstances surrounding it and from the conduct of like character which may appear as tending to aid you in finding and discovering it, but in connection with all this, unless the testimony satisfies you of something else, you are warranted in holding a party responsible for the natural, probable and legitimate consequences of his acts. The intent may be presumed from the doing of a wrongful, fraudulent or illegal act but this inference or presumption is not necessarily conclusive. The law presumes that every man intends the legitimate consequences of his own acts. Wrongful acts, knowingly or intentionally committed can neither be justified nor excused on the grounds of innocent intent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">\"When an act forbidden by law is intentionally done, the intent to do the act is the criminal intent which imparts to the character of the offense and no one who violates the law which he is conclusively presumed to know, can be heard to say that he had no criminal intent to do the forbidden act. A party cannot excuse himself for an act intentionally done which is in itself a violation of law by saying that he did not so intend because where an act is unlawful in itself, the law presumes it was done with an unlawful intent, but where acts are equivocal, as in this case, they become criminal only by reason of the intent with which they are done. Both the commission of the act and the criminal intent with which it is committed must unite to constitute the offense and both must be proved in such case unless the criminal intent is proved, the offense is not proved.\u2018The question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the intent is one that is hard to establish directly because as I have indicated, grown persons do not always disclose the object they have in view in any acts which they may indulge and you have to gather the intent from the character of the acts, the circumstances surrounding it and from the conduct of a like character which may appear as tending to aid you in finding and discovering it. Intent, except when confessed is a matter of inference. Intent, unless confessed, can only be proved by acts, as jurors cannot look into the breast or heart of the accused.

The trial judge followed both. First, we look to case law important to the state of the law in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In speaking of waiver of counsel, the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">\"The determination of whether, there has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Defendant replied negatively to the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether he wished counsel in <em>Moore v Michigan, </em>355 US 155; 78 S Ct 191; 2 L Ed 2d 167 (1957).

See generally, Laub, <em>The Problem of the Unrepresented, Misrepresented and Rebellious Defendant in Criminal Court, 2 </em>Duquesne L Rev 245 (1964). <em>None of these sources of the desire to dispense with counsel outweigh the rights of codefendants, or the interest of the public in a just and orderly trial.

As to self-representation, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\"/ <em>do not, however, \u00f1nd that the defendant possesses </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>the intelligence and capacity to appreciate the consequences of his decision to represent himself in the case and proceed to trial without the assistance of counsel, </em>even advisory counsel, nor do I find that he comprehends all of the facts essential to a broad understanding of the case which would be necessary for him to properly represent himself, and it is for these reasons that I have felt that the protection of the defendant\u2019s rights requires that he have counsel, notwithstanding his desire to proceed without counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In this careful manner, the judge exercised the necessary discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Shortly after this decision the Court of Appeals decided the matter of <em>People v Kirkland, </em>40 Mich App 22; 198 NW2d 811 (1972), wherein it underscored the basic concept that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">\"The right of the accused to represent himself at trial is not absolute when it conflicts with the interest of the public in ensuring a fair trial. * * * While the right to counsel may be waived, it is always the duty of the trial court to determine whether the waiver is voluntarily and intelligently made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Such has been the Michigan precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Then in 1975 came <em>Faretta. </em>The majority reach the conclusion that <em>Faretta </em>demanded defendant\u2019s right to represent himself. I can find nothing in the Federal opinion or the facts of this case to support that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">First, the <em>Faretta </em>concepts are those employed by the court in this matter. That Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\"When an accused manages his own defense, he relinquishes, as a purely factual matter, many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel. For this reason, in order to represent himself, the accused must 'knowingly and intelligently\u2019 forego those relinquished benefits. <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458, 464-465; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461; 146 ALR 357 [1938], <em>Cf. Von Moltke v Gillies, </em>332 US 708, 723-724; 68 S Ct 316, 323; 92 L Ed 309 [1948] (plurality opinion of Black, J.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The record reveals a man unable to represent himself in any but a self-defeating manner. For instance, defendant asked that his appointed counsel be dismissed. He explained his reasons as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\"He ain\u2019t handling my case right, by <em>(sic) </em>grandmother died, I tried to get out on \u2014 she died since I have been in jail, she died two days ago, my people have been trying to get me out on bond and I would like to defense this my own self * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Defendant\u2019s attorney said he had visited his client at least four times in jail and the court noted his attempts to have bond lowered and the court\u2019s refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The court noted defendant\u2019s prior disruptive behavior (which was personally observed) and also the Forensic Center report</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">\"that the defendant exhibited confusion, rambling speech and occasionally incoherent mutterings and exhibited * * * personality features suggesting of an explosive and impulsive personality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The report stated that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">\"could become expansive one time and then very quickly change his mood showing angry and threaten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ing behavior. * * * however when any attempt was made to discuss the charge with him the patient became belligerent and sullen and refused to consider making a defense for himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Defendant\u2019s attorney also noted his client\u2019s lack of interest in the details of his case other than bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\"><em>Faretta </em>requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\" 'he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 <em>Adams v United States ex rel McCann, </em>317 US 269, 279; 63 S Ct 236; 87 L Ed 268 [143 ALR 435 (1942)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Although this case was decided four years prior to <em>Faretta, </em>the judge fulfilled its basic requirements. He also adhered to the standards of 1971 and those upon which subsequent development of the concept has been built.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">For reasons which I do not find apparent in the record, my colleagues find that the court failed to determine whether defendant was \"literate, competent, and understanding\u201d. They cite <em>Faretta </em>as retroactive precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">Although I would find that the requirements of <em>Faretta </em>have been met, the argument of retroactive applicability of the opinion deserves analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">In <em>Johnson v New Jersey, </em>384 US 719; 86 S Ct 1772; 16 L Ed 2d 882 (1966), the United States Supreme Court thoroughly discussed the subject of retroactive treatment. The Court held that <em>Escobedo v Illinois, </em>378 US 478; 84 S Ct 1758; 12 L Ed 2d 977 (1964), and <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), affected only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>those cases in which the trial began after the date of the respective decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The Court noted three general rules governing retroactivity: (1) \"[T]he choice between retroactivity and nonretroactivity in no way turns on the value of the constitutional guarantee involved.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) The retroactivity question must be determined \" 'in each case\u2019 by looking to the peculiar traits of the specific 'rule in question\u2019 \u201d. The reason for this is that \"[e]ach constitutional rule of criminal procedure has its own distinct functions, its own background of precedent, and its own impact on the administration of justice * * * \u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) Protection of \"the integrity of the truth-determining process at trial\u201d is a crucial factor to consider.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Further, the Court stated that \"We must look to the purpose [of the newly adopted constitutional rule], the reliance which may have been placed upon prior decisions on the subject, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application * * * \u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">For example, in <em>Linkletter v Walker, </em>381 US 618; 85 S Ct 1731; 14 L Ed 2d 601 (1965), the Court denied retroactive application of <em>Mapp v Ohio, </em>367 US 643; 81 S Ct 1684; 6 L Ed 2d 1081 (1961). The Court reasoned that <em>Mapp </em>affected evidence \"the reliability and relevancy of which is not questioned\u201d. In <em>Tehan v Shott, </em>382 US 406; 86 S Ct 459; 15 L Ed 2d 453 (1966), the Court denied retroactive application to <em>Griffin v California, </em>380 US 609; 85 S Ct 1229; 14 L Ed 2d 106 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">On retroactive application of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo, </em>the <em>Johnson </em>Court stated that \"the prime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>purpose of these rulings is to guarantee full effectuation of the privilege against self-incrimination * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The Court explained its decision not to invoke retroactivity. One factor was the disruptive effect of retroactivity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\"[Retroactive application of <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda </em>would seriously disrupt the administration of our criminal laws. It would require the retrial or release of numerous prisoners found guilty by trustworthy evidence in conformity with previously announced constitutional standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Not only did the Court deny retroactivity to final convictions, but also cases pending on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\"All of the reasons set forth above for making <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda </em>nonretroactive suggest that these decisions should apply only to trials begun after the decisions were announced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Applying the <em>Johnson </em>analysis, <em>Faretta </em>should in any event be applied only to trials commencing after its decision date. Because the instant case long preceded <em>Faretta, </em>defendant should not be allowed to assert its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">However, even <em>Faretta </em>does not require a judge to permit self-representation under the facts of this case. The judge had a sound basis for his decision based upon his personal observations and discussions in court as well as upon the Forensic Center report. No formal format was required in 1971, nor do I believe it a requirement under <em>Faretta. </em>Indeed, if defendant had been allowed to proceed <em>in propria persona, </em>there would have been good grounds for reversal. The judge steered a precise course between Scylla and Charybdis.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Retroactivity of judicial decisions has long been a matter of concern primarily because of its effect upon bench and bar who proceeded as required by the law of a given date only to find years later that they should have been omniscent. Orderly development of law and social progress usually can be achieved without throwing into confusion the public and all of those upon whom decisions may fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Generally speaking, retroactivity of <em>Faretta </em>as interpreted would cause disruption of the administration of criminal law. \"It would require the retrial or release of numerous prisoners found guilty * * * in conformity with previously announced constitutional standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The majority interpretation of <em>Faretta </em>should only apply to trials started after the date of that decision. Similar to <em>Johnson, </em>future defendants may benefit from the new rule of self-representation, while past defendants m\u00e1y still utilize the previously existing Michigan case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">There is no merit in the other challenges by defendant. No objection was made to the jury instruction, and no miscarriage of justice appears. Neither was defendant denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\"> <em>Westbrook v Arizona, </em>384 US 150; 86 S Ct 1320; 16 L Ed 2d 429 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\"><em> Johnson, supra, </em>at 728.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-9\"> <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at 728.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\"> <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at 729.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b456-11\"> <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at 727.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
