The issues raised are essentially the same as those resolved today in <em>Bundo v Walled Lake, </em>395 Mich 679; 238 NW2d 154 (1975)._</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>In <em>Bundo </em>we held that an individual seeking a renewal of a class C liquor license under \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Liquor Control Act (MLCA)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has an \"interest\u201d in \"property\u201d such that he is entitled to due process protection. For the reasons set forth in <em>Bundo </em>we find the plaintiff, as a liquor licensee, is entitled to due process protection in seeking renewal of a class B-hotel liquor license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The Court of Appeals, in dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint, held that it was precluded by <em>Hanson v Romeo Village Council, </em>339 Mich 612; 64 NW2d 570 (1954), from reviewing \"local legislative body\u2019s action with respect to approval of liquor licenses\u201d. In <em>Bundo </em>we held that arbitrary and capricious actions by local legislative bodies in recommending to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission (MLCC) that liquor licenses not be renewed are subject to judicial review and that <em>Hanson v Romeo Village Council, supra, </em>being inconsistent with this conclusion, \"no longer can be followed\u201d, <em>Bundo, supra, </em>679.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings in light of our decision in <em>Bundo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">On remand, the Court should determine whether the Village of Emmett was properly joined as a party defendant in an action for writ of mandamus against the MLCC in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>If the Court of Appeals finds that the Village of Emmett is a proper party defendant, then a determination should be made whether or not the village council has afforded plaintiff proper due process protection as outlined in <em>Bundo, supra, 679. </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Finally, if the case is not disposed of on other grounds, the Court should determine whether the village council recommendation to the MLCC not to renew plaintiff\u2019s license was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">In its brief and during oral argument the MLCC took great pains to emphasize that independent of any objections the Village of Emmett had to renewal of plaintiff\u2019s license, grounds existed which would justify nonrenewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The commission alleged its records would reveal that \"Bisco\u2019s has, in fact, failed to comply with the terms of its provisional class B-hotel license in that it is operating a bar business and has no interest in operating a hotel business\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">The pendency of an action challenging the propriety of the Village of Emmett\u2019s recommendation not to renew plaintiff\u2019s license should not delay MLCC proceedings to determine whether plaintiff\u2019s request for renewal should be denied for failure to comply with the condition attached to his license or with statutory requirements for a class B-hotel license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The Court of Appeals is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>proceedings.

Two months later, the village enacted an ordinance banning topless exposure in public places. The ordinance was found unconstitutionally overbroad and its enforcement enjoined by a United States District Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">The village council also filed an objection with the commission to renewal of Bisco\u2019s liquor license.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to the village\u2019s request, the commission advised Bisco\u2019s that its license would not be renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Bisco\u2019s sought relief in circuit court which concluded it did not have jurisdiction to issue an order to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Bisco\u2019s then filed this complaint for mandamus in the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That Court declined<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to order the village to withdraw its objection or the commission to renew the license.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">We conclude that a liquor licensee has a property interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, accordingly, an application for renewal of a liquor license cannot be denied without providing the licensee notice and an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>We would remand this case to the commission for consideration of the merits of any objections to the renewal of Bisco\u2019s liquor license and, if the commission determines there may be cause for non-renewal, for an evidentiary hearing consistent with the procedures provided for \"contested cases\u201d in the Administrative Procedures Act of 1969.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The statute provides that the commission shall not grant a license without the approval of the local legislative body; it may, however, renew a license without such approval if the local legislative body has not objected; the commission shall revoke a license upon request of the local legislative body.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">This Court has held that because a liquor license is a privilege, a licensee does not have a property interest in a liquor license and, accordingly, a local legislative body may exercise the powers vested in it by the statute without according the licensee procedural due process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>In <em>Kenosha v Bruno, </em>412 US 507; 93 S Ct 2222; 37 L Ed 2d 109 (1973), where a three-judge court had held that an adversary hearing must be held before a local legislative body could deny renewal of a liquor license,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Board of Regents v Roth, </em>408 US 564; 92 S Ct 2701; 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972), and <em>Perry v Sindermann, </em>408 US 593; 92 S Ct 2694; 33 L Ed 2d 570 (1972), issued after the three-judge court rendered its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Both Roth and Sindermann were college professors who were critical of their institutions. Both were employed under one-year contracts and neither was afforded a hearing before being informed that he would not be rehired.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Roth was employed for one year at a university with a formal tenure system. Tenure accrued after four years of teaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Sindermann taught for ten years in a state college system with no formal tenure. He had been employed for the last four years at the same college under a succession of one-year contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">The Supreme Court concluded that because Roth had no \"legitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to reem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ployment under his contract, he had no property interest. His contract was for one year and it had no provision for renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Sindermann, however, was viewed as having acquired a sufficient property interest in the expectation of continued employment under an informal \"quasi-tenure\u201d system to require notice and a due process hearing before his employment could be terminated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">\"We have made it clear, in <em>Roth, supra, </em>at 571-572, that 'property\u2019 interests subject to procedural due process protection are not limited by a few rigid, technical forms. Rather, 'property\u2019 denotes a broad range of <em>interests </em>that are <em>secured by \u2019existing rules or understandings.\u2019 Id., </em>at 577.\u201d <em>Perry v Sindermann, </em>408 US 601. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The label attached to the interest at stake\u2014 whether it be called a mere \"privilege\u201d or a \"right\u201d \u2014 is not determinative. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Roth </em>reiterated its rejection of \"the wooden distinction between 'rights\u2019 and 'privileges\u2019 that once seemed to govern the applicability of procedural due process rights\u201d. <em>Board of Regents v Roth, </em>408 US 571.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">A liquor license is a franchise bestowed by the sovereign and just as the state may choose not to issue a license, it may place reasonable conditions on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">But once a liquor license has been issued and expenditures have been made in reliance on it, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>licensee has acquired an interest \"secured by existing rules or understandings\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Without a reasonable expectancy of renewal upon compliance with the pertinent ordinances, statutes, commission rules and regulations and specific conditions placed on a particular license, the risk of investing in or extending credit to a new bar would be inordinate. Bisco\u2019s was issued a one year license. It alleges that it invested a \"considerable sum of money\u201d in preparing the facilities for operation; the initial investment cannot be expected to be recouped in one year. A liquor licensee necessarily relies on the \"understanding\u201d implicit in the statute and evidenced by the apparent practice that it can in most instances expect its license to be automatically renewed. That reasonable expectation of continued enjoyment of the \"benefit\u201d conferred is similar to the interest of Sindermann in continued employment under a quasi-tenure system and is, in our view, a property interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Earlier precedent to the contrary, see fn 11 and accompanying text, will no longer be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Having concluded that a liquor licensee has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>property interest in its license<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which entitles it to procedural due process, we find the statute (MCLA 436.17; MSA 18.988) unconstitutional insofar as it fails to provide for notice and an evidentiary hearing before denial of an application for renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The Attorney General, representing the commission, concedes that the statute does not require notice and a hearing before nonrenewal of a liquor license and he does not urge this Court to read in such a requirement to \"save\u201d the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Even if we were so urged to construe the statute, we would decline to do so. Absent a clear indication of legislative intent regarding the procedures it would provide, or the course it would take, it is unwise and inappropriate for this Court to adopt a particular scheme or solution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There is no need to construct an interim procedure as the Administrative Procedures Act of 1969 (the APA) provides a workable and adequate procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">By declining to \"save\u201d the statute, we avoid dealing with the complex and essentially legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>tive question of the future respective roles and responsibilities of the commission and local communities in the new context that there is a property interest in a license once granted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> While a local legislative body may be called upon to act in a quasi-judicial capacity, the Legislature might well conclude that the commission is the appropriate tribunal to conduct a nonrenewal hearing now that local legislative bodies can no longer effect nonrenewal of a liquor license by legislative fiat and could only be empowered to act following notice to the licensee and a hearing, with judicial review as provided for in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 (see Part III, <em>infra). </em>Indeed, if the Legislature does not direct that nonrenewal hearings be conducted locally then under general legislation, the APA, applicable with exceptions not here pertinent to all state agencies, it is the duty of the commission to provide notice and an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing before declining to renew a liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The APA provides the procedure for state agencies hearing contested cases.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The commission is a state agency.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Licensing, defined as including re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>newal of a license,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> is a contested case where \"a determination of the legal rights, duties or privileges of a named party is required by law to be made by an agency after an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The term \"law\u201d in this context includes constitutional as well as statutory law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>For the reasons stated in Part I of this opinion, the Due Process Clause requires notice to the licensee and an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing before an application for renewal of a liquor license may be denied. Accordingly, non-renewal of a liquor license is a contested case and the provisions of the APA are applicable to such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The commission is vested with the constitutional authority to \"exercise complete control of the alcoholic beverage traffic within this state\u201d.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The commission may issue and revoke liquor licenses.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Applications for renewal of liquor licenses are made to the commission. Before the commission may deny an application for renewal, it must give the licensee notice and an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing conforming to the procedures for contested cases provided in the APA.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We do not wish to be understood as saying that the commission must hold an evidentiary hearing each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>time it receives an objection to renewal of a liquor license. But if the commission finds sufficient merit in the objection to indicate there may be cause to deny renewal of the license, it must notify the licensee of its right to an evidentiary hearing as provided in the APA.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The question on review is not whether the decision of the commission is arbitrary and capricious. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 provides for judicial review of administrative action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">\"All final decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer or agency existing under the constitution or by law, which are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect private rights or licenses, shall be subject to direct review by the courts as provided by law. This review shall include, as a minimum, the determination whether such final decisions, findings, rulings and orders are authorized by law; and, in cases in which a hearing is required, whether the same are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record. Findings of fact in workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud unless otherwise provided by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">\"In the absence of fraud, error of law or the adoption of wrong principles, no appeal may be taken to any court from any final agency provided for the administration of property tax laws from any decision relating to valuation or allocation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The decision of the commission to deny renewal of a liquor license is a final decision of an agency which affects \"private rights or licenses\u201d and is, accordingly, \"subject to direct review by the courts as provided by law\u201d. The minimal reviewing standard under the constitution is whether the decision of the commission is \"supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">The APA further defines the scope of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-10\">\"(1) Except when a statute or the constitution provides for a different scope of review, the court shall hold unlawful and set aside a decision or order of an agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>if substantial rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the decision or order is any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-5\">\"(a) In violation of the constitution or a statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">\"(b) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">\"(c) Made upon unlawful procedure resulting in material prejudice to a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">\"(d) Not supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-9\">\"(e) Arbitrary, capricious or clearly an abuse or unwarranted exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">\"(f) Affected by other substantial and material error of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">\"(2) The court, as appropriate, may affirm, reverse or modify the decision or order or remand the case for further proceedings.\u201d MCLA 24.306; MSA 3.560(206).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">We would remand to the Liquor Control Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The Federal Administrative Procedure Act in its cognate provision directs that, prior to the institution of proceedings to revoke a license, facts or conduct which may warrant such action shall have been called to the attention of the licensee and he shall have been accorded an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all lawful requirements.\u201d 2 Cooper, <em>supra, </em>p 496.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-11\"><em>See, also, </em>Cramton, The New Michigan Administrative Procedures Course Handbook, pp 139-140.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
