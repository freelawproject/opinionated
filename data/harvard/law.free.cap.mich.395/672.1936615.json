The subpoena directed plaintiff, a state senator, to give a pretrial discovery deposition and to produce certain documents in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>connection with a civil action which had been assigned to defendant. The issue before us is whether, on the facts of this case, we should judicially construe an exception for intra-session adjournments to this state\u2019s constitutional provision granting senators and representatives immunity \"from civil arrest and civil process <em>during sessions of the legislature </em>and for five days next before the commencement and after the termination thereof \u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The action out of which arose the instant complaint for superintending control was brought by one Walter Benkert and a non-profit corporation, Michigan Association for Consumer Protection, for themselves and all persons similarly situated. Named as defendants in that suit were the Michigan State Police, its Director, Col. George Halverson, and Governor William G. Milliken. The complaint alleged that the state police, acting at the request of a state legislator,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had conducted investigations of the named plaintiffs. It requested that such investigations be permanently enjoined, and that the fruits thereof be produced before the court for destruction. Defendants therein, through the attorney general, answered the complaint, admitting the following: that the state police had been contacted by a state legislator to conduct an investigation of the named plaintiffs; that the scope of the Benkert investigation included his background and relationship with MACP; that the scope of the investigation of MACP included its background, finances, objectives and membership. Defendants pleaded no contest to the allegation that the state police had exceeded its statutory authority in conducting these investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>In connection with the above action, on August 30, 1974, the plaintiffs therein caused to be served on plaintiff Bishop a subpoena directing him to appear at a certain law office at 11:30 a.m. on September 5, 1974, to testify and produce documents. On September 5, plaintiff Bishop filed a motion supported by affidavit in the trial court requesting that the subpoena be quashed on the grounds <em>inter alia </em>that he was privileged from civil process. The motion was denied by defendant who reasoned that, although the Legislature had convened on the second Wednesday in January 1974 and had not as of the date of the purported service adjourned its regular session <em>sine die, </em>nevertheless the Senate had recessed from July 13 until September 17. Consequently, it was defendant\u2019s opinion that plaintiff was \"on free time\u201d and should be available to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">In quashing the subpoena, the Court of Appeals cited Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 11, and <em>Auditor General v Wayne Circuit Judge, </em>234 Mich 540; 208 NW 696 (1926). In that case, it was unsuccessfully argued on behalf of the defendant Wayne Circuit Judge that the post-judgment writ of garnishment did not subject Representative Culver to civil process since the writ was served on the state, sought only to reach Culver\u2019s property in the hands of the state, and compelled him to do nothing. This argument was rejected and the policy underlying the immediate predecessor of article 4, \u00a7 11,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was articulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">\"This is a too narrow view of the situation. The idea back of the constitutional provision was to protect the legislators from the trouble, worry and inconvenience of court proceedings during the session, and for a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>time before and after, so that the State could have their undivided time .and attention in public affairs. Mr. Culver, as principal defendant, had the right to make a defense to the garnishee proceeding. In the present case the garnishee proceeding succeeded in doing just what the constitutional provision was created to avoid. It harassed the legislator, drove him to make a defense in the garnishee proceeding, and deprived him of the means of subsistence pending the balance of the session. We think the case clearly comes within the constitutional inhibition.\u201d 234 Mich 541-542.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In the case at bar, rather than argue that plaintiff is not being subjected to civil process, it is contended that the privilege should not apply during intra-session adjournments. In actuality, the term \"adjournment\u201d in this sense more properly partakes of the nature of a \"recess\u201d in the legislative session.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Article 4, \u00a7 13, of our Constitution, in pertinent part, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">\"The legislature shall meet at the seat of government on the second Wednesday in January of each year at twelve o\u2019clock noon. <em>Each regular session shall adjourn without day, on a day determined by concurrent resolution, </em>at twelve o\u2019clock noon.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">We are of the opinion that the word \"sessions\u201d in article 4, \u00a7 11, includes the regular session as defined in article 4, \u00a7 13, and the special session of article 4, \u00a7 28; article 5, \u00a7 15. Thus, we decline the invitation to define \"sessions\u201d as meaning only \"working sessions\u201d when the Legislature is actually sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Constituent contact, research, committee assignments, and other legislative business are not always confined to days when the Legislature is actually sitting. Under defendant\u2019s \"free time\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>exception, the legislator asserting the privilege could spend as much time and effort convincing the process-issuing court that he was about the public\u2019s business and therefore immune as he would subjecting himself to process. The policy which underlies the privilege and which is aimed at the potential as well as actual distraction from public duty would suffer. The Constitution specifies the period during which the privilege applies. If there is to be a judicial determination that the privilege must give way, our inquiry should be focused on whether the need for process in the individual case is compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Defendant contends, with merit, that consistent late December <em>sine die </em>adjournments could result in immunity continued from one regular session to the next, and therefore could totally frustrate access to the judicial process. This Court is mindful that unreasonably long periods of immunity could, in a hypothetical case not before us, amount to a denial of due process, particularly if the legislator were an essential party to the litigation. The need of a wife for a judgment of divorce<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or of a child for a decree of support<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> may compel a legislator\u2019s participation in the judicial process. It is conceivable that immunity unreasonably extended could result in a loss of a cause of action without a judicial tempering of the privilege, such as a rule tolling the statute of limitations during the period of inability to pursue process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, we are also mindful that we deal with a privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>created not by statute, but by our Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Today, we decide the scope of the privilege on the facts before us. As to other facts \"[cjhoice may prudently be postponed until choice becomes essential\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">In this case, there is no indication that the testimony of plaintiff Bishop is crucial to the maintenance of suit or that facts sought to be discovered from him are unavailable through other sources. From the Benkert pleadings it appears that the need advanced in opposition to the specific constitutional privilege here at issue is that of discovery from a non-party in a civil case to prove a point not in dispute. In the Benkert action, it was conceded that the investigations had been requested by a member of the Legislature and that the investigations were beyond the statutory authority of the state police.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">We therefore hold that the constitutional privilege from civil process obtains when the Legislature is in regular session, as defined in art 4, \u00a7 13, that this case on its facts does not advance due process interests sufficient to outweigh that privilege, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in quashing the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Affirmed.
