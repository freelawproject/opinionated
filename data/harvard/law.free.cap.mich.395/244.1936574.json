Fitzgerald, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANP\">Plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought suit against defendant A &amp; P and defendants Jahn for injuries sustained in the fall on the parking lot of a shopping center owned by defendants Jahn in which defendant A &amp; P maintained its store. A &amp; P filed a cross-complaint against the Jahns as lessors of the A &amp; P premises on the basis that the Jahns were under a duty to indemnify A &amp; P pursuant to the terms of the lease between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Evidence submitted at trial by plaintiffs indicated that on the evening of January 30, 1967, Larry Quinlivan parked his automobile in the parking lot adjacent to the A &amp; P store intending to buy some milk and bread at the A &amp; P. The parking lot was snow-covered and icy, although snow had not fallen for several days. After departing his automobile, plaintiff took several steps in the direction of the A &amp; P store and then felt his feet fly out from under him. He landed on his hip area and shortly thereafter was transported to the hospital by ambulance. Subsequent to the accident, Larry Quinlivan was operated upon several times. As a result of these events he suffered physical and mental disablement with attendant disintegrating effect upon his employment capability and family life.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Plaintiffs allege that defendants negligently permitted a dangerous icy condition to exist in the parking lot area. Such negligence, it was. urged, caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Prior to trial, the trial court entered a summary judgment of indemnification in favor of defendant A &amp; P against defendants Jahn. The jury ultimately awarded plaintiffs a verdict of $160,000<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against defendant A &amp; P, finding no cause of action as to defendants Jahn. The Court of Appeals reversed the jury award against defendant A &amp; P, relying upon <em>Weider v Goldsmith, </em>353 Mich 339; 91 NW2d 283 (1958). The Court of Appeals resolution rendered discussion of the indemnification issue unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We conclude that A &amp; P, as proprietor of a business, owed a duty to Larry Quinlivan to use reasonable care to protect against hazards arising from natural accumulation of ice and snow. We overrule existing case law to the extent that it indicates, and has been interpreted to indicate, that no duty is owed the invitee respecting hazards arising from natural accumulations of ice and snow. The jury verdict against defendant A &amp; P was rendered properly. We further conclude that summary judgment of indemnification was rendered properly against defendants Jahn in accordance with the terms of the lease between defendant A &amp; P and the Jahns. The Court of Appeals is reversed and the judgments below are reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">I \u2014 Standard of Care Owed an Invitee vis-a-vis Natural Accumulations of Ice and Snow.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">At trial, both defendant A &amp; P and defendants Jahn conceded that they owed some duty to exercise reasonable care to Larry Quinlivan as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>invitee on the shopping center premises. The precise nature of the duty owed plaintiff and the relationship of such duty to the alleged injury-causing condition of the parking lot was not specified on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The trial court gave jury instructions which read in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\"I charge you, members of the jury, that the defendants, the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, and the Jahns, owed to the plaintiff the duty to be reasonably sure they were not inviting him into a place of danger, and to that end they must exercise ordinary care and prudence to render the parking lot premises reasonably safe for plaintiff\u2019s visit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">\"I further charge you, members of the jury, that while the A &amp; P is not an insurer of safety of an invitee, if the A &amp; P Company knows, or reasonably should know of a dangerous condition on its premises, it may become liable for injuries resulting therefrom, and it may not delegate the responsibilities to another and thus escape liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">\"I further charge you, members of the jury, that a landowner is not liable to his invitees for injuries caused by the landowner\u2019s failure to remove natural accumulations of ice and snow from a normal outdoor unobstructed sidewalk or premises.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">\"I further charge you that a possessor of land is subject to liability for bodily harm caused to business visitors by natural or artificial conditions thereon, if, but only if, he or she knows, or by the exercise of reasonable care could discover, the conditions which, if known to him, he should realize is involving an unreasonable risk to said business visitors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Before the jury began deliberations, defendant A &amp; P moved for directed verdict on the basis that the proofs showed that the condition existing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the shopping center parking lot to be attributable solely to natural accumulation of ice and snow. Thus, it was argued, under the law defendants were absolved of any causal negligence. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, commenting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\"Whether or not it is a normal or natural accumulation of snow, it is still up to the jury to make a determination as to whether or not the defendants used that degree of care that is necessary and required of them to make sure that the dangerous condition, or no defect existed. I think the mere fact that it could have been a natural or normal accumulation does not necessarily negate the duties imposed on all the parties here, especially on [A &amp; P].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">When A &amp; P renewed its contention in the form of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and later upon motion for new trial, it was again rejected by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The Court of Appeals essentially agreed with the position set forth by A &amp; P in the trial court, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">\"Assuming that someone did something by way of snow removal, this record fails to disclose any affirmative act by A &amp; P which increased the hazard created by the natural accumulation of snow and ice or that created a new hazard. Absent such proof, A &amp; P is not liable for the injuries sustained by Larry E. Quinlivan or the derivative damages sustained by his wife due to such injuries. <em>Weider v Goldsmith, </em>353 Mich 339; 91 NW2d 283 (1958).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The issue before us \u2014 aptly framed by the disparate positions taken by the adversaries and the courts below \u2014 requires our crystallization of the legal relationship between conditions upon prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>erty arising as a result'of natural accumulation of ice and snow and a business proprietor\u2019s and landowner\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of an invitee.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">This Court in <em>Torma v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, </em>336 Mich 468; 58 NW2d 149 (1953), considered the circumstance of injury occurring to plaintiff, a business invitee, when she fell upon an icy angle iron at the entrance to defendant\u2019s store. A verdict for plaintiff resulted. On appeal, defendant, not unlike defendant A &amp; P herein, alleged that plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of liability on the part of the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In disagreeing with defendants\u2019 contention, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\"As invitor the defendant owed the duty to its customers and patrons, including the plaintiff, of maintaining its premises in a reasonably safe condition and of exercising due care to prevent and to obviate the existence of a situation, known to it or that should have been known, that might result in injury. In <em>Blakeley v White Star Line, </em>154 Mich 635 (19 LRA NS 772, 129 Am St Rep 496) [1908], this Court quoted with approval from Cooley on Torts, p 605, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\" ' \"One is under no obligation to keep his premises in safe condition for the visits of trespassers. On the other hand, when he expressly or by implication invites others to come upon his premises, whether for business or for any other purpose, it is his duty to be reasonably sure that he is not inviting them into danger, and to that end he must exercise ordinary care and prudence to render the premises reasonably safe for the visit.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\"Plaintiff testified positively to the presence of snow and ice in the entrance to defendant\u2019s store. It was her claim that a thin coating of ice on the angle bar was directly responsible for her slipping and falling. If the condition described in the testimony existed at 9:45, it is a fair inference, in view of the weather conditions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>that the entrance had not been swept out or scraped out that morning. Under the rule as stated by Justice Cooley there was at least an issue of fact as to whether defendant had exercised proper precautions to enable its customers to enter the store with reasonable assurance of safety in so doing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><em>Weider v Goldsmith, supra, </em>the case deemed dispositive by the Court of Appeals, involved plaintiff tenant\u2019s fall on an ice and snow covered public sidewalk in front of an apartment building owned by defendant landlords. A jury verdict for plaintiff resulted, but the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On appeal, plaintiff relied upon the theory that defendants, by their act of shoveling the sidewalk, had increased the natural hazard of the free fall of snow and ice, thereby causing injury. This Court concluded that plaintiff\u2019s proofs were insufficient to establish that injury arose from anything but a natural condition, incompleteness of snow removal being insufficient to justify a conclusion of defendants\u2019 causal intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The reach of the doctrine of <em>Weider </em>was made apparent in <em>Gillen v Martini, </em>31 Mich App 685; 188 NW2d 43 (1971). In <em>Gillen, </em>plaintiff, a business invitee antique dealer, fell, sustaining injury, on an unshoveled private walkway while approaching defendant\u2019s home in response to an advertisement in a local Lansing paper. The walkway on which plaintiff fell was unshoveled after a recent snowfall. While the Court of Appeals acknowledged that a landowner \"is under an affirmative duty to exercise due care to make the premises reasonably safe for the invitee\u2019s use\u201d that Court nonetheless stated that Michigan case law indicated that there would be no liability to an invitee where the injury-causing condition \"was caused solely by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>natural accumulations of ice and snow\u201d. <em>Gillen, supra, </em>686, 687.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>In <em>Bard v Weathervane of Michigan, </em>51 Mich App 329; 214 NW2d 709 (1974), plaintiff sustained a fall in the area of the parking lot in front of defendant\u2019s store. The parking lot was icy and rutted from a prior accumulation of snow and traffic and a light snow was falling at the time of the accident. A directed verdict in favor of defendants was granted in the trial court. The two-judge majority concluded, citing <em>Weider v Goldsmith, supra, </em>that the only duty owed plaintiff by defendant was \"not to increase [the] natural hazards or create a new hazard by any affirmative act\u201d. <em>Supra, </em>331. The lower court grant of directed verdict was affirmed on the basis that this duty had been discharged. Judge Holbrook dissented. Extensively analyzing the case history relied upon by the Court of Appeals in <em>Gillen, </em>he concluded that the \"natural accumulation\u201d rule historically arose in the context of municipal liability for care of public streets and sidewalks. So confined, the natural accumulation rule did not avoid the duty of a landowner or proprietor to exercise reasonable care \u2014 even when faced with natural accumulations of ice and snow \u2014 to protect business visitors. In support of this view, which he found embodied in Michigan law, Judge Holbrook cited the decision of the Alaska Supreme Court in <em>Kremer v Carr\u2019s Food Center, Inc, </em>462 P2d 747 (Alas, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Controversy concerning the \"natural accumulation\u201d rule again surfaced in <em>Gossman v Lambrecht, </em>54 Mich App 641; 221 NW2d 424 (1974). Plaintiff-tenant Robert Gossman brought suit against defendant landlord for injury sustained in a fall upon an icy sidewalk in front of the clubhouse of his apartment complex. At trial, plaintiffs abandoned the common-law theory of recovery<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>and asserted that defendant had a statutory duty to remove ice and snow from the sidewalk as indicated by <em>Feldman v Stein Building &amp; Lumber Co, </em>6 Mich App 180; 148 NW2d 544 (1967). Verdict for plaintiff resulted. The <em>Gossman </em>Court rejected the earlier holding of <em>Feldman </em>and remanded for a new trial at which the rule of <em>Welder, Gillen, </em>and <em>Bard </em>should be applied. While that Court indicated its understanding that existing Michigan law imposed no duty on a landlord, landowner or proprietor with respect to injuries caused by natural accumulations, that Court questioned the wisdom of such doctrine noting that other jurisdictions required exercise of such reasonable care as would include efforts within a reasonable time to remove natural accumulations of ice and snow.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The thrust of existing Michigan case law tends to support the conclusion generally drawn that the \"natural accumulation\u201d rule applies in the context of the invitee \u2014 invitor relationship. See, in particular, <em>Perl v Cohodas, Peterson, Paoli, Nast Co, </em>295 Mich 325; 294 NW 697 (1940). <em>Cf. Weider, supra; </em>and <em>Betts v Carpenter, </em>239 Mich 260; 214 NW 96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>(1927). The line of cases noting the natural accumulation rule, however, uniformly fails to harmonize or reconcile this rule with the rigorous duty which the law recognizes as owed an invitee. See, for a general discussion of the duty owed an invitee and distinction between such duty and the duty owed a licensee, <em>Preston v Sleziak, </em>383 Mich 442; 175 NW2d 759 (1970), and compare <em>Torma, supra </em>\u2014 a case which recognizes this rigorous duty \u2014and the cases cited above which discuss and rely solely upon the natural accumulation rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Judge Holbrook, in his dissenting opinion in <em>Bard v Weathervane, </em>opined that Michigan case law approved the \"natural accumulation\u201d rule with respect to <em>public </em>sidewalks but not with respect to private property in the context of the invitor \u2014 invitee relationship. Proceeding from the distinction between public and private property, Judge Holbrook would find a broader duty with respect to natural accumulations of ice and snow owed the business invitee than is owed the user of public streets or sidewalks. On this appeal we do not determine the duty owed the user of public streets and sidewalks. Under present Michigan law, liability for failure to keep <em>public </em>highways (including sidewalks) \"in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel\u201d falls principally upon the involved governmental unit and is statutorily defined. MCLA 691.1401, <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101), <em>et seq., </em>and <em>Levendoski v Geisenhaver, </em>375 Mich 225; 134 NW2d 228 (1965). Decision of the case at hand does not require us to address the scope of the statutory duty owed the user of public streets and sidewalks respecting natural accumulations of ice and snow. We need not, therefore, pass upon the merits of the holdings in cases <em>(e.g., Weider, supra; </em>and <em>Betts, supra) </em>which deal with injury from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>accumulations of ice and snow occurring on public streets and sidewalks.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">As suggested by Judge Holbrook in <em>Bard, supra, </em>and by the <em>Gossman </em>Court, it is time that this Court critically evaluate the \"natural accumulation\u201d rule in the context of the invitor \u2014 invitee relationship. Some jurisdictions in this country adhere to the natural accumulation rule while others do not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Prosser, speaking with reference to landlord-tenant law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> notes that \"[t]he prevailing view, by a scant margin, is that the [lessor\u2019s general] duty extends to conditions of purely natural origin, such as ice and snow on the steps; and there seems to b\u00e9 little reason in the distinction as to such conditions made by some of the courts\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Prosser, Torts (3rd ed), \u00a7 63, p 420. In general agreement with Prosser, a Michigan commentator has recently indicated approval of Judge Holbrook\u2019s analysis in <em>Bard:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\"Judge Holbrook would hold the owners and operators of business premises and the accesses thereto to a duty of due care to business invitees who might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>injured as a result of natural or artificial conditions on the premises. He sees little to distinguish an owner\u2019s liability for negligence in a parking lot from liability for negligence inside buildings. The fear of unwarranted suits in this area, he maintains, can be controlled by the doctrine of contributory negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\"Under negligence principles, Judge Holbrook\u2019s analysis is clearly correct. The liability of an owner or occupier should not be determined solely by the condition of the premises, natural or artificial, but rather by the occupier\u2019s conduct in relation to those conditions\u2014 that is, considering all of the circumstances, was due care exercised. By establishing a duty to business invitees, the court would be merely applying traditional negligence principles. Moreover, the defense of contributory negligence constitutes a substantial impediment to any plaintiff charged with knowledge of the danger, for the plaintiff must , exercise the care of a reasonable prudent person with regard to the danger.\u201d Littlejohn, Torts, 1974 Annual Survey Mich Law, 21 Wayne L Rev 665, 677, 678 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In the landmark case of <em>Kremer v Carr\u2019s Food Center, Inc, </em>462 P2d 747 (Alas, 1969), the Alaska Supreme Court rejected application of the \"natural accumulation\u201d rule in the invitor-invitee context. In <em>Kremer, </em>plaintiff fell, sustaining injuries, upon an icy rut on an unsalted, unscraped, ice- and snow-covered parking lot maintained for use of defendant supermarket\u2019s customers. At trial, defendant argued that the natural accumulation rule barred plaintiff\u2019s recovery. Rejecting this contention, the Alaska Supreme Court stated that the case was governed by existing Alaska authority approving the definition of the duty owed by a possessor of land to an invitee as set forth in 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343, pp 215-216. This section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\"A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">\"(a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition, and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\"(b) should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, or will fail to protect themselves against it, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\"(c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The Court further added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\"Section 343 is controlling here; A jury could have found: (a) that Carr\u2019s possessed the parking lot and knew the condition of its surface, (b) that Carr\u2019s should have realized that this condition involved an unreasonable risk of harm to its business invitees, (c) that Carr\u2019s should have expected that its business invitees would not discover or realize the danger, or should have anticipated that they would fail to protect themselves against a danger they did discover or realize, or should otherwise have anticipated harm to invitees despite the fact that the danger was known or obvious to them, and (d) that Carr\u2019s failed to exercise reasonable care to protect business invitees, such as Kremer, from the dangerous surface conditions in its parking lot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The Court confined application of the natural accumulation rule to cases involving the duty owed by municipalities to users of streets and sidewalks, viewing such users as licensees. In explaining its decision the Court further commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">\"Alaska\u2019s climatic conditions do not metamorphize all risks arising from ice and snow conditions into reasonable risks for the business invitee. Nor are we persuaded by appellee Carr\u2019s policy argument that in Alaska it would result in unreasonable costs to the private-commercial possessor of land to require the possessor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>clear ice and snow, or otherwise remedy conditions which amount to unreasonable risks of harm to its business invitees. The mere fact that snow and ice conditions prevail for many months throughout various locations in Alaska is not in and of itself sufficient rationale for the insulation of the possessor of land from liability to his business invitee. Nor do such climatic conditions negate the possibility that the possessor should have anticipated harm to the business invitee despite the latter\u2019s personal knowledge of the dangerous snow and ice conditions or the general obviousness of such conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\"What acts will constitute reasonable care on the part of the possessor of land will depend on the particular variables of each case. Our decision today does not represent the adoption of a flat requirement that the possessor\u2019s duty requires that he attempt to keep his land free of ice and snow. Dependent on the circumstances, reasonable care on the possessor\u2019s part could be demonstrated by other reasonable acts such as the sanding of the area, or application of salt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In our view the Alaska Court has appropriately conceived the legal duty owed by the invitor to the invitee. As that Court found the basis for its decision rooted in pre-existing Alaska law, we find that the basis for our decision is grounded in cases such as <em>Torma, supra, </em>which have recognized the rigorous duty owed an invitee. To the extent preexisting case law authority indicated that the natural accumulation rule applied in an invitorinvitee context, that authority is overruled.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>reasons adequately stated by the Alaska Court, we reject the prominently cited notion that ice and snow hazards are obvious to all and therefore may not give rise to liability. While the invitor is not an absolute insurer of the safety of the invitee, the invitor has a duty to exercise reasonable care to diminish the hazards of ice and snow accumulation. The general description of the duty owed appearing in the Restatement is a helpful exposition of the duty described in <em>Torma. </em>As such duty pertains to ice and snow accumulations, it will require that reasonable measures be taken within a reasonable time after an accumulation of ice and snow to diminish the hazard of injury to the invitee. The conduct of the invitee will often be relevant in the context of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Applying the foregoing to the case at hand, we sustain the jury verdict against defendant A &amp; P. Conflicting instructions, indicating both the rigorous duty owed plaintiff as an invitee and the natural accumulation rule, were submitted to the jury. The jury, in returning a verdict for plaintiff, must have perceived that the duty owed plaintiff as an invitee was not circumvented by the natural accumulation rule. Evidence at trial indicated that at the time of the accident the parking lot was ice- and snow-covered and very slippery. Snow had not fallen for several days and there was no evidentiary indication that salt had been applied to the parking lot surface.

The Jahns further informed the court that \"there are no facts upon which reasonable minds could differ\u201d. A &amp; P answered the Jahns\u2019 motion and moved for summary judgment on its own behalf on the basis of the above-cited lease provisions. A hearing on the motions for summary judgment was held before the trial court on January 28, 1972. At this hearing the trial court denied the Jahns\u2019 motion but granted summary judgment in favor of A &amp; P. An order to such effect was subsequently entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">No transcript of the hearing at which summary judgment was granted is available upon review. The parties apparently did not insist , that the proceedings be transcribed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In view of these circumstances we will proceed to review the trial court\u2019s actions on the premise that summary judgment was granted on the basis of the lease provisions relied upon by A &amp; P.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In <em>Siegel v Detroit City Ice &amp; Fuel Co, </em>324 Mich 205; 36 NW2d 719 (1949), plaintiff, an invitee to defendant theatre\u2019s premises, fell, while walking at night, in a snow- and ice-covered hole on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>common passageway owned by defendant ice company and leased to defendant theatre. The passageway led to defendant ice company\u2019s premises and also to the premises which defendant theatre leased from the ice company. The jury found both defendants negligent, awarding damages. On appeal, defendant ice company sought to avoid liability to plaintiff claiming, pursuant to the lease with defendant theatre, that it was not responsible for the condition of the lot that had been rented to the theatre company. In meeting this contention the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\"[This] is not a case where the landlord has rented the entire premises to one person who goes into sole possession, but it is one where the landlord reserves several buildings on the property and the joint right of ingress and egress with the tenant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The Court then went on to conclude that since both defendants had control and possession of the property the jury award against both was proper, citing as \"a correct statement of the law\u201d the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\"One who leases a part of the premises, retaining control of other portions such as common walks or passages which the tenant is entitled to use, is subject to liability to persons lawfully on the land with the consent of the tenant for damages caused by a dangerous condition existing on the part under the owner\u2019s control, if by reasonable care he could have discovered the condition and made it safe. <em>Bellon v Silver Gate Theatres, Inc, </em>4 Cal (2d) 1, 14 (47 Pac [2d] 462 [1935]); <em>Spore v Washington, </em>96 Cal App 345 (274 Pac 407 [1929]); see <em>Brown v Pepperdine, </em>53 Cal App 334, 336 (200 Pac 36 [1921]); 2 Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 360; Prosser on Torts (1941), pp 656, 657; 32 Am Jur p 561; 15 Cal Jur p 741. Accordingly, invitees of the tenant are regarded as being invitees of the owner while on pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>sageways which invitees of the tenant have a right to use and which are under the owner\u2019s control. <em>(Spore v Washington, </em>96 Cal App 345, at page 350 [274 Pac 407]); see 15 Cal Jur p 741.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>214, 215.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In <em>Bluemer v Saginaw Central Oil &amp; Gas Service, Inc, </em>356 Mich 399; 97 NW2d 90 (1959), the Court distinguished <em>Siegel </em>on its facts, but nonetheless approved the proposition that \"control and possession\u201d of the premises is critical in determining whether landlord, tenant, or both will be liable for injuries sustained on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The legal effect of the doctrine of <em>Siegel </em>and <em>Bluemer </em>was accurately reported as follows by the Court of Appeals in <em>Whinnen v 231 Corp, </em>49 Mich App 371; 212 NW2d 297 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\"The consensus holding seems to be that where a landlord or a tenant has, by virtue of a lease, assumed that degree of obligation with respect to the demised property as to indicate that control rests in him he will be held to answer for any breach of the duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition. <em>Bluemer v Saginaw Central Oil &amp; Gas Service, Inc, </em>356 Mich 399; 97 NW2d 90 (1959) and <em>Siegel v Detroit City Ice &amp; Fuel Co, </em>324 Mich 205; 36 NW2d 719 (1949).\u201d <em>Supra, </em>375.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">While <em>Siegel </em>and <em>Bluemer </em>are of significance to resolution of this case, the governing principle of law is more aptly framed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">\"Where a person has become liable with another for harm caused to a third person because of his negligent failure to make safe a dangerous condition of land or chattels * * * which, as between the two, it was the other\u2019s duty to make safe, he is entitled to restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>from <em>[i.e., </em>to be indemnified by] the other for expenditures properly made in the discharge of such liability, unless after discovery of the danger, he acquiesced in the continuation of the condition.\u201d Restatement, Restitution, \u00a7 95, p 415.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">This rule is noted, and the following comments are made with respect to its application, in 41 Am Jur 2d, Indemnity, \u00a7 17, p 704:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\u201cIn accord with this rule are cases holding that where the loss results from the indemnitee\u2019s negligent failure to make safe a dangerous condition created by the indemnitor, and does not result from the indemnitee\u2019s own sole negligence, indemnity is not barred. But where the indemnitee\u2019s acquiescence in the dangerous condition is shown by long-continued awareness of a dangerous situation on his part without the taking of any corrective measures or calling upon the indemnitor to do so, indemnity will not be permitted.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The principle set forth in the Restatement applies to the facts at hand although the jury in this case found no cause of action against defendants Jahn. During presentation of proofs at trial, the trial court did not permit introduction of evidence pertaining to the issue of risk allocation between the Jahns and A &amp; P. In particular, the introduction of lease provisions which pertained to risk allocation was prohibited. The reason for such treatment was that the issue of risk allocation between A &amp; P and the Jahns had already been resolved by the grant of A &amp; P\u2019s motion for summary judgment of indemnification after both parties had conceded that there were no disputed facts pertaining to the issue. The language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Restatement contemplates circumstances where the indemnification issue is resolved after liability against defendants has been determined. Prior resolution of the indemnity issue in this case determined at the outset the potential derivative liability of defendants Jahn.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">There is a clear relationship between the \"control and possession\u201d principle of <em>Siegel, Bluemer, </em>and <em>Whinnen </em>and the Restatement \"duty to make safe\u201d. The land or property owner\u2019s bundle of possessory responsibilities may be diminished by the \"loaning\u201d of one or several of these responsibilities. This \"loaning\u201d gives a quantum of \"control and possession\u201d to another party. If such quantum of control and possession confers responsibility for an aspect of ownership which gives rise to liability then a \u201cduty to make safe\u201d will be found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Motions for summary judgment were submitted to the trial court in agreement that the sole basis for consideration was the application and effect of the lease terms.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Defendants Jahn contended then, and now assert, that there was no express contract of indemnification in the lease. While this is undoubtedly so, a right to indemnification may be said to arise if the lease provisions establish that the Jahns by the provisions of the lease assumed a \"duty to make safe\u201d the area of the parking lot against hazards from ice and snow accumulation. The description of the demised premises in the lease tends to indicate that the parking lot was leased to A &amp; P. However, other lease provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>explicitly stipulate that the Jahns were to assume responsibility for providing ice and snow removal on the parking lot, although charging the A &amp; P and others for such service, and that the Jahns were to assume responsibility to make necessary repairs and maintain the parking lot and to delimit parking use by customers on the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Even if we assume that the right to possess the parking lot passed to A &amp; P under the terms of the lease, we conclude that A &amp; P, under the lease, \"loaned\u201d its responsibility for removal of ice and snow hazard in the parking lot to the Jahns.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Such \"loaning\u201d placed the requisite control and possession in the Jahns to give rise to a duty on their part to make safe the area of the parking lot against hazards from ice and snow accumulation. Injury to plaintiff occurred as a result of the failure of defendants Jahn to fulfill this duty. Summary judgment of indemnification pursuant to the lease terms was properly granted in favor of A &amp; P.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The Court of Appeals is reversed and the judgments entered in the court below are reinstated.

Defendants do not dispute the well-settled rule that while a landowner is not an insurer of the invitee\u2019s safety, he is under an affirmative duty to exercise due care to make the premises reasonably safe for the invitee\u2019s use. <em>Shorkey v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, </em>259 Mich 450, 452 (1932); <em>Ruemenapp v National Food Stores, Inc, </em>25 Mich App 291, 294 (1970); <em>Mills v A B Dick Co, </em>26 Mich App 164, 167 (1970). Rather, defendants\u2019 argument is that the general duty owed invitees does not include removal of natural accumulations of ice and snow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\"In this regard, we note that an abutting property owner may not be held liable to pedestrians for injuries sustained by falling on sidewalks made hazardous by natural accumulations of ice and snow, and statutes and ordinances which impose a duty upon landowners to clean sidewalks create no private liability. <em>Taylor v Lake Shore &amp; M S R Co, </em>45 Mich 74 (1881); <em>Grooms v Union Guardian Trust Co, </em>309 Mich 437 (1944); <em>Levendoski v Geisenhaver, </em>375 Mich 225 (1965). Cases which alter the rule of non-liability to pedestrians do so when artificial conditions cause aggravation of natural hazards. <em>Betts v Carpenter, </em>239 Mich 260 (1927); <em>Weider v Goldsmith, </em>353 Mich 339 (1958).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\"Once the status of invitee is established, plaintiffs have been able to establish the liability of the landowner where the injuries are sustained either in the vestibule of a building, <em>Keech v Clements, </em>303 Mich 69 (1942), or on a sloping terrazzo walkway leading from the store to a public sidewalk, <em>DeSmit v JC Penney Co, </em>369 Mich 527 (1963). However, we have found no Michigan case in which a landowner has been held liable for failure to clear a natural accumulation of ice and snow from a normal, outdoor, and unobstructed sidewalk. The record in this case clearly shows that the dangerous condition, if it existed, was caused solely by natural accumulations of ice and snow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\"In <em>Perl v Cohodas, Peterson, Paoli, Nast Co, </em>295 Mich 325, 334, 335 (1940), the Court observed that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\" 'Most of the cases involving ice and snow concern actions against municipalities for such accumulations on sidewalks.
