Defendants Michigan Bell Telephone Company and The Detroit Edison Company answered the board\u2019s petition claiming that under the provisions of the plat act they were entitled to retain easements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>reserved in the alley for their facilities or alternatively to be compensated for the cost of relocation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The circuit court held that the board was required to pay compensation and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 51 Mich App 488; 215 NW2d 704 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We affirm. There is no need to decide whether a public utility, under these or other circumstances, is obliged to relocate its facilities without compensation at the behest of a governmental authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A school district has not been so empowered by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The board relies on the \"do all other things\u201d and the \"do anything whatever that may advance the interests of education\u201d language of the School Code of 1955 to support its broad police powers claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">\"Said board shall have power to purchase, lease, and take by the right of eminent domain all property, erect and maintain or lease all buildings, employ and pay all persons, and <em>do all other things in its judgment necessary for the proper </em>establishment, <em>maintenance, management and carrying on of the public schools </em>and for the protection of other property of the school district, and <em>to do anything whatever that may advance the interests of education, the good government and prosperity of the free schools in said city, </em>and the welfare of the public concerning the same, and it shall have authority to adopt bylaws, rules and regulations for its own government and for the control and government of all schools, school property and pupils. If property is sought to be taken by eminent domain, such proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>ings may be brought under the terms of Act No. 149 of the Public Acts of 1911, as amended, being sections 213.21 to 213.41 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, or any other appropriate state law.\u201d MCLA 340.192; MSA 15.3192 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The board also relies on the following provisions of the plat act in effect at the time the board originally filed its petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">\"If any proprietor of part of a plat or the governing body of any municipality who consider it necessary or advisable * * * [for any of several listed reasons it may] petition the circuit court * * * to alter or vacate, or to correct or revise.\u201d MCLA 560.60; MSA 26.490.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">A proprietor is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">\"The word 'proprietor,\u2019 when used in this act, shall be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular and may mean either a natural person, firm, association, partnership, corporation or a combination of any of them.\u201d MCLA 560.2; MSA 26.432.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The board asserts, and the utilities concede, that the board is the proprietor of the alley and the adjoining property. We agree with the utilities that the board is not a \"governing body\u201d within the meaning of the plat act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">\"The words 'governing body,\u2019 as used in this act, shall be deemed to apply to and describe the township board of any township or the legislative body of any city or village as the case may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">\"The word 'municipality,\u2019 as used in this act, shall mean a township, city or village as the case may be.\u201d MCLA 560.2; MSA 26.432.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">While a school district is a type of municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>corporation, <em>School Dist No 4 of Marathon Twp v Gage, </em>39 Mich 484 (1878); <em>Attorney General ex rel McRae v Thompson, </em>168 Mich 511; 134 NW 722 (1912); <em>Hall v Ira Twp, </em>348 Mich 402; 83 NW2d 443 (1957), it is not a \"municipality\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Nor is the board a \"governing body\u201d as defined in the plat act. The \"governing body\u201d of the City of Detroit is the Common Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">The board urges an expansive interpretation of its power under the \"do all other things\u201d and the \"do anything whatever\u201d language of the School Code. It contends that it should be accorded the power to require relocation of utilities without compensation because of the high priority that should be given school construction. We decline to accord the board \"police power by necessity\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We defer consideration of the question whether relocation without compensation can be required by a governmental authority in any circumstances to a case where disposition requires determination of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Affirmed. No costs, a public question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b117-7\">T. G. Kavanagh, C. J., and Williams, Levin, and M. S. Coleman, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b117-8\">Swainson, J. W. Fitzgerald, and Lindemer, JJ., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-8\"> When the action was commenced MCLA 560.62; MSA 26.492 of the plat act was in effect. A stipulation and order allowed the continuation of construction pending resolution. The Subdivision Control Act, MCLA 560.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 26.430(101) <em>et seq., </em>has superseded the plat act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\"> <em>See, </em>VanAlstyne, <em>Taking or Damaging by Police Power: The Search For Inverse Condemnation Criteria, </em>44 So Cal L Rev 1, 51-56 (1971) and Sax, <em>Taking and Police Power, </em>74 Yale L J 36, 67 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
