He married and worked at various jobs in Michigan before moving his family to California in 1943 where he found employment as an asbestos worker. After a two-year apprenticeship, he received his journeyman\u2019s card and remained in the asbestos field for the next 25 years. Plaintiff\u2019s line of work exposed him to excessive quantities of dust. A member of a local union, he was sent out of state to work wherever men were needed. He worked in New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, New Jersey, and also in Michigan where he spent approximately five of those 25 years._</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>In January, 1967 he was laid off from work in California and he came to Michigan seeking employment. In August of that year plaintiff began working at the Trenton powerhouse for Combustion Engineering. Plaintiff had the task of installing insulation blankets on the walls of a boiler and this resulted in his exposure to fiberglass dust. Around January 1, 1968 plaintiff was employed by Hinchliffe &amp; Kenner, defendant-appellant,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to do the same work on the project. He remained in defendant\u2019s employ until May 14, 1968 when he left his job because of a shortness of breath and chest pains. Plaintiff first experienced these symptoms in 1966 and his condition apparently had continued to worsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Upon returning to California, plaintiff in June, 1968 filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits under California law. He indicated that he had been employed as an asbestos worker by various employers during the period March, 1943 to May 14, 1968, and claimed to have developed a pulmonary disorder as a result of exposure to asbestos dust. On June 19, 1969, the California Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board issued an order approving a compromise and release of the claim. An award of $10,045.48 was made by multiple California employers. After deducting attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, charges by two doctors and satisfaction of a lien of the Department of Employment, plaintiff netted $8,125.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">On July 22, 1969 plaintiff filed for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in Michigan for the same injury for which he had previously received an award in California. Hinchliffe &amp; Kenner, being plaintiff\u2019s only Michigan employer during the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ten years who had employed him for a period of six months, was the sole employer named as a defendant. The hearing referee found plaintiff disabled as a result of an injury arising, out of and in the course of his employment with defendant. He also ruled that no credit could be given for the California award.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">While all members of the appeal board concurred on the issue of defendant\u2019s liability they split on the question of crediting the California award. Three members felt no authority existed for ordering credits while two members would have required credit for the California award. The Court of Appeals denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. We granted leave on August 23, 1974. 392 Mich 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">II \u2014 Prior Award Does Not Bar Recovery in Second State</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Defendants argue that under the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution plaintiff\u2019s prior receipt of a compensation award is a bar to recovery in a Michigan proceeding concerning the same injury<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and cite the case of <em>Magnolia Petroleum Co v Hunt, </em>320 US 430; 64 S Ct 208; 88 L Ed 149 (1943), as authority. The impact of a compensation award received in one state upon a proceeding for compensation in a second state was in the past the subject of extensive debate among both jurists and legal analysts. However, the issue, at least in terms of the applicability of the full faith and credit clause, appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>to be settled and today a workmen\u2019s compensation recovery in one state in most instances will not act as an absolute bar to a recovery in a second state. <em>A. </em>Background<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The law prior to <em>Magnolia Petroleum Co v Hunt, supra, </em>was that a recovery in one state was not a bar to recovery in a second state. Goodrich, Conflict of Laws (3d ed), p 287. However, in 1943 the United States Supreme Court in a five-to-four decision ruled that a worker who had received a compensation award in Texas was precluded by the full faith and credit clause from seeking a remedy in Louisiana. <em>Magnolia, supra, </em>443.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The decision received widespread criticism in legal periodicals<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and efforts were made by other courts to distinguish the <em>Magnolia </em>decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Just five years after its decision in <em>Magnolia, </em>the United States Supreme Court dramatically altered its position and in <em>Industrial Commission of Wisconsin v McCartin, </em>330 US 622; 67 S Ct 886; 91 L Ed 1140 (1947), unanimously ruled that an Illinois <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>resident injured in Wisconsin who had previously recovered compensation in Illinois was not precluded from maintaining an action in Wisconsin for workmen\u2019s compensation. The Court suggested that the Illinois award had a different effect from the Texas award in the <em>Magnolia </em>case. The Court indicated that while the Illinois Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act had been interpreted as precluding rights of action against the employer under Illinois common law or under the Illinois Personal Injury Act (Ill Rev Stat 1943, ch 70, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2), it was not intended to preclude compensation actions in other states arising out of the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>McCartin </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">\"there is nothing in the statute or in the decisions thereunder to indicate that it is completely exclusive, that it is designed to preclude any recovery by proceedings brought in another state for injuries received there in the course of an Illinois employment. <em>Cf. Bradford Elec Co v Clapper, supra </em>[286 US 145; 52 S Ct 571; 76 L Ed 1026 (1932)]; <em>Cole v Industrial Commission, </em>353 Ill 415; 187 NE 520 [1933]. And in light of the rule that workmen\u2019s compensation laws are to be liberally construed in furtherance of the purpose for which they were enacted, <em>Baltimore &amp; Phila Steamboat Co v Norton, </em>284 US 408, 414 [52 S Ct 187; 76 L Ed 366 (1932)], we should not readily interpret such a statute so as to cut off an employee\u2019s right to sue under other legislation passed for his benefit. Only some unmistakable language by a state legislature or judiciary would warrant our accepting such a construction. Especially is this true where the rights affected are those arising under legislation of another state and where the full faith and credit provision of the United States Constitution is brought into play. See <em>Ohio v Chattanooga Boiler Co, </em>289 US 439 [53 S Ct 663; 77 L Ed 1307 (1933)].\u201d <em>supra, </em>627-628.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">It is now widely accepted that <em>McCartin </em>severely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>limited, if not overruled, <em>Magnolia, </em>by holding that an employee\u2019s right to proceed in a second state will not be precluded unless the first state\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation act in \"unmistakable language\u201d bars the employee from bringing an action in another state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ApL0\">\n<em>B. Effect of California Award</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Plaintiffs compromise and release in California was approved by that state\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board. In California this type of settlement when approved by the appeal board has the force and effect of an award made after a full hearing. See <em>Johnson v Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, </em>2 Cal 3d 964; 88 Cal Rptr 202; 471 P2d 1002, 1007 (1970). Thus in this case we are dealing with an \"award\u201d and not the type of voluntary payment found in <em>Cline v Byrne Doors, Inc, </em>324 Mich 540; 37 NW2d 630 (1949), where this Court found the full faith and credit clause was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The question then becomes whether there is \"unmistakable language\u201d in the California Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which \"cut[s] off an employee\u2019s right to sue under other legislation passed for his benefit\u201d. <em>McCartin, supra, </em>628. The parties do not direct this Court to any such language nor has our independent inquiry revealed such a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>cific restriction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus in accordance with the rule laid down in <em>Industrial Commission of Wisconsin v McCartin, supra, </em>we find that plaintiffs award in California does not act as a bar under the full faith and credit clause to proceedings in this state for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits arising out of the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">This result is consistent with the result reached by this Court in <em>Schenkel v Tower Builders Co, Inc, </em>380 Mich 492; 157 NW2d 204 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Ill \u2014 Award in First State Should be Credited</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Having determined that the California award does not act as a bar to proceedings in Michigan, the question remains whether the California award must be credited against the award received under the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that credit should be given for the California award.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In other jurisdictions it has been the rule both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>before Magnolia<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and after McCartin<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that the amount of the award made in the first state should be subtracted from the award made in the second state.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">While other jurisdictions have resolved this issue by requiring that credit for prior awards be given, Michigan cases have left the question of the law in this state somewhat in doubt. In <em>Cline v Byrne Doors, Inc, </em>324 Mich 540; 37 NW2d 630 (1949), a majority of the Court chose not to deal with the issue of credits but Justice Butzel in his concurrence made a compelling argument for requiring credit for the prior award. In <em>Schenkel v Tower Builders Co, Inc, </em>380 Mich 492, 494; 157 NW2d 204 (1968), the Court made reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>fact that appeal board below had stipulated \"that the defendant is to receive credit for weekly benefits heretofore paid under the Indiana workmen\u2019s compensation act\u201d. Since the Court did not disturb this order of the appeal board, it is some indication that the Court felt credits for prior awards were appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Despite the trend in other jurisdictions requiring credits and the apparent acceptance of such practice in this state, plaintiff argues that \u00a7 811 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> prohibits giving any credit for prior awards from foreign jurisdictions. Section 811 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\"No savings or insurance of the injured employee, nor any contribution made by him to any benefit fund or protective association independent of this act, shall be taken into consideration in determining the compensation to be paid hereunder nor shall benefits derived from any other source than those paid or caused to be paid by the employer as provided in this act, be considered in fixing the compensation under this act, except as provided in section 161 and section 359.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">While this section could be read as precluding the giving of any credit for prior workmen\u2019s compensation awards from foreign jurisdictions (a conclusion reached by a majority of the appeal board), we do not believe this is the only interpretation which may or must be given this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Section 811 concerns savings, health insurance, and various benefit fund programs which might supplement the workmen\u2019s compensation award. This section does not address itself specifically to the question of the effect of workmen\u2019s compensation awards made by other jurisdictions. Whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u00a7 811 was intended to apply to such foreign workmen\u2019s compensation awards is ambiguous at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Where the meaning of the statute is doubtful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\"a reasonable construction must be given, looking to the purpose subserved thereby. <em>Attorney General v Bank of Michigan, </em>Harr Ch (Mich) 315; <em>Bennett v Michigan Pulpwood Co, </em>181 Mich 33 [147 NW 490 (1914)]. Its occasion and necessity are matters of judicial concern, <em>Sibley v Smith, </em>2 Mich 486 [1853], and <em>Bennett v Michigan Pulpwood Co, supra, </em>and its purpose should be \u00e9ffected if possible, <em>People v Stickle, </em>156 Mich 557 [121 NW 497 (1909)]. Its spirit and purpose should prevail over its strict letter, <em>Stambaugh Township v Iron County Treasurer, </em>153 Mich 104 [116 NW 569 (1908)]. Injustice in its application should be prevented, <em>Attorney General, ex rel Common Council of the City of Detroit v Marx, </em>203 Mich 331 [168 NW 1005 (1918)], and absurd consequences avoided, <em>Attorney General v Railway, </em>210 Mich 227 [177 NW 726 (1920)].\u201d <em>Webster v Rotary Electric Steel Co, </em>321 Mich 526, 531; 33 NW2d 69 (1948).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">See also <em>People v McFarlin, </em>389 Mich 557, 563; 208 NW2d 504 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Double recovery is repugnant to the very principles of workmen\u2019s compensation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Justice Butzel said in his concurring opinion in <em>Cline, supra, </em>558:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\"The purpose of the compensation acts is to provide a method by which an injured employee receives compensation for his injuries promptly and without delay of legal procedure. Not to give credit for payments made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>under the law of a foreign State having jurisdiction as here would defeat this purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-3\">Plaintiff, during his many years of employment, worked not only in Michigan and California but in Texas, New Mexico, New Jersey and Arizona as well. We do not know whether plaintiff is eligible for benefits in any or all of these states, but under plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 811 a recovery in one or all of these remaining states could not be taken into consideration in computing plaintiffs Michigan award.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">To preclude credits would allow claimants to receive windfalls not intended by the act. It would have the effect of allowing some workers to receive more compensation than their fellow employees who suffer from the same occupational disease simply because they had spent some of their employment career out of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">It goes beyond the ridiculous to suggest that the Legislature would intend a result which is so contrary to the fundamental principles of workmen\u2019s compensation. What\u2019s more the Legislature elsewhere in the act provides for the apportionment of liability among a claimant\u2019s former employers, thus preventing double recoveries for occupational diseases such as plaintiff has suffered which develop over a period of time and cannot always be traced to one employment experience. Section 435<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> sets forth this system of apportionment for compensation liability which, but for the fact that jurisdiction cannot be obtained over plaintiffs foreign employers, would be applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Where we can we will avoid unjust and absurd results. We do not read \u00a7 811 as precluding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>allowance of credits for prior awards made under the foreign workmen\u2019s compensation acts of other states. Such crediting is necessary to avoid injustice and to remain consistent with the principles of workmen\u2019s compensation. We follow the lead established by other jurisdictions and find that credits for prior awards must be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">IV \u2014 Defendants\u2019 Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Independent of any argument concerning the effect of the California award upon the Michigan proceedings, defendants maintain that the record is devoid of competent evidence to establish that plaintiff is disabled as a result of his employment with defendant Hinchliffe &amp; Kenner. On redirect examination, Dr. Ira Avrin testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\"><em>\"Q. </em>Based on the knowledge that you have of Mr. Stanley from your physical examination, your history taking, and the hypothetical as proposed to you today do you have an opinion as to whether or not in Mr. Stanley\u2019s case his last exposure at Hinchliffe &amp; Kenner played a significant role in his present disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\"><em>\u2019A. </em>I am of the opinion it played a significant role. I think that tunnel work, or construction work, in a confined area even with forced ventilation it is difficult to perform in such a manner as to eliminate the hazard of inhalation entirely, or significantly, and I feel that that exposure was incurred in an individual who already had tissues that had been subjected to injury by previous exposure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Also, it must be remembered that plaintiff, in order to recover for disability resulting from his occupational disease need not prove that work for his last employer was \"the primary and principal cause of his symptoms and disabilities. The act specifically defines a much different basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>determination of employer liability.\u201d <em>Smith v Lawrence Baking Co, </em>370 Mich 169, 175; 121 NW2d 684 (1963). Section 435 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides pertinently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">\"The total compensation due shall be recoverable from the employer who last employed the employee in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due and in which it was contracted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The hearing referee and all members of the appeal board agreed that the evidence supported a finding that defendant was liable. We see no reason to disturb the conclusions reached below on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">V \u2014 Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">We find that the full faith and credit clause does not bar a proceeding in Michigan for the same injury for which an award in California has been obtained. However, a credit must be given for the award \u2014 the exact dollar amount to be determined by the appeal board on remand. Finally, we conclude that evidence does exist in the record to support a finding of liability against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">The decision of the appeal board is reversed and the matter is remanded to the board for further disposition not inconsistent with decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">No costs, a public question being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b772-11\">Kavanagh, C.

If he was injured in the course of his employment for both concerns we think it clear that he has sustained two distinct wage losses during his disability. That he may have received weekly payments under Mississippi law, amounting to a percentage of his Mississippi salary, is not a sound reason for denying weekly payments under Arkansas law to compensate the loss of his Arkansas salary.

However, the plaintiff in this case does not fall within this exception.
