Baun was disbarred<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by the State Bar Grievance Board after a hearing panel had suspended his license to practice law for two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The hearings disclosed that Mr. Baun had failed to maintain separate accounts for four estates and had commingled those funds with his personal funds. He had eventually converted $147,-019.14 to his own use. He and his sureties repaid all funds which were so converted.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Attorney Baun submits that he was denied a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal. He contends that in effect the State Bar Grievance Board requested the investigation, investigated, determined probable cause, charged, prosecuted, and then found appellant guilty. The Grievance Board maintains that the nexus between the State Bar Grievance Administrator, the hearing panel and itself is sufficiently attenuated as to negate that contention. We agree with the Grievance Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In a recent case which is dispositive of this issue, <em>Withrow v Larkin, </em>421 US 35; 95 S Ct 1456; 43 L Ed 2d 712 (1975), involving the revocation of a medical license, the United States Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\"The initial charge or determination of probable cause and the ultimate adjudication have different bases and purposes. The fact that the same agency makes them in tandem and that they relate to the same issues does not result in a procedural due process violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\"That the combination of investigative and adjudicatory functions does not, without more, constitute a due process violation, does not, of course, preclude a court from determining from the special facts and circumstances present in the case before it that the risk of unfairness is intolerably high.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>In the instant case, the State Bar Grievance Administrator found probable cause, prepared, filed and prosecuted the complaint. A hearing panel initially adjudicated the matter and then the State Bar Grievance Board reviewed it. The functions are separate. The people are different in each instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"><em>Withrow </em>is clear. Absent a contrary showing, the hearing panel, the Grievance Board and the Grievance Administrator, in addition to being functionally separate, are assumed to be fair and honest \u2014 composed of \"men of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances\u201d. We have been presented with no special facts or circumstances which suggest that the risk of unfairness is \"intolerably high\u201d or that it even minimally exists.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find no denials of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Attorney Baun also argues that the mere attempt by the State Bar to call him for cross-examination was prejudicial and violative of his right against self-incrimination. Before Mr. Baun was called for cross-examination, counsel to the State Bar Grievance Administrator had been informed that Baun would invoke his right against self-incrimination. Appellant contends that the only purpose in calling him to the stand was to emphasize that he was invoking his Fifth Amendment rights. This, contends appellant, is akin to a prosecutor arguing to a jury that it should draw an inference of guilt from a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>On the other hand, the Grievance Board contends that the question is not whether appellant can invoke his Fifth Amendment rights, but rather when can he invoke those rights. State Bar Rule 16, \u00a7 16.11 permits cross-examination. Respondent\u2019s right of refusal extends only to those questions which might incriminate him. The appellant has no blanket right to refuse cross-examination on everything involved in the proceedings, including his name, place of practice, date of admission to the bar and other non-incriminating matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We find <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Moes, </em>389 Mich 258; 205 NW2d 428 (1973), coupled with <em>State Bar of Michigan v Block, </em>383 Mich 384; 175 NW2d 769 (1970), to be controlling. The <em>Block </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">\"It is not requisite, so far at least in our developing area of ultraism, that a lawyer be proved a criminal before he can be disbarred. It is requisite only that his conduct be that which proves clearly that he is unfit to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities belonging to the office of an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\"So far as Michigan is concerned, this Court long since has directed that the circuit court, when it determines and orders discipline of an attorney under Rule 15, should administer such discipline 'as a measure necessary for the protection of the public, the courts and the legal profession, and not as punishment for wrongdoing.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">\"In the application of Rule 15 to this respondent we find no taint of unconstitutionality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The <em>Moes </em>Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">\"Respondent misconceives the office of the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Amendment\u2019s privilege. The choice of whether to appear and to offer proofs lies with the one charged, but the obligation to meet charges never entails an obligation of self incrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Here the appellant tried to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights in order to shed his obligation to meet charges and answer questions which could have been non-incriminating. True, if respondent were obliged to answer any and all questions asked, some of his utterances might have been incriminating. But the injection of that argument at this stage is inappropriate. The Administrator was precluded from asking any question at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Respondent\u2019s contention presupposes a blanket immunity from cross-examination. He claims prejudice because of alleged undue emphasis placed upon the mere taking of the stand and the invocation of his right against self-incrimination. But there was no undue influence. The State Bar Grievance Administrator had the right to cross-examine the appellant concerning non-incriminating acts, words and deeds which bore upon his fitness as an attorney to perform the duties and responsibilities entrusted to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The hearing panel and State Bar Grievance Board would be no more influenced by his failure to answer some of the questions while on the stand than by Mr. Baun\u2019s failure to take the stand. These are experienced people selected for their integrity, objectivity and intelligence. A considerable trust reposes in them and absent a specific showing to the contrary, we cannot find \"undue influence\u201d in requesting respondent to take the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In this context, we must keep in mind the purpose of this proceeding, to wit: the ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\"protection of the public, the courts and the legal profession\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">It therefore follows that the board erred in denying all cross-examination of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">As to the administrator\u2019s cross-appeal, we find the error to his case harmless. Respondent was found guilty of the alleged offenses. However, this point of procedure may well be crucial in future matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Although the bar grievance procedure withstands the challenges herein, we have not been enlightened by the board as to the findings and reasoning which prompted the extension of the two-year suspension to disbarment. Therefore, pursuant to <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Gillette, </em>393 Mich 26; 222 NW2d 513 (1974), we remand to the State Bar Grievance Board for the purpose of setting forth reasons in support of the order of discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">We retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-10\">T.

Views regarding its applicability in attorney disciplinary proceedings are especially divergent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The United States Supreme Court has held that a lawyer cannot be disbarred for refusing to testify in a disciplinary proceeding.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In subsequent decisions a New York court has held that an attorney must produce potentially incriminating files in a disciplinary proceeding* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and a California court has held that a hearing panel need not inform the witness of the right to refuse to testify.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">However, in <em>State Bar of Michigan v Woll, </em>387 Mich 154, 165; 194 NW2d 835, 840 (1972), this Court set aside a three-month suspension ordered by the State Bar Grievance Board because counsel for the Grievance Administrator in his closing argument contended that the hearing panel should draw an adverse inference because of the attorney\u2019s exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege. This Court said that the privilege against self-incrimination applies to a disciplinary proceeding and that comments concerning an accused\u2019s silence are prohibited by the Fifth Amendment and the Michigan Constitution (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The Court rejected the contention that the error was harmless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\"While, as counsel for the State Bar points out, the Hearing Panel is made up of lawyers who should not be swayed by emotional arguments, the full Grievance Board does consist of two laymen who may not be familiar with the extent of the privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, counsel for the State Bar did argue to the Hearing Panel that they should take defendant\u2019s failure to answer as evidence of his guilt, and he cannot now assert that because they were lawyers they must have known that he was making an improper argument and, thus, disregard it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Having participated in numerous discussions with lawyers and judges, I know there is no clear and undoubted view regarding the scope of the Fifth Amendment privilege and the consequence of its exercise in bar disciplinary proceedings. We cannot rest comfortably in the notion that all lawyers serving on hearing panels will not draw an adverse inference from an attorney\u2019s claim of the privilege during a disciplinary hearing. \"Too many, <em>even those who should be better advised, </em>view this privilege as a shelter for wrongdoers.\u201d <em>Ullmann v United States, </em>350 US 422, 426; 76 S Ct 497; 100 L Ed 511 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Nevertheless, I agree that respondent in this case cannot predicate error on this ground. He expressly exercised his Fifth Amendment privilege in his answers to the request for investigation and formal complaint, declining to answer the specific allegations against him \"in reliance upon and preservation of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination\u201d. His claim of privilege was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>thereby brought to the attention of the hearing panel and the Grievance Board before and without regard to counsel\u2019s request at the hearing that he take the stand. Under the circumstance that the hearing panel and Grievance Board were made aware <em>by the respondent </em>himself of his exercise of the privilege, no harm was done when counsel for the Grievance Administrator challenged respondent in the presence of the hearing panel to invoke the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>McCarthy v Arndstein, </em>266 US 34, 40; 45 S Ct 16, 17; 69 L Ed 158, 161 (1924), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\"The Government insists, broadly, that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination does not apply in any civil proceeding. The contrary must be accepted as settled. The privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon the nature of the proceeding in which the testimony is sought or is to be used. <em>It applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it. </em>\"(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">This principle has been codified in the Revised Judicature Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">\"Any competent witness in a cause shall not be excused from answering a question relevant to the matter in issue, on the ground merely that the answer to such question may establish, or tend to establish, that such witness owes a debt, or is otherwise subject to a civil suit; <em>but this provision shall not be construed to require a witness to give any answer which will have a tendency to accuse himself of any crime or misdemeanor, or to expose him to any penalty or forfeiture, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>nor in any respect to vary or alter any other rule respecting the examination of witnesses.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) MCLA 600.2154; MSA 27A.2154.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">My colleagues say that respondent was obliged to submit himself to \"cross-examination\u201d on non-incriminating matters \"including his name, place of practice, date of admission to the bar and other non-incriminating matters\u201d. Clearly, the issue is more fundamental than name, rank and serial number.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Baun was not called to the stand to put on the record his name, place of practice and date of admission to the har; at that point in the proceedings, that information was superfluous. The only apparent purpose of calling him was to cause him to invoke the privilege. Unless counsel for the Grievance Administrator asserts and is able to demonstrate a valid purpose for calling a respondent who he knows will invoke the privilege, the general prohibition against calling upon an opponent to waive a legal right is violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">My colleagues state, \"Respondent\u2019s contention presupposes a blanket immunity from cross-examination\u201d. But it is their opinion that proceeds on a presupposition: that there are necessarily non-incriminating matters in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">It is generally agreed that to invoke the privilege a witness must face a \"real and appreciable\u201d danger of incrimination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While the court decides whether the privilege is properly invoked, it is the state of mind of the witness which determines whether the danger is \"real\u201d or \"imaginary\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\"When a question is propounded, it belongs to the court to consider and to decide whether any direct answer to it can implicate the witness. If this be decided in the negative, then he may answer it without violating the privilege which is secured to him by law. If a direct answer to it may criminate himself, then he must be the sole judge what his answer would be. The court cannot participate with him in this judgment, because they cannot decide on the effect of his answer without knowing what it would be; and a disclosure of that fact to the judges would strip him of the privilege which the law allows, and which he claims. It follows necessarily then, from this statement of things, that if the question be of such a description that an answer to it may or may not criminate the witness, according to the purport of that answer, it must rest with himself, who alone can tell what it would be, to answer the question or not. If, in such a case, he say upon his oath that his answer would criminate himself, the court can demand no other testimony of the fact.\u201d <em>United States v Burr, </em>25 F Cas 38 (1807) (per Marshall, Circuit Justice, for the Court).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In this case, the formal complaint lodged one charge against Baun: upon revocation and termination of his appointment as a county public administrator he \"was short in his accounts and failed to pay over to the successor fiduciary\u201d funds belonging to a number of different estates. Baun could have been charged with embezzlement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There was a \"real and appreciable\u201d danger that by his answers he might incriminate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The possibility that an attorney facing disciplinary proceedings may be subject to criminal prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>cution is not unique in this case. A large proportion of the disciplinary charges brought by the Grievance Board concern allegations of fact which could form the basis of criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In a number of cases lawyers have been charged with commingling funds and, accordingly, might have been charged with embezzlement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Perhaps the most common charge, taking money and not completing work on time, might in particular circumstances support a charge of false pretenses or false representation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The privilege against self-incrimination \"registers an important advance in the development of our liberty \u2014 'one of the great landmarks in man\u2019s struggle to make himself civilized\u2019 \u201d. <em>Ullmann v United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The issues raised in this case can be resolved without erosion of the right to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The hearing panel did not err in ruling that Baun was under no obligation to take the stand or answer any questions.
