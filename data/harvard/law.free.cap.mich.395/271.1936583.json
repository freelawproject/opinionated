We hold that the claim accrues when and where injury and damage are suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">Claiming that their injuries in an automobile accident were caused by the blowout of a defective tire, the plaintiffs, the owner-driver and her pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>senger, commenced an action against the defendant, manufacturer of the tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In Ohio, where the accident occurred, an action for bodily injury \"shall be brought within 2 years\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In Michigan, where this action was commenced, actions to recover damages for injuries to persons or property must be brought within three years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This action was commenced more than two but less than three years after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The Michigan borrowing statute, the Uniform Statute of Limitations on Foreign Claims Act, provides: \"The period of limitation applicable to a <em>claim accruing outside of this state </em>shall be either that prescribed by the law of the place where the claim accrued or by the law of this state, whichever bars the claim.\u201d MCLA 600.5861(2); MSA 27A.5861(2). (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The trial court granted the defendant an accelerated judgment based on Ohio\u2019s statute of limitations. The Court of Appeals agreed that the Ohio statute barred plaintiffs\u2019 negligence counts but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>held that the warranty counts could be maintained. Because the tire was sold in Michigan, the \"causes of action for breach of warranty\u201d accrued in Michigan and the borrowing statute did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The Court of Appeals relied on \u00a7 2-725(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> providing that an action \"for breach of any contract for sale\u201d must be brought within four years and that a breach of warranty occurs \"regardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach * * * <em>when tender of delivery is made\u201d. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim that the tire was purchased in late 1968. This action was commenced March 10, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the accelerated judgment. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not accrue until the blowout, resulting accident and injury \"outside of this state\u201d. Michigan\u2019s borrowing statute, thus, applies, and Ohio\u2019s shorter limitation governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">At common law, the limitational periods of the forum generally controlled the time for commencing an action, whether the claim arose within or outside the forum.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Most states have enacted \"borrowing statutes\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to resolve the possible conflicts of laws that may arise when a plaintiffs claim accrues outside of the forum. Borrowing statutes, including Michigan\u2019s, typically confine a plaintiff whose claim accrues outside the forum to the limitational period \u2014 of the forum or the state where the claim accrued \u2014 allowing the least time to commence the action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The issue presented is one of statutory construction \u2014 specifically, the meaning to be ascribed to the words \"claim accruing outside of this state\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We are persuaded that the Legislature did not intend to allow plaintiffs, inhibited by the borrowing statute from shopping for a forum with a favorable limitational period, to accomplish the same purpose by elaborating a legal theory; it was not intended that the time for commencement of a product-liability action against a manufacturer depend on whether plaintiffs theory of liability is grounded in tort or contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The provisions of UCC \u00a7 2-725 (a warranty is breached upon tender of delivery), while entirely satisfactory in a commercial setting, are inconsistent with principles developed by the courts in consumer actions against manufacturers for personal injury. While most business losses attributable to a defective product will surface during the four-year period prescribed by \u00a7 2-725, consumers often suffer personal injury after a longer period of time has elapsed. Adopting time of delivery, without regard to time of discovery, as the point of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>departure for statute of limitations purposes frequently will produce unsatisfactory results in personal injury cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Section 2-725 concerns, if not only, primarily claims based on an <em>agreement </em>of the parties to the litigation \u2014 including actions based on warranties implied from or in respect of their agreement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The product liability of a manufacturer, not in direct dealing with the consumer,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has, in contrast, been imposed by the courts with little or no regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>to whether there is an agreement between the parties and in the face of attempts by some manufacturers to disclaim liability in recitals accompanying the product into the market place.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">While some of the concepts <em>(e.g., </em>implied warranty) developed by the courts in creating the consumer\u2019s right of direct action against the manufacturer have been enacted into statute, the UCC draftsmen have acknowledged that the consumer\u2019s remedy is not statutory, but essentially a judicial development which the courts should be free to develop further.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The UCC did not create a new and separate consumer\u2019s product liability claim against the manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">This Court has consistently held that the three-year limitational period applicable to \"all other actions to recover damages for injuries to persons and property\u201d applies without regard to whether the claim sounds in tort or contract, express or implied.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">To hold that the consumer\u2019s claim against a manufacturer for personal injury \"accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach\u201d (UCC \u00a7 2-725) would be inconsistent with</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u2014the general rule of law that a claim for personal injury does not accrue for statute of limitations purposes until all elements of the claim, including the element of damage, are present;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">\u2014recent holdings of this Court in consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>actions against suppliers of services, that the statute of limitations does not begin to run before the plaintiff discovers or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered his loss;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u2014the goal of a unified product liability cause of action, disentangled from allegiance to warranty or tort concepts, whether the question presented is \"procedural\u201d or \"substantive\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (a consumer has only one product liability \"claim\u201d against a manufacturer [wherever it arises], however many counts and legal theories <em>[e.g., </em>negligence, warranty, strict liability] he may advance in support of that one claim);</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u2014RJA \u00a7 5833: \"In actions for damages based on breach of a warranty of quality or fitness the claim accrues at the time the breach of the warranty is discovered or reasonably should be discovered.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The Court of Appeals sought to reconcile the conflict between its conclusion that \u00a7 2-725 determines <em>where </em>a claim for implied warranty accrues and the \"long standing policy in Michigan that the statute of limitations should not expire before damage has been suffered\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by reading RJA \u00a7 5833 (\"the claim accrues\u201d in actions for breach of warranty of quality or fitness when the breach is discovered or reasonably should have been) as tolling, until damage is suffered, the running of the statute against the claim which, under the Court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 2-725, accrues upon tender of delivery.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">We find that analysis strained, unpersuasive and inconsistent with the purpose of \u00a72-725 to commence the running of the four-year limitational period, applicable to UCC contract of sale actions, <em>instanter </em>upon tender of delivery. RJA \u00a7 5833 is not a tolling statute; in terms it establishes, as does \u00a7 2-725,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> when a \"claim accrues\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">We have considered the so-called \"interest anal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ysis\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and whether Michigan, the state where the tire was purchased, has a special interest justifying the conclusion that plaintiffs\u2019 claims \"arose\u201d in this state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\"The state [of purchase] has a concern for the control of its own commercial climate: for protecting those who come to purchase, and for exacting assurances of safety from those who do business in its markets.\u201d Note, <em>Products Liability and the Choice of Law, </em>78 Harv L Rev 1452, 1464 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Analogous reasoning would emphasize the state\u2019s interest in protecting its. residents against short statutes of limitations of infortuitous places where breach, injury or damage is suffered. But the Legislature could have both barred nonresidents from coming into this state in search of a longer statute of limitations and allowed Michigan residents (who generally are not forum shopping) the benefit of Michigan\u2019s frequently longer limitational period by exempting, as many states have, its own residents from the restrictions of its borrowing statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The Legislature, however, on the recommendation of the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, has chosen an undifferentiating course barring Michigan residents, as well as nonresidents, from maintaining actions in Michigan courts that accrue in another state and which are time-barred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that state.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This suggests that there is no legislative policy of special concern for Michigan residents overriding the considerations which prompted the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws to make residence irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The tendency of Michigan\u2019s borrowing statute is to bar residents of Michigan and nonresidents alike, who suffer personal injury outside this state, howsoever caused, from maintaining an action in Michigan unless commenced not later than the time allowed by the state of injury. We are not persuaded to carve out an exception for product liability plaintiffs who are able to trace their injuries to a sale of the defendant manufacturer\u2019s goods in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We conclude that the product liability claim of a consumer for personal injury against a manufacturer, whether postulated on theories of tort or contract or an amalgam of both, does not accrue for purposes of the borrowing statute until all elements of the cause of action are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<judges id=\"b396-8\">T.

This question was not addressed by the trial court nor was it briefed by the parties in their arguments before this Court. The instant proceeding should be remanded to the trial court for resolution of this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>I \u2014 Breach op Warranty \u2014 One Theory or Two?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The evolution of the law towards recognition of the manufacturer\u2019s liability in favor of a consumer for injuries suffered as a result of a defective product attributable to that manufacturer has been a long process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, after this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Piercefield v Remington Arms Co, </em>375 Mich 85; 133 NW2d 129 (1965), there can be little doubt that such a liability against the manufacturer of defective products is recognized in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In the development of this area of the law, the judicially developed theory of liability based upon the concept of \"warranty\u201d has served as a cornerstone. The initial question we must answer is whether the warranty protection afforded by the UCC is separate and distinct from this judicially developed theory of warranty. We answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>A. Breach of Warranty Under the UCC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The UCC was enacted by the Legislature, <em>inter alia, </em>\"to simplify, clarify and modernize the law governing commercial transactions\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is designed to delineate the rights and liabilities of the various parties involved in a sale of \"goods\u201d. The UCC provides for seller liability based upon implied warranties of merchantability<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and fitness for a particular purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>With either of these two warranties the plaintiff must prove particular facts before he can recover against the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition the code provides a number of defenses which a defendant may invoke to avoid liability. Under the code \"the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>notify the seller of breach\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the buyer fails to provide this notice he will be barred from any recovery. The seller may disclaim the implied w\u00e1rranties<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and in some instances modify or limit the buyer\u2019s remedies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Finally, with UCC warranty actions, the requirement of privity is still applicable to some extent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Thus, while the warranties under the code afford the consumer a measure of protection against defective goods, this protection is subject to certain limitations. As will be seen below, the scope of coverage under the UCC is not as great as that under the judicially created cause of action for breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>B. Breach of Warranty at Common Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The judicially developed \"warranty\u201d liability<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>against manufacturers of defective goods, unlike the legislatively created warranties in the UCC, is not based solely upon contract principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In <em>Piercefield v Remington Arms Co, </em>375 Mich 85; 133 NW2d 129 (1965), this Court, utilizing the concept of \"warranty\u201d, recognized the manufacturer\u2019s [of a defective shotgun shell] liability to a plaintiff who was neither a purchaser nor user of the product. The Court held that this warranty theory was not based solely upon contract principles, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\" 'The duty of impliedly warranting the quality and fitness of the product has become a duty imposed by law. In effect, the warranty runs with the chattel. * * * the duty is not imposed by the terms of the contractual relationship ***.\u2019\u201d Quoting from Bushnell, <em>Practical Aspects of Defending Products Liability Cases, </em>11 Defense L J 99 (1962). <em>Supra, </em>100.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Quoting from <em>Picker X-Ray Corp v General Motors Corp, </em>185 A2d 919, 922 (Mun App DC, 1962), the Court in <em>Pierce\u00f1eld </em>went on to describe this judicially evolved theory of warranty in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\" 'There seems to be some confusion in understanding the nature of implied warranty liability. In the first place, concepts of negligence and fault, as defined by negligence standards, have no place in warranty recovery cases. Proof of negligence is unnecessary to liability for breach of implied warranty and the lack of it is <em>implied, </em>either in fact or in law, no express representations or agreements by the manufacturer are needed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Implied warranty recovery is based upon two factors: (a) The product or article in question has been transferred from the manufacturer\u2019s possession while in a \"defective\u201d state, more specifically, the product fails either to be \"reasonably fit for the particular purpose intended\u201d or of \"merchantable quality,\u201d as these two terms, separate but often overlapping, are defined by the law; and (b) as a result of being \"defective,\u201d the product causes personal injury or property damage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Supra, </em>96-97.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The Court in <em>Pierce\u00f1eld </em>also recognized that the judicially created breach of warranty was distinct from those warranties imposed by the statutory forerunner to the UCC, the uniform sales act (1948 CL 440.49).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is likewise true that this common-law warranty exists independent of the implied warranties contained in the Code. The warranty given birth by the courts extends protection well beyond that given by the code\u2019s warranties. Not only is the requirement of privity inapplicable<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but the manufacturer may not rely on the affirmative defenses of lack of notice, disclaimer of warranties, limitations of remedies as he can under the code.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When courts talk about warranty based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>on law, not the contractual agreements, and hold that a manufacturer may not avail himself of the defense provided by the code, it is quite evident that they are not talking about a warranty based upon the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Thus, it can be said that in Michigan there exist two separate and distinct theories of warranty liability \u2014 one judicially developed and the other enacted by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">II \u2014 \u00a7 2-725 Statute of Limitations Controls in Warranty Actions Brought Under the Code</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Where plaintiff seeks to impose liability upon a defendant for personal injuries suffered and does not base his claim upon the UCC, there is no question but that the three-years-from-date-of-injury period of limitation would apply.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, where a plaintiff may properly rely upon the UCC and chooses to base his claim upon the code, the statute of limitation contained in the code governs.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">There is no question that the code authorized recovery for breach of warranty includes damages for personal injuries. Section 2-715 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>\" * * * Consequential damages resulting from the seller\u2019s breach include * * * injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The four-year-from-date-of-tender-of-delivery statute of limitation contained in \u00a7 2-725 was meant to govern in actions brought under the code. Since the code contemplates that breach of warranty actions may be brought under the code for personal injuries, it follows that in personal injuries action maintained under the UCC, the code\u2019s statute of limitation, and not as Justice Levin suggests the three-year general statute of limitations, should govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions have recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">\"that where an action is correctly brought within the framework of the Uniform Commercial Code, the applicable statute of limitations is that provided by the code, although the damages sought are for personal injuries.\u201d <em>Sinka v Northern Commercial Co, </em>491 P2d 116, 118 (Alas, 1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">See also <em>Kelly v Ford Motor Co, </em>110 RI 83; 290 A2d 607, 609 (1972); <em>Redf\u00edeld v Mead, Johnson &amp; Co, </em>266 Or 273; 512 P2d 776, 777 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">My brother, Justice Levin, argues that the four-year-from-date-of-delivery period prescribed by \u00a7 2-725 is entirely satisfactory in commercial settings but is \"inconsistent with principles developed * * * for personal injury\u201d. <em>Parish v B F Goodrich Co, ante, </em>395 Mich 271, 278; 235 NW2d 570 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">While it is true that in most situations the three-years-from-date-of-injury statute of limitations will provide the consumer the greater protection, there will be cases in which the suit will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>brought by the consumer more than three years after injury but less than four years after tender of delivery. In these cases the consumer would be better protected by reliance upon the \u00a7 2-725 statute of limitations. Justice Levin makes a forceful argument for a uniform products liability cause of action based upon the three-year-personal-injury statute of limitations. However, in our zeal for such a uniform cause of action we cannot ignore a distinct cause of action created by the Legislature. The code gives a plaintiff an alternate cause of action with a different statute of limitations. Where a plaintiff may benefit from the four-year period and he may properly bring an action under the UCC, he should not be precluded from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Ill \u2014 Applicability of \u00a7 2-725 to the Instant Case</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The complaint of the plaintiffs consisted of one count of negligence and one count of breach of warranties. The latter was framed in the language of the code.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">With regard to the negligence count we concur with Justice Levin\u2019s treatment of the applicability of Michigan\u2019s borrowing statute, MCLA 600.5861(2); MSA 27A.5861(2). However, concerning the other count, if the plaintiffs are in a position to maintain a warranty action under the UCC, the borrowing statute would be inapplicable. This is because a breach of warranty action under the UCC accrues where and when the tender of delivery is made. Tender of delivery of the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>legedly defective tire was made in Michigan so the cause of action under the code accrued in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The important question whether the plaintiffs on the facts may properly bring an action under the Uniform Commercial Code remains to be answered. It will be recalled that protection under the UCC warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose is not as broad in scope as that of the judicially developed concept of warranty.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The availability of the UCC warranties to the plaintiffs was not resolved by the trial court nor was the question briefed by the parties in their arguments before this Court.

The theories have, of course, been those of implied warranty and strict liability in tort. Often, appellate courts have approved and authorized charges on both theories. Indeed a charge to the jury in a product liability case is often a conglomerate of three theories \u2014 negligence, implied warranty and strict liability in tort. Such charges are often unintelligible even to a sophisticated lawyer unless he has specialized on this subject, and certainly they are so to a lay jury. Our supreme courts should arrive at a theory of recovery to the exclusion of all others. Trial judges cannot under the present state of the law be criticized for being unable to submit a product liability case to a jury in a satisfactory manner. This situation emphasizes the fact that lack of efficiency in the administration of justice is often due to the complexities and ambiguities of the substantive law rather than to either court organization or court procedures. The fact that litigants, especially plaintiffs, want as a matter of tactics to employ all three theories is not at all decisive.\u201d (Emphasis by author.)
