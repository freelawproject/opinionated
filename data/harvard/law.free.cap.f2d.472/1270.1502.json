AR 64-2 et al., E, Texas Gulf Coast Area Rate Proceeding. It is unquestioned that the first petition to review was filed in this court by the Public Service Commission of New York, No. 71-1828, and that this court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-21\">A motion to transfer the review proceedings to the Fifth Circuit has been filed by Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., and other producers, who filed petitions to review in that circuit which have been transferred to this court. They have apparently been joined by producers who have not filed a separate petition to review but have filed petitions for leave to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-22\">The theory underlying the motion is that the Commission\u2019s opinions and orders under review in the instant proceedings \u201care in many material decisional respects related to its findings and conclusions\u201d in other proceedings which either have been reviewed in the Fifth Circuit or are slated for review there,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and raise \u201ccommon questions of law, closely related questions of fact, and attempts to comply with the specific crite<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>ria set forth\u201d by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Austral, </em>see note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">Movants say, <em>inter alia, </em>that the cases should be transferred to the Fifth Circuit \u201cwhere the Judges are familiar with the myriad complex issues involved\u201d and add that the members of the panel which decided <em>Austral </em>remain on the court and are presumably available for assignment to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">We think denial of the motion is in furtherance of the statutory scheme that appeal responsibility be determined by the filing of the first petition to review. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">That statutory command is subject to certain limited exceptions, none of which is applicable here,\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">(1) For a case where the first petition to review is filed by a party who is not substantially aggrieved, in effect undercutting the assumption of a good faith petition to review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-12\">(2) For a case of virtually instantaneous filings in two or more circuits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-13\">(8) For a case where the same or inter-related proceeding was previously under review in a court of appeals, and is now brought for review of an order entered after remand, or in a follow-on phase, where continuance of the same appellate tribunal is necessary \u201cto maintain continuity in the total proceeding.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The need for this doctrine is underscored by the consideration that an appellate court may retain exclusive jurisdiction, by remanding the record rather than the case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and it is inappropriate that jurisdiction for unified review depend on such particularities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-14\">This motion goes beyond these limited exceptions and implicitly invokes a theory of specialization of tribunals. That is not what Congress has provided. The contention based on specialization of particular judges is even more debatable. The Judicial Council for this cir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>euit, at least, has adopted a system of selection of judges by lot that eschews any concept of specialized appellate judges, and contemplates broadening of judicial exposure in meeting common problems.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It provides for retention of the same panel that handled an earlier appeal in the same case, i. e., a situation like that identified in (3), but not for reference to a panel that handled a different ease on the basis of similarity of underlying questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">In <em>Municipal Distributors Group, </em>cited <em>supra </em>note 2, ordering transfer to the Fifth Circuit of the petition to review the FPC order in Southern Louisiana II, we noted that the Fifth Circuit had already considered Southern Louisiana I (see note 1). We need not consider whether that was, strictly, a different phase of the same or inter-related proceeding. The pleadings represented to this court that the petition to review had been time-stamped two seconds earlier in the Fifth Circuit. We declined to consider whether the principle of the exception identified in (1) might be applicable, since even if the matter were doubtful, or indeterminable, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s earlier exposure in Southern Louisiana I reenforced review in that circuit of the later proceeding which involved, <em>inter alia, </em>the FPC\u2019s authority to reconsider retrospectively certain determinations made in Southern Louisiana I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">Assignment to the Fifth Circuit may not be predicated on a conception that the case is solely one of local concern. The entire Nation is interested in natural gas rates, though for other purposes it may be convenient to refer to certain states as primarily producing areas, and others as consuming areas. Such issues, of national concern, have arisen \u2014 and may arise again \u2014 in a number of circuits, including the Third, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth, as well as our own. While uniformity of approach is important, in the last analysis it is provided under our system by the Supreme Court. An additional focus at the intermediate level on an issue of national consequence \u201cis not necessarily an evil but may, on the contrary, serve like a stereopticon to enhance depth perception.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZhR\">Motion denied,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1331-14\">. <em>See </em>Southern Louisiana Area Rate Proceeding, FPC Docket AR 61-2, reviewed in Southern Louisiana Area Rate Cases, Austral Oil Co. et al. v.
