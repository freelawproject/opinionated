To ameliorate this situation a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>regulation was issued on January 26, 1968, designating a new type of whisky defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-5\">\u201cLight Whisky\u201d is whisky produced in the United States at more than 160\u00b0 proof, on or after January 26, 1968, and stored in used or uncharred new oak containers ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">27 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.22(b) (3) (1972). The effective date of this new regulation was July 1, 1972,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whereupon, whisky distilled since January 26, 1968, and stored in reused cooperage, could be marketed with the light whisky label and the statement of age, \u201c-- years old,\u201d without reference to storage in reused cooperage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">On December 14, 1971, Continental Distilling Corporation, appellee, applied for approval of a label designating whis-ky produced prior to January 26, 1968, as \u201cLIGHT WHISKY\u201d with the age statement \u201c6 YEARS OLD,\u201d although such pre-1968 stock of whisky did not then qualify by definition as light whis-ky and would therefore have to be marketed merely as \u201cWhisky\u201d with or without the reused cooperage statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Continental\u2019s request was denied. The primary reason advanced by appellants for rejection of the label application was that the industry was to be on an equal competitive footing in using the new label, beginning July 1, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">Continental then initiated this litigation to overcome this restriction upon its use of the light whisky label. Agreeing with Continental\u2019s position, the District Court ordered as follows: 1. that the language \u201con or after January 26, 1968\u201d be deleted from the definition of light whisky contained in the two regulations [27 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5.22(b)(3) and 5.40 (a)(4)] above set forth; and 2. that appellants had invalidly denied the application of Continental for a Certificate of Label Approval for \u201cContinental\u2019s Light Whisky, 6 Years Old.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We cannot sustain the District Court\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-15\">Appellants had found that to permit Continental to market as light whisky, six years old, its pre-1968 stock would have enabled Continental to obtain a substantial competitive advantage with consumers, since there is a general market preference for longer-aged whisky. As to the accuracy of this conclusion we cannot disagree, particularly when we adhere to the division of responsibility between court and regulatory \u25a0 agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-16\">Continental contends, however, that appellants could not under their statutory authority consider competitive factors, that appellants are statutorily limited to considerations of consumer protection in the formulation of these labeling regulations. We turn to the statute. The Federal Alcohol Administration Act authorizes the issuance of such regulations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-17\">(1) as will prohibit deception of the consumer with respect to such products or the quantity thereof and as will prohibit, irrespective of falsity, such statements relating to age, manufacturing processes, analyses, guarantees, and scientific or irrelevant matters as the Secretary of the Treasury finds to be likely to mislead the consumer ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-18\">(2) as will provide the consumer with adequate information as to the identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>ty and quality of the products</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-4\">(4) as will prohibit statements on the label that are disparaging of a competitor\u2019s products or- are false, misleading, obscene, or indecent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-5\">(5) as will prevent deception of the consumer by use of a trade or brand name. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-7\">27 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-8\">There is no mention in subsection (e) of fair competition, except the prohibition of a label disparaging a competitor\u2019s products in subpart (4) above. But section 205, the mother section, is entitled \u201cUnfair competition and unlawful practices,\u201d and subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 205 do prohibit a variety of unfair competitive and unlawful practices. While none specifically refers to labeling, a special subject left to subsection (e), yet the fact that all these subsections are combined in one over-all section dealing in large part with \u201cUnfair competition,\u201d lends support to appellants\u2019 finding of a kinship between the provisions for fairness in competition with those for labeling to protect consumers from deception. All subsections of section 205 are inherently related. Moreover, a natural affinity exists between considerations of fair competition and consumer protection. Implementation of one often includes consideration of the other, and regulations for one often bear consequences for the other.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the Senate Report in discussing the part of the Federal Alcohol Administration Bill concerned with unfair practices arising from false labeling refers not only to \u201cconsumer protection\u201d but to \u201cpreventing unfair competition.\u201d S.Rep.No. 1215, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-13\">It is of course possible to construe the latter reference as intended to apply only to competition unfair to the consumer, rather than to competition within the industry, but we decline so to limit it. Neither legislative history, statutory language, administrative interpretation nor judicial decision decrees that we should do so. As to the latter, in Arrow Distilleries, Inc. v. Alexander, 109 F.2d 397, at 402 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 310 U.S. 646, 60 S.Ct. 1095, 84 L.Ed. 1412 (1940), the court stated that in general the authority granted by section 205(e) \u201cis limited to such regulatory action, with respect to labeling, as will protect consumers from false, misleading or inaccurate representations and protect competitors from unfair trade practices in the use of labels.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsequently, our decision in Continental Distilling Corp. v. Humphrey, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 104, 220 F.2d 367 (1954), was decided without reference to the effect of the label on competition, since the case was concerned only with consumer protection. Our second <em>Continental </em>case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>however, does have some bearing on the present problem. While the majority opinion does not refer in explicit terms to competition, nothing therein is inconsistent with the consideration of such a factor; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Edgerton seems clearly to have had the competitive problem in mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-4\">. I think, that there is arbitrary discrimination when a manufacturer of one kind of whisky is required, and manufacturers of other kinds of whisky are not required, to state the fact, equally true of both, that their respective products are aged in re-used cooperage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">101 U.S.App.D.C. at 213, 247 F.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">Furthermore, the motivation behind the new light whisky label, itself, was to place domestic whisky in a better competitive position with imported whisky, a concededly pertinent consideration of industry competition. While this reason would not itself justify imposing a competitive disadvantage upon one company not offset by overriding fairness to the industry as a whole, we do not find that Continental was entitled to the particular advantage it seeks. To permit it to market as light whisky, beginning July 1, 1972, six year old whisky aged in reused cooperage, stating its age without reference to reused cooperage, while the industry as a whole was in a position to market as light whisky only four year old whisky aged in reused cooperage, would require the court to overrule the judgment of appellants as to what was overridingly fair to the industry as a whole. We do not feel able to do that. Riddance of the reused cooperage reference could validly be inaugurated with the industry as a whole placed on an equal competitive basis. There was in our opinion no legal compulsion that appellants do otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-8\">We add that fair competition has a well-occupied place in our public policy represented by regulatory law, so much so that it has not been unusiial for the courts to sustain its consideration in industrial regulation even though the particular regulatory statute before the court does not explicitly mention it. Northern Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 220, 226-228, 399 F.2d 953, 959-961 (1968); Municipal Electric Ass\u2019n v. SEC, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 145, 149-150, 413 F.2d 1052, 1056-1057 (1969); cf. FTC v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., <em>supra, </em>405 U.S. at 239-244, 92 S.Ct. 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-10\">From what we have said it follows that not only could the appellants consider \u201cfair competition\u201d in its new labeling regulation, but that in doing so it did not act arbitrarily or unreasonably in denying approval of the inconsistent label sought by Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-11\">Finally, we have considered Continental\u2019s contention with respect to the difference in the treatment by appellants of \u201clight whisky\u201d from their treatment of \u201cgrain spirits,\u201d in initiating as to the latter a new standard of labeling, dropping the necessity of stating the spirits had been stored in reused cooperage. The validity of the grain spirits standard adopted by appellants is not before us for decision, and we base our holding with respect to \u201clight whisky\u201d on the considerations we have deemed pertinent as to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">. 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.40(a)(1) &amp; (4) (1972), which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-8\">(a) <em>Statements of age and percentage for whisky. </em>In the case of straight whisky bottled under section \u00a7 5233, Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 5233), and domestic or foreign whisky, whether or not mixed or blended, all of which is 4 years or more old, statements of age and percentage are optional.

For example, false or misleading advertising not <em>only is </em>prohibited for reasons of protecting the consumer, but also for reasons of insuring fair competition. <em>See, </em>FTG v.
