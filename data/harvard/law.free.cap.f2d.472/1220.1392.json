The district court dismissed the action as to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-21\">The dismissal of the City of Seattle is affirmed, as that municipal defendant is not a \u201cperson\u201d under the Civil Rights Act. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">With regard to the individual defendants, the district, court held that the Act did not apply to property rights and that therefore it lacked jurisdiction. Subsequent to that determination, the Supreme Court in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972), held that property rights as well as personal liberties are within the protection of the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">The district court dismissed the action relative to the individual defendants for the additional reason that the plaintiff had a state cause of action for common law conversion. The denial of federal jurisdiction upon that ground was rejected in Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-13\">The judgment with regard to the City of Seattle is affirmed. It is reversed with regard to the individual defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
