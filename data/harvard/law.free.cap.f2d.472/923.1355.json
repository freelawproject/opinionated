On review, the sentence was reduced to life imprisonment; he is now confined in the Federal Penitentiary at Marion, Illinois. After exhausting his military appeals, petitioner attacked the military judgment collaterally. He now appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus contending (1) that the military tribunal had no jurisdiction to try him for murder because his offense was not \u201cservice connected,\u201d <em>cf. </em>O\u2019Callahan v. Parker, 395 U.S. 258, 89 S.Ct. 1683, 23 L.Ed.2d 291; and (2) that his appointed counsel, who failed to raise his sole meritorious defense, was so ineffective that he did not receive a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-22\">The basic facts are not in dispute. On November 17, 1962, petitioner killed the proprietress of the Gasthaus Sonne in Ludwigsburg, Germany, by stabbing her with a knife. Petitioner was then a sergeant in the United States Army on active duty in the Federal Republic of Germany. At the time of the offense he was not performing any military assignment, was not on a military post, and was not in uniform. His victim was a German civilian who had no connection with the United States Army or any agency of the United States Government. Insofar as the jurisdictional issue is concerned, the only relevant dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>ference between petitioner\u2019s offense and the crime involved in O\u2019Callahan v. Parker, 395 U.S. 258, 89 S.Ct. 1683, 23 L.Ed.2d 291, is that it transgressed the laws of a foreign sovereign, whereas O\u2019Callahan\u2019s violated the law of an American Territory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\"><em>O\u2019Callahan </em>seems to hold that the power delegated to Congress by Article I, \u00a7 8, clause 14 of the Constitution to \u201cmakes Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\u201d does not encompass any power to authorize punishment of soldiers for misconduct which is not \u201cservice connected.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Logically, that holding would seem to apply here. The court construed the exemption from the Fifth Amendment for \u201ccases arising in the land or naval forces\u201d as though it were a limitation on the congressional rule-making power for the Armed Forces. It reasoned that a case does not arise in the Armed Forces merely by reason of the defendant\u2019s status as a soldier; the conduct itself must also be \u201cservice connected.\u201d Petitioner forcefully contends that his misconduct had no more connection to his duties as a serviceman than did O\u2019Callahan\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Respondent argues, however, that the <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>holding should not be followed here because its underlying rationale is inapplicable. The \u201cconstitutional stakes\u201d in <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>were the claimed right to indictment by a grand jury and trial by a petit jury in a civilian court. 395 U.S. at 296, 89 S.Ct. 1683.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those constitutional protections are not in any event available in case's involving the violation of foreign law; and, therefore, <em>O\u2019Callahan\u2019s </em>purpose to provide greater protection to members of the Armed Forces would not be served, and might well be defeated, if the holding were extended to such cases. Although respondent\u2019s argument is by no means compelling,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we think he fairly reads the <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>opinion as being limited to offenses \u201ccommitted within our territorial limits,\u201d and \u201cnot in the occupied zone of a foreign country.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>395 U.S. at 273-274, 89 S.Ct. at 1691.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, in Relford v. United States Disciplinary Commandant, the Supreme Court repeatedly stressed the fact that O\u2019Callahan\u2019s offense had been committed on \u201cAmerican Territory,\u201d see 401 U.S. at 356, 364, 365, 91 S.Ct. 649, and unanimously construed <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>as requiring an \u201cad hoc,\u201d rather than a logical, approach to the jurisdictional issue. See 401 U.S. at 365-366, 91 S.Ct. 649, We therefore hold that the fact that petitioner was present in Germany as a result of his status as a member of the United States Army provided a sufficient \u201cconnection\u201d between his offense and his service status to characterize his crime as \u201carising in the land or naval forces\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">Petitioner contends that the incompetence of his trial counsel is demonstrated by the failure to assert a defense of insanity or to offer any evidence in mitigation before the death sentence was imposed. The record discloses, however, that counsel did seriously investigate the insanity issue; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the extensive psychiatric evidence that he assembled in advance of trial persuasively indicates that such a defense would not have been successful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">It is true that two qualified civilian psychiatrists subsequently evaluated the medical history assembled by the army psychiatrists and expressed opinions indicating that petitioner was not legally sane at the time of the offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>opinions tend to prove that the defense would have been meritorious, but they do not establish trial counsel\u2019s incompetence. Even if those opinions had been in the trial record, it is not unlikely that the military tribunal would have attached greater weight to the consistent conclusions of the five army psychiatrists, three of whom personally examined petitioner, than to the two later opinions based only on the medical history.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-19\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>\u201cQuestion: Did the mental defect, disease or derangement that he had deprive him completely of the power of choice or volition so that he was unable, concerning the particular act charged, to adhere to the right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-21\">\u201cAnswer: Again concluding that the act took place during a temporary period of acute, irrational, violent behavior during which his will was overthrown and his thinking processes short-circuited, it is my opinion that, at the time of the offense, he was deprived completely of the power of choice over his behavior and he was therefore unable, concerning the particular act charged, to adhere to the right. Since I do feel his thinking processes and controls were completely overthrown at that time, I have no hesitation in saying that, at the time of the offense, he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">On the basis of the record then available, counsel\u2019s decision to use testimony of a psychiatrist in support of a claim that petitioner was incapable of premeditated murder, rather than insane in the legal sense, cannot fairly be criticized. We recognize, as petitioner argues, that an even more detailed investigation might have turned up additional evidence; but even taking into consideration the fact that a capital offense was involved, our review of the record persuades us that counsel\u2019s trial preparation was both diligent and professional.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The factors which actually motivated counsel\u2019s decision to offer no evidence in mitigation are not available to us. There was no affirmative evidence that this was the result of incompetence; indeed, counsel for respondent suggests several reasonable explanations for it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is sufficient for our purposes, however, simply to observe that, in light of defense counsel\u2019s ardent advocacy at earlier stages, it is reasonable to infer that silence at this point was a competent, tactical decision. The wisdom of any tactical decision cannot be judged simply by its actual consequences. In any event, petitioner was not harmed by that determination since the Board of Review reduced his sentence to the minimum allowable under the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that counsel\u2019s decision, which may or may not have been wise, establishes that petitioner\u2019s representation was constitutionally defective.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-9\">\u201cIn the last assignment of error, appellate defense counsel contend that the. accused was denied due process of law because, at trial, defense counsel failed to present any evidence, in mitigation and offered no argument against the death sentence. For three days, defense counsel represented the accused with competence and vigor. Time and again, he presented multiple objections to exhibits and testimony damaging to the accused. As the board of review observed, he waged \u2018a hard fought, hotly contested\u2019 case up to the findings. But, except for some incidental comments, defense counsel was unaccountably silent (luring the sentence proceedings. lie offered no evidence in mitigation ; and lie presented no argument as to tlie sentence, even though trial counsel demanded the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-15\">\u201cIn this unusual and ambiguous situation, the law officer should have had an out-of-court conference to determine, if possible, the reasons for defense counsel\u2019s silence at this critical time. The board of review considered several possible explanations, some militating against the accused. However, it resolved all doubts in the accused\u2019s favor. That decision was correct. It observed that by law the court-martial could adjudge only death or life imprisonment for premeditated murder. Article 118, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.O. \u00a7 918. It then reviewed \u2018all of the circumstances of the case\u2019 and concluded that only the lesser punishment should be affirmed. This action removed all risk of prejudice resulting from the alleged deficiency in defense counsel\u2019s representation of the accused in the sentence proceedings.\u201d United States v. Wimberley, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 3, 13 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Based on a review of the record as a whole, including the lawyer\u2019s experience, general qualifications, his preparation for trial, and his vigorous conduct of the trial itself, we conclude that petitioner did receive the effective assistance of counsel mandated by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b986-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-5\">. Except for the fourth item in Mr. Justice Blackmun\u2019s 12-point list, all of the controlling factors in <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>apply to petitioner. See Relford v. United States Disciplinary Commandant, 401 U.S. 355, 365, 91 S.Ct. 649, 28 L.Ed.2d 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b984-6\">. At page 272 of the 395 U.S., at page 1690 of the 89 S.Ct., the court concluded \u201cthat the crime to be under military jurisdiction must be service connected,\u201d and at page 274, 89 S.Ct. at page 1692 stated: \u201cWe have accordingly decided that since petitioner\u2019s crimes were not service connected, he could not be tried by court-martial but rather was entitled to trial by the civilian courts.\u201d See also United States ex rel. Flemings v. Chaffee, 458 F.2d 544, 549-550 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b984-7\">. \u201cClearly then, grand and petit jury protections were the core rights sought to be vouchsafed.\u201d Gosa v. Mayden, 450 F.2d 753, 756 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b984-8\">. The <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>holding seems to assume that a serviceman on trial for a civilian offense would perforce prefer trial by a local jury over trial before a military tribunal \u2014 that the danger of \u201ccommand influence\u201d is greater than the risk of adverse local prejudice against the visiting soldier. In contrast, respondent seems to assume that there is greater risk of unfair treatment before a foreign tribunal than in a military trial. Petitioner rejoins that murder is not a capital offense in Germany, but the court-martial imposed a death sentence. Logically, of course, these conflicting policy considerations should not determine the boundaries of the constitutional delegation of rule-making power to Congress. If, as <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>can be interpreted as holding, \u201cservice connection\u201d is a jurisdictional requirement which must be met to authorize military discipline, it is anomalous to assume that the Army has a lesser interest in punishing an assault against an Hawaiian than one against a German. Put somewhat differently, it seems anomalous to determine the scope of the power of Congress by the nature of the alternative civilian remedy which is available. Nevertheless, in view of the force of Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s dissent, the care with which the majority opinion narrowly limited the <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>holding, and the Court\u2019s own characterization of its approach as \u201cad hoc,\u201d we have concluded that the Supreme Court is not likely to extend <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>to its logical limit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b985-5\">.
