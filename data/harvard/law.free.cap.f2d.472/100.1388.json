Honorable Myron L. Gordon of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-7\">STEVENS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Four juveniles confined in the Illinois Industrial School for Boys at Sheridan, Illinois, filed petitions for habeas corpus alleging that they were entitled to be released because they have already received punishment greater than that authorized by law for adults guilty of offenses comparable to those which led to their respective delinquency findings. The district court denied the relief requested but ordered the respondent to transfer the four petitioners either to a home or to a different institution and to discontinue the use of the drug thora-zine, or any other tranquilizer, for purposes of mere control or punishment. Both sides have appealed. Petitioners seek complete release from custody; respondent, without challenging the propriety of the relief which was granted, seeks a new trial on the ground that the district judge was biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">In the district court, petitioners contended that they were denied equal protection of the laws by incarceration in an institution no different from an adult penitentiary for a longer period of time than they could have been incarcerated had they been convicted by the Illinois criminal courts. The district court found the facts in petitioners\u2019 favor and ordered respondent to provide them with the rehabilitative treatment authorized by the Illinois Juvenile Code;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he refused to order their release.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-16\"> A juvenile delinquent may be incarcerated until his twenty-first birthday, no matter how insignificant the misconduct that resulted in the jurisdictional finding of delinquency, provided that the requisite findings are made at his dispositional hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and provided further that he does not demonstrate that his best interests would be served by an earlier release.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, a juvenile\u2019s indeterminate sentence may be longer than the maximum period of imprisonment for an adult guilty of a like offense. This potential difference in treatment does not invalidate the statutory distinction between adults and juveniles because offsetting benefits general<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ly result in favored treatment for the youthful offender.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Since the character of petitioners\u2019 detention was tantamount to imprisonment in an adult penitentiary, they contend that they received no offsetting benefits which could arguably justify detention beyond that authorized for adults. Though not conclusive,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this argument is appealing; nevertheless, even if the argument is accepted for purposes of decision, it does not follow that the only permissible remedy is to treat petitioners as if they were adults. On the contrary, it was well within the district court\u2019s discretion merely to order respondent to provide them with the statutory benefits authorized for other members of the juvenile class. On the remedy issue the district court properly focused on the ultimate question of what relief would best serve the interests of these young men. Since we are satisfied that he did not abuse his discretion, we affirm the denial of petitioners\u2019 prayer for complete release without analyzing the validity of their equal protection claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Although respondent prevailed on the principal issue litigated in the district court, and does not object to the relief granted against him, he urges us to order a new trial because the district judge was guilty of flagrant misconduct. The argument is in two parts: First, that a statement at a preliminary hearing evidenced prejudgment and required the judge to recuse himself; and second, that several incidents during the course of the trial revealed such bias and hostility on the part of the judge as to deprive respondent of a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">Since the propriety of the relief which was granted is not questioned no useful purpose would be served by another trial. We have concluded, however, that the record discloses such friction between the trial judge and counsel for respondent that if questions relating to compliance with the court\u2019s order should arise in the future, the interests of justice would be served by having such matters heard by another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">Respondent\u2019s motion to recuse was predicated on a statement made by the trial judge on Friday, October 15, 1971, in an informal opinion explaining his reasons for denying a motion to dismiss predicated on the assertion that state remedies had not been exhausted. Petitioners had invoked the state procedures, obtaining partial relief from the Juvenile Court in May, 1971, and had unsuccess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>fully sought expedited review in the Illinois appellate courts. When the trial judge learned that, notwithstanding petitioners\u2019 bona fide efforts to obtain it, the transcript \u00f3f the May hearing was not yet available, and was informally apprised of the risk that routine handling of the appeals in the overloaded Illinois courts might moot the issues before any relief could be granted, he understandably reacted unfavorably to the State\u2019s exhaustion argument. In the context of his impromptu remarks, he made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">\u201cIllinois is notorious in its Juvenile Court in- its history of mistreatment, legal mistreatment, under a guise of legal parentage, parenthood attitude, but the rights under the Constitution inure to the benefit of the newborn infant as much as they do to the most venerable citizen among us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">On the following Monday, before any evidence was heard, respondent filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 requesting the district judge to recuse himself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The motion was supported by an affidavit of one of the attorneys for respondent rather than the affidavit of a \u201cparty\u201d as required by the statute. The motion was, therefore, insufficient. Giebe v. Pence, 431 F.2d 942 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">If there is a substantial likelihood that a judge\u2019s conduct would prejudice the jury, a new trial must be directed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In a case tried without a jury, that danger of prejudice is absent; accordingly, the judge may properly play a more active and critical part in such a trial without impairing his ability to give the parties a fair hearing and to rule impartially after the record is complete. Nevertheless, the presiding judge must require the barristers and the litigants to observe and to respect the standards of decorum that are traditional attributes of a fair trial. By his own example, as well as by his rulings, the judge must confirm the objectivity and majesty of the judicial process. The integrity of the proceeding, not merely its ultimate outcome, must command the confidence of the community. The conduct of this trial fell short of the high standards that are required.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Respondent\u2019s attack on the judge\u2019s conduct of the trial is three-pronged. He contends that the judge (1) prejudged the merits; (2) assumed the role of advocate; and (3) exhibited unprovoked hostility toward counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">Before commenting on each of these points, it is only fair to observe that certain conduct on the part of counsel for respondent could only be offensive to the sensibilities of the judge. We mention this fact to indicate that although some of the court\u2019s comments did not appear to have any immediate provocation, respondent\u2019s counsel are not completely innocent victims of judicial intemperance.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">After denying the State\u2019s motion to dismiss on Friday, October 15, the court ordered respondent\u2019s counsel to produce the four petitioners at the evidentiary hearing commencing at 10:00 o\u2019clock A. M. on the following Monday. Counsel did not comply with that order, but instead presented the motion to recuse which we have held insufficient. They sought to justify what the district court correctly described as contemptuous conduct on the ground that they had been confident that their motion to recuse would be granted. We share the trial judge\u2019s -unfavorable reaction to a lawyer\u2019s prejudgment of the merits of his own motion. Although some of the court\u2019s remarks were inappropriate, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>were less severe than the punishment he had the power to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">As the ease progressed, counsel for respondent properly objected to inadmissible evidence and urged the court to adhere to normal adversary procedures in the quest for the truth. But on occasion, as sometimes happens in the heat of advocacy, counsel\u2019s conduct impliedly demeaned the seriousness of petitioners\u2019 claims. The judge, sensitive to the plight of the young men who had repeatedly been injected with thorazine and incarcerated in solitary confinement for long periods of time, reacted unfavorably to the implications that this was just another ordinary lawsuit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, there is merit in portions of respondent\u2019s criticism of the conduct of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Respondent\u2019s claim that the trial judge prejudged the merits is belied by a reading of the record as a whole including the court\u2019s final ruling. There is no indication that respondent was unable to present his case. Moreover, the record does not support the conclusion that the trial judge had closed his mind to the presentation of evidence or argument. It is true that some of his comments were unfortunate. He had obviously read widely in the professional literature relating to the use of thorazine, to the problem of the youthful offender, and to correctional philosophy. But a judge should not be criticized for making an impartial study of relevant scholarship or for candidly advising counsel of the results of such research. Therefore, although we agree that some of the trial judge\u2019s observations relating to the merits tended to impede the orderly development of the case and were even inappropriate,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we categorically reject the prejudgment contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The charge that the judge occasionally assumed the role of an advocate has more substance. He invited counsel for petitioners to expand the theory of their case to assert claims on behalf of the entire class of inmates at Sheridan.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At times the court interjected unfavorable comment on the testimony as it developed,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> took over the examination of witnesses, or, after petitioners\u2019 counsel had concluded his examination, urged him to continue to dig for additional evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In' response to petitioners\u2019 suggestion that the court visit Sheridan to view the physical plant, a suggestion which respondent did not oppose, the court, on his own initiative, suggested that evidentiary hearings be held at the institution. A legitimate objection to such hearings prompted intemperate remarks by the court suggesting that the State\u2019s unfavorable reaction to the proposal might necessitate the use of military force to overcome anticipated resistance to his visit to Sheridan.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>There is also substance to respondent\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s manifestation of hostility against counsel. Although he subsequently apologized, the judge made certain deprecatory comments about counsel that have no place in the trial of a lawsuit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-D\">Instead of ruling promptly and decisively on objections, on occasion his discursive comments provoked digressions which became unnecessarily hostile.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He quite plainly resented counsel\u2019s objections to his own examination of certain witnesses, although it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>perfectly clear that a lawyer has the same right and duty to object to questions propounded by a judge as to those propounded by opposing counsel.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>It is impossible to capture the full flavor of a trial from the record on appeal. Nevertheless, the excerpts set forth in the margin are sufficient to explain why we conclude that if any further proceedings shall be necessary in this case, they should be conducted by a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-20\">Two of the appellants in this case are among the plaintiffs representing the entire class of inmates at Sheridan in litigation pending before Judge Bauer.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> They have joined in an application for an extraordinary writ<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to require expedition of those proceedings which were temporarily stayed to await a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>by the Illinois Supreme Court in litigation in which apparently some of the same parties raised issues which partially overlap the issues in these two federal cases. It would appear that under the district court\u2019s procedures for the processing of related cases, the reassignment of this case should therefore be to Judge Bauer, particularly since there appears to be no valid reason for further delay in the commencement of such hearings as may be necessary in the class action. The order of the district court is affirmed; further proceedings, if any, shall be conducted by Judge Bauer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-10\">. \u201cThe purpose of this Act is to secure for each minor subject hereto such care and guidance, preferably in his own home, as will serve the moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the minor and the best interests of the community; to preserve and strengthen the minor\u2019s family ties whenever possible, removing him from the custody of his parents only when his welfare or safety or the protection of the public cannot be adequately safeguarded without removal; and, when the minor is removed from his own family, to secure for him custody, care and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should be given by his parents, and in cases where it should and can properly be done to place the minor in a family home so that he may become a member of the family by legal adoption or otherwise.\u201d Ill.Rev.Stat.

United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 123, 306 F.2d 283, 285 (1962) ; In re Herrara, 23 Cal. 2d 206, 143 P.2d 345 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\">. Petitioners have received certain benefits which are denied to the adult offender. Thus, they have no criminal record ; they have not been incarcerated with hardened adult offenders; and they had a continuous opportunity to seek an early release. Moreover, their evidence does not include the matter developed at their respective dispositional hearings, and therefore any comparison between them and their hypothetical adult counterparts is necessarily incomplete.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b163-10\">. Nor would the other constitutional claims advanced here, though not argued below, entitle petitioners to their release. The evidence concerning the use of thorazine and prolonged solitary confinement convinced the trial court that petitioners were entitled to relief under the Eighth Amendment. The court found, however, that reforms liad alleviated conditions at Sheridan ; his order to discontinue the use of thorazine, to transfer petitioners to .another institution, and to require that their future treatment accord with the humane purposes of the statute represented appropriate relief for the violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. Past violations of those rights do not necessarily entitle them to unconditional release. And since petitioners have not challenged the statutory procedure, the adequacy of the findings at their respective dispositional hearings, or the State\u2019s jurisdiction to deprive a juvenile delinquent of his liberty until he reaches the age of twenty-one, their due process argument is without force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">. In addition to the comment quoted in the text, the motion also asserted that the judge\u2019s statement that it takes two years to prosecute an appeal in the courts of Illinois evidenced prejudice against respondent. The State, understandably, does not press that point here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b164-16\">. See United States v.

Early in the trial, one of the lawyers indicated that he had no need for a daily transcript, even though he had not been present at earlier sessions; in colloquy a few days later, he supported an argument by quotation from the transcript. On another occasion he conditioned his voluntary production of a document on withdrawal of his adversary\u2019s expression of surprise at his apparently unusual willingness to produce anything without formal process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">.

It is just the sound of your voice is irritating \u2014 (continuing) \u2014 to let him have his way and get this over with.\u201d Tr. 386-387.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYq\">Later in the same session:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-16\">\u201cMR.

ZAGEL: Your Honor, I object to this question you have just asked, and I would ask that the last answer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the witness be stricken. It refers to a conversation of a witness who is not subject to cross examination. It is not \u2014-it is obviously offered for its truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: This witness is subject to cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">\u201cMR. ZAGEL: Yes, but the person whose accusations are being made in court is not subject to cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u201cMR. ZAGEL: Because Mr. Daniels \u2014is that his name? \u2014 is not here in court, and it is the statements of Mr. Daniels this witness is relating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you can subpoena him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">\u25a0 \u201cMR.

ZAGEL: I do not wish to call Mr. Daniels. I wish to cross examine Mr. Daniels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: You may call him in, and if he is a hostile witness I will certainly allow you to cross examine him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-17\">\u201cMR.

FRIEDMAN: The question is only one of fair trial, your Honor. These statements of the witness which are asserted for the truth of the proposition, which are being heard for the truth of the proposition stated therein, herein now are not subject to cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-20\">\u201cThat is the classic definition, if the Court please, of hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: You two gentlemen from the Attorney General\u2019s office may not realize it, but I admire you, I admire you, and I think that your client has excellent attorneys. You are doing a good job for your client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-22\">\u201cA petition for a writ of habeas corpus addresses itself somewhat to the traditional equity jurisdiction of the Court, which is very broad very, very broad, and is not to be \u2014 because we don\u2019t have a jury, we are really in chancery, historically. It addresses itself to an attempt on the part of the Court to get from all of the parties and from whatever sources the Court may determine to get from, the facts that underlie the petition that is presented before me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-23\">\u201cNow, I don\u2019t believe that personally you two fine lawyers would want to withhold from me anything, but you are doing so magnificent a job that were it not for the fact that I refuse to be in any way charged with being biased or predisposed in the matter, I could not but conclude that somewhere along the way somebody is saying, \u2018Don\u2019t let that Judge know anything more than just the bare little bit of facts about this. Keep him out of this. Keep everything out of his ears. Don\u2019t let there be an expose out of this case. Keep it as tight as you possibly can. Raise every kind of objection. Object to him. Object to his questions. Object to everybody else\u2019s questions. Just don\u2019t let anything get in.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-25\">\u201cWell, I am just going to let it in. I want to know about it. I can\u2019t be fair to both sides, and that includes the respondent, unless I am given a full panoramic view of this whole thing, and I cannot afford to be restrained by technical restrictions that would apply to personal injury cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-26\">\u201cMR. ZAGEL: Your Honor, in response\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-28\">\u201cTHE COURT: A motion that I disqualify myself. I know what it is. Motion denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-29\">\u201cMR. ZAGEL: In response to your Honor\u2019s statement, I would point out that your Honor has made several serious errors of law. The first is that a writ of habeas corpus is not a writ in equity, it is a writ in law\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-31\">\u201cTHE COURT: I did not say it was a writ in equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-32\">\u201cMR. ZAGEL: The procedure under a writ of habeas corpus is a procedure in law. The rules of evidence I have rarely heard referred to as a mild technicality which can be brushed aside by a Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-33\">\u201cThe right that you are denying, the right that the rule of evidence in question here is designed to protect, is considered one of the most sacred in American law. It is the right of cross examination. You are denying that right to the respondents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-34\">\u201cFurthermore, your Honor \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-35\">\u201cTHE COURT: Cross examination of this witness?

It is the first time that I have ever been in a court of law in which a Court has regarded the making of objections as in any way an attempt to obscure the issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-15\">\u201cIt is Hornbook law that objections are not to be construed in that light.
