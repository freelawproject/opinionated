Consequently, we remand to the District Court so that an appropriate factual inquiry will be made as to whether the juror at the time he sat was able to read, write and understand the English language as required by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1861 (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>c the trial court finds in the affirmathe conviction stands affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court finds in the negative, n in the exercise of our supervisory wer, <em>see </em>Rabinowitz v.
