No showing is made that the rule is unreasonable or that defendant was prejudiced by it. Such a rule is authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1863(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-23\">We find the evidence of guilt was adequate. The refusal of the court to grant the motion for a mistrial was not error. The consecutive terms of imprisonment were proper. Cf. United States v. Bishop, 462 F.2d 127, 9 Cir. 1972.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
