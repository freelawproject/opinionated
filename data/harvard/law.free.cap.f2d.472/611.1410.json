The testimony was, for the most part, uncontradicted, and the jury was entitled to believe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">Appellants contend that the prosecutor made an improper comment on their failure to testify. The record reveals no such comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">Appellants also seek to fault many of the court\u2019s instructions. One such instruction correctly told the jury that no presumption of guilt may be raised and no inference of any kind may be drawn from the failure of a defendant to testify. Any semantic difference between \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d in the context of the standard instruction in such cases could not affect the outcome of a trial, and clearly had no adverse effect upon the appellants in this case. Counsel have expended commendable diligence in going over each of the instructions in a similar search for error, but have pointed to none that could have impaired the defense. The difficulty with the defense lay in the facts, not in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
