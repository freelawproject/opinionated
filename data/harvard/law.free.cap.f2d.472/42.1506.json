MacArthur is the principal owner of Colonnades, Inc., which owns and operates hotels in Palm Beach County, Florida. The center of the MacArthur hotel operation is the Colonnades Beach Hotel, fronting the Atlantic Ocean. Five smaller hotels are located nearby and are connected to the main hotel by colonnaded walkways. This hotel complex has 400 guest rooms, a large convention hall accommodating 500 people, a bowling and putting green, swimming pool, dining facilities, and three kitchens. MacArthur purchased the hotel in 1960 or 1961. At that time the hotel was much smaller, with only a little over 100 rooms. MacArthur was advised to tear down the original buildings and start over from scratch. He testified that he \u201cdecided they were wrong\u201d and \u201cproceeded to fix it up.\u201d Extensive construction projects were undertaken. Two major construction projects were the addition of 139 new rooms on top of the main building and the addition of several floors on top of the convention center. These additions were constructed by numerous independent contractors and subcontractors. Also, MacArthur was continually improving and changing the premises. The labor for this constant improvement program was performed by employees on the hotel\u2019s payroll. In the joint stipulation the parties agreed that Colonnades\u2019 construction employees performed the following tasks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">(a) Applied waterproof stucco to the exterior walls of hotel buildings,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">(b) Dug ditches and connected piping for a sprinkler system on the hotel lawn,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">(c) Erected forms and poured concrete in those forms to construct an addition to the seawall on the hotel\u2019s ocean-front,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">(d) Received construction materials from suppliers, moved those materials onto the hotel elevators, and unloaded those materials on upper floors of the hotel for use by employees of outside contractors,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-13\">(e) Erected forms and poured concrete to build sidewalks connecting various hotel buildings,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-14\">(f) Constructed outside steps to be used as fire escapes on hotel buildings,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-15\">(g) Constructed a penthouse apartment on top of the main hotel building, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-16\">(h) Cleaned up construction debris left by employees of various outside independent contractors who were engaged to build four additional floors on the main hotel building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-17\">During the period specified in the complaint (the period since April 7, 1967) the employees named were not paid overtime for workweeks in excess of forty hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">Both parties appeal from those findings not in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-19\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision as to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-20\">1. The denial of injunctive relief against John D. MacArthur personally, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-21\">2. The finding that Colonnades\u2019 construction employees were not subject to the exemption to the overtime provisions of the Act under Section 213(b) (8).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>We reverse the District Court\u2019s decision as to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">1. The refusal to allow the Secretary to amend his complaint to include additional employees of Colonnades and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">2. That Colonnades did not come within the definition of a construction enterprise within Section 203(s)(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\n<em>A. Injunctive Relief Against John D. MacArthur</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Section 203(d) defines \u201cemployer\u201d to include \u201cany person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The Secretary claimed that MacArthur</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">(1) participated in the day-to-day supervision of the activities giving rise to the violations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">(2) had the authority to hire and fire the employees in question; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-12\">(3) supervised the supervisors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The Secretary contends that \u201ccourts have repeatedly held that corporate officers who have a proprietary interest in their companies and who actively participate in their day-to-day affairs\u201d are proper party defendants under Section 217 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and can be enjoined from continuing to withhold unpaid wages due to affected employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">The District Court found that \u201can injunction directed to MacArthur personally would be inappropriate and unnecessary.\u201d It said \u201cthe evidence indicated that the management and operations of the hotel were regularly supervised by others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">\u201cEach case must be considered in light of the total situation or whole activity to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists.\u201d Wirtz v. Lone Star Steel Company, 5 Cir., 405 F.2d 668 at 669 and Wirtz v. Soft Drinks of Shreveport, Inc., 336 F.Supp. 950, 957 (W.D.La.1971). The total employment situation should be considered in regard to the acts MacArthur performed \u201cin the interest of the employer in relation to the employee,\u201d Shultz v. Chalk-Fitzgerald Construction Co., 309 F.Supp. 1255 at 1257 (D.C.1970). Also to be considered are the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d of the situation, Goldberg v. Whittaker House Cooperative, 366 U.S. 28, 33, 81 S.Ct. 933, 936, 6 L.Ed.2d 100 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-17\">We are not inclined to reverse the action of the District Court as to MacArthur personally. As to the corporation, the injunction should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-18\">B. <em>The Section 213(b)(8) Exemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-19\">Section 213(b)(8) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-20\">The provisions of Section 207 (overtime) shall not apply with respect to any employee employed by an establishment which is a hotel .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-21\">The District Court held as to the employees here involved that Colonnades was not within the exemption. It found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-22\">The Colonnades is not an unusual or atypical hotel from the standpoint of the services and facilities it provides for its guests. The hotel is unusual, however, in that a full-time crew is maintained for the principal purpose of building, remodeling, and rendering substantial alterations to the premises . (Colonnades claims) that the hotel\u2019s unusual policy of continuing renovation and change should not cause it to lose the exemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-23\">In the court\u2019s view the central flaw of this argument is the assumption that the \u2018unusual\u2019 policies of this particular hotel are immaterial to the exemption. The primary function of the construction crew had little if anything to do with the daily operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the hotel as a facility for the accommodation of guests. A hotel is essentially a service facility. The 13(b)(8) exemption contemplates that the duties of the establishment\u2019s employees will be reasonably related to and directed toward that end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">The literal interpretation and application of the exemption which the hotel urges runs contrary to the over-all purpose of the Act and the exemption itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The record amply supports this view. Whether employees are exempt from the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act involves a question of fact. Walling v. General Industries Co., 330 U.S. 545, 550, 67 S.Ct. 883, 885, 91 L.Ed. 1088 (1947) and Hodgson v. Klages Coal and Ice Co., 6 Cir. 1970, 435 F.2d 377, 382, cert. den. 402 U.S. 973, 91 S.Ct. 1660, 29 L.Ed.2d 137. Therefore, the findings of fact made by the District Court may not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Walling v. General Industries Co., supra at 550; Hodgson v. Klages Coal and Ice Co., supra at 382, and Wirtz v. Atlanta Life Ins. Co., 6 Cir., 1963, 311 F.2d 646, 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">An exemption from the coverage of the Act \u201cmust be narrowly construed.\u201d Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490, 493, 65 S.Ct. 807, 808, 89 L.Ed. 1095 (1945) and Mitchell v. Stenson, 1 Cir., 1954, 217 F.2d 210, 214. The exemptions must be applied only to those \u201cplainly and unmistakably within its terms and spirit.\u201d Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, supra at 493, 65 S.Ct. at 808. See also Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U.S. 388, 392, 80 S.Ct. 453, 456, 4 L.Ed. 2d 393 (1960). This strict construction of the exemption requires that it not be extended to another business merely because the principal business of the employer is exempted, Walling v. Connecticut Co., 62 F.Supp. 733, 735 (D.C.Conn. 1945), affirmed 2 Cir., 1946, 154 F.2d 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Therefore, we agree that Colonnades\u2019 construction employees <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> did come within the Section 213(b) (8) exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">C. <em>Amending the Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s original complaint asked for relief for 64 employees. During the trial, the plaintiff sought to amend the complaint to add an additional 63 employees. This would involve approximately $27,000 additional in back wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The original list of 64 names resulted from a list submitted to a Wage and Hour Compliance Officer prior to the filing of the complaint. The plaintiff sought to obtain from the defendant its payroll records,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> granted by the District Court. The payroll records were inspected. From these records the plaintiff was able to uncover all the names of the construction workers employed during the pertinent period, as well as the information necessary to compute the full extent of the wage underpayments. The trial began on November 16, 1972. The trial court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend, stating that no case \u201ccited to the court supports the motion that the complaint may be so drastically amended on the day of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Colonnades claims that up to trial it treated the suit as \u201ca $6,000 lawsuit involving 50 people.\u201d It then states that if the plaintiff had amended his complaint prior to trial, Colonnades would have \u201cprepared for a $35,000 lawsuit involving substantially over 100 employees, but (it) had no way of knowing if any additional employees would be added.\u201d The applicable part of Rule 15(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">An amendment of a complaint will be allowed \u201cunless the opposing party is actually prejudiced.\u201d 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7 15.14 at p. 1011 (2d ed. 1968). This prejudice must \u201cput the objecting party to some serious disadvantage,\u201d and \u201cit is not enough that (the objecting party) advances an imagined grievance or seeks to protect some tactical advantage.\u201d Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1495. Thus, the party opposing the amendment \u201cmust be seriously prejudiced\u201d in his \u201cdefense on the merits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Colonnades does not make any allegation as to how it was prejudiced in its defense except for its vague statement that it would have defended case differently if it had known more money or a greater number of employees were involved.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The issue on this point was really one of mathematical computation. Colonnades had the records in its possession. The identity of the employees and their hours of work were there set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The District Court should have allowed the amendment, Shultz v. Mack Farland &amp; Sons Roofing Co., 5 Cir., 1969, 413 F.2d 1296, 1302 and Monod v. Futura, Inc., 10 Cir., 1969, 415 F.2d 1170, 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">D. <em>Inclusion of Colonnades under Section 203(s)(4)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The District Court held that Colonnades did not come within the \u201cold\u201d Section 203(s)(4) as a construction enterprise. Unpaid overtime compensation was therefore computed under Section 207(a)(2), which covers newly covered employees who come within the Act for the first time under the 1966 Amendments. The District Court held that Colonnades came within the Act for the first time under the 1966 Amendments by virtue of Section 203(s)(l) as amended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">\u201cThe plaintiff makes much of the fact that the defendant had expenditures for construction in excess of $350,000 during the relevant periods. But this does not mean at all that the hotel was in the business of construction. To the contrary, it was at all times engaged in the business of operating a hotel. The hotel had no profit or receipts of any kind from construction. Its construction activities consisting solely of expanding and modernizing existing structures and facilities for its own account. The court finds and concludes that the defendant hotel was not and is not engaged in the business of construction within the meaning of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">Colonnades claims that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-14\">(It) was not engaged in 'the business of construction.\u2019 It was engaged in the business of operating a hotel. Any \u2018construction\u2019 activities consisted simply of expanding and modernizing the existing functioning hotel and were incidental to the business of operating the hotel \u2014 not a separate business activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">Colonnades\u2019 annual gross volume must exceed $350,000 from the construction business for Colonnades to come within the \u201cold\u201d Section 203(s)(4).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Colonnades stipulated that in every year in question there was \u201cin excess of $350,000 in addition to our capital assets on the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-16\">\u201cAnnual gross volume\u201d should not be narrowly construed. Wirtz v. Allen Green &amp; Associates, Inc., 6 Cir., 1967, 379 F.2d 198, 200. The Court in <em>Allen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>Green </em>said that \u201cannual gross volume\u201d does not mean sales and agreed with the District Court below that it meant \u201cany gain of capital assets derived from construction activities ... to the extent of their fair market value, irrespective of whether the assets were in the form of money or its equivalent in property.\u201d Wirtz v. Allen Green &amp; Associates, Inc., supra at 199. The Court in <em>Allen Green </em>said it was the purpose of Congress to \u201cinclude in the coverage of the Act employees of construction contractors who build for themselves as well as those who build for others.\u201d Wirtz v. Allen Green &amp; Associates, Inc., supra at 200. Therefore, we must hold that the District Court construed too strictly the definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d in Section 203(s)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The District Court on remand will compute the overtime compensation due to the affected employees under Section 207(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-10\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq., hereinafter called the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-11\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-12\">.
