We hold that this statement was spontaneously volunteered and did not result from any official interrogation, and hence was not obtained in violation of either Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1965), or Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964). It thus becomes unnecessary for us to reach the question whether it was \u201cplain error\u201d not to instruct the jury that a statement obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>may be used only in passing on credibility and not as evidence of guilt, under Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>It is undisputed that the statement made here was not a part of any interrogation, that it was not elicited by the Postal Inspector<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, indeed, appellant was not asked anything by the Inspector but volunteered the statement to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">While the trial court ruled that \u201cit should have been called to [appellant\u2019s] attention that he doesn\u2019t have to make the statement and that if he does make it, it will be used against him\u201d and said \u201cthat is the only objective testimony of voluntariness,\u201d there is no suggestion by the trial court in the record that the statement was involuntary in the traditional sense of resulting from physical or psychological coercion. Rather, the court felt that for even a spontaneously volunteered statement to be legally \u201cvoluntary\u201d it must be interrupted and the defendant cautioned that what he says might be used against him. The cases in this circuit establish that this view of the law is erroneous. United States v. Garcia, 377 F.2d 321, 324 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 991, 88 S.Ct. 489, 19 L.Ed.2d 484 (1967), points out that <em>Massiah </em>prevents the admissibility of incriminating statements only when \u201claw enforcement authorities have \u2018deliberately elicited\u2019 incriminating statements from a defendant [them] by direct interrogation or by surreptitous means,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he rule does not apply to spontaneous or voluntary statements made by the defendant in the presence of government agents. . . . \u201d United States v. Maxwell, 383 F.2d 437, 443 (2d Cir. 1967), cert denied, 389 U.S. 1057, 88 S.Ct. 809, 19 L.Ed.2d 856 (1968), held admissible a similarly volunteered statement by the defendant, the court saying: \u201cSince Agent Murphy\u2019s unchallenged testimony reveals that Aiken freely volunteered the remarks, neither <em>Massiah </em>nor <em>Escobedo </em>has been violated.\u201d <em>See also </em>United States v. Barone, 467 F.2d 247, at 249 (2d Cir., 1972), <em>(Massiah </em>inapplicable even though damaging admissions were made \u201cat least in part in response to interrogation by the agent\u201d because they were made not only after an express waiver of counsel had been signed but also after the suspect had had a telephone conversation with his attorney). United States v. Collins, 462 F.2d 792, 802 (2d Cir. 1972) (en banc), is not to the contrary, holding only that renewed <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required before the reinterrogation of a suspect who has indicated that he wishes to remain silent. Here, the appellant had given no such indication.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-17\">We therefore affirm the conviction.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-5\">. The following colloquy occurred when the Government sought to introduce the inculpatory statement in its case in chief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-8\">Mr. Chrein: . . . I would say that \u2014 while I am not saying the agent actively solicited the statement, the agent 1 believe might have had an obligation to tell the defendant, \u201cYou are represented by counsel, you shouldn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-10\">Miss O\u2019Brien : Your Honor, the agent has specifically stated that he was not eliciting anything, that the statement was made purely voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-11\">Mr. Chrein: I am not claiming that he elicited, I am claiming that he permitted the statement to go on at a time when the man had counsel and the man was represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-18\">. The testimony of the Inspector was \u201c . . . There was no conversation. He made a certain statement. There was no request on my part to have him make the statement.\u201d The defendant himself denied making any statement in the elevator :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-20\">Q.
