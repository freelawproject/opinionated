While the record in this case indicates that much of the evidence was in direct conflict and that the resolution of issues of credibility was far from a simple and easy task, the record also discloses that there clearly was substantial evidence to support the findings of the trial examiner and the decision and order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-18\"> This court does not sit to retry disputed issues of fact or to redetermine issues of credibility of witnesses. Our sole question in such a proceeding as this is to determine whether or not there was substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole to uphold the findings of fact and the order of the National Labor Relations Board.
