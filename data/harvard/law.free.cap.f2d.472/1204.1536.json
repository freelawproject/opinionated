Thirty minutes later, after refueling, the plane was back in the air and the agents again followed it by plane to Chillicothe, Ohio, where it again landed. After several hours, two camper trucks drove up to the aircraft and a considerable number of large plastic bags were taken from the airplane and loaded into the campers. The defendants were stopped by customs officials at a roadblock outside the airport and arrested. The campers were searched and the 41 bags of. marijuana weighing over 1,000 pounds were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">There were no customs facilities at the airports at New Smyrna Beach, Florida, or at Chillicothe, Ohio, and the occupants of the plane had, of course, violated the customs law of the United States. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1509, 1474 (1970) ; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-16\">The District Judge rejected the government\u2019s claim that the search and seizure was a legal \u201cborder search,\u201d but held it valid because on the facts recited above \u201cthe customs agents had probable cause to believe that the two campers contained contraband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>Subsequently appellants were found guilty before a jury of violating 21 U.S. C. \u00a7 841(a) (1) (1970) and were sentenced to five years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">We affirm the judgments of conviction for the reasons and on the authorities \u25a0cited by the District Judge in his Memorandum and Order filed April 26, 1972.
