The government\u2019s evidence in this case consisted of eye-witness testimony and the testimony of an accomplice. Appellant was sentenced to serve a term of twenty years. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">On October 13, 1971, Mrs. Mary M. Brengel was conducting her usual business as a teller at the drive-in window facilities of the First Guaranty Bank. A lone, unmasked person drove up to her booth in a light colored automobile; he reached over to his glove compartment and stated: \u201cI think I\u2019ve forgotten it.\u201d He drove off and returned to the same booth approximately twenty-five minutes later and placed a bank deposit bag in the teller\u2019s drawer. Mrs. Brengel opened the satchel and discovered a note along with a curious plastic box. The note read: \u201cThis is a radio-controlled bomb. Put your money in the bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Mrs. Brengel glanced at the driver who was now holding a device similar in appearance to a transistor radio. Fearing for her life, she followed the instructions and filled the bag with $2200 and returned it to the driver, who then sped away. Mrs. Brengel did jot down the license number of the automobile as well as a rough outline of the robber\u2019s salient characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">During the course of this occurrence a Mr. Hazelhurst, who was in the vehicle directly behind the robber\u2019s, began wondering why the person preceding him was causing such delay. Mr. Hazel-hurst only glimpsed the profile of the man, yet he paid particular attention to him as he bore a marked resemblance to an acquaintance of his. Mr. Hazelhurst was unaware that he was witnessing the execution of a bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Appellant first contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress and/or strike the identification testimony of eye-witnesses Brengel and Hazelhurst.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">On the day of the robbery Mrs. Bren-gel was shown numerous photographs at the Duval County Police Station and was unable to make an identification. Some eight days after the incident the FBI told Mrs. Brengel that they may have some suspects and that they had some pictures they wanted her to see. The FBI showed her a photo spread which consisted of two sets of photographs, one being in black and white and the other in color. There were eight photos in the black and white set and ten in the color set.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">Appellant\u2019s picture appeared once in each set while no other person\u2019s picture was repeated. Mrs. Brengel identified appellant\u2019s picture in each of the sets.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">Five days after the photographic identification Mrs. Brengel attended a lineup which consisted of six men who, excepting one, fairly matched the appellant\u2019s physical characteristics. She, once again, picked out appellant. In the course of the trial Mrs. Brengel again positively identified the appellant as the bank robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-16\">Robert Hazelhurst, who observed the robber\u2019s profile while waiting in line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>at the bank\u2019s drive-in facilities, was not shown any photographs but he did attend the line-up with Mrs. Brengel. Hazel-hurst was also told by the FBI that they had a man they wanted him to see. At the line-up Hazelhurst requested the men to turn to give him a profile view. He identified the appellant and, although he could not be absolutely certain, he was \u201cas sure as he could be.\u201d Eye-witness Hazelhurst also identified the appellant during the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Appellant alleges that the photographic identification procedure as employed denied him his fundamental rights of due process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"An\">The United States Supreme Court has held that convictions based on eye-witness identification at trial following a pre-trial identification by photograph will be set aside only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). The Court indicated that the chance of misidentification would be heightened if a picture of a single individual recurs in the photographic spread or is in some way emphasized. However, a recurrence of one person\u2019s photograph within a group of pictures does not necessitate a finding that the photographic identification was impermissibly suggestive. United States v. Ballard, 423 F.2d 127, 132 (5th Cir., 1970). The identification may stand even though the procedure employed may have in some respects fallen short of the ideal, providing that the procedure when viewed in the totality of its own circumstances meets the fundamental test of fairness. <em>Simmons, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">As stated in United States v. Sutherland, 428 F.2d 1152, 1156 (5th Cir., 1970): .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">\u201c . . . Clearly, if a teller in a bank is held up by a person he knows well, a picture spread, regardless of its suggestiveness, is unlikely to affect the teller\u2019s identification. But if the witness caught only a fleeting glimpse of an unknown fleeing felon, the likelihood of misidentification is substantially increased by a suggestive picture spread. Between these two extremes, the determination must be made upon the facts in the particular case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Since Mrs. Brengel had viewed the robber for approximately five minutes, appellant\u2019s case rests between these two poles. Under the facts of this case the recurrence of appellant\u2019s photograph within the sets displayed did not render the in court testimony concerning this procedure excludable under the rule of <em>Simmons.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Prior to viewing the spread of photographs the witness Brengel was told that the FBI \u201cmay have a suspect.\u201d Similarly, the FBI prior to the line-up told Hazelhurst that they wanted him to \u201csee a man.\u201d At no time did the FBI or other law enforcement officials make any suggestion that appellant was \u201cthe man.\u201d The possible suggestiveness caused by the repetition of appellant\u2019s photograph and the FBI\u2019s statement does not in the context of the facts in this case so undermine the reliability of the eye-witness identification as to violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">We have carefully examined appellant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
