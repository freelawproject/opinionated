General Stencils, Inc., 438 F.2d 894 (2 Cir. 1971), we remanded to the National Labor Relations Board the portion of its order of August 15, 1969, 178 N.L.R.B. 108, requiring a small Brooklyn manufacturer to bargain with a union which had obtained authorization cards from a majority of its production and maintenance workers in 1967. We did this in light of two factors: One was our holding that the Board\u2019s findings of unlawful interrogation of two workers were unwarranted under our decision in Bourne v. NLRB, 332 F.2d 47 (2 Cir. 1964); the other was a question whether the surviving findings met the requirements laid down in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 613-615, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), for dispensing with a Board-supervised election and our inability to understand the seeming disparity between the Board's issuance of a bargaining order in this ease and its failure to do so in others where the employer\u2019s conduct appeared to pose a graver threat to the conduct of an election. We presented the Board with three possible courses for applying its <em>\u201cGissel-given </em>authority\u201d to issue a bargaining order on the basis of cards alone. These were, in descending order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>of desirability: (1) use of the Board\u2019s rule-making power; (2) an illuminating opinion by the full Board; and (3) an explanation in each case \u201cjust what it [the Board or a panel] considers to have precluded a fair election and why, and in what respects the case differs from others where it has reached an opposite conclusion.\u201d 438 F.2d at 901-902.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">More than fourteen months after our remand, on a further review of the record, two members of a three-man panel adhered to the initial determination. 195 N.L.R.B. No. 173 (1972). Chairman Miller dissented. In an opinion of the sort envisaged by the second possibility we had suggested, he analyzed a broad range of types of employer misconduct and sought to develop standards that would bring consistency and intelligibility into the Board\u2019s decisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority, however, opted for the third \u2022course.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The majority regarded as \u201cthe most salient violation\u201d a threat of plant closure allegedly made by Joseph Klug-man, the Company\u2019s general manager, to a single employee, Robert Kretschmer, who had already advised the employer of his intention to leave. It is worthwhile to state just what the evidence of this \u201cthreat\u201d was. Kretschmer testified that after making unfavorable remarks about unions, Klugman \u201calso said that he didn\u2019t have to give us, anything that\u2014 well, what I am going to say now was said before the union came in and during \u2014 \u201d, and then, after an objection by counsel,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">Yes, this was all in the same conversation, but this was something that he had said before. I mean it is not something he just said at this one specific time, that he could always close, close the business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Further, in response to the General Counsel\u2019s question on redirect \u201cwhether on more than one occasion Mr. Klugman said that if the union came in, he would close down or might close down,\u201d Kretschmer responded in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Kretschmer gave no testimony that he took this threat seriously or that he had ever communicated Klugman\u2019s remarks to any other employee in the two-month period before he left. Seventeen other employees were called by the General Counsel, but none testified to having heard such a threat, either directly or indirectly. The majority sought to avoid the absence of any such testimony by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">A threat of such serious consequences for <em>all </em>employees for selecting the Union will, all but inevitably, be discussed among employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">Chairman Miller thought it made \u201cno sense whatever to permit the only witness who heard a threat to testify that the threat was made but to remain silent on the question whether he disclosed the threat to any other employee,\u201d since \u201c[a] chain of dissemination is a relatively easy matter to establish\u201d but \u201cnondissemination is virtually impossible to prove . . . . <em>\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5Ub\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number> While we agree that the General Counsel should not be relieved of this exceedingly slight burden before the Board can rely on such a threat to support a bargaining order, there are further circumstances invalidating the majority\u2019s conclusion in this case. As indicated, Kretschmer was about to leave; common sense dictates that the case for such an \u201cinevitable\u201d inference as the majority made is at its weakest when a \u201cthreat\u201d to such an employee is involved. Indeed, Klugman\u2019s \u201cthreat\u201d made so little impression on Kretschmer that at first he could not recall this part of their conversation. To bring Klugman\u2019s alleged remarks to Kretschmer under the same rubric as the repeated and detailed threats of plant closure which were the subject of the Court\u2019s rulings in Sinclair Co. v. NLRB, decided with <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 618-619, 89 S.Ct. 1918, is an example of the \u201cfallacy of the lonely fact\u201d and the further fallacy of using the same word to cover wholly unlike situations. The Supreme Court detailed at great length the extent, reality, and immediacy of Sinclair\u2019s threats of plant closure. 395 U.S. at 587-589, 89 S.Ct. 1918. See also NLRB v. Sinclair Co., 397 F.2d 157, 159 (especially note 5), 160 (1 Cir. 1968). In contrast, Klugman\u2019s remarks, if made, went little beyond the truism that an employer can shut a plant at any time. American working men are bright and sturdy enough to know this, and also to know how unlikely it is that a small local employer will in fact close down a flourishing operation simply in a fit of pique. It is thus easy to understand why what has now become \u201cthe most salient violation\u201d by respondent received no mention in the Board\u2019s original decision as a ground for a bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The other ground advanced by the majority for finding \u00a7 8(a)(1) violations of such magnitude as to justify dispensing with an election was this court\u2019s \u201cinexplicable\u201d failure to ascribe proper importance to \u201ctwo specific violations of comparable gravity to the threat of closure; namely, the threat to lay off and the threat to discharge employees in the event the Union won an election.\u201d If we had done anything so truly inexplicable, we would have been in good company. Although the Board\u2019s previous decision noted these threats of layoff and discharge, 178 N.L.R.B. at 108 nn. 2 &amp; 3, it supported its bargaining order by referring only to the employer\u2019s \u201cintention to revoke many existing privileges if they [the employees] elected the Union.\u201d In its brief in this court the Board argued that the bargaining order was justified in light of the employer\u2019s threatening the employees \u201cwith loss of benefits, disciplinary sanctions and the possibility of plant closure;\u201d it said nothing of threats of layoff or discharge. Following these leads, after discussing the plant closure issue, we referred to \u201cthreats to a few employees to withdraw benefits of a relatively minor nature.\u201d 438 F.2d at 902-903.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">We find the Board\u2019s newly found reliance on the \u201cthreats\u201d to lay off and discharge as a ground for a bargaining order to be unwarranted. The bases for the claimed \u201cthreat to discharge employees in the event the Union won an election,\u201d were the following testimony of Kenneth De Thomas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">Q. What did Mr. Klugman say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">A. He was talking about people being late, and he said that he would have to enforce a new rule, if anyone was late three times in a month, that they would be fired, and he also stated that if the union got it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">Q. I\u2019m sorry. Would you repeat that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>A. He stated if the union got in, he would have to enforce a new rule on lateness, that anyone late three times in a month would be fired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">and testimony by Marie Lamattina referring to a statement by Klugman, \u201cAnd if we came in late, he could fire us for it.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is a rather long way from the dramatic characterization the majority opinion of the Board has now given to it. The Union would have something to say about the existence and administration of any such rule. Moreover, any employee could avoid \u201cdischarge\u201d by the simple method of coming to work on time. The evidence of the \u201cthreat\u201d of layoffs was a sentence in Miss Lamattina\u2019s testimony just preceding that last mentioned, \u201cAnd he said that well, if the union came in, and it got slow, he could lay us off.\u201d <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There was nothing to suggest any likelihood that work was going to get \u201cslow\u201d within any foreseeable time; Klugman testified without contradiction that the company was extremely busy. While there was testimony that in the past the company had generally found something for employees to do, as was in its interest, in cases of temporary slackening, no employee could have supposed that, union or no union, the company would indefinitely keep on its payroll workers for whom it had neither actual nor prospective use.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The lack of support for the majority\u2019s conclusion that Klugman\u2019s conduct impaired the prospect for a fair election is confirmed by a reading of the record as a whole. Of the eighteen employees called by the General Counsel, only one, Miss Lamattina, testified that Klugman\u2019s clumsy sallies had caused her any fear. The same witness admitted that much of the employees\u2019 speculation about possible crackdowns on lateness and other matters came before Klugman had said anything. The picture emerging from the entire record is of employees who remained in a perfectly good position to weigh, in Miss Lamattina\u2019s words, both the good and the bad things which they knew, apart from any statements by Klugman, would happen if the union came in.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The Board\u2019s attempted explanation of its failure to issue a bargaining order in the three post <em>-Gissel </em>cases cited in our previous opinion, 438 F.2d at 903-904, as seemingly presenting more serious violations than in the instant case, is equally unconvincing. The majority appeared to think it sufficient to say that the cases were different, as all eases are, whereas the real question is whether they were significantly different, and, if so, how. As an example of the opinion\u2019s analysis, it will suffice to cite Blade-Tribune Publishing Co., 161 N.L.R.B. 1512 (1966), remanded in light of NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 71 L.R.R.M. 3104 (9 Cir.), bargaining order withdrawn, 180 N.L.R.B. 432 (1969), where the employer systematically interrogated the majority of the employees with regard to their union sympathies, implicitly promised new benefits to induce the employees to reject the union, and, as the Board majority here characterized it, made \u201ca change in the work schedule of one union adherent.\u201d Incredibly, the majority, or whoever wrote their \u25a0 opinion, chose to omit any reference to the circumstances which made this last conduct a most serious violation. As the Board found in <em>Blade-Tribune, </em>161 N.L.R.B. at 1528, the employer had deliberately and discriminatorily imposed an extraordinarily harsh work schedule on an active union adherent in an attempt to force him to quit \u2014 the sort of conduct that Chairman Miller believed would justify a per se rule that the employer be ordered to bargain. Although the Board majority here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>lamely asserts that there were no \u201cdirect threats to layoff or discharge employees for selecting the Union,\u201d the Board in <em>Blade-Tribune </em>found that the employer\u2019s action was intended \u201cto serve notice on all the other employees that adherence to the Union would result in reprisal.\u201d 161 N.L.R.B. at 1528. To say that this blatant misconduct of the employer in <em>Blade-Tribune, </em>along with his other unlawful acts, is less serious than Klug-man\u2019s anti-union remarks here goes beyond the bounds of rationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We are aware of the statement in a footnote to the <em>Gissel </em>opinion, 395 U.S. at 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. at 1939 that \u201cIn fashioning its remedies under the broad provisions of \u00a7 10(c) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c)), the Board draws on a fund of knowledge and expertise all its own, and its choice of remedy must therefore be given special respect by reviewing courts.\u201d Whether the duty of deferral is weakened when the experts disagree would be an interesting subject for legal commentators. <em>Cf. </em>Northeast Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, 331 F.2d 579, 589 (1 Cir. 1964) (Aldrich, J., eoncur-ring). We need not undertake such an exploration here. We fault the majority not because of disagreement with the few general views on labor policy that it expressed, but because of its blowing up bits and pieces to arrive at a' conclusion not justified by a fair reading of the record as a whole. It was to prevent administrative action of just this sort that \u00a7 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, directed the courts to review the whole record and to set aside arbitrary or capricious agency actions, and the Taft-Hartley Act made the Labor Board\u2019s findings of fact conclusive only \u201cif supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), (f). As the Court said in Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 466, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), Congress has imposed on the courts of appeals \u201cresponsibility for assuring that the Board keeps within reasonable grounds.\u201d We hold it exceeded them here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Enforcement is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">. Chairman Miller identified two types of misconduct which would justify a <em>per se </em>rule \u2014 -the grant of significant benefits to thwart an organizing campaign, see United Packing Co., 187 N.L.R.B. Np. 132 (1971), and the reassignment, demotion, or discharge of union adherents in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) of the NLRA. In contract to the treatment of such employer \u201cactions,\u201d he proposed that where only employer \u201cthreats\u201d were involved, the Board should analyze the nature of the threats, the likelihood that they would be seriously regarded by employees, and how widely they were disseminated, and set forth considerations relevant to this analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-14\">. The Board argues that, under the rule prevailing when the case was tried, see 438 F.2d at 897, there was no reason for the General Counsel to elicit testimony with respect to dissemination. This is not altogether clear in light of the many Board holdings, criticized in NLRB v. River Togs, Inc., 382 F.2d 198, 206-208 (2 Cir. 1967), that the extent of an employer\u2019s \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations was relevant to a determination whether he had a good faith doubt of the union\u2019s ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>jority. But assuming that point in the Board\u2019s favor, a legitimate excuse for not adducing evidence is not the equivalent of its existence; it was open to General Counsel to ask to have the record reopened, as we had suggested the Board do \u201cin light of the fact that the case was tried on the basis of a legal standard different from that now applied.\u201d 438 F.2d at 905.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\">. She later amplified this, \u201cHe said if we came in late a few times, he could fire us for it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">. The two were linked by another \u201cthreat\u201d: \u201cYou know, and he said, that he could stop the radio playing and not let us play it, you know.\u201d The witness acknowledged that the word was \u201ccould,\u201d not \u201cwould.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">. We had suggested that, although perhaps not required to do so under NLRB v. Katz, 369 U.S. 736, 748 n. 16, 82 S.Ct. 1107, 8 L.Ed.2d 230 (1962), the Board might find this an appropriate case for considering employee turnover, as proposed in NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., 427 F.2d 446, 448-449 (5 Cir.) cert. denied, 400 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 356, 27 L.Ed.2d 266 (1970), and in Judge McCree\u2019s dissent in G. P. D., Inc. v. NLRB, 430 F.2d 963, 965-966 (6 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 974, 91 S.Ct. 1193, 28 L.Ed.2d 323 (1971). The majority dismissed this in a footnote saying \u201cwe deem it inappropriate to consider employee turnover since the original entry of the bargaining order\u201d because an employer should not be rewarded for his misconduct, citing NLRB v. L. B. Foster Co., 418 F.2d 1 (9 Cir. 1969), and NLRB v. Kostel Corp., 440 F.2d 347 (7 Cir. 1971). While we need not place our refusal to enforce on this ground, the majority\u2019s statement strikes us as rather casual. Respondent claims there was a 43% turnover before the hearing, and a 70% turnover before the Board\u2019s deliberately postponed decision, see 438 F.2d at 896, to issue a bargaining order. Then came a further delay of over a year before the Board filed its brief seeking enforcement, <em>id. </em>After our remand the Board took more than fourteen months to render its opinions. As a result, we are now five and a half years away from the time when the union walked away from an election. It is true that the Court indicated in <em>Kate </em>that lapse of time alone is not a sufficient reason to deny enforcement of a bargaining order, and noted in <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 610-611, 89 S.Ct. 1918, that the Board need not establish that the union has maintained its majority despite the passage of time before issuance of a bargaining order if the order is otherwise appropriate. But this does not mean that the passage of time or proof of employee turnover is irrelevant for all purposes. When the employer\u2019s unlawful practices fall outside the \u201coutrageous\u201d or \u201cpervasive\u201d category, the Court in <em>Gissel </em>held that \u201ceffectuating ascertainable employee free choice becomes as important a goal as deterring employer misbehavior,\u201d 395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. See Christensen &amp; Christensen, <em>Gissel Packing </em>and \u201cGood Faith Doubt\u201d: The Gestalt of Required Recognition of Unions under the NLRA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>37 U.Chi.L.Rev. 411, 422 (1970). Moreover, to determine the appropriateness of a bargaining order, the <em>Gissel </em>Court mandated an inquiry into the effect of the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices on the election process and the likelihood that these practices or their recurrence in the future 'will prevent a fair election. Where the focus is thus on ascertaining employee choice and examining the conditions likely to surround a future election, changes in personnel and the passage of time are relevant considerations in the Board\u2019s analysis. When the question whether the employer\u2019s conduct prevented a fair election is marginal in any view, as demonstrated by a dissent from one of its own members, it would seem that the Board should more carefully weigh the deterrent effect of a bargaining order on an employer found to have violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) against the possibility of inflicting what may be a totally unwanted, and even largely unknown, union on a new work force. See NLRB v. Staub Cleaners, Inc., 418 F.2d 1086, 1090 (2 Cir. 1969) (Lumbard, Chief Judge, dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>HAYS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ac_-dedup-0\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1939, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969) the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201cThe employers argue that the Fourth Circuit correctly observed that, \u2018in the great majority of cases, a cease and desist order with the posting of appropriate notices will eliminate any undue influences upon employees voting in the security of anonymity.\u2019 NLRB v. S. S. Logan Packing Co., [4 Cir.,] 386 F.2d [562,] at 570. It is for the Board and not the courts, however, to make that determination, based on its expert estimate as to the effects on the election process of unfair labor practices of varying intensity. In fashioning its remedies under the broad provisions of \u00a7 10(c) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c)), the Board draws on a fund of knowledge and expertise all its own, and its choice of remedy must therefore be given special respect by reviewing courts. See Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, 379 U.S. 203 [, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233] (1964). \u2018[I]t is usually better to minimize the opportunity for reviewing courts to substitute their discretion for that of the agency.\u2019 Consolo v. FMC, 383 U.S. 607, 621, [, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1027, 16 L.Ed.2d 131] (1966).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">This court has said that the Board is invested with \u201calmost total discretion\u201d in determining when a bargaining order is the appropriate remedy for violations of the Act.

Surely such matters as the effect on employees of threats to close the plant, to discharge for tardiness and to deprive them of plant privileges, are exactly the areas in which the Board rather than the judges have a special \u201cfund of knowledge and expertise.\u201d If ordinary common sense would not provide the answer, surely the Board would know better than the judges whether the report of an employer\u2019s threat of plant closure is likely to spread among the employees of a tiny plant all working in close proximity to one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">While it may have been proper for the court, having found that the employer\u2019s interrogation of employees did not violate the Act, to remand the case to the Board to determine whether the remaining unfair labor practices were sufficient to justify a bargaining order, the court should now accept the Board\u2019s decision on that point. I, therefore, dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
