The District Court dismissed his petition for habeas corpus relief on the merits. We find, however, that the petition should have been dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">This Court affirmed a prior denial of habeas corpus relief to the appellant. Kirby v. Beto, 426 F.2d 258 (5th Cir. 1970). The grounds for relief set out in the instant habeas petition, however, are different from those alleged in the appellant\u2019s earlier federal petition. In this petition Kirby alleges: (1) the contraband seized was inadmissible because it was not listed on the search warrant; (2) the search warrant was invalid because it was obtained through false swearing; and (3) the search warrant was invalid for lack of probable cause because the informer was not a credible person. These contentions were not urged on Kirby\u2019s direct state criminal appeal or in any state habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The record shows that petitioner has failed to exhaust his available state remedies, as required by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254. The contentions stated in the present ha-beas petition have yet to be considered by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals under Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Vernon\u2019s Ann. St. <em>See </em>St. Jules v. Beto, 462 F.2d 1365 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Vacated and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
