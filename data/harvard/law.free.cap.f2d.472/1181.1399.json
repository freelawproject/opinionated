He stipulated all of the facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By the stipulation Brown admitted his prior felony conviction in 1967 as alleged in the indictment; that the firearm had moved in interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>commerce on or about April 10, 1970; and that the firearm was found in his possession on January 18, 1972. Thus, at the trial only a question of law was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">The District Court, considering the indictment and the stipulation, found Brown \u201cguilty as charged in the indictment\u201d (App. 5A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">On appeal, Brown contends that there was not sufficient nexus between his possession of the firearm and interstate commerce. He argues that the movement of the firearm in interstate commerce had ceased about nineteen months prior to the time he received and possessed it, and that it had initially been received and possessed by another person. He further contends that the statute only proscribes possession of the firearm while it is being moved in interstate commerce. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">In our opinion this contention is without merit. Sufficient nexus was shown by the prior movement in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), is controlling. In that case, unlike the case at bar, the indictment did not allege, and the Government made no attempt to prove, that the firearm had been moved \u201cin commerce or affecting commerce.\u201d The majority opinion (the Chief Justice and Justice Blackmun dissenting) read the statute narrowly, and held that there must be some nexus with interstate commerce. Five Courts of Appeals, including this Court, had previously held otherwise by giving effect to the Congressional findings and declaration in Section 1201 of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">Here the indictment charged, and the proof showed, the movement of the firearm in interstate commerce. In Part III of its opinion in <em>Bass, </em>in stating how the Government can meet its burden, the Court did not read the statute so narrowly, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-11\">\u201cHaving concluded that the commerce requirement in \u00a7 1202(a) must be read as part of the \u2018possesses\u2019 and \u2018receives\u2019 offenses, we add a final word about the nexus with interstate commerce which must be shown in individual cases. The Government can obviously meet its burden in a variety of ways. We note only some of these. For example, a person \u2018possesses in commerce or affecting commerce\u2019 if at the time of the offense the gun was moving interstate or on an interstate facility, or if the possession affects commerce. Significantly broader in reach, however, is the offense of \u2018receiv[ing] in commerce or affecting commerce,\u2019 for we conclude that the Government meets its burden here if it demonstrates that the firearm received has previously traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d (Footnotes omitted) (404 U. S. at 350, 92 S.Ct. at 524.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">The last three lines of the above quotation are particularly applicable here. The Government has met its burden because \u201cit demonstrates that the firearm received has <em>previously </em>traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Court did not place any time limit on the previous movement; neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-13\">Brown was convicted of receiving and possessing the firearm. However, as we pointed out in United States v. Mc-Creary, 455 F.2d 647 (6th Cir. 1972), one could not very well possess a firearm without receiving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1241-14\">. Tlie pertinent provisions of tlie statute are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-15\">\u201c\u00a7 1202. (a) Any person who\u2014 (1) has been convicted by a court of tlie United States or of a State or any political subdivision thereof of a felony, . . . and who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce, after the date of enactment of this Act, any firearm shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1241-18\">. The stipulation reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-19\">\u201c1. The Court may view and consider the indictment, noted above, as evidence of defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction and his subsequent possession of the firearm described in tlie indictment; but defendant does not, by this stipulation, admit tlie sufficiency of the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-28\">\u201c2. The firearm described in the indictment was lawfully shipped from Nashville, Tennessee, to a licensed dealer in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on or about April 10, 1970. The firearm was subsequently purchased from the dealer in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, by a known party, and defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm arose in Kentucky from an unknown party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-29\">\u201c3. The firearm was found in defendant\u2019s possession in Logan County, Kentucky, by law enforcement officers at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest on January 18, 1972.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">.
