The federal habeas court found that his counsel had been effective and that appellant had entered a voluntary plea of guilty which waived the other asserted grounds for relief, they being non-jurisdictional in nature. The finding that counsel was effective was not clearly erroneous. The finding of waiver was correct. McMillin v. Beto, 447 F.2d 453 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
