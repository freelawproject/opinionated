After the plaintiffs had amended their original complaint, the district court, 330 F.Supp. 1235, granted a motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-25\">We agree with the district court that so much of the complaint as alleges in substance that the defendant has slandered the plaintiffs and their business does not assert the violation of any right protected by the Civil Rights Act. The district court also ruled that the other allegations of the complaint lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201cthe factual specificity required to support a cause of action under the Civil Rights Act.\u201d That ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Finally, while the original complaint was dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d the order appealed from is not so limited. No reason appears for affording the plaintiffs another opportunity to plead after twice failing to make an adequate factual statement of any basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
