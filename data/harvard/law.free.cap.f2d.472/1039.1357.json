On March 5, 1971, this action was removed by defendant from the Court of Common Pleas of the State of Connecticut, New Haven County, to the District Court for the District of Connecticut, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446. At no time during the 21 months that this action has been pending in the federal courts have plaintiffs ever moved to remand it to the state court as provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447 (e). Indeed, in their petition for rehearing or rehearing in banc, filed March 30, 1972, plaintiffs expressly disclaimed any desire to have the case remanded to the state court. And, in view of plaintiffs\u2019 indication to us of their intention to seek further review of our order - of dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we purposely refrained from ordering that the case be remanded to the state court, since such order would not be \u201creviewable on appeal or otherwise\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447 (d) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>We deduce, nevertheless, from the Supreme Court\u2019s order of November 13, 1972 that plaintiffs now wish to have the case remanded to the state court. Accordingly, since our determination that the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction has become final, we order that the opinion of this Court dated March 17, 1972, as modified May 22, 1972, be further modified so that the last paragraph thereof, 457 F.2d at 614, shall read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-4\">\u201cAccordingly, since our determination that the federal court lacks s\u00fcb-ject matter jurisdiction has become final, we vacate the order of the District Court and remand the action to the Court of Common Pleas of the State of Connecticut, New Haven County. No costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">The Clerk of this Court is directed to modify the judgment of this Court accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
