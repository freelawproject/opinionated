United States v. Menna (9 Cir. 1971) 451 F.2d 982, 984, cert. denied, 405 U.S. 963, 92 S.Ct. 1170, 31 L.Ed.2d 238 (1972). We hold that the statute is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-23\">Appellant next claims that the statutory term \u201cacquisition\u201d was not meant to reach redemption of firearms from a pawnbroker, and that its plain meaning is not broad enough to do so, citing the factually similar case of United States v. Laisure (5 Cir. 1971) 460 F.2d 709, 711-712. We decline to follow that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-24\">We hold that the term \u201cacquisition\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a) (6), when read together with the ensuing language prohibiting false statements \u201cwith respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the <em>sale or other disposition </em>of such firearm,\u201d clearly and unambiguously defines an offense. The terms \u201cacquisition\u201d and \u201cother disposition\u201d are clearly correlatives. United States v. Beebe (10 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 222, 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-25\">The statutes were meant to and did prohibit false statements in connection with the redemption of firearms from a pawnbroker, who is a \u201cdealer\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a) (11) (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-26\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions have been considered, and they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-27\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b653-28\">CHAMBERS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ANA\">(concurring and dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b653-29\">I concur that the statute is constitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-30\">But what Huddleston did was reacquire. I do not believe that \u201creacquire\u201d is necessarily included within \u201cacquire.\u201d That seems to be a little too broad when we construe a criminal statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
