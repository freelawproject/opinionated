PECK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The petitioners, major domestic and foreign manufacturers of automobiles, have petitioned this Court for a review of an order of the National Highway-Traffic Safety Administration of the Department of Transportation, adopted pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, 15 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1461, entitled \u201cMotor Vehicle Safety Standard #208, Occupant Crash Protection in Passenger Cars, Multipurpose Passenger Vehicles, Trucks and Buses.\u201d The Automobile Safety Act of 1966 was enacted as a response to the alarming number of deaths and injuries resulting from automobile accidents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Its expressed purpose is \u201c . . . to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents.\u201d 15 U. S.C. \u00a7 1381. Chrysler Corp. v. Rhodes, 416 F.2d 319, 321 (1st Cir. 1969); General Motors Corp. v. Volpe, 321 F.Supp. 1112, 1115 (D.C.Del.1970). In achieving this goal, two courses of action are open to the Agency. (See Cong. Rep. No. 1919, 89th Cong.2d Sess., 1966, 2 U.S. Code, Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2731 (1966).) It can act to prevent accidents,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or it can act to prevent injuries in the event of accidents. Standard 208 is designed to accomplish the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">It is now established that most injuries caused by the impact of the automobile passenger with the steering wheel and column, the dashboard, the windshield, and other interior protrusions, can be prevented or at least ameliorated by safety-oriented vehicle design, and much attention has recently been devoted to the problem of the \u201csecond collision.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">While many injuries of this sort can be prevented by the elimination from the interior surfaces of hard projections or sharp edges (e.g.: Standard 111, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.111, S3.1.2.2) and by the use of energy absorbing steering columns (Standard 203, 49 C.F.R. 571.203), and by the application of energy absorbing materials to reduce impact forces at probable points of contact in the event of rapid deceleration, (Standard 201, 49 C.F.R. 571.201, S3.1, S3.4, S3.5), the most serious injuries can be prevented only by an occupant restraint device which absorbs the high deceleration forces while firmly preventing the passenger from being thrown against the inside of the vehicle or from being ejected out of it. The idea is to assure that when the car stops dead, the passengers don\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The standard under review requires the petitioners to build into their vehicles by a specified date a specified quantum of \u201cpassive protection\u201d through the use of \u201cpassive restraint devices.\u201d A passive restraint is defined as a protective occupant restraint device which does not depend for its effectiveness upon any action taken by the occupants beyond that necessary to operate the vehicle (36 F.R. 8296, May 4, 1971). An active restraint is a device which is not effective unless some action is taken by the occupants, the most familiar example of which is the fastening of a seat belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">An \u201cairbag\u201d is a passive inflatable occupant restraint system. The term \u201cairbag\u201d is used generally to designate the entire system of apparatus in which a sensor, activated by the deceleration force of a collision, causes an explosive charge of compressed gas (or a gas generator) to rapidly inflate a large bag which restrains the occupant as he moves toward the windshield, dashboard or steering wheel of the car, and then deflates itself. This entire cycle, including the deflation, is completed in less than ' one-half second. Although the safety standard under review does not by its terms specify that airbags be used to meet the specified injury criteria, the petitioners unanimously contend that because the injury criteria of Standard 208 were established with the airbag in mind that the airbag is the only device which can be reasonably expected to satisfy these criteria, and that therefore, the standard is in reality an airbag requirement standard. Although nothing in the record justifies disagreement with the petitioners on this point,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the purposes of this opinion we do not find it necessary to distinguish between the airbag and any other form of passive restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Standard 208 was first published as part of the initial federal standards issued pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(h) on February 3, 1967 (32 F.R. 2415 (1967) \u201cSeat Belt Installation \u2014 Passenger Cars\u201d) and established the requirements for seat belt installations. No objections were made to this requirement, and the standard remained unchanged until March 10, 1970. On that date the Agency published what is now generally referred to as Revised Standard 208, New Standard 208 or, more descriptively, the Airbag Standard. The amendment procedure has produced to date a series of twenty-four notices, consisting of notices of proposed rulemaking, notices of meetings, and various final amendments to the existing standard. Not all of these notices are important to the case presented to us, but a brief review of their chronology will help to put into perspective the course of the Agency\u2019s action in the promulgation of Standard 208, and its reaction to the industry\u2019s comments, and is necessary to an evaluation of many of the petitioners\u2019 challenges to the procedure utilized by the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">A proposed change in the initial Standard 208 was first announced in Notice 1, published on July 2, 1969, entitled \u201cInflatable Occupant Restraint Systems\u201d (34 F.R. 11148). In this advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the Agency observed that a promising system of restraint, commonly referred to as \u201cairbags,\u201d was in the final stages of development and that it would be desirable that such a system be provided on new motor vehicles as soon as possible, and not later than January 1, 1972. Information was requested, and a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>meeting was scheduled at which interested parties presented their views on the concept of mandatory, industry-wide installation of airbags (Notices 2 and 3, 34 F.R. 12107, 13480). Written comments were submitted as requested and as required by the APA \u00a7 4(c), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">After a lengthy evaluation of the comments of the manufacturers and other interested parties and newly developed technical information, the Agency issued a notice of a proposed safety standard entitled \u201cOccupant Crash Protection; Passenger Cars, Multipurpose Passenger Vehicles, Trucks and Buses\u201d (Notice 4, 35 F.R. 7187). The proposed rule generally provided a delay in the effective date of a passive restraint system from January 1, 1972 to January 1, 1973. However, during the interim period, passenger ear manufacturers were required to substitute a modified restraint system which amounted to an improved seat belt assembly. The proposal set out the procedures to be used in testing the devices and the injury criteria which must be met. A second public meeting was held (Notice 5, 35 F.R. 10120). The interim requirements of the proposed standard were modified to some extent by Notice 6 (35 F.R. 14941), which was published on September 25, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The Agency held numerous formal and informal meetings and conferences; comments were submitted by more than 120 interested persons. After consideration of these comments and other relevant materials, the Agency issued the passive protection requirements of the standard as a final rule in Notice 7 on November 3, 1970 (35 F.R. 16927). The effective date for passive systems was extended from January 1, 1973, to July 1, 1973, for front seat positions and to July 1, 1974, for all occupants; the injury criteria proposed in Notice 4 were modified in some respects. Notice 8, (35 F.R. 16937) issued simultaneously with Notice 7, was a proposal for further modifications of the standard as to a new requirement that deployable systems should not deploy in impacts of less than 15 miles per hour (mph), and for additional injury criteria for various test modes.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">In response to a variety of objections raised in comments and in petitions for reconsideration, the Agency republished Standard 208 on March 10, 1971, as Notice 9 (36 F.R. 4600), a complete and final rule. This notice forms the basis of the Agency\u2019s action which is before this Court for review. This notice incorporated a change in the effective date for passive restraints from July 1, 1973, to August 15, 1973, to reflect the historic model change-over period of the automobile industry. Certain concessions were made for open body vehicles and forward control vehicles, and the Agency indicated that it intended to issue further specifications for the anthropomorphic test devices which the manufacturers had suggested were too vague and which therefore produced inconsistent test data.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">The Agency issued Notice 10 (36 F.R. 12858) in response to the petitions for reconsideration of Notice 9. This notice amended the requirements for the seat belt warning system option which was to become effective January 1, 1972. Notice 11 (36 F.R. 12866), issued simultaneously with Notice 10, proposed certain release requirements should a seat belt assembly be used as a passive restraint system, and requires that airbags be self-deflating.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">Notice 12 (36 F.R. 19254) was issued on October 1, 1971, as a response to the petitions for reconsideration of Notice 9, and is the second of the two notices which this Court has been requested to review. This notice refers to a proposed rule, issued simultaneously, to delay one of the effective dates of Notice 9, and comments upon the necessity of later rulemaking in the standard. This amendment clarifies the monitoring system requirements for a passive system, specifies the positioning and locations of the anthropomorphic test devices and changes the cargo weight to be used for testing multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks. In the comments to Notice 9, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Agency acknowledged that the test dummy specifications were inadequate and that variances in dummies could jeopardize the test results of a vehicle attempting to comply with the standard. The Agency stated that it would issue, at a later date, proposed amendments to the standard detailing performance and descriptive specifications for the test dummies. In the interim, the Agency stated in the comments to Notice 12 that if a vehicle is found to comply with the existing standard under a properly conducted test by a manufacturer the negative results of an Agency test will not be used as the basis for a finding of non-compliance so long as the difference in the test results can be attributed to the test dummies.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Notice 13 (36 F.R. 19266), issued simultaneously with Notice 12, proposed an amendment to Standard 208 which would allow for an additional interim option of a seat belt interlock system which will not allow the engine starting system in a vehicle to operate unless the driver and any front seat passengers have fastened their seat belts. Notice 14 (36 F.R. 19705) proposed a change to conform all explosive devices to existing state and federal regulations. Notice 15 (36 F.R. 23725) was a promulgation of several minor changes concerning seat belt warning systems. On February 24, 1972, the Agency published Notice 16, (37 F.R. 3911) as a final amendment to Standard 208, basically incorporating the proposals of Notice 13 which provided for the option of a manufacturer to use seat belts equipped with an ignition interlock system between August 15, 1973, and August 14, 1975. On March 16, 1972, in Notice 17 (37 F.R. 5507), the Agency proposed further amendments to the method of calculating the head injury criteria of Standard 208. Notices 18 to 24 (37 F.R. 10745, 12393, 13265, 16186, 16604, 22871, 23115) are not directly relevant to these proceedings except that portion of Notice 19 which adopted the proposed amendments of Notice 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Chrysler, Jeep, American Motors, Ford and the Automobile Importers of America have petitioned this Court for a review of Notice 9; Ford, American Motors and Jeep have petitioned this Court for a review of Notice 12. These petitions for review were consolidated in this Court, and were, argued together.</p>\n<p id=\"arb-dedup-0\">Notice 9, as amended by Notices 10, 12, 15 and 16 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is designed to be implemented in three stages, the first two of which offer a manufacturer the choice of several options for compliance:</p>\n<p id=\"AJd\">STAGE ONE: A manufacturer must provide on all vehicles manufactured between January 1, 1972, and August 14, 1973, one of the following three options:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATy\">(1) \u201cComplete Passive Protection,\u201d defined as a system which meets specified injury criteria<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for all seating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>positions in all impact modes, frontal (head-on into a fixed barrier at 30 mph), angular (30 degrees from either side of frontal into a fixed barrier), and side (90 degrees from frontal, impact at 20 mph with a lateral moving barrier) and which will prohibit any part of two test dummies from extending outside any part of the car in a rollover test (rollover in either lateral direction at 30 mph); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">(2) Sufficient interior padding plus lap belts such that the prescribed injury criteria are met at the front outboard positions with test dummies in a, 30 mph frontal crash into a fixed barrier; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">(3) Lap and shoulder belt systems with warning signals at the front outboard positions that restrain test dummies in a 30 mph frontal test crash without complete separation of the belts themselves or their anchorages, plus lap belts at other seating positions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">STAGE TWO: A manufacturer must provide on all vehicles manufactured after August 15, 1973, one of the following three options:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">(1) \u201cComplete Passive Protection\u201d; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">(2) Passive protection for front seat positions which will meet specified injury criteria in a 30 mph head-on crash into a fixed barrier, plus lap belts at all other positions; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">(3) Seat belts with ignition interlocks <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for front seat passengers, plus non-interlocked belts at other positions which must meet the specified injury criteria for front outboard occupants in a 30 mph impact into a fixed barrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-17\">STAGE THREE: By August 15, 1975, a manufacturer must provide \u201cComplete Passive Protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b727-20\">A threshold issue is raised concerning this Court\u2019s scope of review of Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The manufacturers contend that this Court must determine whether the Standard is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence on the record as a whole,\u201d and they rely upon the legislative history of the Act, upon the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, and upon Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). The agency contends that because the rule under review is not the product of adjudication, but of informal rulemaking which is a legislative process, this Court\u2019s review is restricted to a determination of whether the Agency complied with applicable procedural requirements and whether the Agency\u2019s rule reflects a \u201crational consideration\u201d of the relevant matters presented by interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-21\">We think that the scope of review urged upon this Court by the Agency is virtually no review at all; the Agency seems to ignore the existence of its record as well as the substantive limitations which the Act places upon its authority to set standards.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, even though the Agency may proceed by in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>formal rulemaking, the Act requires that several substantive criteria be met, and also provides for direct review of that rule by a United States Court of Appeals on the basis of the record which was compiled during the course of the rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The Automobile Safety Act of 1966 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1431) which empowers the Agency to set minimum performance standards for newly manufactured automobiles, provides that all standards \u201cshall be practicable, shall meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and shall be stated in objective terms.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(a). In addition, the Agency must consider relevant available motor vehicle safety data (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(f)(1)), and must consider \u201cwhether any such proposed standard is reasonable, practicable and appropriate for the particular type of motor vehicle . . . for which it is prescribed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(f)(3). These factors represent the statutory minimum substantive criteria against which each automobile safety standard must be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Congress established a distinct procedure for direct judicial review of Motor Vehicle Safety Standards by the United States Courts of Appeals. In such cases, the Secretary of Transportation is required to file in the Court the record of the proceedings \u201con which [he] based his order as provided in Section 2112 of Title 28 of the United States Code.\u201d Section 2112 of Title 28 provides that \u201call of the evidence before the agency shall be included in the record,\u201d excepting only that stipulated by the parties to be omitted as wholly immaterial to the questioned finding. Section 706(2) (E) of Title 5 provides that in a case in which statutory provision is made for review on the record of the agency, that the agency\u2019s action must be supported by substantial evidence. Clearly when factual issues are involved, including the issue of whether compliance is technologically feasible, the reviewing court must consider the record upon which the Agency based its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The Agency contends that under the authority of California Citizens Band Assn. v. United States, 375 F.2d 43 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 844, 88 S.Ct. 96, 19 L.Ed.2d 112 (1967), it can act on the basis of evidence in its own files, and it does not have to make this evidence available to a litigant seeking judicial review. This may be true in a situation such as was present in that case, where the Agency needed only to make a discretionary decision unencumbered with factual or technical considerations of any kind. In that case, the petitioners requested a review of rules promulgated by the FCC dealing with the use of radio frequencies. The FCC had selected seven frequencies to be used by private radio operators under the new rules of interstate communications. There was no factual question raised in the selection of the frequencies; this was purely a matter of administrative discretion, and consequently was subject to a very narrow scope of review. Furthermore, the statutory language which empowered that Agency to act did not require the compiling of a record as the basis for its action. This is clearly not the case with the Automobile Safety Act which requires the Secretary to \u201cconsider relevant available motor vehicle safety data, including the results of research, development, testing and evaluation activities\u201d and to \u201cconsult with the Vehicle Equipment Safety Commission, and such other State or interstate agencies (including legislative committees) as he deems appropriate.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(f)(1) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">It seems clear that any rule which is required to be, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cpracticable\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d must be reviewed on the basis of the data which the Agency considered in its promulgation, regardless of whether formal hearings were or were not held. In Automotive Parts and Accessories Assn. v. Boyd, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 200, 407 F.2d 330 (1968), the Court was presented with the issue of whether informal rulemaking was authorized by the Act. The Court found that it was, and then upheld the safety standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>there under review by looking at the underlying record to determine whether there was a factual basis for the Agency\u2019s decisions, and whether the required \u201cconcise general statement\u201d of the Agency\u2019s purpose was properly supported.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See also, Boating Industry Assn. v. Boyd, 409 F.2d 408 (7th Cir. 1969) where the identical procedure was followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">An agency performing a rule-making function need not always compile a record of the material upon which its rule is based. It may act on the basis of data contained in its own files or on its own views or opinions. In such cases, a reviewing court cannot test the rule as promulgated against the evidence in the agency\u2019s record. Flying Tiger Line, Inc. v. Boyd, 244 F.Supp. 889 (D.C.1965). In this case, however, the Agency\u2019s freedom of action in regard to the rules it may promulgate is limited by a Congressional mandate which also requires the Secretary to compile a record. As observed in <em>Overton Park, supra, </em>the substantial evidence test may be applied to agency action even when the agency is performing a rulemaking function. 401 U.S. at 414-415, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136. Accordingly, the reviewing court must \u201cengage in a substantial inquiry\u201d and a \u201cthorough, probing, in-depth review,\u201d yet at the same time must be mindful that the ultimate scope of its review is narrow and that it may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency\u2019s. 401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">Any safety standards issued pursuant to the Automobile Safety Act of 1966 must be tested for compliance with the statutory limitations of that Act, and this testing can only be done against the record. The record includes not only the notices of the Agency as published in the Federal Register and the comments and petitions for reconsideration submitted by interested parties, but also the technological and statistical data relied upon by the Agency in arriving at its conclusions. That this material is, or should be, a part of the record in this case is clear from the legislative direction that the Agency \u201cconsider relevant available motor vehicle safety data, including the results of research, development, testing and evaluation activities conducted pursuant to this chapter,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(f)(1), and that the Secretary shall, in the event that a petition for review is presented to a Court of Appeals, file in that court the record upon which he based his actions. 15 U. S.C. \u00a7 1394(a)(1).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To the extent that this conclusion is inconsistent with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>reached by the Seventh Circuit in Boating Industry Assn. v. Boyd, <em>supra, </em>we respectfully decline to follow that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Our review does not end with a determination that these statutory criteria have been met. Section 706(2) (A) of the Administrative Procedure Act requires a finding that the actual decision reached was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d As pointed out in <em>Overton Park, supra, </em>to make this finding, the reviewing court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment. 401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">One further observation may serve to demonstrate the impracticality of the Agency\u2019s argument that only the procedural aspects of a motor vehicle safety standard are subject to review brought pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1394. Once such a standard has been adopted and becomes effective, the validity of that standard is capable of being placed in issue in litigation in any of a number of ways. For example,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1398 provides for the imposition of sanctions in the form of fines against anyone who manufactures for sale or offers for sale a motor vehicle which does not conform with applicable federal safety standards. An obvious defense in such a prosecution would be the claimed invalidity of the standard and it seems clear, that a previous judicial review limited to an approval of the procedural aspects of the adoption of the standard would not bar the defense. Such a defense might be successful at any judicial level, but the adjudication would almost certainly not be considered final until the Supreme Court had reviewed the issue or had refused to do so. In the interval preceding such final adjudication, which could be a substantial one, a chaotic condition would exist within the industry to the serious detriment of the manufacturers and the public alike, perhaps accompanied by inestimable damages to both. Such a possibility strongly militates against the limitation of review urged by the Agency and supports our determination that it should be here determined whether the standard is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>In summary, the function of this Court is to test the \u201cvalidity\u201d of Standard 208. Although we are not empowered to substitute our judgment as to discretionary decisions made by the Agency, we will look to the underlying record to determine whether a factual basis exists for the Agency\u2019s decisions and to determine whether the statutorily required concise general statement of the Agency\u2019s purpose is properly supported. In order to be valid, Standard 208 must meet all statutorily prescribed criteria, and the Agency must have complied with all applicable procedural requirements. The former are contained in the Automobile Safety Act of 1966 and can be designated as substantive criteria, the latter, contained in the APA, can be designated as procedural requirements, and they can be discussed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The petitioners\u2019 first argument is that the Automobile Safety Act of 1966 does not authorize the Agency to establish a safety standard which requires the improvement of existing technology, and that the Agency may only establish performance requirements which can be met with devices which, at the time of the rulemaking, are developed to the point that they may be readily installed. The Agency\u2019s response is that inasmuch as the technology of airbags is fully developed, and inasmuch as airbags are presently readily available to all manufacturers, this issue is not properly before the Court in this case. The Agency also contends that, even if that were not so, one of the prime purposes of the Act is to require automobile manufacturers to develop safety technology not presently existing.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The explicit purpose of the Act, as amplified in its legislative history, is to enable the Federal government to impel automobile manufacturers to develop and apply new technology to the task of improving the safety design of automobiles as readily as possible.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Senate Report, in a section entitled \u201cPurpose and Need,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">\u201c[T]his legislation reflects the faith that the restrained and responsible exercise of Federal authority can channel the creative energies and vast technology of the automobile industry into a vigorous and competitive effort to improve the safety of vehicles.\u201d S.Rep. 1301, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 U.S.Code, Cong. and Admin.News, 2709 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The same report continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-11\">\u201cWhile the bill reported by the committee authorizes the Secretary to make grants or award contracts for research in certain cases, a principal aim is to encourage the auto industry itself to engage in greater auto safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>and safety-related research.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2718.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">There is no suggestion in the Act that developed technology be in use by an automobile manufacturer or that any given procedure be an established industry practice prior to its incorporation into a federal motor vehicle safety standard. If the Agency were so limited, it would have little discretion to accomplish its primary mission of reducing the deaths and injuries resulting from highway accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In fact, specific efforts by the Automobile Manufacturers Association to tie the rate of innovation imposed by safety standards to the pace of innovation of the manufacturers were rejected by the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the reported bill proposed that safety standards be \u201cpracticable, meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and be stated in objective terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In explaining the purpose of the first of these criteria, the House Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\u201cIn establishing standards the Secretary must conform to the requirement that the standard is practicable. This would include consideration of all relevant factors, including technological ability to achieve the goal of a particular standard as well as consideration of economic factors.\u201d H.R.Rep. 1776, p. 16.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">If the Agency were limited to issuing standards only on the basis of devices already in existence, there would be no need for the Agency to give any consideration to the manufacturers\u2019 technological ability to achieve a stated goal. Under this proposed interpretation, the Agency would be unable to require technological improvements of any kind unless manufacturers voluntarily made these improvements themselves. This is precisely the situation that existed prior to the passage of the Act, and we decline to eviscerate this important legislation by the adoption of this proposed in-terpretion. As it stands, the Act is reasonable, and the power of the Agency to \u201cchannel the creative energies and vast technology of the automobile industry into a vigorous and competitive effort to improve the safety of vehicles\u201d fully meets the need for motor vehicle safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">We do not intend to suggest that the Agency might impose standards so demanding as to require a manufacturer to perform the impossible, or impose standards so imperative as to put a manufae-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>turer out of business. But it is clear from the Act and its legislative history that the Agency may issue standards requiring future levels of motor vehicle performance which manufacturers could not meet unless they diverted more of their resources to producing additional safety technology than they might otherwise do. This distinction is one committed to the Agency\u2019s discretion, and any hardships which might result from the adoption of a standard requiring, as does Standard 208, a great degree of developmental research, can be ameliorated by the Agency under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(c). This section allows the Secretary to extend the effective date beyond the usual statutory maximum of one year from the date of issuance, as he has done with Standard 208. The Senate report, in explaining this section, confirms the conclusions reached above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ary\">\u201cThe power to specify a later effective date is needed because it may be a practical economic and engineering impossibility, as well as a source of great hardship and unnecessary additional cost, to require that all vehicle changes required by any new safety standard, whatever its scope or subject matter, be accomplished by all manufacturers on all their vehicles within 1 year.\u201d S.Rep. 1301, 89th Cong. 2d Sess., 2 U.S.Code., Cong. and Admin.News, 2714 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Similarly, should it develop that, as the time for implementation of federally mandated devices approaches, such devices will require further testing or development, upon a showing to the Agency by the manufacturers or the developers the Agency should again review the matter and decide whether to extend the time for implementation or to alter, or even to abandon, the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In summary, the Agency is empowered to issue safety standards which require improvements in existing technology or which require the development of new technology, and it is not limited to issuing standards based solely on devices already fully developed. This is in accord with the Congressional mandate that \u201csafety shall be the overriding consideration in the issuance of standards.\u201d S.Rep. 1301, 2 U.S.Code, Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2714 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">The petitioners next contend that Standard 208 is not practicable because airbag technology is not, at present, developed to the point where airbags can be installed in all presently manufactured cars. In light of our preceding conclusion, we need not discuss this contention at length. But we will observe that, as the record indicates, many of the development problems with which the petitioners have concerned themselves in their briefs (such as noise, sensor reliability, danger to out of position occupants and effectiveness in certain nonfrontal impact modes), have been eliminated or are presently the subject of continuing development efforts. We need not detail here the immense amount of factual data contained in the record relevant to this issue; suffice it to here observe that present systems demonstrate considerable sophistication over earlier prototypes. In addition, several automobile manufacturers and several airbag developers have expressed a great deal of confidence in their present systems and an equal confidence that present developmental research programs will eliminate any obstacles which may presently remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">For example, General Motors announced in 1970 that final research and development efforts on its airbag system were currently underway, that it was entering the production design stage on those bags, and that it planned to introduce its system on a phased-in schedule so that by the fall of 1974, all 1975 model GM passenger cars and light trucks would have a passive protection system as standard equipment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Eaton has in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>dicated that it has largely eliminated noise as a problem and that it expected, in the near future, to solve the problem of the effect of airbag detonation on a child standing near the dashboard. On October 1, 1971, Irvin Industries stated that it had built a system which met or exceeded all published U.S. government specifications in effect at that time.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Most recently, the Ford Motor Company delivered to the Chairman of the Board of Allstate Insurance Company an automobile equipped with an airbag restraint system for the front seat passenger. This vehicle was the first of a fleet of 200 similarly equipped cars which Allstate has purchased for use by selected employees in a joint field-test of these systems with Ford. While there is some disagreement as to the significance of this event, we do note that the insurance company involved has publicly expressed a large measure of confidence in the reliability and effectiveness of the system as delivered, and in the developmental research program of which this test is a vital part.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Since we have rejected the petitioners\u2019 contention that nonexisting technology may not be the subject of motor vehicle safety standards, and in view of the present state of the art of passive inflatable occupant restraint systems, we conclude that Standard 208 is practicable as that term is used in this legislation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The petitioners contend that Standard 208 does not meet the need for motor vehicle safety because belts offer better protection to occupants than do airbags. The Agency defends the standard by contending that airbags offer better protection to occupants than do belts. The record. supports the conclusion that each type of occupant restraint offers protection in a slightly different form for differing impact situations. Neither is clearly superior to the other in every respect. Consequently, we conclude that the Agency\u2019s decision to abandon active restraints in favor of passive restraints was a proper exercise of its administrative discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Paramount among the Agency\u2019s considerations in deciding to require all occupant restraint systems to be fully passive was the factor of low belt usage. It is uncontested that active restraints are not extensively used. The record indicates that usage rates for lap belts are about 20 to 30%, and for the lap and shoulder harness combination about 1 to 5%; it is projected that devices (or laws) to encourage or to force belt usage will not increase usage rates above 60%. The petitioners\u2019 position is that, if the Agency starts with the proposition that occupants are not now using belts, its consequent course of action should be an effort to increase belt usage through whatever means are available (e. g.: ignition interlocks, compulsory usage laws) rather than to disregard active restraints entirely and require passive protection in all vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">It is conceded that belts, when used, are extremely effective. The conclusive evidence on this point is a study of more than 28,000 accident cases in Sweden which showed that no occupant wearing a combined lap belt and shoulder harness was fatally injured in any accident occurring at speeds below 60 miles per hour.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On the other hand, while belts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>are superior to airbags in some respects, most notably in rollovers and multiple impact situations, airbags have advantages over belts in other equally important respects. For example, airbags spread crash deceleration forces over most of the whole body, while belts concentrate them on the narrow area of the rigid belt. Airbags restrain the body evenly over a greater distance and a longer period of time by permitting occupants who are thrown forward in the crash to ride down the deceleration forces more gradually, over a distance of two or three feet. An airbag system, being passive, removes the elements of the occupants\u2019 will, memory and skill from the consideration of reliability. Furthermore, many people cannot properly use belt systems (e. g.: children under four years of age, persons under 55 inches in height, obese or very smallwaisted persons and pregnant women) and among those who can, there is an inevitable percentage who will not wear them properly. We cite these facts not to advocate belts over airbags or vice versa, but to indicate the myriad factors which must be carefully considered by the Agency in reaching a conclusion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">We conclude that the issue of the relative effectiveness of active as opposed to passive restraints is one which has been duly delegated to the Agency, with its expertise, to make; we find that the Agency\u2019s decision to require passive restraints is supported by substantial evidence, and we cannot say on the basis of the record before us that this decision does not meet the need for motor vehicle safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We now turn to the final major substantive argument presented by the petitioners: that Standard 208 fails to meet the statutorily required criteria of objectivity. The necessity for objective certainty in the performance requirements of safety standards was clearly recognized by Congress in the Safety Act. The Act provides, as noted above, that \u201cstandard [s] shall be practicable, shall meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and shall be stated in objective terms.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(a). These requirements are repeated in the statutory definition of motor vehicle safety standards : \u201c \u2018Motor vehicle safety standards\u2019 means a minimum standard for motor vehicle performance, or motor vehicle equipment performance, which is practicable, which meets the need for motor vehicle safety and which provides objective criteria.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(2). The requirement of objectivity was emphasized in the following statement from the House Report: \u201cIn order to insure that the question of whether there is compliance with the standard can be answered by objective measurements and without recourse to any subjective determination, every standard must be stated in objective terms.\u201d H.R. 1776, 89th Cong. 2d Sess.1966, p. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The importance of objectivity in safety standards cannot be overemphasized. The Act puts the burden upon the manufacturer to assure that his vehicles comply under pain of substantial penalties.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the absence of objectively defined performance requirements and test procedures, a manufacturer has no assurance that his own test results will be duplicated in tests conducted by the Agency. Accordingly, such objective criteria are absolutely necessary so that \u201cthe question of whether there is compliance with the standard can be answered by objective measurement and without recourse to any subjective determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Objective, in the context of this case, means that tests to determine compliance must be capable of producing identical results when test conditions are exactly duplicated, that they be decisively demonstrable by performing a rational test procedure, and that compliance is based upon the readings obtained from measuring instruments as opposed to the subjective opinions of human beings.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Standard 208 requires that compliance be determined by specified tests using an anthropomorphic dummy built to the specifications of SAE Recommended Practice J963, \u201cAnthropomorphic Test Device for Dynamic Testing.\u201d These specifications generally provide for the structural characteristics of the dummy, which is to simulate the basic human body components in size, shape, mass and kinematics. The petitioners contend that this test device will not produce consistent, reliable, or repeatable test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The record supports the conclusions that the test procedures and the test device specified by Standard 208 are not objective in at least the following respects: (1) The absence of an adequate flexibility criteria for the dummy\u2019s neck; the existing specifications permit the neck to be very stiff, or very flexible, or somewhere inbetween, significantly affecting the resultant forces measured on the dummy\u2019s head. (2) Permissible variations in the test procedure for determining thorax dynamic spring rate (force deflection characteristics of the dummy\u2019s chest) permit considerable latitude in chest construction which could produce wide variations in maximum chest deceleration between two different dummies, each of which meets the literal requirements of SAE J963. (3) The absence of specific, objective specifications for construction of the dummy\u2019s head permits significant variation in forces imparted to the accelerometer by which performance is to be measured.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The shortcomings of the test device become understandable, if still not excusable, when one considers the minutes of a May 23, 1971, meeting of the SAE Crash Test Dummy Subcommittee, which are a part of the record in this case. That report points out that since SAE J963 only relates some limited performance specifications for an anthropomorphic test device, it should be used as a guide for specifications of such a device, with considerations given to certain enumerated shortcomings. Further, the report mentions that \u201c[i]t should be noted that the original document [SAE J963] was intended to specify a research tool and, therefore, the document was written in general terms,\u201d and that until more definitive specifications are published, \u201c[t]he subcommittee is of the opinion that SAE Recommended Practice J963 can only be used as a guide rather than as a rigid set of specifications.\u201d The Safety Systems Laboratory (formerly of the office of Vehicle Systems Research, National Bureau of Standards, now of the NHTSA) reported in September of 1971 that SAE J963 is not \u201csufficiently definitive to provide an adequate descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>tion of the dummies\u201d and concluded that \u201cfurther study is necessary to develop standard specifications for an anthropometric crash dummy.\u201d A similar determination was made by the Cornell \u25a0Aeronautical Laboratory, which concluded: \u201cMore complete specification of anthropomorphic dummy characteristics is needed. While it is tentatively concluded that a degree of repeatability is obtainable with existing dummies, the dynamic performance of these devices needs specification designed to insure repeatability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Further recitation of statements from the record that the test procedure and devices of Standard 208 lack objectivity is unnecessary because, interestingly enough, the Agency has never asserted that its test criteria are fully objective. Although the Agency noted, at the time it first proposed the adoption of SAE J963, that these dummy specifications \u201cmay not provide totally reproducible results,\u201d it justified their adoption because they are \u201cevidently the most complete set available at this time.\u201d 35 F. R. 7188. Specific comments were requested from interested parties; comments were submitted by each of the parties to this action.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Agency replied to these comments in Notice 7 by modifying the specifications slightly, but retained the requirement of the SAE J963 dummy, noting only that \u201cdummies conforming to the SAE specifications are the most complete and satisfactory ones presently available.\u201d 35 F.R. 16928. In Notice 9, the Agency again remarked not that the SAE J963 dummy was adequate, but that it was the \u201cbest available,\u201d and that it was sponsoring research in this area and would therefore issue new specifications at some time in the future. Virtually all automobile manufacturers, including each of the present petitioners, submitted petitions for reconsideration to these requirements of Notice 9. General Motors went so far as to supply suggested modifications and additions to the SAE J963 test device specifications which it felt were necessary before a device would provide consistent test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Finally, the Agency conceded in its most recent official pronouncement on the subject, Notice 12, that the specifications contained in SAE J963 \u201cdo not completely define all the characteristics of the dummies that may be relevant to their (and the vehicle\u2019s) performance in a crash test.\u201d 36 F.R. 19255. That notice, however, retains the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The Agency makes two responses to the attacks upon the standard\u2019s lack of objectivity. First, it contends that the incompleteness of the dummy device is not fatal to the standard because it has assured the manufacturers that specifications for a suitable test device will be issued in the future.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We do not think it necessary to dwell upon the obvious inadequacy of this response because it seems to us axiomatic that a manufacturer cannot be required to develop an effective restraint device in the absence of an effective testing device which will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>assure uniform, repeatable and consistent test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The Agency\u2019s second response is that it has assured the manufacturers that their position with regard to compliance will not be jeopardized by the variances in the test device. The Agency\u2019s solution to the problem was set out in Notice 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">\u201cIf the NHTSA concludes after investigation that a manufacturer\u2019s tests are properly conducted, with dummies meeting the specifications, and show compliance with the standard, and that differences in results from tests conducted by the agency are due to differences in the test dummies used by each, the Agency tests will not be considered to be the basis for a finding of noncompliance.\u201d 36 F.R. 19255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">This statement is illusory. This test allows as many as three subjective judgments to be made by the Agency, including the ultimate determination of whether the differences in results from tests conducted by the Agency are due to differences in the test dummies used by each. As noted above, objectivity requires that each essential element of compliance be made by specified measuring instruments; there is no room for an \u201cagency investigation\u201d in this procedure. The inherent uncertainty of this procedure is no substitute for the specification of an adequate test device, especially in light of the Agency\u2019s power to specify such a device. As the Agency noted in Notice 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\u201c[S]ince the dummy is merely a test instrument and not an item of regulated equipment, it is not necessary to describe it in performance terms; its design could legally be \u2018frozen\u2019 by detailed, blueprint-type drawings and complete equipment specifications.\u201d 36 F.R. 19255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">While we have concluded that automobile manufacturers can (and should) be compelled by automobile safety standards to develop new safety devices, we hold that the performance goals which they must meet must be clearly delineated by the Agency. That is to say, while they can be required to develop a new device not presently existing, we do not think that they can (or should) simultaneously be required to develop a testing device by which the safety device is to be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The Amicus Center for Auto Safety cautions that if we were to hold that the standard is invalid because the test procedures are not objective we would be allowing \u201cthe tail to wag the dog.\u201d We think that the Center has misapprehended the anatomy of the animal. The Act requires the Agency to issue performance standards, which a manufacturer must then meet by any system of hardware it chooses. It is clear from a reading of the Act and its legislative history that the performance standards (injury criteria and test procedures) are in fact the \u201cdog\u201d to which a manufacturer is free to attach the tail of its choosing. To rule otherwise would be to permit the Agency to establish a \u201cproduct standard\u201d requiring airbags, without requiring it to establish adequate, objective and repeatable test procedures by which a manufacturer\u2019s airbags can be measured, by it or by the Agency, for compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Since we find that the dummy as specified is inadequate for the testing purposes for which it is designated, we do not find it necessary to pass upon the petitioners\u2019 contention that the dummy is a poor predictor of human response; nor do we reach their contention that the standard is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">The petitioner Automobile Importers of America<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Standard 208 effectively eliminates convertibles and sports cars from production because these types of cars are inherently incapable of meeting the injury criteria of the standard. At issue is the question of whether the standard violates 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(f)(3) which provides that \u201cIn prescribing standards under this section, the Secretary shall . . . consider whether any such proposed standard is . . . appropriate for the particular type of motor vehicle . . . for which it is prescribed.\u201d The implications of this section that safety standards shall take into consideration different classes of vehicles, such as small cars, sports cars, or convertibles, and that standards shall not be used as a device to bring about their extinction, is made clear from the Act\u2019s legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201c[I]n determining whether any proposed standard is \u2018appropriate\u2019 for the particular type of motor-vehicle equipment or item of motor-vehicle equipment for which it is prescribed, the committee intends that the Secretary will consider the desirability of affording consumers continued wide range of choices in the selection of motor vehicles. Thus it is not intended that standards will be set which will eliminate or necessarily be the same for small cars or such widely accepted models as convertibles and sports cars, so long as all motor vehicles meet basic minimum standards. Such differences, of course, would be based on the type of vehicle rather than its place of origin or any special circumstances of its manufacturer.\u201d S.Rept. 1301, 2 U.S.Code, Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 2714 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Congressman Springer observed in the House debate that \u201c [i] t is not the intention to deprive the public of cars by outlawing types and models. . . . [This legislation] avoids imposing on the buying public a complete standardization to humdrum, dreary vehicles.\u201d 112 Cong.Rec. 19630-31 (1966). The Act clearly contemplates the continued production of sports cars and convertibles.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">The special difficulties facing soft top convertibles and sports cars become obvious upon reflection. For example, Standard 208 requires a rollover test throughout which all portions of the test dummy must remain contained within the outer surfaces of the vehicle passenger compartment (j[ S 5.3 and ff S 6.-1). The comments submitted to the Agency by virtually every automobile manufacturer indicate that a considerable difficulty is being encountered with this requiremnt for vehicles with fixed steel tops because of the tendency of the roof to rupture or be punctured which, when combined with the centrifugal force operating on the dumipy during the rollover, will allow the hands and arms to raise over the dummy\u2019s head and extend beyond the vehicle body perimeter.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">While sufficient reinforcement should solve the problem currently being experienced with the hard top vehicles, it is obvious that a soft top convertible is inherently incapable of passing such a rigid requirement. It seems equally obvious that while the purchaser of a fixed roof automobile should expect some measure of protection from that roof, (perhaps expecting more than he is currently obtaining) owners of convertibles would not be disappointed to find that they are being afforded less protection in this area. Other problems inherent to convertibles and sports cars have been brought to the Agency\u2019s attention by several automobile manufacturers, do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>mestic and foreign, but little if any agency action has been taken in response to these comments. This lack of response is surprising in view of the Agency\u2019s obligation to afford such vehicles special consideration, as detailed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Accordingly, this issue is remanded to the Agency for further consideration without prejudice to the petitioner\u2019s right to resubmit this issue to this Court for review after the Agency has been afforded an opportunity to amend Standard 208 so that it does not in fact serve to eliminate convertibles and sports cars from the United States new car market.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The petitioners\u2019 principal procedural arguments can be consolidated into the assertion that the Agency has acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irresponsibly and unlawfully by requiring manufacturers to comply with Standard 208 by a fixed date while it has consistently been issuing a rapid succession of final orders, each of which has been incomplete in several significant respects, (several have been coupled with proposed rulemaking to fill in missing parts), thereby constantly changing the basic requirements of the standard (performance criteria and test procedures), and more proposed changes are still pending. The Agency\u2019s response is that its actions in this regard reflect the extreme flexibility which is the very purpose of delegated rulemaking authority. We agree. The Safety Act gives the Secretary the authority \u201cto issue, amend, and revoke such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out [the Act].\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407. This broad delegation of rulemaking authority allows the Agency to amend its safety standards in those complex and technical respects which are brought to its attention as a result of petitions for reconsideration filed by \u201cinterested persons.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In this way the Act contemplates that a safety standard might evolve through a series of industry-suggested and agency-adopted amendments, as has been done in this case. This procedure is consistent with one of the central purposes of the Act that the automobile industry be encouraged to develop new and improved safety technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">It is equally important to note that almost all of the changes in the requirements of which the petitioners complain were made as a result of comments or petitions for reconsideration submitted to the Agency by the petitioners themselves, and these amendments to the standard generally have relaxed the requirements or have extended the date of implement\u00e1tion to provide the manufacturers with additional leadtime, or to conform the date of implementation with the traditional date of the annual model changeover. These petitioners cannot be heard to complain that the Agency has constantly revised its standard when those changes were initiated by these very petitioners. We find no irregularities in the procedure utilized by the Agency in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Finally, the petitioners contend that the Agency has acted unlawfully in compiling the record which has been submitted to this Court. Specifically, they contend that substantial relevant materials were not placed on the docket of the proceeding or otherwise made available to interested parties until after petitions for review were filed in this Court. The petitioners\u2019 position is that this has prejudiced them by depriving them of an opportunity to comment upon these materials prior to the issuance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>standard in that this procedure violated the Agency\u2019s expressed policy of placing \u201call technical material, not routinely available through other sources, supporting or otherwise relating to proposed safety standards\u201d in the record. (Notice 4, 35 F.R. 7188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We have examined the materials of which the petitioners complain, and we find that the late submission of this material (if in fact it was not timely submitted), did not serve to prejudice the petitioners in this case. The materials to which the petitioners refer consist principally of monthly progress reports from ongoing research projects conducted under the direction of the Agency in accordance with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395. Prior to the filing of the petitions for review in this case, the Agency placed in its general reference section of its file a research input memorandum which contained a list of the projects then in progress.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> After these materials were docketed, several petitioners submitted comments to the Agency in response to these materials. These comments were therefore before the Agency when it issued Notice 12, and the petitioners have not alleged that the Agency failed to consider these comments in the issuance of this notice. Therefore, in that the petitioners were not prejudiced by the Agency\u2019s manner of compiling the record,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> we do not reach the issue of whether substantial irregularities did in fact occur in the compiling of the record which is before this Court. Similarly, we do not reach a determination of whether or not the Agency\u2019s announced policy rises to the level of a \u201cprocedural regulation\u201d as is contended by the petitioners, although we express some doubt in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">We have considered the petitioners\u2019 remaining arguments and find either that they have been effectively answered by the conclusions reached above or that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">We conclude that Paragraph S 8.1.8 of Standard 208 which requires the use of the anthropomorphic test device as defined in SAE Recommended Practice J963 to be invalid; the remaining portions of the standard which do not depend for their effectiveness upon Paragraph S 8.1.8 are valid and remain in effect. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.9.

This is not to imply that the Agency is prohibited from issuing this type of standard, in certain instances, if it wishes to.

This section identifies three substantive restrictions upon each motor vehicle safety standard promulgated pursuant to the Act which are repeated in the definition section characterizing a motor vehicle safety standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">\u201c \u2018Motor vehicle safety standards\u2019 means a minimum standard for motor vehicle performance, or motor vehicle equipment performance, which is practicable, which meets the need for motor vehicle safety and which provides objective criteria.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Since only the third of the statutory requirements by which a motor vehicle safety standard is to be judged is in issue at this point, it deserves repeating that these sections speak only of a motor vehicle safety standard and do not mention compliance testing: \u201cEach such Federal motor vehicle safety standard shall be stated in objective <em>terms.\u201d </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(a). [Emphasis added]. \u201c \u2018Motor vehicle safety standards\u2019 means a minimum standard for motor vehicle performance, or motor vehicle equipment performance . which provides objective <em>criteria.\u201d </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(2) [Emphasis added]. Both these sections utilize the same terminology except that \u00a7 1391(2) uses the word \u201ccriteria\u201d while \u00a7 1392(a) uses the word \u201cterms.\u201d Consequently, it must be determined whether Congress in using the word \u201ccriteria\u201d in \u00a7 1391(2) expanded the requirement of objectivity to apply to more than just a motor vehicle safety standard and therefore intended that the objectivity test should be applicable to compliance testing devices and procedures as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">Webster defines \u201ccriterion\u201d as \u201ca standard on which a decision or judgment may be based; ... a standard of reference. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cTerm\u201d is defined by Webster as \u201ca word or expression that has a precisely limited meaning in some uses or is peculiar to a science, art, profession, trade, or special subject.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> From these definitions of the two words it does not appear that any significant difference was intended by Congress.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> From a reading of the statutory text alone, it would appear that the requirement of objectivity applies only to a motor vehicle safety standard. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">Further support for this position is provided by the language of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>1396 which specifically separates and distinguishes these two concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The Secretary is authorized to advise, assist, and cooperate with, other Federal departments and agencies, and State and other interested public and private agencies, in the planning' and development of\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">(1) <em>motor vehicle safety standards ;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\"><em>(2) methods for inspecting and testing to determine compliance with motor vehicle safety standards. </em>[Emphasis added]<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In light of the fact that Congress was demonstrably cognizant of a difference between \u201cmotor vehicle safety standards\u201d and \u201cmethods for inspecting and testing to determine compliance with motor vehicle safety standards,\u201d and in \u00a7\u00a7 1391(2) and 1392(a) chose only the words \u201cmotor vehicle safety standards\u201d when enumerating the substantive requirements by which such standards were to be judged, the proper interpretation of the Act would clearly appear to be that the objectivity requirement applies only to \u201cmotor vehicle safety standards\u201d and does not mandate this requirement for testing devices or procedures. My understanding of Judge Peck\u2019s position is that these two clearly delineated statutory concepts are inseparable in all cases involving motor vehicle safety standards. I am in basic disagreement with this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">In the context of Standard 208, the clear delineation provided by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 between a motor vehicle safety standard and a compliance testing device and procedure is blurred because of the form in which this Standard was issued. Standard 208 specifies performance requirements for a passive restraint system which must protect vehicle occupants in the event of a destructive crash. The Standard establishes basic injury criteria with reference to an anthropomorphic test device conforming to the requirements of SAE Recommended Practice J963, expressed in terms of maximum forces and pressures on critical parts of the body. Three vehicle crash modes \u2014 frontal, longitudinal and rollover \u2014 are prescribed in which a vehicle is required to meet the injury criteria. It is important to recognize at this point that two technologies are involved, in considering this case. First, that of the passive restraint system, which for all practical purposes is the airbag, and second, that of the anthropomorphic test device (dummy). The use of dummies as compliance test instruments and not living persons needs no explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">In my opinion, since compliance testing is a separate and distinct statutory concept the form in which this Standard was issued does not preclude separating the injury criteria (the actual motor vehicle safety standard) from the compliance test device. If this is not done, then an unnecessary conflict with the language of the Act and its legislative history arises. The Act makes it clear that motor vehicle safety standards are to be \u201cperformance\u201d standards and consequently must be stated in performance terms: \u201c \u2018Motor vehicle safety standards\u2019 means a minimum standard for motor vehicle <em>performance, </em>or motor vehicle equipment <em>performance. . . </em>.\u201d15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(2) [Empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>sis added].<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the language of the Act leaves any doubt as to this proposition, all doubt is removed by the legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">There is no reference anywhere in the definitions to the concept of \u201cdesign.\u201d Rather, the definitions, and this bill have been written in terms of requiring standards of motor vehicle and equipment performance. The Secretary would not become directly involved in questions of design.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">H.R. Rep. No. 1776, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1966).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">Unlike the General Services Administration\u2019s procurement standards, which are primarily design specifications, both the interim standards and the new and revised standards are expected to be performance standards, specifying the required minimum safe performance of vehicles but not the manner in which the manufacturer is to achieve the specified performance .

No. 1301, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 U.S.Code, Cong. and Admin.News, 2713-14 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The majority opinion, however, rests on the assumption that practically and conceptually no distinction or separation is possible between motor vehicle safety standards and compliance testing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To do so, it is inferred, would create an irrational situation where the Agency demands that the automobile industry develop an innovative passive restraint system (airbag) without providing it with the means to test such system dur-. ing the developmental process to see if in fact it is properly progressing and in the end has adequately complied.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus the two concepts of a motor vehicle safety standard and compliance testing are merged in the majority\u2019s initial discussion of the statutory requirement of objectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">In the absence of objectively defined ^ <em>performance requirements and test procedures, </em>a manufacturer has no assurance that his own test results will be duplicated in tests conducted by the Agency. Accordingly, such <em>objective criteria </em>are absolutely necessary so that \u201cthe question of whether there is compliance with the standard can be answered by objective measurement and without recourse to any subjective determination.\u201d [Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b746-15\">By combining \u201cperformance requirements\u201d <em>and </em>\u201ctest procedures,\u201d all under the heading \u201cobjective criteria,\u201d the opinion expands the meaning of the statutory word \u201ccriteria\u201d used in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(2) to be broader than the statutory word \u201cterms\u201d used in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(a),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> concluding that the objectivity requirement applies to compliance testing.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The result is that for pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>poses of judging whether this Standard is objective the opinion finds the two concepts of motor vehicle safety standards and compliance testing to be inseparable.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">However, there is then created an inconsistency in the majority\u2019s position in explaining the necessity for motor vehicle safety standards to be issued in performance terms. The opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUA\">The inherent uncertainty of this procedure is no substitute for the specification of an adequate test device, especially in light of the Agency\u2019s <em>power </em>to specify such a device. As the Agency noted in Notice 12:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">\u201c[S]ince the dummy is merely a test instrument and not an item of regulated equipment, it is not necessary to describe it in performance terms; its design could legally be \u2018frozen\u2019 by detailed, blueprint-type drawings and complete equipment spec drawings and complete equipment specifications.\u201d [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaD\">By employing the word \u201cpower\u201d and quoting with approval the Agency\u2019s statement, the opinion apparently recognizes the distinction that motor vehicle safety standards and any later compliance testing are separable concepts. In effect then, the opinion separates the two for purposes of considering the performance requirement but ignores this factor when applying the objectivity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The anthropomorphic test device referred to in Standard 208, it should be observed, is specified in design terms, not performance terms.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>recognizes this fact and correctly justifies its position by impliedly making the differentiation between motor vehicle safety standards and compliance testing devices.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The opinion disregards what the Agency in fact has done and remands the case to the Agency to issue further specifications for the compliance test instrument. Since the Act makes clear that motor vehicle safety standards are distinct from methods for inspecting and testing to determine compliance with motor vehicle safety standards, that the statutory requirement of objectivity applies only to motor vehicle safety standards, and since the Agency has impliedly recognized these facts in Standard 208, in my opinion, it is a mistake to apply the objectivity test to the compliance test instrument (dummy).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The Act does not define \u201cobjective\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but the House and Senate Committee Reports indicate what was meant by this word. The House Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">In order to insure that the question of whether there is compliance with the standard can be answered by objective <em>measurement </em>and without recourse to any subjective determination, every standard must be stated in objective terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">H.R.Rep. No. 1776, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1966) [Emphasis added]. The Senate Report, by incorporating an example states: \u201cThe Secretary would thus be concerned with the <em>measurable </em>performance of a braking system, but not its design details.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1801, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 U.S.Code, Cong. and Admin.News, 2714 (1966) [Emphasis added]. Since both these Reports use a derivative of the word \u201cmeasure\u201d in referring to a motor vehicle safety standard, the word \u201cobjective\u201d in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391(2) and 1392(a) means that a motor vehicle safety standard is to be prescribed in quantitative or measurable terms \u2014 as opposed to qualitative terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">The majority opinion in defining \u201cobjective\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-13\">Objective, in the context of this case, means that tests to determine compliance must be capable of producing identical results when test conditions are exactly duplicated, that they be decisively demonstrable by performing a rational test procedure, and that compliance is based upon the readings obtained from measuring instruments as opposed to the subjective opinions of human beings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">This expansive definition, in my opinion, is much broader than is necessary to decide this case and consequently should be avoided for several reasons. First, the opinion\u2019s statement supposedly limiting its definition of the word \u201cobjective\u201d to \u201cthe context of this case\u201d is unrealistic. Since this word is statutory language it cannot have a meaning all its own for this particular case, but rather must have a definition which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>applicable to all cases arising under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391(2) and 1392(a). Second, from this definition the opinion implies that the Agency has an affirmative duty to prescribe, contemporaneously with the issuance of a motor vehicle safety standard, a fully pre-developed compliance testing device. In my opinion, a proper construction of the Act only places a duty on the Agency to delineate a motor vehicle safety standard which is capable of measurement and not necessarily a compliance test instrument and procedure at 'the time the standard is promulgated.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> To avoid this unwarranted implication which makes the opinion\u2019s definition broader than is necessary to decide this case, the word \u201cobjective\u201d should be defined to mean \u201cmeasurable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Although the opinion does not specifically deal with the petitioners\u2019 objection to the rollover requirement of Standard 208, this objection illustrates the danger of such a broad definition of the word. The first injury criterion of Standard 208 requires that all portions of any test device must be contained within the vehicle passenger compartment throughout the vehicle rollover procedure. This requirement anticipates measurement by visual inspection. In my view it is stated in objective terms since it may be measured by the eye, but under the opinion\u2019s definition of objective even this injury criterion is invalid because conformance would not be \u201cbased upon the readings obtained from measuring instruments. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">I am in disagreement with Judge Peck\u2019s conclusion that the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 places the sole burden of developing compliance test devices and procedures upon the Agency <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and the underlying assumption upon which this conclusion is based: that a prerequisite to the issuance of a motor vehicle safety standard is a fully pre-developed compliance test device and procedure.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Neither of these views is supportable by the language of the Act nor its legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The sweeping Congressional plan to \u201creduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> invests broad discretionary powers in the Agency in order to implement this legislative purpose. The aim of this Congressional enactment, evidenced by its language and history, is to create a scheme whereby the federal government, acting through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, could compel the automobile industry to develop and apply new technology to improve the safety of motor vehicles as rapidly as possible.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The primary means to see this intention to fruition is the promulgation by the Agency of federal motor vehicle safety standards requiring the development and application of new safety technology for motor vehicles.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">[T]his legislation reflects the faith that the restrained and responsible exercise of Federal authority can chan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>nel the creative energies and vast technology of the automobile industry into a vigorous and competitive effort to improve the safety of vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">S.Rep. No. 1301, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 U.S.Code, Cong. and Admin.News, 2709 (1966). This same Report continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anj\">[A] principal aim is to encourage the auto industry itself to engage in greater auto safety and safety-related research.

Further, the language of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1392(c), 1392(e) and 1407 giving the Agency the power to amend or revoke motor vehicle safety standards and determine when they are to be implemented, unequivocally demonstrates the Congressional intention of immediately allowing the public to benefit from newly developed technology in automobile safety and safety-related research. As stated in the Senate Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">The power to specify a later effective date is needed because it may be a practical economic and engineering impossibility, as well as a source of great hardship and unnecessary additional cost, to require that all vehicle changes required by any new safety standard, whatever its scope or subject matter, be accomplished by all manufacturers for all their new vehicles within 1 year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">S.Rep. No. 1301, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 U.S.Code, Cong. and Admin.News, 2714-15 (1966). Yet in the face of this Congressional plan the majority stops short.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Judge Peck specifically finds in Part III of the opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvHn\">the Agency is empowered to issue safety standards which require improvements in existing technology or which require the development of new technology, and it is not limited to issuing standards based solely on devices already fully developed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">I fully concur with this result. However, Part IV of the opinion holds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHzB\">while they [the automobile industry] can be required to develop a new device not presently existing, we do not think that they can (or should) simultaneously be required to develop a testing device by which the safety device is to be measured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">I disagree with this view for, as I have indicated, the Act does not comport with such an interpretation. Since this legislation encompasses the development of new technology by the automobile manufacturers, there is no rational objection for requiring the development or refinement of new testing devices and procedures by the automotive industry as part of its development of technological advances in motor vehicle safety.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Therefore, I conclude that the Agency does not have the sole burden of developing the anthropomorphic test instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">If the statutory concepts of motor vehicle safety standards and compliance testing are not separated, the effect is substantially to undermine the legislative scheme. Under the majority\u2019s view in a case such as this where there are two technologies involved \u2014 that of the passive restraint system (airbag) and that of the anthropomorphic test instrument (dummy) \u2014 the development of the airbag must await the full development of the compliance test device. My view is that it puts the cart before the horse to require a completely pre-developed testing device and procedure as a prerequisite to promulgating an objective motor vehicle safety standard. The purpose of compliance testing (in this case the use of the dummy) is to allow the Agency to determine whether some technical mechanism developed by an automobile manufacturer and installed in a motor vehicle (in this case an airbag) conforms to the previously issued, objectively stated motor vehicle safety standard (in this case the injury criteria).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The reason for requiring an objective standard is to permit the Agency to measure whether the injury criteria have been met once the airbag is fully developed to avoid as much as possible subjective Agency determinations and protect the manufacturer from arbitrary Agency actions. The purpose of compliance testing is <em>not </em>to shortcut the industry\u2019s research efforts in developing the airbag by providing it with the means to test such system during the developmental stage to see if in fact it is properly progressing. The legislative history clearly indicates that the federal government is to contribute to the development of new technology for motor vehicle safety but the primary burden was deliberately placed on the auto industry by Congress. It misconceives this legislative scheme as well as the nature of research to require a pre-developed testing technique for a yet undeveloped technical device required by a motor vehicle safety standard.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> New testing procedures progress only as they are needed by advancing technology and to deny the Agency (and consequently the motoring public) the advantage of picking and choosing among the best of newly developed testing devices and procedures is unwarranted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">The Act states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">The Secretary is authorized to advise, assist and cooperate with . private agencies, in the planning and development of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">(2) methods for inspecting and testing to determine compliance with motor vehicle safety standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This section mentions nothing concerning the simultane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ous issuance of compliance testing procedures with motor vehicle safety standards nor is such an intention found in any other section of the Act or in its legislative history. If, as the opinion states, the sole burden is on the Agency to develop the compliance test instrument then the statutory words in 15 U. S.C. \u00a7 1396 that the Agency is to \u201cassist and cooperate\u201d do not mean what they say.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Also it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the most potent weapon in the Agency\u2019s arsenal to achieve motor vehicle safety is its power, conferred by the Act, to compel the industry to develop new technology through the issuance of motor vehicle safety standards. Yet, if the rational of the majority is adopted, industry is in effect relieved from the responsibility of developing a concomitant part of new automotive safety technology since without a previously developed testing device and procedure the Agency is powerless to press industry toward this end. Where, as in this case, two distinct technologies are involved, the simultaneous development of both on the part of industry would appear to go hand in hand and indeed compliment one another. As stated in Judge Peck\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">the Agency is empowered to issue safety standards which require improvements in existing technology or which require the development of new technology, and it is not limited to issuing standards based solely on devices already fully developed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">Contrary to Judge Peck\u2019s analysis, as I construe the Act, this applies not only to a safety standard requiring the development of the airbag but also to compliance testing devices such as the anthropomorphic test dummy.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">As stated, the Agency has broad discretionary powers under the Act limited only by the substantive requirements 'of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392. The Agency, by going ahead in Standard 208 and detailing a compliance test instrument commensurate with the present state-of-the-art does not change the result. As I read this legislation, the Agency has no duty simultaneously to issue compliance test devices and procedures when promulgating a motor vehicle safety standard although it does have the discretionary power to do so as it has done in this instance.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The recommended test instrument in Standard 208 is the best available at this time.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Agency in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>prescribing this device and sponsoring research on it<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> is fulfilling its research responsibility under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395. The only statutory duty imposed on the Agency is to insure that within a reasonable time prior to the effective date of this standard the industry is informed as to the complete specifications of the compliance test instrument to be used by the Agency. The reasonableness of this time period must take into account the myriad factors which only the Agency, not this Court, has the expertise to determine. The industry can be required by the Agency to help develop compliance test devices and procedures and the Agency may capitalize on industry\u2019s private efforts. As anthropomorphic test device technology progresses the Agency may refine the instrument to be used in its final compliance tests<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> but to require it to do more than the present state-of-the-art allows is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The injury criteria (the actual motor vehicle safety standard) of Standard 208 clearly meet the statutory requirement of objectivity since they are capable of measurement. Therefore, Standard 208 is not invalid as the majority concludes in Part VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">It follows from the foregoing that the proceeding should not be remanded to the Agency.

At this point the opinion uses the word \u201cstandards\u201d whereas in the language quoted earlier it uses the word \u201cgoals.\u201d Evidently the same meaning is intended.

The majority opinion relies on a statement in the House Report to support its conclusion that the objectivity requirement applies to any compliance testing instrument as well as the motor vehicle safety standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">In order to insure that the question of whether there is compliance with the standard can be answered by objective measurements and without recourse to any subjective determination, every standard must be stated in objective terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">At best, this statement is inconclusive to support the position taken in the opinion. This comment merely states that a <em>motor vehicle safety standard </em>must be prescribed in objective terms in order to permit later compliance testing by quantitative measuring processes instead of subjective human judgments. The House Committee Report mentions nothing concerning a requirement of objective statement for compliance testing. The quoted statement may be relied upon to support the conclusion reached in the opinion only if it is construed to mean: First, that a necessary requisite of an objectively stated motor vehicle safety standard is an equally objectively stated testing procedure; and second, that an essential prerequisite of an objective motor vehicle safety standard under this legislation is a contemporaneously issued, completely pre-developed compliance testing device or procedure. (This latter contention is fully developed in Part III of my dissent).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">Of course to achieve scientific results any compliance testing instrument or procedure would necessarily have to be reasonable, rational and have some degree of objectivity inherent in it, but this is a separate question from the objectivity of the motor vehicle safety standard itself. Since we are dealing with the English language in construing the Act, it must be admitted we start with an imprecise measuring tool. However, objectivity is relative in the sense that there are varying degrees of this word. Therefore, a given objective motor vehicle safety standard may bo judged by a testing procedure which is somewhat less objective than the standard itself. This, however, neither affects the initial objectivity of the safety standard nor makes the testing procedure unreasonable or irrational. In such a case the compliance testing may still produce valid results.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">Ender an analysis which would not differentiate between a motor vehicle safety standard and compliance testing (as set forth in the majority opinion), this contingency would require that the whole motor vehicle safety standard be invalidated or alternatively, that a double definition of the word \u201cobjective\u201d be employed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b747-16\">. Of course under the Act, the Agency does have the responsibility of issuing compliance test procedures within a reasonable time before the effective date of a motor vehicle safety standard (See Part III of my dissent), but in this case the issuance of performance standards for a compliance test dummy would provide no assistance to the petitioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b748-9\">. Although the opinion quotes from Notice 12 a more complete extraction is illustrative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">It would actually be difficult, if not impossible to describe the test dummy in performance terms with such specificity that every dummy that could be built to the specifications would perform identically under similar conditions. Of course, since the dummy is merely a tost instrument and not an item of regulated equipment, it is not necessary to describe it in performance terms; its design could legally be \u201cfrozen\u201d by detailed blueprint-type drawings and complete equipment specifications. Such an action does not, however, appear to be desirable at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-15\">36 Fed.Reg. 19255 (1971). This shows that the Agency recognizes the distinction between motor vehicle safety standards and compliance testing. Compliance testing devices and procedures do not have to meet the performance requirement of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(1) and (2) nor do they have to meet the objectivity requirement of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391(2) and 1392(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-16\">Also implicit in this statement is the recognition of the broad discretionary powers vested by the Act in the Agency concerning compliance testing. <em>Infra, </em>note 36 and accompanying text.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b748-17\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391(2) and 1392(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b749-11\">. <em>See </em>Part III of ray dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b749-12\">. <em>Supra, </em>note 5 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b749-13\">. <em>Supra, </em>note 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b749-14\">. 15 TT.S.C. \u00a7 1381.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b749-15\">.
