Byrne, Senior United' States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1261-27\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1261-28\">This Selective Service case has returned to this court following remand for further testimony in the district court. Wallace v. United States, 403 U.S. 902, 91 S.Ct. 2211, 29 L.Ed.2d 678 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>(1971), vacating United States v. Wallace, 435 F.2d 12 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">In what he termed an \u201cact of solidarity,\u201d Wallace participated in a symbolic surrender of Selective Service cards in 1967. Shortly thereafter, his local board reviewed his classification and decided that Wallace was no longer eligible for an occupational deferment (Class II-A). Wallace and his employer filed timely appeals, but the appeal board upheld the determination of the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Pursuant to the remand, the district court offered the government the opportunity to rebut the inference that Wallace had been deprived of the occupational deferment as a punitive measure discountenanced in Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed.2d 532 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">The members of the appeal board had no recollection of the case independent of the Selective Service file. Wallace\u2019s file contained a letter from the acting state director suggesting that the local board consider declaring Wallace and certain other registrants delinquents \u201cby reason of their failure to have in their possession registration certificates and valid classification cards\u201d and accelerating their induction into the armed forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">In our previous opinion we held that procedural errors allegedly committed by the local board had been cured by the de novo review of the appeal board, but we did not consider the import of the acting director\u2019s letter. See United States v. Wallace, supra. Where the record shows that the appeal board may have been guided by legally erroneous official recommendations, the government must prove that the proceedings were free from the taint of impropriety. Clay v. United States, 403 U.S. 698, 704, 91 S.Ct. 2068, 29 L.Ed.2d 810 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">The testimony by the appeal-board members as to how they now think they would have reacted to Wallace\u2019s file is inherently speculative. The danger of post hoc rationalization makes this kind of testimony little better than pure guesswork. Without definitive testimony as to what, in fact, did transpire when the appeal board convened to evaluate Wallace\u2019s appeal, we are unable to say with the requisite certainty that the improper suggestion of the acting state director played no part in the appeal board\u2019s deliberations. A proper concern for \u201cthe integrity of the Selective Service System,\u201d 403 U.S. at 704, 91 S.Ct. at 2072, therefore requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
