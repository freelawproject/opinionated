Walker, pled guilty in Georgia state court to charges of murder and robbery, resulting in a life sentence and a concurrent 20-year sentence. In 1968, he filed a Georgia state habeas corpus petition alleging three grounds (which are not at issue in this habeas petition), and during a hearing said in testimony about his counsel: (1) \u201che tell me one thing, and when it comes out, it\u2019s another\u201d; and (2) \u201cwhen they appoint you a lawyer, well, he don\u2019t really take full interest in the case anyway, just to get you out of the way.\u201d Now the petitioner is contending that what he meant is (1) that he thought only a 20-year sentence would result from a guilty plea (instead of the life and concurrent 20-year sentence), so the plea was involuntary; and (2) that he was represented by ineffective counsel. In the 1968 habeas case the state district judge ruled that petitioner was represented by effective counsel (even though that question was not raised in the petitioner\u2019s complaint). Walker filed another state habeas petition raising substantially the same issues as this petition, but it was returned to him \u201cwithout sanction\u201d for the reason of being repetitious. The Georgia Supreme Court refused to docket Walker\u2019s \u201cWrit of Review of Habeas Corpus.\u201d Then the federal district judge ruled on the merits that the \u201cGeorgia court has conducted a full and impartial hearing squarely into the merits of petitioner\u2019s application.\u201d Accordingly, he denied any further hearing and denied habeas relief. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">First, the state habeas hearing was inadequate for the reason that no meaningful hearing was held on the allegations raised in the present complaint. Second, while the state court ruled on the adequacy of counsel, the court did not rule on the voluntariness of the plea (since at no time did petitioner in the first habeas case specifically allege that he expected only a 20-year sentence). Petitioner has exhausted his state court remedies on these two allegations by virtue of the later state habeas effort. The federal district judge is obliged to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of adequacy of counsel and vol-untariness of plea raised in the present complaint. <em>See </em>Dixon v. Caldwell, 5 Cir., 1972, 471 F.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
