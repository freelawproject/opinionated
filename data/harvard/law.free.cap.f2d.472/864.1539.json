The district court (Judge Larson), 350 F.Supp. 853, retained jurisdiction by denying appellants\u2019 motion for dismissal. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">We take our facts from the allegations of the complaint and unopposed affidavits filed in the action. In essence, plaintiff, Schulman, states that he originated an idea for a float mechanism to be used on pontoons for boats. On a confidential basis, Schulman disclosed the nature of his invention to defendants Solar Plastics, Inc., Solar\u2019s president, Donald Ber-quist, and one Richard Reynolds, for the purpose of arranging for the incorporation of this invention into the production and manufacture of pontoon boats. He advised the three defendants of his intention to apply for a patent. Schulman claims that these defendants formed a new corporation, Huck Finn, Inc., also a defendant in this action, and that all of said defendants conspired to deprive Schulman of the benefits of his invention, for which he subsequently received a patent on October 26, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">Schulman claimed damages and other relief against all defendants for patent infringement in Count I and for unfair competition through misappropriation of trade secrets in Count II. The district court, on motion, dismissed the patent infringement claim against defendants Solar and Berquist on the basis of affidavits showing that Solar had sold its boat production facilities to defendant Huck Finn and ceased producing and selling pontoons or pontoon boats prior to the date of the issuance of the patent to Schulman. The district court, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>denied the further motion by Solar and Berquist asking dismissal of the remaining unfair competition claim for want of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Thus, in its posture before us, Schul-man\u2019s complaint alleges claims for both patent infringement and unfair competition against defendants Reynolds and Huck Finn, Inc., but a claim only for unfair competition against defendants Solar Plastics, Inc. and Berquist. Solar Plastics and Berquist, excepting to the court\u2019s ruling, sought and received permission to appeal under \u00a7 1292(b) challenging the district court\u2019s assertion of federal jurisdiction over the unfair competition claim against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">The issue is one of first impression in this circuit. Section 1338(b) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-6\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action asserting a claim of unfair competition when joined with a substantial and related claim under the copyright, patent, plant variety protection or trademark laws. [28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1338(b) (Supp. 1972), amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Appellants contend that the statutory language permits joinder of nonfederal claims only against parties against whom a \u201crelated\u201d federal claim has been stated, as in Hurn v. Oursler, 289 U.S. 238, 53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 972 (1933). <em>See </em>discussion 3A J. Moore, Federal Practice, \u00b6 18.07 [1.-2] (2d ed. 1964); W. Barron, The Judicial Code \u2014 1948 Revision, 8 F.R. D. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">In ruling to the contrary the district court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-9\">An analysis of the plaintiff\u2019s claims in the instant action has convinced this Court that the claim of unfair competition against the two moving defendants is sufficiently related to the patent infringement claim against Reynolds and Huck Finn, Inc., to come within the letter of \u00a7 1338(b) to entertain plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action against the two moving defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-11\">* * * [A]s an alternative to the holding stated supra \u2014 that, even if plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action against the two moving defendants does not state a claim of \u201cunfair competition\u201d and thus does not fall within \u00a7 1338(b), the Court nevertheless has the power to exercise jurisdiction over these State law claims by virtue of the more general doctrine of pendent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">In this ruling, Judge Larson relied on two decisions of the Second Circuit, Astor-Honor, Inc. v. Grosset &amp; Dunlap, Inc., 441 F.2d 627 (2nd Cir. 1971) (jurisdiction under \u00a7 1338(b)), and Leather\u2019s Best, Inc. v. S. S. Mormaclynx, 451 F.2d 800 (2nd Cir. 1971) (pendent jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">We agree with the rationale of the district court that as a matter of law under \u00a7 1338(b), or as a matter of discretion in the exercise of pendent jurisdiction, the appealing defendants must remain in this federal lawsuit for, as Judge Larson indicated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-15\">-\u00bb * * [i]t would be an unjustifiable waste of judicial and professional time \u2014 indeed, a travesty on sound judicial administration \u2014 to allow plaintiff to try his unfair competition claim against Reynolds and Huck Finn, Inc., in Federal court but to require him to prosecute a claim involving precisely the same facts against Berquist and Solar Plastics, Inc., in a State court</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">Defendants have cited cases to the contrary on the pendent jurisdiction theory, Hymer v. Chai, 407 F.2d 136 (9th Cir. 1969); Moor v. Madigan, 458 F.2d 1217 (9th Cir. 1972); Patrum v. City of Greensburg, Kentucky, 419 F.2d 1300 (6th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1125, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970); Wojtas v. Village of Niles, 334 F.2d 797 (7th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 964, 85 S.Ct. 655, 13 L.Ed.2d 558 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">We find these precedents inapposite. The general doctrine enunciated in <em>Hy-mer, supra, </em>407 F.2d at 137, that the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction applies only to joinder of claims, and not to joinder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>parties, has been criticized and rejected by this court in Hatridge v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 415 F.2d 809, 817 (8th Cir. 1969). Without exercising judgment as to the merits of the jurisdictional determinations in the remaining cases, we find them distinguishable on their facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">We believe that the district court cited sound precedent for its decision, and affirm the order here appealed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
