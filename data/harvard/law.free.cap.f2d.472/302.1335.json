KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b363-21\">Rarely is there a case reaching us after conviction in which the defendant believes he has received a fair trial. The human tendency to blame a trial judge for the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt is a frailty we often encounter, and almost as frequently we find such claims to be without merit or substance. Once again we are asked by a convicted defendant to consider a claim of improper conduct on the part of a trial judge. In this instance, however, we believe the record amply demonstrates that the defendant, James Nazzaro, did not receive a fair trial. Although \u201cit is one of the glories of federal criminal law administration that a district judge is more than a moderator or umpire. . . ,\u201d United States v. Curdo, 279 F.2d 681, 682 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 824, 81 S.Ct. 59, 5 L.Ed.2d 52 (1960), a judge\u2019s participation during trial \u2014 whether it takes the form of interrogating witnesses, addressing counsel, or some other conduct \u2014must never reach the point at which it appears clear to the jury that the court believes the accused is guilty. Nazzaro, who was convicted after trial before Judge Rosling and a jury for receiving, concealing, and facilitating the transportation of eight and one-half pounds of hashish, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>176a,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> maintains that the trial judge\u2019s .conduct in examining witnesses \u2014 particularly the defendant himself \u2014 and in repeatedly harassing Nazzaro\u2019s counsel, so severely prejudiced the defense as to make a fair trial impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"> There is simply no handy tool with which to gauge a claim that a judge\u2019s conduct improperly has shifted the balance against a defendant. Understandably, we reach a decision in such cases only after the most thorough and careful deliberation. We frankly recognize that appellate review of criminal cases, always a difficult task, becomes even more hazardous when the question presented involves an attack upon the conduct of a judge. The special quandary we face in such cases stems from the fact that \u201cwe are not given the benefit of witnessing the juxtaposition of personalities which may help prevent reading too much into \u2018the cold black and white of a printed record\u2019 \u201d. United States v. Grunberger, 431 F.2d 1062, 1067 (2nd Cir. 1970). Moreover, appellate review does not take place in a vacuum. We must be mindful of the fact that trials in the district courts are not conducted under the cool and calm conditions of a quiet sanctuary or an ivory tower, and that enormous pressures are placed upon district judges by an ever increasing criminal docket<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a demand, expressed in part by Rules of the Second Circuit Judicial Council, for speedier trials of criminal defendants. These pressures can cause even conscientious members of the bench, such as the trial judge in this case, in their anxiety to keep pace with the flood of litigation, to give vent to their frustrations by displaying anger and partisanship, when ordinarily they are able to suppress these characteristics. But grave errors which result in serious prejudice to a defendant cannot be ignored simply because they grow out of difficult conditions. A claim of unfair judicial conduct, under these circumstances, requires a close scrutiny of each tile in the mosaic of the trial so that we can determine whether instances of improper behavior or bias, when considered individually or taken together as a whole, may have reached that point where we can make a safe judgment that the defendant was deprived of the fair trial to which he is entitled. United States v. Guglielmini, 384 F.2d 602, 605 (2nd Cir. 1967). On the record before us, we are left with the inescapable conclusion that the judge\u2019s conduct during trial seriously prejudiced the defendant. Accordingly, we are constrained to reverse Nazzaro\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">A brief recital of the facts adduced at the trial will aid us in considering Naz-zaro\u2019s principal claim. Nazzaro\u2019s trial focused upon incidents involving a large trunk shipped from Morocco to New York City via Air France. The trunk, containing some articles of women\u2019s clothing and a blanket, arrived at the Air France cargo terminal at Kennedy International Airport on December 25, 1969. Concealed within a false panel at the bottom of the trunk were eight and one-half pounds of hashish. Two months later, on February 25, 1970, an undated Air France arrival notice was delivered through the mail to Nazzaro\u2019s apartment at 17 West 20th Street in Manhattan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The notice \u2014 addressed to Nazzaro Studio of Design<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 stated that a shipment had been received by the airline and that storage charges were accruing. In the early afternoon of February 27, a friend drove Nazzaro to Air France\u2019s cargo building at Kennedy Airport.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Nazzaro presented the arrival notice to an employee at the Air France freight counter, he was given additional shipping documents and instructed to go to the United States Customs Office, located at the far end of the counter. The additional documents \u2014an airway bill and a carrier\u2019s certificate \u2014 indicated that the trunk had been shipped from Morocco by Judy Hoffman and George Armstrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">As Nazzaro walked towards the Customs section, an Air France employee placed the trunk on a counter in front of Inspector Frank Pisciotta. Pisciotta testified at trial that after examining the documents which Nazzaro handed to him, he asked Nazzaro if he owned the trunk. Nazzaro responded, according to Pisciotta, that a friend, Judy Hoffman, had written a letter requesting him to claim the trunk and hold it until she returned to the United States from Morocco. Pisciotta claimed that Nazzaro expressed a willingness to pay any duty imposed on the contents of the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Nazzaro\u2019s version of this incident differed sharply from Pisciotta\u2019s. Nazza-ro, who maintained during trial that he did not know anyone named Judy Hoffman, testified that the arrival of the Air France notice completely mystified him. He stated that after Air France refused to disclose any information about the shipment over the telephone, he went to the airport to seek an explanation. According to Nazzaro, he talked with Pis-ciotta only about accrued storage charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">Pisciotta, after this conversation with Nazzaro, inspected the trunk. An apparent two-inch discrepancy between its inside and outside depth measurements and the fact that the trunk was only half full immediately aroused his suspicions. Pisciotta and another inspector then carried the trunk to a back room. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>While Nazzaro stood to the side, Pisciot-ta cut a small hole in the bottom of the trunk with a pocket knife. The opening revealed a plastic wrapping containing a substance which Pisciotta believed was hashish. Pisciotta immediately telephoned the airport headquarters of the Bureau of Customs to report his discovery. In response, Special Agent Frank Farrell and Customs Port Investigator James Voloposille went to the Air France cargo building to investigate. Farrell examined the false bottom and concluded that the substance contained in the plastic wrapping was hashish. Farrell then informed Nazzaro that he was under arrest, advised him of his rights, and placed handcuffs on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">After taking the trunk to their government automobile, Farrell and Volo-posille drove Nazzaro to the Bureau of Customs\u2019s airport office. Agent Farrell testified that during this trip he commented on the large quantity of seized hashish. According to Farrell, Nazzaro responded by saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t think there would be that much hash.\u201d In addition, Farrell claimed that Nazzaro answered, \u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d when asked about Judy Hoffman\u2019s identity. At trial, Nazzaro vigorously denied making the statements attributed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">After a brief stop at the airport office, Farrell and Voloposille drove Naz-zaro to the Bureau of Customs headquarters at 201 Varick Street in Manhattan. Farrell escorted Nazzaro to a room located on the third floor for questioning by Special Agent Donald Dono-hue, who was in charge of the investigation. Donohue did not summon a stenographer to transcribe the subsequent interrogation nor did he prepare a written report recording the substance of the interview. At the trial twenty-six months later, he was able, nevertheless, to recall perfectly that in response to questioning, Nazzaro stated that he had gone to the airport to claim a trunk for his friend, Judy Hoffman. According to Donohue, Nazzaro admitted that he \u201cknew he was going to get some hash [but] didn\u2019t think it would be quite that much.\u201d While Donohue interrogated Nazzaro, Farrell removed the entire bottom of the trunk in the hall outside the interview room, revealing twenty bags of hashish. When Nazzaro left the room with Donohue at the conclusion of the interrogation, he saw the packages and, again according to Donohue, stated, \u201cI told you, I did not know it was going to be that much stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Nazzaro\u2019s recollection of this interview sharply contradicted Donohue\u2019s. Nazzaro flatly denied acknowledging an acquaintance with Judy Hoffman or ever stating that he was expecting \u201csome\u201d hashish, but not \u201cthat much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The government\u2019s case against Nazzaro thus relied heavily upon admissions \u2014 uncorroborated by any written memoranda \u2014 allegedly made by Nazzaro to Pisciotta, Farrell and Donohue. At trial, Nazzaro conceded that he had gone to the airport with the arrival notice. He denied, however, any familiarity with a person named Judy Hoffman and insisted that he did not know why he was notified of the trunk\u2019s arrival, nor did he know anything about its contents. The theory of the defense was that Nazzaro\u2019s sister-in-law, Jennifer Nazzaro\u2014 who was travelling in Morocco during December, 1969 \u2014 had shipped the trunk to \u201cNazzaro Studio of Design\u201d on West 20th Street without giving any advance notice or warning of its contents. According to Nazzaro, Jennifer,' who was separated from her husband Phillip, probably intended the trunk for either Mara Lepmanis \u2014 Jennifer\u2019s close friend \u25a0 \u2014 or Phillip Nazzaro, who shared the apartment with James and Mara.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>cordingly, in view of the fact that each government witness recalled his version of the three conversations without the benefit of any written memoranda, resolution of Nazzaro\u2019s guilt or innocence turned upon the jury\u2019s view of the credibility of the witnesses presented by each side. The question for the jury thus necessarily focused on whether Nazzaro in fact did admit that he was expecting the arrival of a trunk containing hashish from Judy Hoffman.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">It is in this context that we turn to Nazzaro\u2019s claim that the trial judge so interfered with the course of trial as to preclude a fair resolution of the factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">There is no dispute among the parties that the judge participated extensively in the examination of all witnesses. Several such instances, however, occurred only \u201cwhere [it was] necessary to clarify testimony and assist the jury in understanding the evidence,\u201d United States v. DeSisto, 289 F.2d 833, 834 (2nd Cir. 1961).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But \u201cwhile it might be proper for a judge to question witnesses to clarify issues, such intervention should not become the rule.\u201d United States v. D\u2019Anna, 450 F.2d 1201, 1206 (2nd Cir. 1971). It is clear from the record that on frequent occasions during the trial of this case, the judge\u2019s questions unmistakably rehabilitated a prosecution witness whose credibility had been undermined by defense counsel. At other times, the court\u2019s questions appeared designed to inject doubt or uncertainty as to the credibility of a defense witness. While we must forego an enumeration of all instances of misconduct revealed by the record if we are not to prolong unduly this opinion, a few examples will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">In the course of cross-examination of Special Agent Donohue, counsel for Naz-zaro attempted to explore inconsistencies between Donohue\u2019s testimony during direct examination and his statements to the Grand Jury that indicted Nazzaro. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-13\">Q. Isn\u2019t it a fact that you never told the Grand Jury that Judy Hoffman was a friend of [Nazzaro\u2019s] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APM\">A. Not if I weren\u2019t asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-14\">Q. Isn\u2019t it a fact that you never told\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-15\">The Court: Counselor, the witness has just stated that he responded to questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-16\">Do you have any questions you want to confront him with? Don\u2019t ask him whether he told them \u2014 there are a lot of things he didn\u2019t tell them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-17\">You didn\u2019t tell them that Columbus discovered America in 1492, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-18\">The Witness: I wasn\u2019t asked, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-19\">The Court: You may continue, but not in that form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-20\">Q. Had you told the U.S. Attorney, prior to the Grand Jury presentation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>that the defendant had told you about a letter he was going to get ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">Q. And you were not asked the question and didn\u2019t give the answer in the Grand Jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">The Court: Members of the Jury, whether or not he got a letter or not is irrelevant to the charge here. So it may be that that was why he wasn\u2019t asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">Do not raise your voice in such indignation, counselor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">Mr. Schwartz: I am trying not to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">The Court: But you are doing it. The Jury knows I\u2019m not inventing this, they hear you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">There were numerous similar occasions in which the judge came all too quickly to the aid of a prosecution witness during cross-examination. The impact of these instances was such that the jury could only believe that the judge favored the government\u2019s witness and his version of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">Even more damaging was the judge\u2019s persistent questioning of defense witnesses, particularly the defendant Naz-zaro himself. The trial judge often assumed the prosecutor\u2019s role, interposing questions which clearly indicated disbelief in the defendant\u2019s testimony. One illustration will suffice. During Nazza-ro\u2019s testimony, he asserted that the Air France employees had referred him to a Customs official for discussion of accrued storage charges on the trunk. Nazzaro was met with a lengthy barrage of questions by the judge aimed at demonstrating the improbability that a United States Customs Inspector would be concerned with an airline\u2019s storage charges:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">The Court: Let me ask you this, this letter about storage charges didn\u2019t come from the United States Government, did it?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-14\">The Witness: I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-15\">The Court: Who did it come from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-16\">The Witness: Air France.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-17\">The Court: Now, you went to the Air France people, didn\u2019t you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-18\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-19\">The Court: With their arrival notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-20\">The Witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-21\">The Court: And the arrival notice said, \u201cStorage charges are accruing in accordance with the provisions set forth in IATA Resolution 512-B.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-23\">Do you know what that means, \u201cstorage charges are accruing\u201d ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-24\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-25\">Q. When you went to the airplane people to get these other papers, did they tell you that they were holding the trunk for some storage charges ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-26\">The Witness: They didn\u2019t tell me anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-28\">The Court: They gave it to you even though the storage charges were accruing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-29\">The Witness: They said take it down to the Customs Inspector and maybe he can do something about it; that\u2019s what they told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-30\">The Court: He can do something about what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-32\">The Witness: I assume they meant the charges, storage charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-33\">The Court: You mean the United States Government was concerned about the storage charges that Air France was accruing on this trunk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-35\">The Witness: I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s what I was told. I had no idea what the procedure was. I had never done it before so I didn\u2019t know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-36\">The Court: Over there at the Air France they didn\u2019t say \u201cWe got a lien on that trunk for storage charges?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-37\">The Witness: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-38\">The Court: \u201cAnd we are not going to give you this, these other two papers, until you pay us those charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-39\">The Witness: No, they didn\u2019t sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-40\">The Court: They just \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-41\">The Witness: Just handed me the two sheets of paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The Court: Didn\u2019t tell you it was a trunk even?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">The Witness: Not that I remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">The Court: Try hard to remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">The Witness: All I remember is he just handed me those invoices, whatever they are, and said, \u201cGo down the end of the counter and the Customs Inspector will \u2014 he\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">Or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">The Court: Nobody told you at that point that it was a trunk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">The Witness: I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">The Court: You know, the next paragraph, after the one I read, this is also from Air France, reads: \u201cIf you do not claim this shipment within a period of seven days. . . . \u201d \u2014 did you notice that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-13\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-14\">The Court: Were you coming there to claim the shipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-15\">The Witness: I went there to inquire about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-16\">The Court: Inquire of whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-17\">The Witness: Air France.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-18\">The Court: You left Air France with their papers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-19\">The Witness: It\u2019s in the same building. They are about ten feet apart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-20\">It\u2019s no longer than this piece of wood here (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-21\">The Court: Do you know the difference between a Customs officer and somebody that works for the French airline, Air France? I think that is a French airline, isn\u2019t it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-22\">The Witness: I thought they were all connected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-23\">The Court: In other words, the Customs officers, they help Air France collect its bills, is that the way it goes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-24\">The Witness: I don\u2019t know sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-26\">The Court: Did you ask the Customs people what the charges were ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-27\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-28\">The Court: What did they tell you, how much?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-29\">The Witness: They didn\u2019t tell me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-30\">The Court: They didn\u2019t tell you that it was owing to the United States Government, storage charges ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-31\">The Witness: Not that I remember, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-32\">The Court: It wasn\u2019t owing to the United States Government, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-33\">Mr. Schwartz: Your Honor, may I object to this. I think these questions were asked yesterday and they are being asked again repeatedly and they were asked yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-34\">The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-35\">Did you ask the Customs people what the charges of Air France were ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-36\">The Witness: I believe I asked them what the charges were about, or if they could tell me anything about the charges, about the package.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-37\">I don\u2019t remember what was said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-38\">The Court: Did you ask them what the Air France charges were ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-39\">The Witness: I didn\u2019t ask them \u2014 I just asked them about the charges. I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-40\">The Court: You thought these were charges of the United States Customs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-41\">The Witness: I\u2019d no idea. I\u2019d never been in the building before. I\u2019d never been through the procedure. I didn\u2019t know what was what.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-42\">The trial judge also frequently interrupted testimony of defense witness Matt Reynolds, the truck driver who drove Nazzaro to the airport. The questions clearly reflected disbelief in Reynold\u2019s version of the circumstances of the trip. For example, after Reynolds indicated that he had a one hour holdover between shipments, the trial judge strenuously cross-examined the witness in this fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-43\">The Court: How long would you say the trip took from Long Island City to Air France ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-44\">The Witness: Roughly 20 minutes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-45\">The Court: 20 minutes ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-46\">The Witness: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The Court: 20 plus 20, that is 40 minutes. That left you with 20 minutes more, didn\u2019t it? 20 minutes there, 20 minutes back, and 20 minutes free time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">The Witness: Well, I didn\u2019t make it exactly. I knew that I had enough time to take him out of there and come back safely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">The Court: Didn\u2019t you testify earlier that you estimated it would take you 15 to 20 minutes at that time of day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">The Witness: Yes. But, in other words-\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">The Court: So if it was as little as 15 minutes, you would have 15 minutes there, 15 minutes back, 5 [sic] minutes turnaround time, and you were still left with 15 minutes free?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">The Witness: Well, I am just estimating, your Honor. I had plenty of time to take him out to the airport and come back and do what I was committed to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">The Court: Could you have stayed there for 10 minutes or so to see what happened ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">The Witness: Well, I had told Mr. Nazzaro that I just wasn\u2019t taking him back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">I didn\u2019t want to cut anything too close and get involved with anything like waiting on line because these things definitely take time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">I told him that it takes time, simply that, and I would not be able to wait for him. And he would have to take a cab.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-17\">The Court: You would not be able to take a load back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-18\">The Witness: A \u2014 The point is, I am committed to somebody else for my time and service for the day. I couldn\u2019t get tied up with Mr. Nazzaro. I had a free hour where I would have to just sit at Columbia Letter or go out for a cup of coffee. And as much as I could do was to take him out to the airport, period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-19\">The Court: You couldn\u2019t wait 20 or 25 minutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-20\">The Witness: No, I couldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-21\">The Court: And then put it in your almost completely empty truck and cart it back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-22\">The Witness: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-23\">Where the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence rests almost exclusively on the jury\u2019s evaluation of the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and credibility, we cannot ignore questioning undertaken by a judge which so clearly signals to the jury the judge\u2019s partisanship. Even if a judge\u2019s interjections are not motivated by a partisan purpose, \u201che must not permit even the appearance of such an interference.\u201d United States v. Curcio, 279 F.2d 681, 682 (2nd Cir. 1960). The court\u2019s vigorous participation in examining Nazzaro and Reynolds, especially when contrasted with the relative freedom from hostile interruption of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, could not avoid conveying to the jury that the judge did not believe Nazzaro and the other defense witnesses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Other incidents reinforce our conclusion that Nazzaro must receive a new trial. The judge engaged in numerous acrimonious exchanges with defense counsel, many of which occurred in the presence of the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>disturbing colloquy was marked by the court reporter as occurring \u201cat the side bar . . . out of the hearing of the Jury,\u201d but, as appears from certain of the quoted statements below, some of it may have been overheard by the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgL\">Mr. Dearie [the prosecutor]: I do not want to be dramatic about this, your Honor. And I\u2019m sure it is not intended, but Mr. Schwartz is nodding yes and nodding no while the witness is testifying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">The Court: You are in good shape. When I had an adversary that was nodding to the witness on the stand, I welcomed it because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">Mr. Schwartz [defense counsel]: I am not aware of it. If you want to point it out to me, I will turn away\u2014 The Court: \u2022 \u2014 I never even bothered to say anything- \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">Mr. Schwartz: I think the Jury can hear this and it is not helpful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">The Court: Well, keep your voice down. And lipreading won\u2019t do them any good because my back is turned to them. But my experience has been that with a witness on the stand\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">Mr. Schwartz: May I leave the side bar conference ? I do not want to discuss this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">The Court: You will remain here. Indicate that he remains. My experience has been if signals are given to a witness\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">Mr. Schwartz: Oh, my god\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">The Court: Will you keep still.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-13\">You are attracting the attention of the Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-18\">Mr. Schwartz: I am not doing any such thing, so help me god. I do not want to stay at the conference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-19\">The Court: You can stay in jail, if you prefer that. Just remain here. We are in the middle of a criminal trial. My experience has been \u2014 and this is an explanation of my ruling\u2014 that when a witness is on the stand and receives signals from an attorney or from anybody else he is receiving them only when he is in trouble and he doesn\u2019t understand what the signals mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-20\">So I overrule your objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">In several instances the judge\u2019s remarks were prompted by counsel\u2019s failure to comply with rulings on the scope of cross-examination, but these comments, when considered along with other instances of inappropriate judicial participation, destroyed the \u201cimpartial, judicious, and above all, responsible courtroom atmosphere in which guilt or innocence [must] be soberly and fairly tested.\u201d United States v. Brandt, 196 F.2d 653, 655 (2nd Cir. 1952). <em>See </em>United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d 340 at 385-391 (7th Cir. 1972). Although in most circumstances a damaging impression may be mitigated by a jury instruction which emphasizes that \u201ccomments or questions by the court [are] not to be construed as in any way expressing any opinion or view on the part of the court whatsoever,\u201d United States v. Cruz, 455 F.2d 184, 185 (2nd Cir. 1972), United States v. D\u2019Anna, 450 F.2d 1201, 1206 (2nd Cir. 1971), \u201csuch admonitions may offset [only] brief or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>minor departures from strict judicial impartiality.\u201d United States v. Brandt, 196 F.2d 653, 656 (2nd Cir. 1952). Even if the trial judge\u2019s charge on this score had not been as cursory as it actually was,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we do not believe the error in this case could have been cured. The only remedy for the prejudice suffered by the defendant here is to reverse the conviction and grant him a new trial. United States v. Grunberger, 431 F.2d 1062 (2nd Cir. 1970); United .States v. DeSisto, 289 F.2d 833 (2nd Cir. 1961); United States v. Brandt, 196 F.2d 653 (2nd Cir. 1952).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In sum, after careful review of the entire trial record, we are constrained to arrive at the conclusion that the defendant did not receive a fair trial. Certainly a trial judge must be something more than a useless appendage to the trial. He bears the responsibility of insuring that the facts in each case are presented to the jury in a clear and straightforward manner. Yet an appearance of impartiality and judicious detachment must prevail at all times. While concededly the line separating permissible and impermissible judicial conduct in the courtroom is drawn with the finest point, we are of the firm view that the line was crossed in this case. Accordingly, it is our duty to reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-5\">. Nazzaro received a sentence of five years imprisonment. A second charge, failure to pay a transfer tax on the hashish, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 4744(a)(2), was dismissed prior to trial on the government\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">. During Fiscal Year 1972, the number of criminal filings in the Eastern District of New York \u2014 which makes a special effort to begin trial of all criminal cases within six months of arrest \u2014 was 1422, an increase of almost 150% over the 581 filings during Fiscal Year 1962. Compare 1972 Annual Report of the Director, Administrative Office of the United States Courts Table 31, with 1962 Annual Report of the Director, Administrative Office of the United States Courts Table D 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">. Nazzaro also claims that the indictment should be dismissed for failure to comply with this Circuit\u2019s Rules Regarding Prompt Disposition of Criminal Cases and because of a denial of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. These claims are meritless. Nazzaro was arrested on February 27, 1970 and indicted on October 29, 1970. The government\u2019s Notice of Readiness For Trial was timely filed on June. 28, 1971, a week before the effective date of the Second Circuit Rules. Conceding that a valid readiness notice filed on that date would satisfy the government\u2019s obligations under the Rules, Nazzaro contends that the notice was meaningless because the government had failed to provide certain discovery. But defense counsel\u2019s affidavit submitted in support of his motion to dismiss, dated January 20, 1972, and his statements at a hearing on this motion on February 4, 1972, reveal that there was only an informal agreement by the government to disclose certain documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>no later than one week in advance of trial. Nazzaro\u2019s vague and eonclusory claims of prejudice \u2014 regarding destroyed Air France records and unavailable witnesses \u2014 cannot support a claim under the Sixth Amendment. Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. Also living in the apartment with Naz-zaro were Mara Lepmanis, his girlfriend, and Phillip Nazzaro, his younger brother. Phillip recently had separated from his wife Jennifer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">. Nazarro testified that the apartment lease was executed in a business name because the building was located in a commercially zoned area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-15\">. The friend, Matt Reynolds, was employed as a truck dx-iver. Reynolds and Nazzaro each testified that they met at noon on the 27tlx of February in the Riviera Bar and Restaurant, located near Nazzaro\u2019s apartment in Greenwich Village. Reynolds testified that his employer had instructed him to deliver a shipment to a warehouse in Long Island City and that he volunteered to drive Nazzaro at least that far. After arriving at the warehouse, Reynolds was told there would be a one-hour delay before a return shipment was ready. He then decided to drive Nazzaro to the airport, but did not wait to drive Nazzaro back to Manhattan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\">. As part of his proof, Nazzaro sought to introduce a letter written by Jennifer Nazzaro to Mara Lepmanis. He offered the letter, dated December 15, 1969, to show that Jennifer was in Morocco during the time the trunk was shipped. The thirteen longhand pages of the letter related Jennifer\u2019s experiences while she was travelling through Spain and North Africa and mentioned purchases of small quantities of hashish in Morocco. The government objected to introduction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the letter, asserting that it was both irrelevant and hearsay. Prolonged discussion of whether the judge erred in sustaining this objection is unnecessary since we believe that if it was error not to admit the letter in evidence, it was harmless. The information in the letter was adduced during Mara Lepmanis\u2019s testimony :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">Q. Miss Lepmanis, did you ever receive any correspondence from any person in the Middle East, or in North Africa, Morocco, with respect to their having possession of or purchasing hashish ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">Q. From whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-21\">A. Jennifer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-22\">The Court: She mentions that in her letter, doesn\u2019t she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-23\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b367-24\">. For example, near the outset of Inspector Pisciotta\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor asked him to describe his duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-25\">A. Well, our main function is to protect the Revenue Act of the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-26\">The Court: Now, don\u2019t put it in legal gobbledygook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-27\">The Witness : All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-28\">The Cour.t: Put it in jury language. What are you supposed to do?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b370-13\">. We also consider regrettable the court\u2019s concern with the existence of physical hygiene facilities in Nazzaro\u2019s apartment. For example, during the testimony of Irving Barry, a friend of Nazzaro\u2019s, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-14\">The Court: Where was the bathroom, the toilet in [Nazzaro\u2019s apartment] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-16\">The Witness: Well, as you came in the door, it was on your left. It was another \u2014 It was a room that had been built up and newly piped out, you know, new plumbing fixtures, et cetera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-24\">The Court: Bathtub in it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-25\">The Witness: A bathtub \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-26\">The Court: A shower?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-27\">The Witness : There may have been a shower. I don\u2019t know if there was a bathtub.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-28\">The Court: There may have been a shower?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-29\">The Witness: Bight, there may have just been a shower stall. I don\u2019t remember if there was a bathtub.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-30\">The Court: Well, would it be a situation without a bathtub and without a shower?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The Witness: Could it have been without a bathtub\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">The Court: Without either \u2014 without both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">The AYitness: I don\u2019t really remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">The Court: I see. This was a special type of an apartment, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">The AATtness: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">Moreover, in the context of this trial, the court\u2019s effort to link addresses mentioned by defense witnesses with the Greenwich ATllage area was unfortunate. For instance, immediately after Matt Reynolds was sworn as a witness by the clerk and stated his address as 194 Bleecker Street, New York, New York, the trial judge asked, \u201cThat is in Greenwich Village, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">These comments on matters totally irrelevant to the case could only have placed the defendant in an unfair light before the jury, as did the following unnecessary exchange, which took place while Nazzaro described how Inspector Pisciotta cut a hole in the trunk at the airport:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-13\">The Witness: And then the hashish or whatever was in it came out, fell on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-14\">The Court: AVell, what did the hashish look like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-16\">The Witness: What I have seen here, that green \u2014 green\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-17\">The Court: Was that the first time in your life you ever saw hashish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-19\">The AATtness: In that quantity, yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-20\">The Court: In that quantity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-21\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-22\">The Court: You have seen it in a smaller quantity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-23\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b371-24\">. One such instance occurred during direct examination of Reynolds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-25\">Q. [defense counsel] Now, Mr. Reynolds, continue with the conversation. You told him that it was at the Cargo Building, and he had to go out there to find out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-26\">A. Right. He asked me if \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-27\">The Court: Did he say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-28\">The Witness: Excuse me, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-29\">The Court: Did you say he had to go out there to find out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-30\">The Witness: He asked me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-31\">The Court: Suppose it was you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-32\">Mr. Schwartz: [defense counsel] May he answer the question, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-33\">The Court: Counselor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-34\">Mr. Schwartz: Please let him answer the question, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-35\">The Court: Don\u2019t put yourself in that position in front of the jury as though the Court was oppressing you. The Court is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-36\">Now, you remain silent, please. Other exchanges, although occurring during side bar discussions or while the jury was not present in court, indicate the acrimonious atmosphere that permeated the courtroom. During a discussion concerning the permissible scope of cross-examination of Inspector Pisciotta, the following is recorded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-37\">The Court: You should be before some of the other judges \u2014 and I have one in particular in mind \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t have gotten a fraction of the testimony in. You would not have had the problem with the jury because the judge asks all the questions of the jury and doesn\u2019t go into any detail and \u2014 He would be saying, \u201cCome, come, let\u2019s hurry, let\u2019s hurry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-39\">You know, the kind of motion you made in this case some time back, the motion \u2014 you made a motion to dismiss because I could not get to the case, notwithstanding\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-40\">Mr. Schwartz: That was not why. Desmond O\u2019Sullivan [an Assistant U.S. Attorney formerly in charge of the case] promised me those papers for fourteen months, that\u2019s why I moved, not because of your Honor. I think you have disliked me since that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-41\">The Court: If you want to get on an emotional basis, you may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-42\">Mr. Schwartz: I don\u2019t. I want to take out the personal feelings between us. I don't want to have any personal feeling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-43\">The Court: Counselor, the jury box is empty, and I will tolerate some things that come close to being contemptuous\u2014 BIr. Schwartz: I am only talking to your Honor without the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-44\">The Court: You have now interrupted me four times. You are about twenty-five or thirty-five years my junior and I have not got the strength to cope with you, but I do have the power \u2014 so just stop it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-46\">The motion referred to was the January 20, 1972 motion to dismiss for denial of a speedy trial, see note 3, supra. The pressures of overwork which un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>doubtedly were a contributing factor to this conscientious trial judge\u2019s demeanor during trial were evident at the February 4, 1972 hearing held on this motion:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-15\">The Court: Look, I will tell you [defense counsel, Mr. Schwartz] something : You sit down there and I\u2019ll tell you something about manners in the Court. Most courts have only one lawyer standing. Will you sit down, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-17\">Now, in my Court, nobody addresses the Court from a seated position. Sit down. Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-22\">All right, and if you wish to speak, you ask permission. Then if I say you can rise, then you can address the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-23\">Mr. Schwartz: May I speak, your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-25\">The Court: No. Remain seated. Just keep calm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-27\">The hour is late. I am in the middle of a trial. I don\u2019t know how to do everything I have to do today.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b373-17\">. The extent of the charge on the judge's views was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-18\">In the course of trial it has been necessary for me to rule on the admission of evidence and on motions made with respect to the applicable law. You must not infer from any such ruling I have made or from anything that I have said during the course of trial that I hold any views for or against the defendant in this prosecution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b373-19\">. We also believe it was not appropriate to exempt Special Agent Donohue from an order excluding witnesses from the courtroom. Over Nazzaro\u2019s objection, Donohue was allowed to sit at the prosecutor\u2019s table during trial. We recognize that \u201csince the chief investigating agent may be of significant help to the prosecution during the course of a trial, the trial court has discretion to make an exception to the general rule of sequestration of witnesses.\u201d United States v. Pellegrino, 470 F.2d 1205 at 1208 (2nd Cir. 1972). But even cautionary instructions to the jury immediately before the agent\u2019s testimony, as were given in <em>Pellegrino, </em>would have been inadequate in a case such as this, in which Donohue\u2019s credibility was a crucial element in the government\u2019s case against Nazzaro. Nevertheless, Judge Rosling failed even to give such a limiting instruction. Regardless of how imperceptibly the jury\u2019s view of Donohue\u2019s testimony may have been affected, under the circumstances present here it would have been better to exclude Donohue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
