The central question is the admissibility in evidence of narcotics found in appellant\u2019s possession on a search of his pockets at the police station, where he was brought following an arrest for the petty offense of driving with a learner\u2019s permit while unaccompanied by a licensed driver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appeal was originally heard by a division of this court, which affirmed the conviction, one judge dissenting, as to counts one and two of the indictment. The denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the narcotics, made at pre-trial hearing, and renewed at trial, was sustained on the ground that the inspection of the contents of appellant\u2019s pockets was valid because he was to be detained in stationhouse confinement. Appellant had the right to post $50 collateral for that petty offense, and had he been accorded that opportunity he would, with $171 in cash on him, have been permitted to leave the stationhouse forthwith, without any search of his person. We hold that the stationhouse inspection of the contents of his pockets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>was an unreasonable search, in violation of the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment, and that the evidence found as a result of this search is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">On December 29, 1967, Patrolman Willie C. Ivery, Jr., of the Metropolitan Police, was on patrol in the neighborhood of Sixth and H Streets, N.E. At about 4:30 a. m. he observed an auto, driven by appellant, approaching him at an excessive rate of speed. He flagged the car down, walked over to it, and asked appellant, who was alone in the car, for his driver\u2019s permit and the automobile registration. Appellant produced only a District of Columbia learner\u2019s permit and did not have the registration. The officer told appellant that it was illegal to operate an automobile with a learner\u2019s permit unless a licensed operator was with him. Appellant told him that he had just dropped off the car\u2019s owner at a nearby restaurant. The officer then placed appellant under arrest for driving without a proper permit. Officer Ivery patted appellant down and found no weapons. He called for a scout car, which arrived shortly thereafter. The officers and appellant then drove to the nearby restaurant and there Craig Tatum, the owner of the car and a licensed operator, verified appellant\u2019s account. Officer Ivery told Mr. Tatum that he would be cited for permitting an unlicensed driver to operate his car and asked Tatum to accompany him to the precinct. Tatum agreed, and Ivery went with him, following the other officers, who had charge of appellant, to the sta-tionhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">The difference in Officer Ivery\u2019s handling of appellant by arrest, as distinguished from the citation procedure used with Mr. Tatum, was not due to any apprehension of danger from appellant, but was based on the officer\u2019s understanding that appellant\u2019s offense, as contrasted with Tatum\u2019s, required an arrest procedure. Officer Ivery testified at trial that his \u201cnormal procedure\u201d was to proceed by citation for petty offenses unless the person \u201cdisrespects me or something.\u201d Tatum was asked to go to the station to pick up his articles; asked whether Mr. Mills had offended him, Ivery replied \u201cNo.\u201d The trial transcript reveals that Mills stopped promptly on hearing the whistle,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the officer quickly verified that Mills had had Tatum\u2019s permission to drive the car, nothing turned up in the frisk for weapons conducted in the street, and Mr. Mills did not resist arrest in any way but was \u201cvery cooperative.\u201d The reason Officer Ivery gave for arresting Mills, instead of proceeding by citation, was: \u201cThis is a different type of offense. . This type of offense always constitutes an arrest, having no D.C. permit.\u201d It appears that police instructions had not caught up with a recent change in the law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which made the arrest for this offense a matter of discretion. However, we assume that the arrest of Mills was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">As to events following the arrival of Mills at the police station, the police say that Mills was taken into the station-house through a side door, detained briefly in a small room, and was then delivered into the custody of Officer Ivery, who brought him to the booking desk. Ivery testified that Mills was then ordered to remove everything from his pockets, the standard procedure for persons to be held in stationhouse detention. Mills emptied his pockets \u2014 which contained more than $170 in cash \u2014 but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>was reluctant to expose whatever was in the left pocket of his jacket. Mills had stuck his hand in that pocket, according to the police; when Ivery assisted Mills in removing the hand, Mills was seen to be holding a small black change purse, the contents of which were later identified as 22 capsules of heroin and 33 capsules of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">While we accept the foregoing account for purposes of this case, we take note that Mills claims that in the small side, room, or back room, he was searched thoroughly, stripped of his clothing, that it was during this search that the narcotics were found, and that he was not brought to the booking desk until after the narcotics had been found during the strip-search in the small room.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">II. THE UNREASONABLENESS OF THE SEARCH</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">\n<em>Applicable Principle</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">In deciding whether the search was valid, our starting point, as noted above, is that the arrest of Mills for driving without a proper permit was valid. We do not rely upon the doctrine that when an arrest on a traffic charge is used as a pretext to justify a search for evidence of other crimes, the search is invalid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the bare fact that a person is validly arrested does not mean that he is subject to any and all searches that the arresting officer may wish to conduct. \u201c[T]he mere fact of a lawful arrest does not end our inquiry.\u201d Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 769, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1835, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). Under the Fourth Amendment, the validity of searches and seizures turns upon their reasonableness, and even when there is a valid arrest the search must be reasonably incident to the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\"> In most situations, the reasonableness of the search of an arrested man is clear enough, for it is reasonable for an arresting officer \u201cto search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape\u201d and \u201cto search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.\u201d Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). Those justifications have no application for the case before us\u2014 even assuming that the scout car officers did not strip-search Mills in the side room, and that we take Officer Ivery\u2019s account that the emptying of pockets followed on the booking for driving alone with a learner\u2019s permit. There was no question of a stationhouse search for weapons or for evidence concerning the offense of driving without a proper permit; appellant was frisked at the time of the arrest, with no arms found, and the offense was proved completely at the time of the arrest. The validity of the search of Mills at the stationhouse must stand or fall on the premise that it was a predetention inventory, undertaken to hold and account for valuable or potentially dangerous personal property \u2014 such as rings, belts, watches or jewelry \u2014 during the detention of the person arrested. This is the theory underlying Officer Ivery\u2019s trial testimony and it is defended by Government counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">We do not here consider the proper scope of a search that is supported by the premise of forthcoming confinement. In this case, no such justifying premise is available to validate the search of defendant Mills described by Officer Ivery. Having been arrested for a petty offense, Mills should have been informed of his opportunity, prescribed for that offense, to post $50 collateral and leave the precinct station. Instead, the police officer who conducted the booking proceeded forthwith to require Mills to empty his pockets. We think that was an unreasonable search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-13\">\n<em>The En Banc Remand Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-14\">The pertinent facts appear in the trial transcript and in the transcript of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>remand proceedings in the District Court, which this court, en banc, ordered after hearing oral argument. Four judges dissented from that remand, being of the view that the appeal should be decided on the record already made. It is appropriate to identify and explain the basis of that remand order. The majority of the court is of the view that the remand was appropriate in light of the statute authorizing an appellate court to \u201crequire such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. On the disposition by the division drawn for the case, there were three opinions: Judge Robb was of the view that it was reasonable for the police to take charge of the contents of appellant\u2019s pockets since he was about to be placed in a cell. Judge Fahy concurred, reserving his position if evidence other than contraband were seized. Judge Robinson dissented, being of the view that a rule authorizing an extensive booking search in case of arrest would provide incentive to make arrests, for the purpose of search, for offenses normally handled without arrest, and that an accommodation of all proper interests could be accomplished by permitting a \u201cbooking\u201d search of an opaque container (here, the change purse) only if there was some reason to believe this was needed to avoid danger to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">On rehearing, the court en banc was required to grapple with the problem of police \u201cinventory searches\u201d- \u2014 when, why and to what extent were they needed and reasonable. It developed, on questioning at oral argument, that just as not all offenses lead to arrests, not all arrests lead to confinement. Counsel were asked to file supplementary memoranda concerning this possibility, and such memoranda, duly filed, set forth the outlines of the system in this jurisdiction under which a number of minor offenses \u2014 this one included \u2014 are of a collateral type, so that the offender may post collateral and depart without confinement. The court considered it in the interest of justice that this information be amplified in remand proceedings: to identify whether any police officer present had the function to inform the defendant that he could post collateral for his offense; whether this information was given defendant; and if so why defendant failed to post collateral.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\">This supplementary information was considered of possible materiality to a sound decision concerning the possible justification of so-called inventory searches. The questions posed with respect to defendant \u2014 who was arrested for a $50 collateral offense, and was detained although he had $171 in his pocket \u2014 were not only pertinent to justice in his case, but spotlighted questions of broader import, as will appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">The foregoing established, in our view, a sound predicate for the court\u2019s exercise of its remand authority. Appellate courts are called upon for two functions \u2014to accord justice in the particular case; and to settle underlying principles of law. When cases raise constitutional or other basic questions, it is often a responsible exercise of the function to remand for a full record developed on hearing, rather than decide the matter on the record as made in the trial court. United States v. Robinson, 145 U.S.App.D.C. 46, 447 F.2d 1215 <em>(en banc, </em>1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">\n<em>Pertinent Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">A stipulation was entered into between the parties, prior to the remand hearing, as to the collateral system, and particularly police recognition that, if the offense is one for which collateral may be placed, offenders must be advised of their opportunity to post collateral, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>are not subject to police inventory searches unless they are unable or refuse to post collateral. The stipulation reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-4\">No. 1, the Government and defense stipulate that those who are brought to a police station for an offense for which collateral may be placed are advised of their privilege of posting collateral and are not searched at the station house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-5\">Only those who are arrested for crimes for which there is no collateral and those unable to post collateral or refuse to do so are searched pursuant to Chapter 4, Section 3 of the Police Regulations prior to being placed in confinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-6\">Stipulation No. 2, no D.C. Permit, the offense Mr. Mills the defendant was charged with, was at the time of his arrest a collateral offense for which collateral was $50.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-7\">Stipulation No. 3, the Government and defendant further stipulate that as a matter of police practice, both the arresting and booking officer advise those arrested who are eligible for collateral of the collateral system, but since these officers are generally in each other\u2019s presence at the booking, one or the other of the officers will advise the person arrested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">In addition, the District Judge found that Mills had $171 in cash on his person at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-14\">The District Court did not explicitly identify how it came about that Mills, with $171 in his pocket, failed to post collateral of $50 for the minor offense, and was processed and inventoried for stationhouse confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-15\">Under Mills\u2019 account there is no mystery: He testified that at the time of the booking his possession of narcotics had been discovered in the strip-search in the side room; and he further testified as to his understanding that he was booked for this narcotic offense. Narcotics possession is concededly an offense for which collateral is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-17\">The Government\u2019s justification is predicated upon the possibility that appellant was booked for the minor offense, was notified of the opportunity to post collateral, and declined to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-18\">We are convinced, as the realistic conclusion from this record, that Mills was not given opportunity to avoid confinement by posting $50 collateral, and that he did not refuse to do so. Mills had $171 in his pocket \u2014 evidence of highest caliber in support of that conclusion. The practice, as stipulated, was for both arresting officer and booking officer, or one in the presence of the other, to advise those eligible for collateral of the collateral system. Officer Ivery was both arresting officer and booking officer for he took charge of the writing up of Mills\u2019 offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> His actions and testimony make clear the difference in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>approach with regard to Tatum, who was to be given opportunity to post collateral and depart, and Mills, who was to be detained.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While Officer Ivery\u2019s intervening death precluded his testifying at the remand hearing, his testimony at the pre-trial hearing (see note 8) establishes that he made the writing up of Tatum\u2019s case the \u201cfirst order of business\u201d in order \u201cnot to detain him any longer since [Tatum\u2019s] was a type of case where he could pay the ticket then or take a ticket and pay in five days, ten days, whichever he chose to do.\u201d This first testimony points up that Officer Ivery handled Tatum with an approach appropriate for a \u201ccollateral\u201d type offense, and that this was different from his approach for Mills. At trial, Officer Ivery testified that when he arrested Mills he did not ask whether Mills had sufficient money to post collateral for the offense (Tr. 47), and elaborated that Mills\u2019 violation was one that always required an arrest, unlike Tatum\u2019s, which permitted citation (Tr. 51). At the stationhouse, he made clear, Tatum\u2019s violation only required that I \u201chad to write a citation. I did not say I booked Mr. Tatum or proceeded or intended to book Mr. Tatum.\u201d (Tr. 52). In view of Officer Ivery\u2019s acknowledgement that he gave priority to the citation for Mr. Tatum because he had the choice of posting collateral, and particularly in view of the ample funds in Mr. Mills\u2019 possession, the foregoing record amply establishes that Mr. Mills was not given an opportunity to post collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">In addition, we note that there is not a glimmer of a suggestion in Officer Ivery\u2019s testimony \u2014 in either direct or cross-examination, either at the pre-trial hearing or at trial \u2014 that the booking of Mr. Mills, and conduct of an inventory search incident thereto, was accompanied by a reference, avowedly not accorded on the street, to any opportunity to post collateral. It was as part of the process of booking Mills that Ivery conducted the thorough search prescribed for persons \u201cbeing placed in confinement.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">At the trial, Officer Ivery related on direct examination that he walked through the front entrance to the rear of the stationhouse where he took custody of appellant, who had just been brought in the side entrance by the transporting officers, and brought appellant to the front desk. He continued (Trial Tr. 30):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-11\">A. At this time I proceeded to write two violations for having no D.C. permit and also Mr. Tatum permitting an unlicensed operator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-12\">Q. Did there ever come a time when you made a search?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-13\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-14\">Q. Will you tell us, please, if you will\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-15\">A. After completing the violations, normally we take the property from the prisoners that they may effect an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>escape or anything that he may have access to that would harm himself or some other person. This was taken away at the desk where he was standing, and usually I ask the prisoner if he will do this himself, and if they cooperate, then you don\u2019t have to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-4\">Q. What did he do in this case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-5\">A. Well, he cooperated and took everything out of his pockets and laid it on the counter and he was deprived use of it. And later I noticed his reluctance to pull his left hand out of his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-6\">Q. What did you do upon noticing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-7\">A. Then I asked him to take it out and he was still reluctant, so I assisted. So this is when this purse fell out of his pocket, black change purse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar6U\">He reiterated and amplified the procedure that had been followed in his answers on cross-examination (Trial Tr. 53-57):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-8\">\u201cA. First, I accepted the prisoner [Mills] [from the officers in the scout car] and brought him up to the counter and proceeded to write the citations, both for Mr. Mills and also for Mr. Tatum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-9\">Q. You accepted the prisoner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-11\">Q. Then you walked the prisoner up to the booking desk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-12\">A. Up to the area where we take the property. You could call it the booking desk. It is associated with the clerical positions in the area where the clerks work in the precinct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-20\">Q. Then after writing a citation for Mr. Tatum you searched Mills; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-21\">A. Well, after completing the citation for Mr. Mills, then I advised him to take everything out of his pockets, and the normal procedure is to lay it on the counter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-23\">Q. Did you personally conduct the search of Mr. Mills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-24\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-26\">Q. Now the search at the station house was what you would also call patting down the defendant; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-27\">A. No, this is a thorough search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-28\">Q. You found the narcotics after patting him down, searching for a weapon more or less at the station house, but you didn\u2019t find them on the street after patting him down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-29\">A. The station house was a more thorough search as I stated earlier. This is when you take the belt, jewelry, watches, rings, things of this nature. It is a complete search.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-30\">We have developed why this record leads us to a clear conviction that Mills was not given an opportunity to post collateral. We do not base that conclusion on Mill\u2019s testimony, though we think the conclusion is entirely consistent with his testimony, for reasons explained in the footnote,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> indeed is fortified by his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>Furthermore, it is not enough, as the District Judge seems to have supposed, for the Government to point to a bare possibility that Mills was given an opportunity to post collateral. As will be explained in the next section of the opinion, the police had a duty to advise defendant of his opportunity to post collateral for this minor offense, and at this suppression hearing the Government had the burden of showing that such opportunity was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">\n<em>Duty of Booking Officer To Advise Of Collateral Opportunity For Minor Offenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">When circumstances justify stationhouse detention, there is reason for some search of the person involved\u2014 putting aside, for present purposes, any attempt to grapple with the difficult questions of permissible occasion and extent of \u201cinventory\u201d searches. But it would be entirely unreasonable to hold that policemen have discretion to detain and therefore thoroughly search petty offenders like Mills, who may avoid stationhouse detention altogether by posting collateral. A huge proportion of the public is guilty of some sort of petty infraction almost every day \u2014 jaywalking, exceeding the 25-mph limit, using high beams, parking in a loading zone, among many others. Informing a person arrested for such a minor offense of his option to post collateral, and giving him an opportunity to exercise that option, is a necessary precondition to a thorough and complete search that is conducted only as an incident to the needs of sta-tionhouse detention.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">Our conclusions concerning the obligation of police to give \u201cnotice and opportunity\u201d to petty offenders of their option to post collateral are fortified by the fact that the stationhouse clerks who have the function of booking offenders <em>{supra </em>note 6) are also serving as acting clerks of court \u2014 formerly Court of General Sessions, now the Superior Court\u2014 during the hours when court is not in session. See 23 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 610, 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">If for some reason the police officer concludes that interests of the community require additional protection, established regulations and orders make clear that he cannot act solely on his own discretion. The Police Manual regulations provide ch. VIII, \u00a7 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-16\">The bond and collateral lists established by the Municipal Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>District of Columbia shall be strictly complied with by members of the Force and no member shall accept or require a greater or lesser collateral than that specified in these lists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">The order signed by Chief Judge Smith of the Court of General Sessions, effective April 19,1965, provides:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-5\">Whenever it shall appear to the police officer commanding a precinct, division or squad of the Police Department that, by reason of the special facts or circumstances of a case in which an arrest has been made by an officer under his command, the collateral set herein is inadequate to protect the interests of the community in the premises, he shall communicate by telephone or otherwise with a judge of [The Court of General Sessions] advising the judge of the facts and circumstances of the case for the purpose of having the judge set bond or collateral in a higher amount. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\"> When a person is charged with a collateral-type petty offense, under which he rightfully has the opportunity to post collateral and avoid further detention, and there is no probable cause to believe he committed a more serious crime, the police may not engage in an inventory search of the offender, or an equivalent direction that he empty his pockets, and seek to support it on the ground of holding him in further confinement, unless at a minimum he was timely notified of his opportunity to post collateral (and thus avoid further detention) and refused or was unable to do so. Assuming that, in the context of a motion to suppress, the presumption of regularity puts a burden on the defendant to come forward with some evidence that such an opportunity was not afforded, that burden is met, and the presumption is overcome, when, as here, defendant establishes that he had on his person money enough to post the necessary collateral. That put it to the Government, if it were to sustain the search as incident to stationhouse confinement, to make a showing that it accorded the opportunity to post collateral. There was no such showing by the Government. Indeed, as already stated, the total record \u2014 at trial and on remand \u2014 convinces us that no such opportunity was accorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">\n<em>Other Precedents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">While we know of no direct Federal circuit precedent, the views stated herein are in accord with opinions of other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">In California v. Mercurio, 10 Cal.App.3d 426, 88 Cal.Rptr. 750 (1970), a man arrested when he walked backward across a street against a \u201cdon\u2019t walk\u201d signal was taken to the police station, and was unable to produce satisfactory identification. He was required to undress, and a police search of his clothing disclosed a vial of marijuana. The court took account of the legislature\u2019s intent to allow a person arrested for this offense to post bail \u201cto avoid the indignity of jailing.\u201d 10 Cal.App.3d at 431, 88 Cal.Rptr. at 752. Although the arrest of appellant was lawful, \u201cthe failure of the officers to take him before ... a person accepting bail in accordance with schedule, deprived the subsequent jailhouse search of validity.\u201d 10 Cal.App.3d at 432, 88 Cal.Rptr. at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">In Carpio v.

But even the best of good faith cannot justify an unconstitutional search. The officer\u2019s order to appellant to empty his pockets was a stationhouse search which required a premise of stationhouse detention for its justification. When, as here, the arrest is for a minor offense for which the police must give defendant opportunity to post collateral, the defendant was detained notwithstanding he had funds sufficient to post collateral, and there is no showing that defendant was given opportunity to post collateral, any detention-based inventory justification is negatived, and the search must be held invalid. The evidence found as a result of that search was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Reversed and remanded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1292-10\">.

Almost four years after this case was tried in the district court the majority has retried it on issues that were raised for the first time by this court. Moreover, the majority has resolved those issues by brushing aside findings of the district court and resorting to speculation and surmise. I cannot agree to such procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">The appellant Mills was arrested and searched December 29, 1967. His motion to suppress was heard and overruled May 17, 1968 and he was tried and convicted on July 18 and 22, 1968. On his appeal before a division of this court he contended, as he had in the district court, that the search at the station-house was invalid because his arrest was a pretext adopted by the police to justify their search for narcotics. He did not claim that the police acted improperly in placing him in a cell; on the contrary his counsel accepted the premise that \u201cthere was a legitimate governmental interest, prior to Appellant\u2019s actual incarceration, in a more thorough search of him to insure that the jail remained free of weapons to guard against Appellant\u2019s escape, and to insure Appellant\u2019s own safety \u2014 the very reasons mentioned by Officer Ivery.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief, pps. 26, 27). On the premise that the appellant\u2019s incarceration was proper, a majority of the division rejected his claim that his arrest was a pretext, and held that the stationhouse search was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">The opinion of the division was vacated and on February 26, 1971 the case was reargued before the court sitting <em>en banc. </em>During the argument a new theory of the case was advanced from the bench, namely, that unless Mills was told that he might post collateral his incarceration and the preceding search were improper. Thereafter, on May 27, 1971, with four judges dissenting, the court remanded the case to the district court with directions that it \u201ctake evidence and make findings as to (1) Whether at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest it was the function of the station-house clerk or some other police officer, under either regulation, written or oral instruction, or general practice, to advise the defendant that his was an offense for which collateral could be post<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>ed; (2) Whether this information was given to defendant; and (3) If so, why defendant failed to post collateral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aky-dedup-0\">Pursuant to the order of remand the district court took evidence on June 24, 1971 and thereafter made findings of fact. The court found that established police procedure required the police to inform Mills that he might post collateral for the traffic offense. The court found, however, that the second and third questions posed by the remand order could not be answered. Specifically, the court found that notwithstanding the appellant\u2019s \u201capparent candor\u201d in answering certain questions on the subject his \u201cincontrovertible\u201d testimony was insufficient to support his counsel\u2019s \u201cassertion\u201d that he <em>\u201cclearly </em>was not given the opportunity to post collateral\u201d, (emphasis in original) The court concluded that whether Mills was given that opportunity remained \u201cunclear\u201d because (1) the stationhouse clerks and transporting officers on duty when Mills was booked were unable to recall what had occurred; (2) the government had been unable to locate two other officers who were present that night; (3) Craig Tatum, who was arrested with Mills, also had no recollection of the matter; and (4) Officer Ivery, the arresting officer, died in line of duty shortly after the trial of the case. In the circumstances the court found that questions two and three could not be answered, that any answers would require \u201cspeculation\u201d. The court did find, however, that Mills knew about the collateral system in general and knew that he could have posted collateral for the offense of not having a valid driver\u2019s permit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">The issues considered by the district court on remand were new issues, injected into the case for the first time by questions from the bench during the argument before this court. Having thus recast the case for the defense, the majority now brushes aside the conclusions of the district court on the new issues and makes its own finding that the police acted improperly. This finding is derived from the testimony of the appellant \u2014 hardly a disinterested witness \u2014-which the district judge found unconvincing and which the government, because of the lapse of years and through no fault of its own, was unable to controvert. In my judgment this is not the right way to dispose of a criminal appeal. I think we should decide the ease on the issues raised and the record made at the trial. We should not retry it years later on a new theory that germinated in appellate cloisters after the witnesses for one party died, forgot the facts, or became unavailable. A criminal appeal should not be turned into a new trial in which the theory and strategy of the defense are refashioned by appellate judges and a judgment of a district court is reversed on grounds that have never been fairly litigated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">. Mills was not a guileless innocent. He is now serving a sentence for violations of the federal narcotics laws that occurred on December 19, 20, and 28, 1967. <em>See </em>United States v. Mills, 149 U.S.App.D.C. 345, 463 F.2d 291 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1302-7\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"auf-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">I concur fully in Judge Robb\u2019s dissenting opinion, but I wish to add one further point. The majority reverses Mills\u2019 conviction by holding that the pre-detention inventory search which produced the evidence against him was illegal because he was not expressly offered the opportunity to avoid detention by posting collateral for the relatively minor offense for which he was being arrested. The reversal thus turns on the <em>single factual question </em>of whether he was given the opportunity to post collateral at the station house during the booking procedure that ultimately included the search declared illegal today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">As discussed more fully in Judge Robb\u2019s opinion, this question was neither raised nor decided in the trial below, thus necessitating the remand proceedings we ordered to examine the circumstances of Mills\u2019 booking. Because of Officer Ivery\u2019s intervening death and the inability of any other party to the book<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>ing procedure to recall any details thereof, the remand proceedings were almost wholly unproductive of relevant evidence concerning Mr. Mills\u2019 booking. Coupled with the majority\u2019s decision to entirely disregard Mr. Mills\u2019 version of the events leading to his search, we are left with no direct evidence in this record on the critical question of whether he was given the opportunity to post collateral. The majority\u2019s conclusion that Mills was denied that opportunity thus rests entirely on inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence of very limited probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Attempting to bolster their argument with testimony from the key Government witness \u2014 Officer Ivery \u2014 the majority, however, seeks to draw that inference from testimony that is not relevant to the question the majority opinion is based upon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-6\">At trial, Officer Ivery testified that when he arrested Mills he did not ask whether Mills had sufficient money to post collateral for the offense . . . (majority opinion at 12)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">The testimony to which this statement refers is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-9\">[Defense counsel]. Did you ask Mr. Mills whether or not he had sufficient money to post collateral for the offense you intended to charge him with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-10\">[Officer Ivery]. No, sir, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-11\">Q. At that point you called the scout car from the station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-12\">A. I called a scout ear as soon as I felt it was necessary. I don\u2019t know at what point it was. (Tr. 47-47a)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-13\">This colloquy referred only to the time when Officer Ivery initially stopped Mills on the street \u2014 before he had verified that Tatum, the registered owner of the car, had authorized Mills to drive it. At that point in time, the facts known to Officer Ivery required him to consider the possibility that the car might have been stolen. Since auto theft is not a minor offense for which collateral may be posted, Officer Ivery\u2019s failure to mention collateral to Mills at this time is absolutely irrelevant to the question of whether, having eliminated the possibility of such charges, Officer Ivery subsequently gave Mills the chance to post collateral at the station house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-16\">Following its summary of Officer Ivery\u2019s testimony, the majority opinion concludes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-17\">the foregoing record amply establishes that Mr. Mills was not given an opportunity to post collateral.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-18\">In addition, we note that there is not a glimmer of a suggestion in Officer Ivery\u2019s testimony \u2014 in either direct or cross-examination, either at the pretrial hearing or at trial \u2014 -that the booking of Mr. Mills, and conduct of an inventory search incident thereto, was accompanied by a reference, avowedly not accorded on the street, to any opportunity to post collateral, (majority opinion at 1237)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-19\">It is a grossly improper evaluation of the testimony to say that \u201cthe foregoing record <em>amply establishes\u201d </em>(emphasis added) the fact. The majority blithely ignores the fact that the reason Officer Ivery\u2019s testimony is devoid of such a suggestion is that he was <em>never </em>asked whether Mills had been given a chance to post collateral when he was booked. So it is equally true that Officer Ivery\u2019s testimony reveals \u201cnot a glimmer of a suggestion\u201d that Mr. Mills was <em>not </em>accorded \u201cany opportunity to post collateral\u201d at the station house. The majority\u2019s conclusion is at best completely speculative and at the worst plainly erroneous. The direct evidence in the record, both at trial and at the remand hearing, is wholly silent on the question of Mills\u2019 opportunity to post collateral. To the extent that the majority relies on Officer Ivery\u2019s testimony, it reaches a conclusion on an issue that was not being litigated and concerning which the witness never addressed himself. His intervening death makes the majority\u2019s use of his testimony to support their speculative inference a matter of great consequence \u2014 to this case and to our</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>system of justice. It refuses to conform to established appellate procedures in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">I am authorized to state that Judge Robb concurs in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1304-5\">WILKEY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"avp-dedup-1\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">I concur in the dissent of Judge Robb. I also would like to state briefly an additional reason. My analysis of the facts relied on by the majority is:</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">1. At the stationhouse the defendant Mills knew he had a right to post collateral and avoid confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">2. The defendant apparently was under a misapprehension that he would be detained at the stationhouse, whether he was able to post collateral or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">3. The defendant failed to clear up his own misapprehension by asserting his known rights to post collateral and thus avoid detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-10\">4. If the defendant had said \u201cI want to post collateral,\u201d on the version of the evidence necessarily relied on by the majority opinion itself, it is clear that defendant would have been released without the search which took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-11\">5. A reasonable routine administrative search cannot be vitiated because the defendant himself failed to speak up. The test is- not as the majority considers it, whether the police officer spoke up\u2014 the purpose of that would be to <em>inform </em>the defendant of his right to post collateral. This the defendant <em>already knew.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-12\">6. Finally, <em>the police officer knew that the defendant knew! </em>The defendant had loaned the money and had seen his friend Tatum post collateral and be released, all in the presence of the police officer. So there was <em>no reason </em>for the police officer to speak up and tell the defendant Mills what he must have already known.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-13\">In my view, it is sufficiently irrational to exclude evidence and permit \u201c[t]he criminal . . . to go free because the constable has blundered,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> yet the courts occasionally do it because that is the law established by the Supreme Court. But in Mills\u2019 case, it wasn\u2019t the constable who blundered \u2014 it was the criminal! By what rationality, then, should the criminal go free?</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1304-15\">. See People v.
