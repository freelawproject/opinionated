The district court found jurisdiction lacking under the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">I. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The relevant facts, drawn from the complaint and the parties\u2019 stipulation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Plaintiff is a \u201cproducer-handler<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of fluid milk in the Phoenix, Arizona, marketing area. In March 1965 he introduced \u201cGo\u201d into that market. \u201cGo\u201d is made in Arizona by adding local water to other ingredients, including dried milk, brought in from other states. The product was well received. During 1968 sales totaled 863,377y2 gallons, and profits $36,720.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-14\">\u201cThe plaintiff is, and at all times relevant to this action has been, engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling a beverage product called \u2018Go\u2019. All ingredients, with the exception of water, used in the manufacture of \u2018Go\u2019 are purchased by plaintiff from outside of the State of Arizona and are delivered to him at his Glendale, Arizona plant. Then, in Arizona, plaintiff combines and processes these ingredients with Arizona water, manufacturing the j)roduct \u2018Go\u2019. Plaintiff sells \u2018Go\u2019 exclusively within the State of Arizona, \u2018Go\u2019 being a filled milk banned from interstate commerce under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 61, 62. There are no other business activities of plaintiff which are alleged to be restrained by defendants\u2019 acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-16\">In December 1966 defendants entered into a conspiracy to restrain trade and create a monopoly by driving plaintiff\u2019s \u201cGo\u201d and other filled milk beverages from the Arizona market. Defendants agreed to accomplish this purpose by (1) causing the Central Arizona Milk Marketing Order to be amended to reclassify \u201cGo\u201d and other filled milk products as \u201cClass I\u201d milk, knowing that the resulting increase in cost would prohibit sale of these products:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) sponsoring legislation to eliminate filled milk products from Arizona markets and create a whole milk monopoly; (3) engaging in a widespread false advertising campaign, misrepresenting and disparaging \u201cGo\u201d and other similar filled milk products;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (4) causing defendant Ezra Odie, Dairy Commissioner of the State of Arizona and also a director of the United Dairymen of Arizona, to issue in his official capacity certain regulations restricting and conditioning the manufacture, labeling, display, and sale of \u201cGo\u201d and other filled milk products.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-17\">Two lines of commerce are involved. The first line of commerce \u201cinvolved, burdened, and restrained and otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>illegally controlled\u201d by defendants is \u201cthat portion of the Interstate Commerce in which milk is produced in the State of Arizona and in other States and thereafter shipped to purchasers in the State of Arizona for the purpose of processing, pasteurizing, manufacturing and offering for sale to the consumers in the State of Arizona and elsewhere.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The second line of commerce is that in which \u201cGo\u201d \u2019s out-of-state ingredients flow into Arizona, are combined with local water, and are sold and distributed in the Arizona Marketing Area as \u201cGo.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[E]very ingredient used in the manufacture of the product \u2018Go,\u2019 other than Arizona water, is wholly produced, manufactured and moves in interstate commerce from States outside Arizona into Arizona . . . for delivery to [plaintiff] ... in Phoenix, Arizona.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The Secretary of Agriculture has determined that the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d in milk constitutes interstate commerce, and that all activities \u201cin the field of milk or activities related thereto\u201d burden, obstruct, or interfere with this stream of interstate commerce in milk and therefore are subject to regulation by the Secretary under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c. The Secretary has further determined that plaintiff\u2019s activities in processing and selling \u201cGo\u201d are either in this stream of interstate commerce or burden, obstruct, and interfere with it, and therefore are subject to regulation by the Secretary under the provisions of the statute. The acts of the defendants complained of were based upon, or were related to, the Central Arizona Milk Marketing Order, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1131, issued by the Secretary under the statute to regulate this stream of commerce.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Finally, plaintiff alleges that defendants\u2019 wrongful acts were \u201cin aid of and in pursuance of the design of monopolization, price enhancement, restifling and restriction of competition\u201d in the described commerce, and \u201cwere for the purpose of injuring Plaintiffs\u2019 business and property and to restrain trade and to create a real milk monopoly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">II. <em>The Ruling Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaB\">Focusing on the second of the two lines of commerce allegedly restrained \u2014commerce in \u201cGo\u201d and its ingredients \u2014the district court held plaintiff\u2019s allegations insufficient as a matter of law to give the court subject-matter jurisdiction under the Sherman Act. According to the court, \u201cplaintiff\u2019s business is of a local nature and interstate commerce is not substantially and adversely affected by an alleged re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>straint applied to that business simply because plaintiff uses ingredients in his product which are produced out of state.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">In the discussion that follows, the jurisdictional test to be applied under the Sherman Act is first defined. The test is then applied to the line of commerce with which the district court was primarily concerned \u2014 the one involving \u201cGo\u201d and its ingredients. Finally, the test is applied to the other allegedly affected line of commerce \u2014 the one in fluid milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">III. <em>The Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\u201cThat Congress [in passing the Sherman Act] wanted to go to the utmost extent of its Constitutional power in restraining trust and monopoly agreements . . . admits of little, if any, doubt. The purpose was to use that power to make of ours, so far as Congress could under our dual system, a competitive business economy.\u201d United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Ass\u2019n, 322 U.S. 533, 558-559, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 1176, 88 L.Ed. 1440 (1944).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The reach of the Sherman Act is \u201cas inclusive as the constitutional limits of Congress\u2019 power to regulate commerce.\u201d Report of the Attorney General\u2019s National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 62 (1955). As judicial construction of the commerce clause has expanded over the years to reflect changing evaluations of the necessary scope of the federal commerce power, so too has the reach of the Sherman Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">In short, the conduct of the defendants is within the jurisdictional reach of the Sherman Act if Congress can prohibit that conduct under the commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">Before this general test is particularized, an important distinction should be stressed \u2014 the distinction between the jurisdictional question, with which we are concerned, and the question of whether, in other respects, a substantive violation of the Sherman Act is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-18\">The two problems are frequently confused, and understandably so. <em>See </em>P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 59-60 (Little, Brown &amp; Co. 1967). Section 1 of the Act prohibits contracts, combinations, and conspiracies \u201cin restraint of trade or commerce among the several States.\u201d This single cryptic phrase defines both the conduct prohibited by the Act and . the statute\u2019s jurisdictional reach. As the Court explained in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 494-495, 60 S.Ct. 982, 992, 84 L.Ed. 1311 (1940): \u201c[T]he phrase \u2018restraint of trade\u2019 which . . . had a well-understood meaning at common law, was made the means of defining the activities prohibited. The addition of the words \u2018or commerce among the several states\u2019 was not an additional kind of restraint to be prohibited by the Sherman Act but was the means used to relate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>prohibited restraint of trade to interstate commerce for constitutional purposes. . . . \u201d The same general distinction is drawn in Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 235, 68 S.Ct. 996, 92 L.Ed. 1328 (1948), and United States v. Women\u2019s Sportswear Manufacturers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 336 U.S. 460, 461-462, 69 S.Ct. 714, 93 L.Ed. 805 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Whether a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes a substantive Sherman Act violation is entirely a matter of congressional definition: Is the defendant\u2019s conduct the type of conduct Congress intended to prohibit? Is that conduct a \u201crestraint of trade\u201d within the meaning of section 1, or an \u201cattempt\u201d or \u201cconspiracy\u201d to \u201cmonopolize trade\u201d within the meaning of section 2? The jurisdictional question, on the other hand, concerns Congress\u2019 power to reach the defendant\u2019s conduct: \u201c[T]he restraint must \u2018occur in or affect commerce between the states . . . <em>for constitutional reasons.\u2019 \u201d </em>Klor\u2019s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 255 F.2d 214, 224 (9th Cir. 1958) (emphasis added), <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>359 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959), quoting and discussing Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">We are concerned in this case only with the jurisdictional question. We assume, but expressly do not decide, that the conduct charged constituted a \u201crestraint of trade,\u201d or an \u201cattempt\u201d or \u201cconspiracy\u201d to \u201cmonopolize trade.\u201d Our sole inquiry is whether the prohibition of that conduct falls within \u201cthe utmost extent of [Congress\u2019] . Constitutional power.\u201d United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters\u2019 Ass\u2019n, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">On its face, this test is extremely broad. Congress\u2019 power over interstate commerce is plenary, encompassing not only the regulation of interstate commerce itself, but all measures \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d to that end, including the regulation of commerce that is purely intrastate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">The \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d standard is met if the regulated conduct has a \u201csubstantial economic effect\u201d upon interstate commerce. As the Court said in Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. III, 125, 63 S.Ct. 82, 89, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942): \u201c[E]ven if . . . [the] activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce, and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as \u2018direct\u2019 or \u2018indirect\u2019.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Or as the Court said in Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 255, 85 S.Ct. 348, 356 3 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964), quoting Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 196-197, 6 L.Ed. 23(1824): \u201c[T]he determinative test of the exercise of power by the Congress under the Commerce Clause is simply whether the activity sought to be regulated is \u2018commerce which concerns more States than one\u2019 and has a real and substantial relation to the national interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">As the wording of these passages suggests, the power of Congress over commerce among the states is not a \u201ctechnical legal conception,\u201d divorced from economic reality. <em>See </em>United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters\u2019 Ass\u2019n, <em>supra, </em>322 U.S. at 547, 64 S.Ct. at 1170. \u201c[T]he conditions of transportation and commerce have changed dramatically\u201d over the years, and the constitutional principle must be applied \u201cto the present state of commerce.\u201d Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 251, 85 S.Ct. at 354. As Justice Cardozo noted in his dissent in Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 328, 56 S.Ct. 855, 880, 80 L.Ed. 1160 (1936), the words and phrases used to define the commerce power must be interpreted \u201cwith suppleness of adaptation and flexibility of meaning. The power is as broad as the need that evokes it.\u201d Whether the requisite \u201csubstantial economic effect\u201d or \u201csubstantial relation to the national interest\u201d is present or absent is a practical, case-by-ease economic judgment, not a conclusion derived from application of abstract or mechanistic formulae. Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal Sugar Co., <em>supra, </em>334 U.S. at 232-233, 68 S.Ct. 996; United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters\u2019 Ass\u2019n, <em>supra, </em>322 U.S. at 546-547, 64 S.Ct. 1162; Wickard v. Filburn, <em>supra, </em>317 U.S. at 119-125, 63 S.Ct. 82.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>A demonstrable quantitative effect is not necessary-: \u201c[T]he power of Congress to promote interstate commerce also includes the power to regulate the local incidents thereof, including local activities . . . which <em>might </em>have a substantial and harmful effect upon that commerce.\u201d Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 258, 85 S.Ct. at 358 (emphasis added): '</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In essence, the test is whether \u201c[t]he facts of the particular situation determine . . . [that the] relationship to interstate commerce is too tenuous in a practical sense to warrant federal control.\u201d <em>See </em>Stern, The Commerce Clause and the National Economy, 1933-1946 (Part 1), 59 Harv. L.Rev. 645, 673 (1946) (discussing Justice Cardozo\u2019s dissent in Carter v. Carter Coal Co., <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">A caveat is in order. When Congress itself determines that particular conduct adversely affects interstate commerce, the courts defer to Congress\u2019 judgment so long as there is \u201ca rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary, to the protection of commerce. . . . \u201d Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 303-304, 85 S.Ct. 377, 13 L.Ed.2d 290 (1964).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, under the Sherman Act, \u201cCongress has . . . left it to the courts to determine whether the intrastate activities have the prohibited effect on . [interstate] commerce. . . . \u201d United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 120, 61 S.Ct. 451, 460, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941). While the underlying standard remains the same, the judicial function is not that of reviewing a decision made by Congress, but rather that of determining in the first instance whether the facts permit the exercise of power under the commerce clause. The court may not stop with a determination that there would be a \u201crational basis\u201d for regulating the defendant\u2019s conduct. The court must itself decide whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is sufficiently related to interstate commerce to justify the prohibition of that conduct as \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d to the protection of interstate commerce against the presumed economic burdens resulting from the anticompetitive practices.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">IV. <em>Commerce in \u201cGo\u201d and Its Ingredients</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">We turn to whether the complaint, read in the light of the stipulated facts, alleges conduct having a sufficient impact upon interstate commerce in the ingredients of \u201cGo\u201d to bring it within the regulatory power of Congress under the commerce clause, as manifested in the Sherman Act. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-18\">It may be that the sale of \u201cGo\u201d occurs \u201cin\u201d interstate commerce \u2014 that the overall chain of events, from the shipment of dried milk and other ingredients into Arizona from other states to the ultimate sale of \u201cGo\u201d to retailers and consumers in Arizona, constitutes a single \u201cflow of commerce\u201d for jurisdictional purposes. <em>See, e. g., </em>Cartrade, Inc. v. Ford Dealers Advertising Ass'n, 446 F.2d 289, 292 (9th Cir. 1971); Plymouth Dealers Ass'n v. United States, 279 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>128, 135 (9th Cir. 1960); Las Vegas Merchant Plumbers Ass\u2019n v. United States, 210 F.2d 732, 740-41 (9th Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Although \u201cGo\u201d is processed and sold entirely within the State of Arizona, the only locally derived ingredient is Arizona water. All of the remaining ingredients, including nonfat dried milk, originate out of state. Thus, for all practical purposes, the out-of-state ingredients <em>are </em>\u201cGo.\u201d Although local water is the major ingredient of \u201cGo\u201d by volume and weight, in economic terms \u201cGo\u201d consists almost wholly of the ingredients that move in interstate commerce. The fact that those ingredients are not combined until they reach plaintiff\u2019s Arizona plant is not enough to interrupt the practical continuity of the movement. <em>See </em>Plymouth Dealers Ass\u2019n v. United States, <em>supra, </em>279 F.2d at 135; Las Vegas Merchant Plumbers Ass\u2019n v. United States, <em>supra, </em>210 F.2d at 740-741.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Even if \u201cGo\u201d is not actually \u201cin commerce,\u201d however, the relationship between defendants\u2019 conduct in suppressing the sale of \u201cGo\u201d and a restraint upon interstate commerce in \u201cGo\u201d \u2019s ingredients is, in a realistic business sense, close and substantial. If defendants are successful in preventing the sale of \u201cGo\u201d and other Arizona-made filled milk products in the State of Arizona, those products cannot be sold at all.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The quantitative effect on the overall interstate flow of dried milk and other ingredients is not alleged. But it is the nature of the effect that is important: to whatever extent, it is certain that the flow of \u201cGo\u201d \u2019s ingredients into Arizona <em>will </em>be diminished by an anti-competitive restraint imposed on a product substantially composed of those ingredients. And the states in which those ingredients originate are powerless to protect their commerce against this diminution. Such an \u201ceffect\u201d is \u201csubstantial\u201d for the purpose of the commerce clause; it has a \u201creal and substantial relationship to the national interest\u201d in a competitive economy as expressed in the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Defendants argue, however, that (1) the fact that their conduct applied only to the sale of \u201cGo\u201d and not to the sale of its imported ingredients does make a difference; and (2) in any case, those ingredients \u201ccame to rest\u201d in Arizona prior to sale as the end-product \u201cGo.\u201d Given a determination that defendants\u2019 conduct \u201csubstantially affects\u201d the interstate commerce in \u201cGo\u201d \u2019s ingredients in a realistic business sense, neither of these mechanistic objections has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">It is certainly no bar to jurisdiction under the Sherman Act that defendants\u2019 conduct applied only to the sale of \u201cGo\u201d rather than directly to the sale of its ingredients. This is clear from Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., <em>supra, </em>334 U.S. 219, 68 S.Ct. 996. An agreement among producers of sugar fixing the price paid to farmers for sugar beets grown in California was held to be within the Sherman Act even though the beets did not move in interstate commerce but were processed into sugar in California refineries before the sugar was shipped to other states. This result was held to follow from the economic fact that an agreement fixing the price paid for beets necessarily affected interstate commerce in sugar. To argue to the contrary, the Court said, \u201c[very nearly] denies that the price of beets and restrictions upon it have any substantial relation in fact or in legal significance for the statute\u2019s purposes to the price of sugar sold interstate, when the restrictions take place within the confines of a single state and before the interstate marketing process begins.\u201d 334 U.S. at 228-229, 68 S.Ct. at 1002. It would equally ignore business reality to deny that exclusion of \u201cGo\u201d from the Arizona market has \u201cany substantial relation in fact or in legal significance\u201d to the interstate commerce in the dried milk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>other ingredients from which, by the addition of local water, \u201cGo\u201d is made. This is no less true because the processing occurred after the interstate shipment rather than before, as we explicitly held in Las Vegas Merchant Plumbers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. United States, <em>supra, </em>210 F.2d at 741-742. <em>See </em>Plymouth Dealers Ass\u2019n v. United States, <em>supra, </em>279 F.2d at 135. <em>See also </em>Cartrade, Inc. v. Ford Dealers Advertising Ass\u2019n, <em>supra, </em>446 F.2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Nor is the Sherman Act inapplicable merely because the imported ingredients \u201ccome to rest\u201d at plaintiff\u2019s Arizona plant prior to the point at which defendants\u2019 conduct had its initial impact. If the \u201ccome-to-rest\u201d doctrine is applicable to Sherman Act cases at all,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it is relevant only to whether defendants\u2019 acts occurred \u201cin\u201d interstate commerce. In Burke v. Ford, 389 U.S. 320, 88 S.Ct. 443, 19 L.Ed.2d 554 (1967), the defendants argued that an agreement among Oklahoma liquor wholesalers to divide the Oklahoma market was not within the Sherman Act\u2019s jurisdictional reach because \u201cthe liquor \u2018came to rest\u2019 in the wholesalers\u2019 warehouses and . . . interstate commerce ceased at that point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 88 S.Ct. at 444. \u201c[W]hatever the validity of that conclusion,\u201d said the Court, \u201cit does not end the matter. For it is well established that an activity which does not itself occur <em>in </em>interstate commerce comes within the scope of the Sherman Act if it substantially <em>affects </em>interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present ease, plaintiff has alleged a sufficient relationship between defendants\u2019 alleged conduct and the interstate commerce in \u201cGo\u201d \u2019s ingredients to justify a holding that that conduct \u201csubstantially affects\u201d interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">We must therefore reject defendants\u2019 specific objections to Sherman Act jurisdiction. We recognize, however, that there must be some limit on the intrusiveness of Sherman Act regulation. Since every enterprise, however localized, inevitably has some effect, however remote, on the flow of commerce among the states, some \u201clocalness,\u201d \u201cremoteness,\u201d or \u201cde minimis\u201d factor must intervene or federal regulation is boundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">This is the underlying theme of Page v. Work, 290 F.2d 323 (9th Cir. 1961), and Sun Valley Disposal Co. v. Silver State Disposal Co., 420 F.2d 341 (9th Cir. 1969), relied upon by defendants. <em>Page </em>and <em>Sun Valley Disposal </em>involved local businesses using supplies drawn from the stream of interstate commerce. We recognized that interference with those businesses inevitably had some interstate effect.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We held, nonetheless, that this effect was \u201cincidental,\u201d and did not justify federal regulation of competitive restraints imposed on businesses that were \u201cwholly local in character.\u201d <em>See </em>Sun Valley Disposal Co. v. Silver State Disposal Co., <em>supra, </em>420 F.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">There is no bright line dividing cases in which the effect upon interstate commerce is sufficient to permit Congress to prohibit particular anticompetitive activity under the commerce clause from those cases in which it is not sufficient. In this area perhaps more than in most, each ease must turn on its own facts. As the limits of Congress\u2019 power to regulate interstate commerce are approached, deciding the category in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>a particular case falls becomes a matter of degree.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We think it is reasonably clear, however, that the justification for federal control of the anticompetitive activity in this case is stronger than in either <em>Page </em>or <em>Sun Valley Disposal Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The anticompetitive conduct involved in <em>Page </em>was directed at controlling the sale of legal advertising in Los Angeles County, California. The sale, publication, and distribution of the legal advertising was confined to Los Angeles County. The interstate commerce relied upon was movement of newsprint, ink, and other supplies to a local newspaper deprived of such advertising. The court\u2019s conclusion that the restraint upon competition in the sale of legal advertising had only an \u201cinconsequential, remote, or fortuitous\u201d impact upon this line of interstate commerce, 290 F.2d at 332, is not inconsistent with our conclusion that the deliberate exclusion of \u201cGo\u201d from the market would have a substantial impact on interstate commerce in the only economically significant ingredients of that very product. There is a clear difference between the cases, albeit one of degree, in the justification for federal control of the particular anticompetitive activity as a means of protecting the particular line of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">This is also true of <em>Sun Valley Disposal Co. </em>The activity of the defendants in that case was directed at eliminating competition in the garbage pickup and disposal service in Clark County, Nevada. Some of the supplies used in furnishing these services, notably the garbage containers, moved in interstate commerce. \u201cThis fact alone,\u201d the court said, \u201cdoes not turn what was really a local activity into an interstate one.\u201d 420 F.2d at 343. The opinion discloses none of the underlying business facts upon which this conclusion rests, and it may well be that the supplies moving in interstate commerce were an economically insignificant part of the total service rendered. A barber\u2019s scissors and other supplies may move in interstate commerce, but \u201cthis fact alone\u201d might not justify federal regulation of the price of a haircut, or give an antitrust claim to a barber forced out of business by a combination of other barbers in the community. In the present case, on the other hand, ingredients that move in interstate commerce represent the greater part of the value of \u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">In essence, this case differs from <em>Sun Valley Disposal </em>in the same way it differs from <em>Page. </em>The basic issue in each of the three cases is the extent to which a prohibition of the defendants\u2019 specific conduct is justifiable as a means of protecting the specific line of interstate commerce involved. Approached on these terms, the relation between the restraint of competition in the distribution of the end-product \u201cGo\u201d and the flow of \u201cGo\u201d \u2019s interstate ingredients is clearly more substantial than the relation between either <em>Page\u2019s </em>restraint of competition in legal advertising and the flow of its interstate ingredients or <em>Sun Valley Disposal\u2019s </em>restraint of competition in trash service and the flow of its interstate ingredients. The fact that the conduct to be prohibited is directed against the distribution of \u201cGo\u201d itself, and that all of \u201cGo\u201d \u2019s economically significant ingredients derive from a line of interstate commerce, makes the prohibition of that conduct more clearly reasonable as a means of protecting the particular line of interstate commerce.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>We conclude that a sufficient relationship appears from the complaint and stipulated facts between the restraint allegedly imposed by defendants and interstate commerce in \u201cGo\u201d and its ingredients to establish jurisdiction under the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">V. <em>Commerce in Fluid Milk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We next consider whether defendants\u2019 conduct falls within the jurisdictional reach of the Sherman Act because of the alleged relationship between that conduct and the second line of interstate commerce described in the complaint \u2014 the movement of fluid milk into Arizona from other states for processing, and, after processing, to points in Arizona and other states for sale. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">As we have noted, plaintiff alleges that fluid milk flows in interstate commerce into and out of Arizona. It is the premise of the complaint that \u201cGo\u201d and other filled milk products compete with fluid milk in the Arizona market. Plaintiff alleges that the purpose and effect of defendants\u2019 conduct was to exclude this competition, and thereby to restrain and monopolize the interstate commerce in fluid milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Prohibiting a conspiracy to exclude filled milk from the Arizona milk market is a \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d means to the successful exercise of Congress\u2019 plenary power to regulate interstate</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">commerce in fluid milk. Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct would have a significant, if unpredictable, impact upon interstate commerce in fluid milk: the overall supply of milk and milk substitutes in the Arizona market would be diminished; presumably, the price of fluid milk would rise; the quantity of Arizona-produced fluid milk available for export to other states would decrease, or the quantity of fluid milk brought into Arizona from other states would increase.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The specific consequences may be speculative, but the reality of the economic impact is not. Plaintiff notes that the Secretary of Agriculture has included filled milk in the Milk Marketing Order for the Central Arizona Marketing Area, <em>see </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1131.18, and that this necessarily means that the Secretary has determined that filled milk is either in the current of interstate commerce, or \u201cdirectly burdens, obstructs, or affects interstate commerce\u201d in milk, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c(l). <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra. </em>Defendants concede that this is so, but argue that the Secretary\u2019s determination under the Agricultural Adjustment Act is somehow different from that the court must make under the Sherman Act. The condition imposed by the proviso in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c(l) upon the Secretary\u2019s right to regulate, however, is the same condition that must be satisfied before conduct may be regulated by Congress under the commerce clause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>As noted earlier, the underlying standard remains constant whether applied by an administrative agency or a court. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Darby, <em>supra, </em>312 U.S. at 119-120, 61 S.Ct. 451. The Secretary\u2019s determination may not bind the court, but it at least adds substance to plaintiff\u2019s jurisdictional allegations. <em>See </em>Katzenbach v. McClung, <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 299-301, 304, 85 S.Ct. 377, Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 252-253, 85 S.Ct. 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Congress\u2019 power to regulate defendants\u2019 conduct because of its impact upon interstate commerce in fluid milk does not depend in any way upon finding an interstate aspect in plaintiff\u2019s business of producing and selling \u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">It makes no difference how \u201clocal\u201d plaintiff\u2019s business may be in this sense \u2014defendants\u2019 conduct would fall within the Sherman Act even if all ingredients of \u201cGo\u201d originated within Arizona. The Sherman Act applies because defendants\u2019 suppression of plaintiff\u2019s business substantially affects interstate commerce in fluid milk; nothing else is required. \u201c[T]he marketing of a local product in competition with that of a like commodity moving interstate may so interfere with interstate commerce or its regulation as to afford a basis for Congressional regulation of the intrastate activity. It is the effect upon the interstate commerce or its regulation, regardless of the particular form which the competition may take, which is the test of federal power.\u201d United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U.S. 110, 120, 62 S.Ct. at 526 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We conclude that the complaint alleges a sufficient relationship between the restraint imposed upon commerce in \u201cGo\u201d and other filled milk, and interstate commerce in fluid milk, to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the Sherman Act, even assuming that the commerce in \u201cGo\u201d and other filled milk is wholly intrastate.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-12\">. <em>See 7 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1131.18 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-13\">.
