Contractors\u2019 Association, apparently a multi-employer bargaining group of which ap-pellee Kunco, Inc. is a member. The provision of the contract in issue is paragraph ten, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-19\">\u201cThe Union will furnish, if requested by the contractor, duly qualified workmen in the various classifications covered by this agreement, in sufficient number as may be necessary to properly perform work contracted for by the contractor, in the manner and under the conditions specified in this agreement. Men may be requested by name, and shall be referred, if the man requested has worked for the calling contractor within the past twelve (12) months in the jurisdiction of Local No. 107, unless employed elsewhere at the time of the request. The Union will maintain a register of all persons who desire work of any classification covered by this contract. <em>Such register shall be maintained without discrimination as to </em>race, col- or or <em>status of membership. Contractors agree that no person shall be employed on any job covered by this agreement except such persons as shall be referred from the register so maintained. </em>Provided further, however, that nothing in this contract shall prevent the employment by the contractor of nonregistered persons at any time when no men are available from the register so maintained. Available means reporting to work within eighteen (18) hours following request by the contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-20\">Appendix pp. 3-4 (emphasis supplied.) A reading of that paragraph, especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the emphasized portion, shows that on its face it creates an exclusive, but non-diseriminatory, hiring hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The complaint alleged that Kunco was refusing to adhere to paragraph ten and therefore prayed for injunctive relief and damages. Kunco moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted; Kunco\u2019s theory being the contractual provision is void under Arkansas\u2019 \u201cright-to-work law,\u201d Ark.Const.Amd. 34; \u00a7 81-203 Ark. Stat., and that this law is valid under \u00a7 14(b). The district court, 344 F.Supp. 626, agreed with Kunco and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164(b), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201c(b) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as authorizing the execution or application of agreements requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment in any State or Territory in which such execution or application is prohibited by State or Territorial law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">This statute can best be described as an exception to the general rule that the federal government has preempted the field of labor relations regulation. <em>See, e. g., </em>Retail Clerks Int\u2019l v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96, 99-102, 84 S.Ct. 219, 11 L.Ed.2d 179 (1963). It makes \u201cclear and unambiguous the purpose of Congress not to preempt the field . \u2018in this regard so as to deprive the states of their powers to prevent compulsory unionism.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 101, 101 n. 9, 84 S.Ct. at 221, <em>quoting </em>H.R.Rep.No.510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 60. Thus, the Key issue in this case is whether the hiring hall <em>sub judice </em>is a form of \u201ccompulsory unionism\u201d which \u00a7 14(b) allows states to prohibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">The Arkansas Supreme Court has apparently answered that question in the affirmative, holding that even nondiscriminatory hiring halls violate the state\u2019s \u201cright-to-work law.\u201d That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0cV\">\u201cNo person, . . . corporation, or labor organization shall enter into any contract to exclude from employment . . . persons who are not members of, or who <em>fail or refuse </em>to join, or <em>affiliate with, </em>a labor union . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">\u00a7 81-203 Ark.Stat. (emphasis supplied.) Reasoning that a union operated hiring hall, if exclusive, forces a worker \u201cto affiliate with\u201d the union merely by signing the hiring hall register, the Arkansas Court held that even nondiscriminatory exclusive hiring halls violate the Arkansas law. Kaiser v. Price-Fewell, Inc., 235 Ark. 295, 359 S.W.2d 449 (Ark.1962),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> noted in 17 Ark.L.Rev. 98 (1962). The question here is whether \u00a7 14(b) authorizes that prohibition. We think it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-16\">Section 14(b) does not empower states to ban all involuntary relationships between workers and unions. It merely allows the prohibition of \u201cagreements requiring <em>membership </em>in a labor organization as a condition of employment . . . .\u201d29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164 (b) (emphasis supplied). A hiring hall which, though exclusive, does not require union membership does not violate the closed shop prohibition of \u00a7 8 (a)(3), Local 357, Int\u2019l. Bhd. Teamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 835, 6 L.Ed.2d 11 (1961), and thus, <em>a for-tiori, </em>it is not within the ambit of \u00a7 14(b). <em>Cf., </em>Retail Clerks Int\u2019l v. NLRB, 373 U.S. 746, 751-752, 83 S.Ct. 1461, 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>L.Ed.2d 678 (1963).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is the view of two circuits which have squarely held that \u00a7 14(b) does not empower states to prohibit nondiscriminatory exclusive hiring halls. NLRB v. Tom Joyce Floors, Inc., 353 F.2d 768 (9th Cir. 1965); NLRB v. Houston Chapter, AGC, 349 F.2d 449 (5th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 1026, 86 S.Ct. 648, 15 L.Ed.2d 540 (1966). Of course, in both those cases the cause arose via unfair labor practice charges within the NLRB rather than a suit, as here, under \u00a7 301 (a) of the Act. However, the charge in both cases was refusal to bargain on a union demand for an exclusive, nondiscriminatory hiring hall; and the defense in each instance was that since there is no duty to bargain on an illegal demand, NLRB v. Wooster Div. of Borg-Warner Corp., 356 U.S. 342, 360, 78 S.Ct. 718, 2 L.Ed.2d 823 (1958) (Harlan concurring), there was no duty to bargain on this demand because, as here, the applicable and allegedly valid state \u201cright-to-work law\u201d had been judicially construed to prohibit even nondiscriminatory, exclusive hiring halls. Accordingly, the dispositive question in both those cases, as here, was whether \u00a7 14(b) authorized the state statutory prohibition. Thus, the eases are squarely in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In sum, a nondiscriminatory hiring hall, even if exclusive, does not compel union membership and is therefore not within the grant of power left to the states by \u00a7 14(b). Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\">. Appellant contends alternatively that the hiring hall <em>sub judiee </em>is distinguishable from that in <em>Price-Fewell </em>because there the register was categorized and to achieve more lucrative categories a worker had to pass examinations prepared and administered by the union. Appellant contends the absence here of such \u201caffiliation\u201d distinguishes this case. However, because of the manner in which we decide the federal question in this case, we deem it unnecessary to decide the question of state statutory construction implicit in distinguishing <em>Price-Fewell.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-6\">. The district court was of the opinion that, because the Supreme Court denied certiorari in <em>Price-Fewell </em>subsequent to deciding <em>Teamsters, </em>the denial of certiorari \u201cin effect held there was no preemption . . . \u201d applicable here. Appendix at 29. That view, of course, is patently incorrect. \u201cThe denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case, as the bar has been told many times.\u201d United States v. Carver, 260 U.S. 482, 490, 43 S.Ct. 181, 182, 67 L.Ed. 361 (1923). \u201c[A] denial of certiorari means only that, for one reason or another, . there were not four members of the Court who thought the case should be heard.\u201d Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 492, 73 S.Ct. 397, 439, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (Frankfurter concurring). <em>Accord, </em>United States v. Kras, 409 U.S. 434, 93 S.Ct. 631, 34 L.Ed.2d 626 (1973) ; Parker v. Ellis, 362 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 909, 4 L.Ed.2d 963 (1960) ; Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, 338 U.S. 912, 917-920, 70 S.Ct. 252, 94 L.Ed. 562 (1950) (Frankfurter concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
