Appellant brought the suit as a class action, alleging employment discrimination under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Appel-lee moved to suppress appellant\u2019s interrogatories, claiming in the most general of terms that the interrogatories as a whole were \u201coppressive\u201d and \u201cunduly burdensome\u201d and that they sought \u201cimmaterial\u201d information. Appellee also moved to dismiss appellant\u2019s suit on the grounds that it was not properly maintainable as a class action and that appellant had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Appellee transmitted to the district judge (but apparently never caused to be formally filed) a memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss, supported by affidavits. Nowhere in these documents, nor at any later stage, did appellee move for summary judgment or request that its motion to dismiss be treated as a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">More than sixty days after appellee transmitted its memorandum and affidavits to the district judge, a hearing was held on the motion to dismiss, and the district judge, for the first time, announced that he intended to treat the motion as one for summary judgment. Appellant\u2019s request for additional time to file opposing affidavits was denied on the ground that more than sixty days had elapsed since appellee\u2019s transmittal of its memorandum and affidavits. The district court thereupon granted summary judgment for appellee and suppressed appellant\u2019s interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">As our opinion in Gutierrez v. El Paso Community Action Program, 5th Cir. 1972, 462 F.2d 121, makes clear, the district judge erred in treating appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment without first giving appellant the ten days\u2019 notice required by Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P. Furthermore, it was error to base the suppression of appellant\u2019s interrogatories upon appellee\u2019s vague and conclusory objections. Rule 33(a), F.R.Civ.P., clearly provides that each interrogatory must be answered or objected to separately, and objections must be made with specificity. 4A Moore, Federal Practice \u00b633.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
