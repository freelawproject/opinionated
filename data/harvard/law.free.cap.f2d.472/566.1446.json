GUDGER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFp\">in connection with the acquisition of a firearm, to wit, one 30 caliber Plain-field M-l Carbine, bearing serial number 15932, from a licensed dealer, Dud\u2019s Gun Shop, did knowingly make a false written statement, misrepresenting identification with respect to the transaction, by presenting a fictitious address, \u20184325 Collins, Miami Beach, Florida\u2019 to. the dealer, said false written statement intended to deceive such dealer with respect to a material fact to the lawfulness of the sale, and disposition of such firearm, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(a)(6).\u201d [Rec. p. 180]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">The district court sentenced him to 57 days\u2019 imprisonment. The sole issue on appeal is whether the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Decision of that issue turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201cwith respect to a material fact to the lawfulness of the sale\u201d as that phrase is used in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">The testimony revealed that the address \u201c4325 Collins, Miami Beach, Florida,\u201d was fictitious, but there was no evidence to refute the defendant\u2019s claim of Florida residency. Under similar facts the District Court of New Hampshire granted a defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8G\">\u201cThe gravamen of the crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) is making or furnishing or exhibiting \u2018any false, fictitious, or misrepresented identification, intended or likely to deceive such * * * dealer, * * * with respect to <em>any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale. * </em>* * \u2019 [Emphasis added.] I assume, for purposes of this ruling, that the defendant knew at the time that he showed his license to the gun dealer that the address given on his license was incorrect, although there was no direct evidence as to knowledge or intent. But the material fact for a dealer under \u00a7 922(b)(3) is the residency of the buyer, not the address of the buyer, although the address may be evidence of residency. The fact that a buyer may have intentionally given a false address does not become material until the government first proves that the defendant is not a resident of the state in which the dealer is doing business. There may be many reasons for giving a false address, none of which have anything to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>do with the commission of the crime set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amk-dedup-0\">United States v. Benton, D.N.H.1971, 329 F.Supp. 331, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">On the other hand, in United States v. Crandall, 1972, 453 F.2d 1216-1217 the First Circuit reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201cIn spite of able argument by defendant\u2019s counsel we consider this appeal to be lacking in merit. Defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal was denied, and thereafter he was found guilty of making a false statement, to wit, of supplying a false name, address, and date of birth in connection with his acquisition of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s primary contention is that the misrepresentation was not one of a \u2018fact material to the lawfulness of the sale,\u2019 because, although the jury could find that defendant did misrepresent his identity, in actual fact, regardless of name, he was not a prohibited buyer within section 922, subsections (b) and (d). Hence, he says, the misrepresentation was not material. In making this contention defendant overlooks subsection (5) of section (b), which makes the sale unlawful, without limitation, in every case, unless the seller records the \u2018name, age, and place of residence\u2019 of the purchaser. It follows from the fact that the sale is illegal unless these matters are correctly recorded, that their misstatement is a misrepresentation of a \u2018fact material to the lawfulness of the sale.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Insofar as we are advised or have discovered, <em>Benton </em>and <em>Crandall </em>are the only pertinent eases. In <em>Crandall </em>the defendant supplied \u201ca false name, address, and date of birth,\u201d while in the case at bar the indictment charged the defendant with \u201cmisrepresenting identification with respect to the transaction, by presenting a fictitious address, \u20184325 Collins, Miami Beach, Florida\u2019 to the dealer.\u201d To us that seems a distinction without a difference. We conclude that this case is governed by <em>Crandall, </em>and that the district court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Such a direct approach obviates the necessity of considering the following more indirect rationale: (1) Error in the citation of the statute in the indictment is not ground for reversal if the error did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice. Rule 7(c), F.R.Cr.P. See also Williams v. United States, 1897, 168 U.S. 382, 389, 18 S.Ct. 92, 42 L.Ed. 509; United States v. Hutcheson, 1941, 312 U.S; 219, 224, 61 S.Ct. 463, 85 L.Ed. 788. (2) The facts alleged in the indictment constitute an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(b) (5) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">We think that the facts alleged in the, indictment and supported by the evidence constitute an offense under the statute cited, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), and that resort to other statutes or regulations is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. Which provides for punishment for misrepresentation of any fact required to be kept in the records of a person licensed under this chapter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">.
