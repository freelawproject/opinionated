On that record the District Judge\u2019s finding of \u201cbad faith\u201d is not supported, and as a consequence, must be held to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">The record in this case does not warrant a conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conduct was such willful and obdurate defiance of law as to warrant the award of attorney\u2019s fees here appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
