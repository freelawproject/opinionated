The order requires the posting of the usual notices and in addition requires the respondent to bargain collectively with International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)-, as exclusive representative of the employees in the described unit. The Board relied upon NLRB v. Gissel, 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">In the Trial Examiner\u2019s findings (App. pg. 26 et seq.), he concludes that the formation of the Employee Communication Committee amounted to the creation of a company union in violation of Section 8(a)(2). The examiner further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-16\">\u201cAlthough this case is generally free of the more common forms of encroachment upon employees\u2019 self-organizational rights \u2014 except for Tas-sell\u2019s speech to the assembly department \u2014 nevertheless, the unfair labor practices found are of such pervasive nature that \u2018the possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election (or a. fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies . is slight . . .\u2019 [citing Gissel, 395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. 1918], Accordingly, a bargaining order is required to remedy effectively the Company\u2019s conduct.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">The Board on review modified the findings and concluded that the wage review and the potluck dinner (the principal objectionable activities) which the Examiner found objectionable had been planned prior to the organizing activities and were not motivated by unlawful considerations. The other findings and the conclusions and the balance of the order were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\"> An examination of the record by this Court demonstrates that Tassell\u2019s speech to the assembly department was a single incident of no great importance, although there were some veiled threats. Clearly, the formation of the Employee Communication Committee was a violation of the Act. We do not find any substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the unfair labor practices, as found by the Board, are of such pervasive nature as to eliminate the possibility of fair election.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-20\">It is, therefore, ORDERED that enforcement of the Board\u2019s order be granted, except that portion of the order which requires the employer to enter into collective bargaining with the UAW. As to that aspect of the order enforcement is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
