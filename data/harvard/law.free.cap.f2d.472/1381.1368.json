The taxpayers did not keep a formal set of books in the operation of their business and the bank deposit method was used in reconstructing income. The amount determined as deficiency for the three years by the United States Tax Court was less than that asserted by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-16\">This Court has carefully examined the record and briefs and considered the arguments made in this ease and has determined that the findings of the United States Tax Court are not clearly erroneous. See Opinion in 30 T.C.M. 1337 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-17\">The decision of the United States Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
