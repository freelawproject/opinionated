Labor Law\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 first claim arises out of Starbucks\u2019 policy of distributing tips to store Shift Supervisors, who Plaintiffs assert are agents of the employer and thus may not lawfully be included in the distribution of tips pursuant to Section 196-d of the N.Y. Labor Law. Plaintiffs additionally assert that Starbucks\u2019 tip distribution policy constitutes an illegal \u201ckick-back\u201d of wages and an unlawful deduction of wages in violation of Sections 198-b and 193, respectively, of the N.Y. Labor Law. Plaintiffs also assert a \u201ctraining claim,\u201d premised on the allegation that Starbucks unlawfully denied tips to Baristas for customer service performed during their two-week training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have adequately averred that the Court has diversity jurisdiction of this action pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Plaintiffs have moved for class certification and the parties have cross-moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rules 23 and 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court has considered thoroughly the parties\u2019 submissions. For the following reasons, Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment as a matter of law is granted in its entirety and every claim asserted by Plaintiffs, with the exception of plaintiff Baren-boim\u2019s individual \u201ctraining claim\u201d (as to which Defendant concedes there is a genuine issue of material fact and has not moved for summary judgment), is hereby dismissed. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification of the \u201ctraining claim\u201d is denied. The Court will not address Plaintiffs\u2019 class certification motion with respect to the other claims in light of the Court\u2019s ruling on Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The following material facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs Barenboim and Ortiz are both New York residents and former employees of Starbucks. (Def. Response \u00b6 1.) Starbucks is a Washington-based coffee and beverage company that operates approximately 400 stores in New York State. (Def. Response \u00b63.) Barenboim worked as a Barista at a store located in Queens, New York, from October 3, 2006, to December ,13, 2006. (Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 1.) Ortiz worked as a Barista at a store located in Manhattan, New York, from February 4, 2008, to March 28, 2008. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 2.) As new Baristas, Barenboim and Ortiz were paid a starting wage of $8.75 per hour. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 3.) Starbucks stores are staffed by employees whom Starbucks refers to as \u201cpartners.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 4.) Partners are divided into four categories: Baristas, Shift Supervisors, Assistant Store Managers, and Store Managers. <em>(Id.) </em>In New York, Starbucks employs approximately 5,250-5,600 Baristas, approximately 1,200 Shift Supervisors, approximately 400 Assistant Store Managers, and approximately 400 Store Managers. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 5.) On average, each store is staffed with approximately 17-18 Baristas, three Shift Supervisors, and one Assistant Store Manager. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Baristas are entry-level, part-time hourly employees primarily responsible for customer service-related tasks such as working the cash register, making coffee drinks, and \u201c[a]nticipat[ing] customer and store needs by constantly evaluating the environment and customers for cues.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.) Each Barista must complete a two-week training program at the beginning of her employment, learning how to perform the various tasks associated with that position. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 12.) During the training period, new Bar-istas must complete four to five hours of technology training, which teaches Baristas how to use the store\u2019s cash register. New Baristas must also work three or four \u201cpractice shifts,\u201d during which time the Baristas work \u201con the floor\u201d serving customers, taking drink orders, preparing drinks, processing customer payments, cleaning the store, and reading and performing assignments in a workbook. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.) At the end of the two-week training period, Baristas must take a practical exam to become \u201ccertified,\u201d demonstrating their skills and knowledge of the tasks associated with their position. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">Shift Supervisors, like Baristas, are part-time hourly employees, who are non-exempt from applicable labor laws governing overtime pay. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 29; Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 10.) Shift Supervisors spend a majority of their time performing the same duties as Baristas, but are also responsible for some additional tasks, including supervising and coordinating partners within the store, opening and elos-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ing the store, and depositing money into the safe. <em>(Id.) </em>However, Shift Supervisors do not have the authority to interview, hire, transfer, evaluate, promote, issue formal discipline, fire, or determine pay for any partners. (Def. Response \u00b6 29; Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 11.) Shift Supervisors also do not prepare the work schedule, approve overtime work, or process payroll. <em>(Id.) </em>Shift Supervisors may be promoted from the ranks of Baristas upon approval of the Store Manager or District Manager, or hired directly into the position. (Def. Response \u00b6 19.) Prior customer service experience in a retail or restaurant environment is necessary to work as a Shift Supervisor. (PI. 56.1 St. \u00b6 21.) Shift Supervisors must also complete a training program at the beginning of their employment that consists of a workshop on \u201csupervisory skills,\u201d training on deployment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> coaching,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201cgeneral information on the Shift Supervisor role.\u201d (Def. Response \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) Shift Supervisors are authorized to provide verbal corrective feedback to partners and relay their impressions of a partner\u2019s performance to the Store Manager, but are not authorized to formally discipline partners. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Store Managers are exempt, full-time salaried employees and have the authority to recruit, hire, promote, transfer, schedule, discipline, and terminate Baristas and Shift Supervisors. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 51; Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) Store Managers are responsible for leading a team of store partners and are responsible for the operations of the store to which they are assigned. (Def. Response \u00b6 54.) In some stores, a Store Manager is supported by an Assistant Store Manager, who is a full-time salaried employee. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 53.) Although Store Managers and Assistant Store Managers may perform the same customer-service related duties performed by Baristas and Shift Supervisors on an as-needed basis, their primary duties are related to managing the store. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 56.) Approximately 70% of Assistant Store Managers are promoted internally from the ranks of Shift Supervisors. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 45.) Approximately 60-70% of Store Managers are promoted internally from the ranks of Assistant Store Managers. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Starbucks requires that every store have a Shift Supervisor, Assistant Store Manager or Store Manager on the premises at all times. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 30.) In the absence of an Assistant Store Manager or Store Manager, a Shift Supervisor is authorized to open the safe, transfer money from the safe to the cash registers, and take the daily deposit to the bank. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34.) Shift Supervisors also collect deposit slips and place them in the store\u2019s safe and bring deposit slips to and from the bank. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 34.) Shift Supervisors, as well as Assistant Store Managers and Store Managers, are authorized to open and close the store: they possess keys to the store and are able to disarm the store\u2019s alarm system. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 35.) A written Starbucks policy provides that all partners work as a team to create and maintain the \u201cStarbucks Experience\u201d for customers and partners, and thus customers are served by a customer service \u201cteam\u201d rather than by individual employees. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 53-54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\n<em>Tip Distribution Practices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">Starbucks has a highly detailed written policy governing the collection, storage and distribution of tips. (Def. Response \u00b6 62.) The policy requires that each store place a small plexiglass cube container near the cash register (the \u201ccollective tip box\u201d). <em>(Id.) </em>When the collective tip box becomes full, its contents are emptied into a bag labeled \u201ctips\u201d that is placed in the store\u2019s safe, <em>(Id.) </em>Once a week, a Shift Supervisor or Barista calculates the weekly total of accumulated tips and then consults a report of the total hours worked during the week to determine the ratable tip distribution to each tip-eligible partner. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.) Shift Supervisors and Baristas are tip-eligible partners whereas Assistant Store Managers and Store Managers are not. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.) For the purposes of tip distribution, only qualifying hours (explained below) are included in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>partner\u2019s number of hours worked during the week. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 68.) Tips are distributed weekly in cash and are not part of a tip-eligible employee\u2019s paycheck. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 70.) Shift Supervisors and Baristas are required to report any tips received in excess of 50 cents per hour, whether received as part of the distribution or received individually from a customer, by entering the amount of tips they received into Starbucks\u2019 computer system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\n<em>Training and Tip-Eligible Hours</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">During a Barista\u2019s two-week training period at the beginning of her employment, hours worked are recorded either as \u201ctraining\u201d hours or \u201ccoverage/barista\u201d hours. \u201cTraining\u201d includes the hours spent reading training materials and policy manuals, completing written and computer-based training modules, attending off-site workshops, and practicing tasks with more experienced partners (\u201clearning coaches\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 78.) These hours are not tip-eligible, or \u201cqualifying,\u201d hours. <em>(Id.) </em>However, when Baristas work \u201cpractice shifts\u201d during their training period, in which they perform customer service related duties such as preparing beverages and processing payments at the cash register, that time is recorded as \u201ccoverage/barista\u201d and does qualify as tip-eligible. <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiff Ortiz has not proffered any evidence that he engaged in any customer service-related work during his two-week training as a Barista for which he did not receive a distribution of tips. (Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Plaintiffs do, however, proffer evidence that plaintiff Barenboim may have engaged in customer service-related work during her two-week training as a Barista but did not receive any distribution of tips during that time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Barenboim Tr. 121: 2-16).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\n<em>The Parties\u2019 Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">In their cross-motions, the parties seek summary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims that Defendant\u2019s collective tip distribution policy violates Sections 196 \u2014 d, 198-b, and 193 of the New York Labor Law by reason of the inclusion of Shift Supervisors in the tip-eligible group and the pooling and distribution of tips on a weekly basis. Defendant also seeks summary judgment dismissing Plaintiff Ortiz\u2019s claim that he was denied tips during his training period. Summary judgment is to be granted in favor of a moving party where \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The moving party bears the burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A fact is considered material to summary judgment \u201cif it \u2018might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,\u2019 \u201d and an issue of fact is a genuine one where \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Holtz v. Rockefeller &amp; Co. Inc., </em>258 F.3d 62, 69 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(quoting Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505). The Second Circuit has explained, however, that \u201c[t]he party against whom summary judgment is sought ... \u2018must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts ... [T]he nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Caldarola v. Calabrese, </em>298 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">When cross-motions for summary judgment are filed, \u201cthe standard is the same as that for individual motions for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Natural Res. Def. Council v. Evans, </em>254 F.Supp.2d 434, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). \u201cThe court must consider each mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>tion independently of the other and, when evaluating each, the court must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Morales v. Quintel Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>249 F.3d 115, 121 (2d Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7 196-d Tip-Sharing Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">New York Labor Law Section 196-d prohibits any \u201cemployer or his agent\u201d from \u201cdemanding] or accepting], directly or indirectly, any part of the gratuities, received by an employee, or retaining] any part of a gratuity or of any charge purported to be a gratuity for an employee.\u201d N.Y. Lab. Law \u00a7 196-d (McKinney 2002); <em>see Chung v. New Silver Palace Rest., Inc., </em>246 F.Supp.2d 220, 230 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (holding that Section 196\u2014 d \u201cclearly prohibits part-owner employees who wield ... broad managerial authority\u201d from retaining tips). The drafters of Section 196-d \u201csought to end the unfair and deceptive practice of an employer retaining money paid by a patron under the impression that he is giving it to the employee, not to the employer.\u201d <em>Samiento v. World Yacht Inc., </em>10 N.Y.3d 70, 78 n. 4, 854 N.Y.S.2d 83, 883 N.E.2d 990 (N.Y.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The New York Labor Law defines an \u201cagent\u201d of a corporation as someone including, but not limited to, \u201ca manager, superintendent, foreman, supervisor or any other person employed acting in such capacity.\u201d N.Y. Lab. Law \u00a7 2(8-a) (McKinney 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Plaintiffs contend that Shift Supervisors are \u201cagents\u201d of Starbucks and thus prohibited from sharing in tips because they were able to supervise and coordinate Baristas, open and close the store, deposit money into the safe, and oversee the store in the absence of a Store Manager or Assistant Store Manager. These responsibilities, however, do not carry the broad managerial authority or power to control employees that courts have held to be sufficient to render an employee an \u201cemployer or [employer\u2019s] agent\u201d within the meaning of Section 196-d. In <em>Ayres v. 127 Restaurant Corp., </em>the court held that an employee became an \u201cemployer or his agent\u201d when he gained \u201cfull authority\u201d to suspend or terminate employees, assumed greater responsibility for the restaurant\u2019s budget, and received a guaranteed salary, whereas a \u201csenior floor captain with more limited supervisory responsibilities\u201d would not be an agent for the purposes of Section 196-d. <em>Ayres v. 127 Restaurant Corp., </em>12 F.Supp.2d 305, 308 (S.D.N.Y.1998). Similarly, in <em>Chan v. Sung Yue Tung Corp., </em>the court held that a restaurant employee\u2019s authority to manage the distribution of tips to other employees and the flexibility he was afforded in his work schedule did not suffice to qualify him as an agent for the purposes of Section 196-d because the employee did not enjoy operational control or managerial authority and could not hire or fire other employees. <em>Chan v. Sung Yue Tung Corp., </em>No. 03 Civ. 6048, 2007 WL 313483, at * 2-3, 13-14 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2007); <em>see also Chan v. Triple 8 Palace, Inc., </em>No. 03 Civ. 6048, 2006 WL 851749, at *16-17 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2006) (concluding that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that certain restaurant employees \u2014 who carried business cards and represented to customers they were managers, addressed customer complaints, supervised waiters and busboys, made menus, set shifts for other employees, made hiring recommendations, and documented and calculated tip sharing \u2014 were either employers or agents because the proffered evidence failed to demonstrate that they \u201cpossessed the power to control\u201d plaintiffs). From this case law emerges the proposition that persons without the capacity to hire, fire or discipline other employees, even restaurant staff characterized as senior floor captains and accorded supervisory responsibilities, are not agents for the purposes of Section 196-d, presumably because persons without authority over hiring, firing and other incidents of the employment relationship are not exercising powers relevant to the creation or maintenance of the employment relationship. It is undisputed that Shift Supervisors spend a majority of their working hours performing the same tasks as Baristas. Shift Supervisors\u2019 additional responsibilities do not constitute exercise of authority over the creation, terms or conditions of the employment relationship with Starbucks. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no rational jury could conclude on this record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Shift Supervisors are agents within the meaning of the statutory prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Plaintiffs fail to cite any authority to support the contrary proposition that the limited supervisory authority possessed by Shift Supervisors is sufficient to render them agents under Section 196-d. Rather, Plaintiffs rely on a California state trial court decision in which a class of Baristas who had asserted claims against Starbucks nearly identical to the instant claims prevailed on their contention that Shift Supervisors were Starbucks\u2019 agents and that it therefore was unlawful under California law for them to share with Baristas in the collective tips. <em>See Chau v. Starbucks Corp., </em>174 Cal.App.4th 688, 94 Cal. Rptr.3d 593 (Cal.Ct.App.2009). The <em>Chau </em>decision relied on by Plaintiffs, however, was reversed unanimously on appeal and therefore does not provide viable support for Plaintiffs\u2019 claims here. <em>Chau v. Starbucks Corp., </em>174 Cal.App.4th 688, 94 Cal.Rptr.3d 593 (Cal.Ct.App.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Plaintiffs also make various arguments regarding the final sentence of Section 196-d, which provides that \u201c[n]othing in this subdivision shall be construed as affecting ... the sharing of tips by a waiter with a busboy or similar employee.\u201d N.Y. Lab. Law \u00a7 196-d (McKinney 2002). Plaintiffs argue that the phrase \u201csimilar employee\u201d modifies \u201cbusboy\u201d rather than \u201cwaiter\u201d and therefore only allows waiters (and, by analogy, Baristas) to share tips with employees \u201cwho are lower down the food and beverage hierarchy.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Opp. at 3.) The argument is unavailing because the plain language of the statute makes clear that this sentence merely limits the scope of the first sentence of Section 196-d, without independently proscribing any activity. In light of the Court\u2019s conclusion that Defendant has not violated the first sentence of the statute, the Court need not consider further the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the statute\u2019s final sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims under N.Y. Labor Law Sections 198 and 198-b</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Plaintiffs assert that Defendant\u2019s policy of distributing tips earned by Baristas to Shift Supervisors constitutes an illegal kickback and an illegal deduction of wages, in violation of New York Labor Law Sections 193 and 198-b, respectively. Section 193 prohibits employers from making any deductions from wages, except as required by law or regulation, or authorized by the employee for the employee\u2019s benefit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute is intended to prohibit a deduction from wages for the benefit of the employer and to ensure full and prompt payment of wages to employees. <em>See Hudacs v. Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>90 N.Y.2d 342, 346-47, 660 N.Y.S.2d 700, 683 N.E.2d 322 (N.Y.1997) (finding that Section 193 was intended to place the risk of loss for such things as damaged or spoiled merchandise on the employer rather than the employees). The Court concludes that Section 193 is wholly inapplicable to this case. Plaintiffs fail to proffer any evidence that Defendant made any unauthorized deduction from Baristas\u2019 wages. Rather, Defendant implemented a policy providing the manner in which gratuities that are received in addition to Baristas\u2019 hourly wages are distributed among a team of customer service employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Plaintiffs similarly have failed to proffer any evidence that Defendant\u2019s policy constituted an illegal \u201ckick-back\u201d of wages within the meaning of Section 198-b, such that engaging in the tip distribution policy would be a condition <em>of </em>obtaining or retaining employment as a Barista with Starbucks, which is a necessary element of a claim asserted under this provision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Chung v. New Silver </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Palace Restaurant, </em>272 F.Supp.2d 314, 316 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (finding a violation of Section 198(b) where restaurant employees were required to share their tips with their employer as a prerequisite for their continued employment). Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on these claims is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Class Certification Motion and the Training Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Plaintiffs \u201ctraining claim\u201d is premised on the allegation that Defendant unlawfully denied tips to Baristas for customer service performed during their two-week training period. As explained above, Plaintiffs have failed to proffer any evidence that Ortiz performed customer service work during his training period for which he did not receive his share of tips and, accordingly, Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Ortiz\u2019s training claim is granted. Defendant concedes, however, that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to plaintiff Barenboim\u2019s training claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Plaintiffs seek to certify a class, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(3), consisting of all current and former Baristas employed by Defendant in New York State within the six-year limitations period who were denied tips for customer service work performed during their training period. The party seeking class certification bears the burden of showing that: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable (\u201cnumerosity\u201d); (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class (\u201ccommonality\u201d); (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class (\u201ctypicality\u201d); and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class (\u201cadequacy\u201d).

The party seeking class certification must also show that the proposed class action meets the criteria of one of the three categories of class actions permissible under Rule 23(b). Plaintiffs seek certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), asserting that questions of law or fact common to members of the class predominate and a class action is superior to other available methods for adjudication. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">\u201cRule 23 is given a liberal rather than restrictive construction and courts are to adopt a standard of flexibility.\u201d <em>Marisol v. Giuliani, </em>126 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir.1997). However, a district court must only grant class certification \u201cafter a rigorous analysis.\u201d <em>Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982). After a careful consideration of the parties\u2019 submissions, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs fail to meet the numerosity, commonality, and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">To satisfy the numerosity requirement, the plaintiffs must show that \u201cthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). Numerosity can be presumed at a level of forty members. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, </em>47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir.1995). However, \u201c[c]ourts have not required evidence of exact class size or identity of class members to satisfy the numerosity requirement.\u201d <em>Robidoux v. Celani, 987 </em>F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir.1993) (certifying a class estimated to include between 22 and 133 members). District courts must make factual findings as to the approximate size of the class based on the parties\u2019 evidentiary proffers. <em>In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litig., </em>471 F.3d 24, 40 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 training claim is premised on their allegation that Baristas were denied tips during their training period. However, it is undisputed that Defendant had a lawful policy of distributing tips to Baristas in training when they performed customer-service related duties, while not distributing tips to Baristas for training hours in which they did not perform customer service. Plaintiffs argue that this policy may not have been consistently implemented at all of Defendant\u2019s New York stores during the putative Class Period, and that some Baristas may therefore have been denied tips to which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>were entitled. However, Plaintiffs have not proffered any specific evidence to support a finding that tips were denied to a class of Baristas that is so numerous that joinder of all members would be impracticable. The record is barren of any evidence, in the form of affidavits, declarations, or deposition testimony, indicating that any Baristas other than plaintiff Barenboim were denied their rightful shares of the ratable tip distribution for customer service work performed during their training period. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the numerosity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 class certification motion with respect to the training claim fails on commonality and typicality grounds as well. The commonality and typicality criteria for class certification \u201ctend to merge ... [because] [b]oth serve as guideposts for determining whether ... the named plaintiffs claim and the class claims are so inter-related that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.\u201d <em>Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 157 n. 13, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982). Commonality requires the party seeking class certification to show that \u201cthere are questions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2). Typicality requires that the claims of the party seeking certification are \u201ctypical of the claims ... of the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3). The typicality requirement \u201cis satisfied when each class member\u2019s claim arises from the same course of events and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant\u2019s liability,\u201d and is \u201cusually met irrespective of minor variations in the fact patterns underlying individual claims.\u201d <em>Robidoux, </em>987 F.2d at 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Here, Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating the requisite commonality and typicality of their training claim. The evidence proffered does not support a claim that any Barista other than plaintiff Barenboim was denied tips for customer service work engaged in during the training period. Thus, Plaintiffs fail to establish that individual factual questions as to whether Baristas did not receive tips during training, despite Defendant\u2019s lawful policy to distribute tips for customer service work, would not predominate over common legal and factual questions among the class. Plaintiffs similarly fail to demonstrate that plaintiff Barenboim\u2019s claim would be typical of the claims of the putative class.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Class Certification Motion With Respect To Their Other Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">The Court need not address Plaintiffs\u2019 class certification motion with respect to their other claims. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 provides that a district court must rule on the issue of class certification \u201c[a]t an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative ...\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1). This provision affords district courts with flexibility when presented with both a dispositive motion and a motion for class certification. <em>See Project Release v. Prevost, </em>722 F.2d 960, 963 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Wright v. Schock, </em>742 F.2d 541, 543-44 (9th Cir.1984). A court should consider whether an initial ruling on the merits of a claim would protect the parties from needless and costly further litigation and whether such a ruling would prejudice any of the parties. <em>Wright, </em>742 F.2d at 544. A district court may reserve decision on a class certification motion pending disposition of a motion to dismiss, <em>Benfield v. Mocatta Metals Corp., </em>No. 91 Civ. 8255, 1993 WL 148978, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 5, 1993) (citing <em>Christensen v. Kiewit-Murdock Investment Corp., </em>815 F.2d 206, 214 (2d. Cir.1987)), or pending disposition of a motion for summary judgment, <em>Encarnacion v. Astrue, </em>491 F.Supp.2d 453, 459 (S.D.N.Y.2007), <em>aff'd, </em>568 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2009). Having determined that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment dismissing all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims other than the training claim, the Court will forego determination of the class certification motion with respect to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion is granted in its entirety. Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment is denied in its entirety. Accordingly, all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are dismissed, other than plaintiff Baren-boim\u2019s individual training claim. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification is denied in its entirety. The parties must promptly contact Magistrate Judge Francis\u2019 chambers to schedule a settlement conference. If the parties fail to settle their dispute, they must appear for a Final Pre-Trial Conference on Friday, March 12, 2010, at 3:00 p.m. The parties must confer and make submissions in advance of the Final Pre-Trial Conference as required by the previously entered Pre-Trial Scheduling Order (docket entry no. 26).
