PAULEY III, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b150-25\">Robert Ross and Randal Wachsmuth (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) bring this putative class action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>asserting Sherman Act claims against Defendants American Express company, American Express Travel Related Services and American Express Centurion Bank (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d or \u201cAmerican Express\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims arise from alleged conspiracies to fix foreign currency conversion fees and to impose arbitration clauses in cardholder agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Presently before this Court are Plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for certification of a damages class related to their foreign currency conversion fee price-fixing claim and Defendants\u2019 motion to amend their answer to include the defense of release. For the following reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is granted and Defendants\u2019 motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AW2\">I. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Robert Ross and Randal Wachsmuth hold MasterCard or VISA (the \u201cNetworks\u201d) credit cards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, the Networks and a number of banks that issue MasterCard \u2014 and VISA-branded general purpose credit cards (the \u201cMDL Defendant Banks\u201d) have been engaged in a multi-district litigation before this Court styled <em>In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation, </em>MDL No. 1409 (the \u201cMDL Proceeding\u201d). The MDL Proceeding involves claims against the Networks and the MDL Defendant Banks (collectively, the \u201cMDL Defendants\u201d). Plaintiffs allege that the MDL Defendants conspired to fix foreign currency conversion fees charged to cardholders. (Complaint dated July 22, 2004 (\u201cCompl.\u201d) \u00b6 1.) Drawing on the conspiracy allegations in the MDL Proceeding, Plaintiffs initiated this action on July 22, 2004. The Complaint alleges that against American Express \u201cactively conspired\u201d with the MDL Defendants to fix currency conversion fees. (Compl.lffl 1-3.) Although not at issue in this renewed class certification motion, Plaintiffs also assert that American Express \u201cconspired with the MDL Defendant Banks to include compulsory arbitration clauses in their respective cardholder agreements.\u201d (ComplV 3.) This second claim concerning arbitration clauses is also the subject of another related action <em>Ross v. Bank of America, </em>05 Civ. 7116(WHP), against the MDL Defendant Banks and others, pending before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">On September 27, 2005, this Court granted class certification on the arbitration clause conspiracy claim and also ruled that American Express could have the benefit of arbitration clauses in the cardholder agreements between the MDL Defendant Banks and the cardholders under the doctrine of equitable estoppel. <em>Amex I, </em>2005 WL 2364969, at *11. However, this Court determined that Plaintiffs were entitled to a jury trial on the validity of the arbitration clauses before arbitration could be compelled. Concomitantly, this Court held that certification of a damages class for the foreign currency conversion fee claim was premature until the issue of arbitration was resolved. <em>Amex I, </em>2005 WL 2364969, at *10. On September 21, 2006, this Court denied American Express\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>Amex II, </em>2006 WL 2707393.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>American Express appealed this Court\u2019s decisions regarding arbitration and class certification. Plaintiffs cross-appealed this Court\u2019s application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The Court of Appeals denied American Express\u2019s petition regarding the class certification ruling, but agreed to hear the appeals regarding arbitration. On October 21, 2008, the Court of Appeals reversed this Court\u2019s memorandum and order in part and concluded that American Express could not enjoy the benefit of the arbitration clauses under the doctrine of equitable estoppel. <em>Amex IV, </em>547 F.3d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The MDL Defendants entered into a Settlement Agreement with Class Counsel on July 20, 2006 (the \u201cSettlement\u201d). The Settlement provides for the payment of $336 million in full settlement of the claims in the MDL Proceeding. This Court granted preliminary approval on November 20, 2006. <em>See CCF VII, </em>2006 WL 3247396. After the notice program was re-engineered at the Court\u2019s direction, more than 10 million claims with a face value of between $557 to $577 million were filed. <em>CCF VIII, </em>263 F.R.D. at 119. On October 22, 2009, this Court granted final approval. <em>See CCF VIII, </em>263 F.R.D. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">II. <em>Plaintiffs </em>\u2019 <em>Factual Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">VISA, MasterCard and American Express are the three largest general purpose credit card networks. (Comply 18.) In 2003, over 90% of all purchases with general purpose credit cards were made with VISA, MasterCard or American Express cards. (CompU 18.) At the time this lawsuit was filed, the Networks and American Express operated differently. VISA and MasterCard were associations \u201ccreated, owned, governed, and operated by and in the interests of their member banks.\u201d (CompU22.) VISA- and MasterCard-branded cards are issued to cardholders through member banks. (CompU 18.) In contrast, American Express was a closed network that issued cards directly to cardholders. (Comply 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">VISA, MasterCard and American Express each allow United States cardholders to enter into transactions in foreign currencies. (Compklffl 28, 48.) In return, the Networks and American Express assess a fee for their service. VISA and MasterCard cardholders pay a two-tiered foreign currency conversion fee. (Comply 31.) The first tier constitutes 1% of the foreign transaction amount charged by cardholders and is retained by the Networks. (Compl.lffl 2, 31.) The second tier typically equals 2% of the transaction amount and is retained by the MDL Defendant Banks. (CompU 31.) American Express, in contrast, assesses a single fee for its currency conversion service that equals 2% of the transaction amount. (Compl.lffl 19, 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">American Express and the MDL Defendant Banks disclosed their respective conversion fees in cardholder agreements, change-in-terms notices and initial disclosure statements. (CompU 44.) Plaintiffs allege, however, that because those fees were not disclosed in application solicitations or in the cardholders\u2019 monthly billing statements, the MDL Defendants, Diners Club, and American Express concealed both the existence and amount of the conversion fees imposed. (Compl.lffl 41-42.) In particular, Plaintiffs contend that it is impossible to extrapolate the conversion fee for a given transaction based on the information provided in monthly billing statements. (Compl.tfl 42-43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Plaintiffs also allege that after American Express raised its conversion fee to 2%, it cosponsored a meeting on May 25,1999 attended by certain MDL Defendant Banks, including Citigroup and Chase. (Compl.lffl 49-50.) According to Plaintiffs, at that meeting the MDL Defendant Bank attendees learned that American Express did not disclose conversion fees in billing statements. In addition, the MDL Defendant Banks confirmed their plans to impose fees. (Declaration of David Langer dated Apr. 24, 2009 (\u201cLanger Deck\u201d) Ex. 16: Plaintiffs\u2019 Responses and Objections to Defendants\u2019 Second Set of Interrogatories dated Oct. 14, 2005 (\u201cOct.2005 Resp.\u201d) at 10-11.) Plaintiffs further contend that the MDL Defendant Bank attendees discussed the possibility of assessing a 2% fee. (Compl. \u00b6 51; Oct.2005 Resp. at 11.) Plaintiffs claim that American Express was uncertain that its competitors charged a currency conversion fee and was concerned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>it would be harmed if it acted alone. (Oct. 2005 Resp. at 10-11.) Following the meeting, Plaintiffs contend that the MDL Defendant Banks and American Express implemented a uniform 2% conversion fee. (Compl. \u00b6 52; Oct.2005 Resp. at 11-12.) Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs assert that \u201c[t]he MDL Defendant Banks, together with American Express, conspired to fix and maintain the amount of the second tier fee at an agreed upon level, and ... to restrain competition by concealing the fee.\u201d (Compl.fl 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">III. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Expert Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Plaintiffs offer an expert report from Dr. Gustavo E. Bamberger to establish that common questions predominate over individual ones in this action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also draw on expert reports from Defendants\u2019 expert reports from Dr. Robert E. Litan and Dr. Frederic M. Scherer to buttress their contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">First, Dr. Bamberger contends that a determination of the relevant market should be made on a class-wide basis. After the market is defined, the question of whether American Express and the MDL Defendants possess market power within that market must be considered using evidence common to all members of the class. (Langer Decl. Ex. 4: Declaration of Gustavo E. Bamberger dated Feb. 18, 2005 (\u201cBamberger Deck\u201d) \u00b6 22-23; Langer Deck Ex. 6: Expert Report of Gustavo Bamberger dated Sept. 12, 2005 (\u201cBam-berger Report\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) Dr. Bamberger explains that determination of the relevant market requires evaluation of substitute products available to cardholders in the event of a hypothetical price increase imposed by all firms in the proposed relevant market. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) He also explains that a firm or group of firms has market power when they have the ability to raise the price above the competitive level. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6 25.) Based on these definitions, Dr. Bamberger concludes that because individual cardholders do not independently negotiate foreign currency transaction fees, all cardholders would face the same inerease, which would allow the fact finder to determine the relevant market and market power. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26.) Thus, both determinations would be subject to common class-wide proof. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Bamberger also maintains that the conspiracy had a common impact on the class\u2014 payment of a conspiratorially-set fee for the use of a general-purpose card issued by an MDL Defendant Bank to purchase goods or services denominated in foreign currencies. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) In addition, determining the size of this common impact would rely on evidence common to all class members \u2014 the difference between the amount of the fee actually paid and the amount the class members would have paid absent the conspiracy. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6 28.) Thus, Bamberger opines that common proof may be used because the fees are set for groups of cardholders, and are not the product of individual cardholder-by-cardholder negotiations. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Finally, Bamberger asserts that aggregate and individual damages could be calculated on a class-wide basis. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6\u00b6 29-33.) Specifically, individual damages can be measured by applying the same formula to each class member, even though each individual class member may not have been equally damaged. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6 30.) Under Bamberger\u2019s model, damages can be determined by finding the difference between what the MDL Defendant Banks would have charged for a currency conversion fee in the absence of the alleged conspiracy and what they did charge. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) Bamberger opines that in the absence of the alleged conspiracy, the MDL Defendant Banks would have been unable to impose the currency conversion fee. (Bamber-ger Deck \u00b6 31.) Thus, the aggregate and individual damages equal the entire amount of the currency conversion fee charged by the MDL Defendant Banks. (Bamberger Deck \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) In addition, the individual damages can be determined formulaically because the damages for each member of the Damages Class equals the actual issuer fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>paid by a class member minus the \u201cbut-for\u201d fee times the dollar value of the transactions to which the fee was applied. (Bamberger Decl. \u00b6 33.) Under Dr. Bamberger\u2019s model, the \u201cbut-for\u201d fee is zero and so each class member\u2019s damages would equal the additional fees actually paid by that class member. (Bamberger Decl. \u00b6 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Plaintiffs also proffer Defendants\u2019 expert reports from Drs. Litan and Scherer to demonstrate that common question predominate in this action. Dr. Litan provides three conclusions. First, that Bamberger\u2019s damages analysis is incorrect because the \u201cbut for\u201d fee would not be zero as Dr. Bamberger opines, but rather would approximate the amount actually imposed. (Langer Decl. Ex. 13: Defendants\u2019 Expert Report of Robert E. Litan dated Oct. 14, 2005 (\u201cLitan Report\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15-27.) Second, that Bamberger\u2019s conclusion regarding market power was incorrect because it misapprehends the structure of the market and how the market prices services, such as currency conversion. (Litan Report \u00b6\u00b6 13, 28-33.) Finally, that Bamberger\u2019s analysis of outside counsel\u2019s communications at meetings between MDL Defendant Banks\u2019 in-house counsel and American Express\u2019s in-house counsel is incorrect and that these communications are not evidence of collusive activity. (Litan Report \u00b6\u00b6 34-52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Defendants\u2019 other expert, Dr. Scherer, opines on the structure and dynamics of the general purpose credit card market. He concludes that the behavior exhibited by the MDL Defendants in pricing foreign currency conversion fees and the meetings held between in-house counsel are not indicative of collusion, but rather of rational non-collusive economic behavior. (Langer Decl. Ex. 14: Defendants\u2019 Expert Report of Frederic M. Scherer dated Oct. 15, 2005.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">IV. <em>LiPuma Release</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">On August 23, 2003, Edward LiPuma filed a putative class-action complaint on behalf of American Express cardholders against American Express in Florida state court, alleging violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and unjust enrichment for claims arising out of American Express\u2019s foreign currency conversion practices, including the assessment and disclosure of the 1 to 2% foreign currency conversion fee (the \u201cLiPuma Action\u201d). <em>Lipuma v. Am. Express Co., </em>406 F.Supp.2d 1298, 1300 (S.D.Fla.2005); <em>see also </em>(Declaration of Charles P. Goodwin dated May 21, 2009 (\u201cGoodwin Decl.\u201d) Ex. 7: Complaint, <em>LiPuma v. American Express Co., </em>No. 03-19365 (Fla, Cir.Ct., 11th Jud. Cir.) (\u201cOriginal LiPuma Complaint\u201d) \u00b6 2). On February 10, 2004, following some discovery and a lengthy mediation, the parties reached a settlement. As part of the settlement, LiPuma filed a First Amended Complaint adding a Truth in Lending Act claim. (Goodwin Decl. Ex. 10: First Amended Complaint dated Feb. 10, 2004 (\u201cLiPuma Amended Complaint\u201d).) In addition to the currency conversion fee allegations, the LiPuma Amended Complaint included allegations concerning American Express\u2019s methodology for setting conversion rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The LiPuma settlement agreement, signed on June 9, 2004, (the \u201cLiPuma Settlement Agreement\u201d) provides for the following releases (the \u201cLiPuma Release\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">Upon the Effective Date, ... the Representative Plaintiffs and each of the Settlement Class Members, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, representatives, agents, attorneys, partners, spouses, successors, predecessors-in-interest, assigns, and any authorized users of their accounts, shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Judgment shall have, fully, finally and forever released, relinquished and discharged any and all rights, duties, obligations, claims (including those that the Representative Plaintiffs or any Settlement Class Member does not know or suspect to exist in his, her, or its favor at the time of the release which, if known by him, her or it, might have affected his, her or its settlement with and release of the Released Persons, or might have affected his, her or its decision not to object to this settlement), actions, causes of action or liabilities, whether arising under local, state, or federal law, whether by statute, contract, common law or equity whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, asserted or unasserted, foreseen or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>unforeseen, actual or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, as of the Effective Date: (1) that arise out of or are related in any way to any or all of the acts, omissions, facts, matters, transactions, or occurrences that were directly or indirectly alleged, asserted, described, set forth or referred to in the Litigation including, but not limited to, claims for alleged violations of the Truth in Lending Act (including the Fair Credit Billing Act), state consumer credit or consumer protection statutes, common law prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, fraud, and/or misrepresentation and equity prohibiting unjust enrichment or requiring restitution or disgorgement; and (2) that are, were, or could have arisen out of or been related in any way to Defendants\u2019 foreign currency conversion practices and the disclosures relating thereto. The release includes all claims premised on any state, federal or common law cause of action arising out of American Express\u2019s currency conversion practices. However, the release does not release the claims of non-American Express cardholders or of American Express cardholders against Visa, MasterCard, or any issuer other than American Express \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">(Goodwin Decl. Ex. 3: Settlement Agreement dated June 9, 2004 \u00a7 4.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">With the addition of the federal claim, American Express promptly removed the Li-Puma Action to federal court in the Southern District of Florida. <em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1307, (LiPuma Amended Complaint). Neither complaint in the LiPuma Action mentions Visa, MasterCard or any of the other MDL Defendants. The parties then moved for preliminary approval of their settlement. The federal court in Florida preliminarily approved the settlement on October 15, 2004, and certified the following class:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"an-dedup-0\">All former or current American Express cardmembers or account holders with U.S. billing addresses who incurred a charge denominated in a foreign currency, and paid that charge in U.S. dollars, during the time period between March 28, 1997 and October 15, 2004, and who did not negotiate (or on whose behalf there was not negotiated) a foreign currency conversion methodology for their American Express account(s).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\"><em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The LiPuma court held a final Fairness Hearing on March 14 and 15, 2005. <em>Lipu-ma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1309. At that hearing several objectors raised concerns about the breadth of the release. <em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1310. Specifically, these objectors claimed that the release improperly included allegations related to American Express\u2019s selection of the foreign currency conversion rate used on foreign currency transactions. <em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1310-11. These objectors complained that class counsel in the LiPuma Action had negotiated away these valuable claims without any effort to assess their value.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">On December 20, 2005, the LiPuma court approved the settlement, finding that it was fair, adequate and reasonable. As for objections to the scope of the release, the LiPuma court noted that \u201cto the extent that additional released claims are transaetionally related to the underlying conduct and are merely alternative causes of action that could have been brought against the challenged conduct, the defendants\u2019 demands for finality and closure appear appropriate and have given courts little pause.\u201d <em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1317 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The LiPuma court framed the issue of the propriety of the release as \u201cwhether the 1-2% surcharge that American Express added to all foreign currency conversion exchanges is transaetionally related to its addition of a competitive rate adjust-ment____\u201d <em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">The LiPuma court dismissed the objectors\u2019 concerns, finding that \u201cit was not unreasonable for American Express to have requested that the pleading be amended to add express language that would resolve any future claims concerning the \u2018spread claim\u2019 since the two formed part of one continuous process of foreign currency conversion.\u201d <em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1317. The LiPuma court distinguished the LiPuma Release from class action settlements that were rejected by noting that those cases \u201cpresent instances where the settlements included the release of claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>that were not related to the claims litigated,\u201d and finding that \u201c[h]ere, the \u2018claimants\u2019 are one and the same ... [a] ny party aggrieved by American Express\u2019 application of a rate adjustment and failure to disclose the adjustment in the monthly statements would also be aggrieved by American Express selecting the most favorable rate but not passing that along to the cardmember, or revealing it.\u201d <em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1317-18. The LiPuma court concluded that the rate selection claims were properly included because \u201c[t]he harms are transactionally related, and moreover, were explained and included in the Amended Complaint and in the notice to the Class.\u201d <em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1318. The LiPuma court further found that \u201c[g]iv-en the [LiPuma court\u2019s] conclusion that the rate selection and spread claims are transac-tionally related, the failure of the Class notice to reveal the settlement would be disposing of other claims ... does not render it defective.\u201d <em>Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1318 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">On January 30, 2006, the LiPuma court issued a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice. (Goodwin Decl. Ex. 5: Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice dated Jan. 30, 2006 (\u201cFinal Judgment\u201d).) The Final Judgment referred to the LiPuma court\u2019s final approval order and the LiPuma Release. (Final Judgment \u00b6 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">I. <em>Proposed Class Definition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Plaintiffs seek certification of the following class:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">All VISA, MasterCard and Diners Club general purpose cardholders who used cards issued by any of the Co-Conspiring Banks during the Damages Period from July 22, 2000 to November 8, 2006, and were assessed a foreign transaction fee or surcharge for using such cards to purchase goods and/or services priced in foreign currencies or in foreign countries and who have submitted valid claims, regardless of timeliness in the settlement of <em>In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation, </em>No. 01-MD-1409 (WHP), Master File No. 21-95 (S.D.N.Y.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">This proposed class is narrower than the class definition in the Complaint, which sought to include all MDL Defendant Bank cardholders who incurred the currency conversion fee without regard to whether they filed a claim in the MDL Proceeding. The Defendants do not object to narrowing the proposed class definition. Moreover, this definition leverages the millions of dollars spent in the MDL Proceeding to identify claimants and makes this action more manageable. This Court sees no prejudice and grants Plaintiffs leave to amend their Complaint to seek certification of this narrower class. <em>See In re N.Y. City Mun. Sec. Litig., </em>87 F.R.D. 572, 580-81 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (\u201cPrior to a decision on the merit s, leave to amend the complaint to redefine the class should be freely given except when some prejudice results to either the defendants or to those persons dropped from the class.\u201d). Accordingly, this Court will now consider the question of certification of this narrower class.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">II. <em>Class Certification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">A. <em>Legal Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">To certify a class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, a plaintiff must satisfy the numer-osity, commonality, typicality and adequacy of representation requirements of Rule 23(a) and meet the additional requirements of predominance and superiority.

In this case, the named Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are typical because Plaintiffs must prove a conspiracy, its effectuation, and damages therefrom \u2014 precisely what the absent class members must prove to recover. <em>See In re Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) Antitrust Litig., </em>264 F.R.D. 603, 609, 2009 WL 4263524, at *5 (N.D.Cal.2009) (finding overarching price fixing scheme satisfied typicality); <em>In re Ready-Mixed Concrete Antitrust Litig., </em>261 F.R.D. 154, 168 (S.D.Ind.2009) (\u201cTypicality in the antitrust context will be established by plaintiffs and all class members alleging the same antitrust violation as the defendants.\u201d); <em>In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., Polyether Polyol Cases, </em>251 F.R.D. 629, 640-41 (D.Kan. 2008) <em>(\u201cUrethane II\u201d) </em>(finding typicality in an antitrust price-fixing conspiracy (collecting cases)); <em>see also In re Potash Antitrust Litig., </em>159 F.R.D. 682, 691 n. 11 (D.Minn. 1995) (same) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">2. <em>Adequacy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Rule 23(a)(4) requires that \u201cthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d Fed.

In <em>Amex I, </em>this Court noted that Ross and Wachsmuth were adequate representatives only for the cards they actually held. <em>See Amex I, </em>2005 WL 2364969, at *1 n. 1. This holding was based in part on this Court\u2019s prior holding in <em>CCF TV </em>that the named plaintiffs in that action, Chase and Citibank cardholders, were inadequate to represent cardholders of another bank, Pro-vidian, because the plaintiffs there only offered \u201cconclusory statements\u201d that they would adequately protect the interests of the absent class members. <em>See CCF IV, </em>229 F.R.D. at 64-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">This Court is mindful that the law of the case doctrine instructs \u201cwhen a court has ruled on an issue, that decision should generally be adhered to by that court in subsequent stages in the same case\u201d unless \u201ccogent and compelling reasons militate otherwise.\u201d <em>United States v.

However, the law of the case doctrine is tempered because it\u2019 \u201cdoes not rigidly bind a court to its former decisions, but is only addressed to its good sense,\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Holder, </em>564 F.3d 95, 99 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Higgins v. Cal. Prune </em>&amp; <em>Apricot Grower, Inc., </em>3 F.2d 896, 898 (2d Cir.1924) (L.Hand, J.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Here, a confluence of circumstances warrants re-visiting the adequacy of Ross and Wachsmuth to represent a broader class. First, to the extent this Court\u2019s prior ruling was premised on concerns regarding arbitration \u2014 an issue that has permeated this action and the MDL Proceeding, those concerns were obviated by the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Amex TV. See Amex IV, </em>547 F.3d at 148. Second, in contrast to the record that was before this Court when it ruled in <em>CCF IV </em>and <em>Amex I, </em>Plaintiffs have submitted extensive additional factual evidence demonstrating that they have and can continue to adequately and zealously protect the interests of the entire proposed class regardless of issuing bank. <em>See Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3tunes, LLC, </em>No. 07 Civ. 9931(WHP), 2009 WL 3364036, at *5-6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct.16, 2009) (departing from the law of the case based on new evidence); <em>see also Boucher v. Syracuse Univ., </em>164 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 1999) (\u201cDistrict judges have broad discretion over class definition[,] ... courts are required to reassess their class rulings as the case develops.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Moreover, a facet of Plaintiffs\u2019 economic evidence is that the alleged conspiracy possessed market power. While not an element of a price-fixing conspiracy claim, it could enable Plaintiffs to show that price fixing was feasible in this market. <em>See In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig., </em>295 F.3d 651, 655 (7th Cir.2002) (noting that economic evidence that the market structure made price fixing feasible or that the market overall behaved in a noncompetitive manner is important in cases where the noneconomic evidence of collusion is \u201csuggestive rather than conclusive\u201d). This creates a strong incentive for Plaintiffs to prove participation by all (or by as many as possible) of the MDL Defendant Banks in the alleged conspiracy. And the evidence Plaintiffs submit shows that they are endeavoring to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Finally, the great weight of authority in price-fixing conspiracy cases, absent special circumstances such as arbitration, holds that the victim of one alleged co-conspirator is adequate to prove liability for victims of all co-conspirators. <em>See In re Vitamins Anti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>trust Litig., </em>209 F.R.D. 251, 262 (D.D.C.2002) (\u201c[B]eeause the plaintiffs have alleged an overarching single conspiracy ... all named plaintiffs will have the same incentive to the case as an absentee class member. This incentive is in no way diminished by the fact that ... the named representatives may have used different methods of purchase.\u201d); <em>see also Urethane II, </em>251 F.R.D. at 644 (named plaintiffs had the \u201csame interests as the other class members in proving they were all damaged by defendants alleged price-fixing conspiracy\u201d); <em>In re Tableware Antitrust Li-tig., </em>241 F.R.D. 644, 649 (N.D.Cal.2007) (adequacy was met where \u201c[m]embers of the class were allegedly overcharged for tableware and [had] a mutual and coterminous interest in establishing defendants\u2019 liability and in recovering damages\u201d in common with representative plaintiffs); <em>In re Carbon Black Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 03 MDL 1543(DPW), 2005 WL 102966, at *14 (D.Mass.

Therefore, the named plaintiffs and their counsel have the same core objectives as would absent class members.\u201d); <em>In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., </em>203 F.R.D. 197, 208 (E.D.Pa.2001) (same); <em>NASDAQ Market-Makers, </em>169 F.R.D. at 519 (Because antitrust law \u201cprovides for joint and several liability of co-conspirators, each Plaintiff will have an equal incentive to generally prove the Defendants\u2019 participation in the alleged conspiracy.\u201d); <em>In re Playmobil Antitrust Li-tig., </em>35 F.Supp.2d 231, 243 (E.D.N.Y.1998) (\u201cthe fact that Plaintiffs purchased only a small portion of the products whose prices were anti-competitively established, and from only certain retailers and not all co conspirator retailers, does not render the Plaintiffs inadequate representatives of the Class as a whole\u201d); In <em>re Industrial Diamonds Antitrust Litig., </em>167 F.R.D. 374, 381 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (\u201cWhere the plaintiffs have alleged a single conspiracy to artificially inflate prices, a representative plaintiff may satisfy the adequacy requirement without having purchased products from all of the defendants.... The crucial inquiry is not how many of defendants\u2019 products each plaintiff purchased, but rather whether each plaintiff has sufficient incentive to present evidence that will establish the existence of the alleged conspiracy and its effect on the prices of the products purchased by the putative class members.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Defendants assert no other disabling conflict between the named Plaintiffs and the other members of the class and this Court discerns none. Because Ross and Wa-chsmuth allege a unitary, overarching price-fixing conspiracy, this Court finds that even though they did not hold cards from all co-conspirators, they are adequate class representatives for the entire proposed class. Plaintiffs have every incentive to expose the full scope of the conspiracy and have shown that they will zealously pursue the interests of the entire class. As for the second prong, Defendants do not dispute the quality of class counsel \u2014 they are experienced antitrust lawyers who have demonstrated they are willing and able to vigorously pursue this case. Accordingly, this Court finds that Plaintiffs satisfy the adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) for the entire class of VISA, MasterCard, and Diner\u2019s Club cardholders that they seek to represent.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">C. <em>Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">1. <em>Predominance of Common Questions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">To meet Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual class members.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). In other words, \u201c[t]he predominance requirement is met if the plaintiff can \u2018establish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof, and thus applicable to the class as a whole, ... predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cordes &amp; Co. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. AG.

At the outset this Court notes that this is \u201ca test readily met in certain cases alleging ... violations of the antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Amchem, 521 </em>U.S. at 625, 117 S.Ct. 2231. \u201cBut it does not follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>that a court should relax its certification analysis or presume a requirement for certification is met merely because plaintiffs claims [are antitrust claims].\u201d <em>In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., </em>552 F.3d 305, 321-22 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]very ... conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce ... is hereby declared to be illegal.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. \u201cThe three required elements of an antitrust claim are (1) a violation of antitrust law; (2) injury and causation; and (3) damages.\u201d <em>Cordes, </em>502 F.3d at 105 (internal alterations omitted). \u201cThe injury and causation element has also been referred to as \u2018antitrust injury1 and \u2018causation or impact.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., </em>256 F.R.D. 82, 87 (D.Conn.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">a. <em>Violation of the Antitrust Laws</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u201cHorizontal price-fixing agreements are <em>per se </em>violations of the Sherman Act.\u201d <em>Cordes, </em>502 F.3d at 105 (citing <em>United States v.

Thus, if proven, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy would be sufficient to show an antitrust violation. Moreover, Plaintiffs have shown that common questions predominate on this first element because: (1) the foreign currency conversion fees were not negotiated on an individual basis, and (2) the evidence of a conspiracy consists of class-wide economic proof, parallel conduct, and meetings among the competitors. <em>See Cordes, </em>502 F.3d at 105 (finding price-fixing conspiracy is susceptible to common proof and meets the first element); <em>see also EPDM, </em>256 F.R.D. at 87; <em>In re Auction Houses Antitrust Litig., </em>193 F.R.D. 162, 165-66 (S.D.N.Y.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">b. <em>Antitrust Injury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">As for the second element, \u201c[i]n general, the person who has purchased directly from those who have fixed prices at an artificially high level in violation of the antitrust laws is deemed to have suffered the antitrust injury....\u201d <em>State of N.Y. v.

There are two prongs that must be satisfied to meet the antitrust injury element. \u201cOne prong is the familiar factual question whether the plaintiff has indeed suffered harm, or \u2018injury-in-fact.\u2019 The other is the legal question whether any such injury is \u2018injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cordes, </em>502 F.3d at 106 (quoting <em>Brunswick Corp. v.

Defendants contend that the reason this is \u201cproblematic\u201d because some class members suffered harm during the class period while others were not affected at all. However, \u201c[Section] 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act does not outlaw only perfect conspiracies to restrain trade.\u201d <em>United States v. Beaver, </em>515 F.3d 730, 739 (7th Cir.2008). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is well settled ... that the law does not require every defendant to participate in the conspiracy by identical means throughout the entire class period.\u201d <em>Masters v. Wilhelmina Model Agency, Inc., </em>No. 02 Civ. 4911(HB), 2003 WL 145556, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan.17, 2003); <em>see also Interstate Circuit v.

Thus, when a particular MDL Defendant Bank imposed its currency con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>version fee is irrelevant to the issue of common proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that they paid supra-competitive prices for foreign currency conversion fees as a result of the alleged conspiracy can be proved by evidence common to the class and would be sufficient to meet the legal prong of antitrust injury. In addition, Defendants point to no individualized factors in the industry. Thus, these questions are common to the class. <em>See Cordes, </em>502 F.3d at 107; <em>EPDM, </em>256 F.R.D. at 88 (finding predominance for legal prong of antitrust injury met in an antitrust price fixing conspiracy by persons who paid supraeom-petitive prices).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">ii. <em>Factual Prong</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The so-called \u201cfactual prong\u201d of the antitrust injury element \u201crequires that harm actually resulted from the antitrust violation-the \u2018injury-in-fact\u2019____\u201d <em>EPDM, </em>256 F.R.D. at 88. \u201cTo meet the predominance requirement for class certification, the plaintiffs must show that injury-in-fact, or impact, can be proven by evidence common to the class.\u201d <em>EPDM, </em>256 F.R.D. at 88. \u201cIt is important to note at the outset that \u2018impact\u2019 (or \u2018injury-in-fact\u2019) and \u2018damages\u2019 are two distinct elements of an antitrust claim \u2014 injury-in-faet is whether the plaintiffs were harmed and damages quantify by how much.\u201d <em>EPDM, </em>256 F.R.D. at 88 (citing <em>Cordes, </em>502 F.3d at 107 n. 11); <em>see also Urethane II, </em>251 F.R.D. at 638 (\u201c \u2018The issue in the common impact analysis is the fact, not the amount of the injury.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Potash, </em>159 F.R.D. at 695)).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In this ease, both sides offer experts who agree on a methodology of determining class-wide impact: comparing actual prices to those that would exist in a \u201cbut for\u201d environment \u2014 that is, without the allegedly unlawful activity. <em>(Compare </em>Litan Report \u00b6\u00b6 15, 27 <em>with </em>Bamberger Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28.) The two experts disagree as to what that impact is. In the model constructed by Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, the \u201cbut for\u201d price of foreign currency conversion fees would be zero, and so the damages and impact of the conspiracy are the entire amount of the fee \u2014 2%. In contrast, Defendants\u2019 expert contends that banks would have imposed the same fee even in the absence of collusion based on the overall structure of the credit card market. In Litan\u2019s model, the \u201cbut for\u201d price is equal to the actual price, so the class-wide damages are zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Under the more demanding standard of <em>In re IPO, </em>when both experts rely on evidence common to the class, this Court should not resolve which \u201cbut for\u201d price is correct. <em>See EPDM, </em>256 F.R.D. at 90 (\u201cWhen assessing the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b) (3), ...

Thus, for this inquiry \u2014 whether common questions predominate to prove injury-in-fact \u2014 it is sufficient that a common formula exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Defendants\u2019 argument that the MDL Defendant Banks\u2019 imposition of currency conversion fees at different times bars proof of antitrust injury by common evidence fares no better on this second prong than it did on the first. The question of \u201cwhen\u201d the fees were imposed was irrelevant to Defendants\u2019 experts\u2019 ability (or Plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 ability for that matter) to construct a common model and determine injury-in-fact by a common means. Accordingly, because the parties essentially agree on a common methodology for proving injury-in-fact on a class-wide basis, common questions also predominate on the injury-in-fact prong of antitrust injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">C. <em>Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">The final element of an antitrust claim is damages. <em>See Cordes, </em>502 F.3d at 105. \u201c[Plaintiffs burden of proving the fact of damage under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act is satisfied by its proof of some damage flowing from the unlawful conspiracy; inquiry be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>yond this minimum point goes only to the amount and not the fact of damage.\u201d <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>395 U.S. 100, 114 n. 9, 89 S.Ct. 1562, 23 L.Ed.2d 129 (1969). Indeed, \u201c[t]he antitrust cases are legion which reiterate the proposition that, if the fact of damages is proven, the actual computation of damages may suffer from minor imperfections.\u201d <em>In re Scrap Metal Antitrust Litig., </em>527 F.3d 517, 534 (6th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Texaco, Inc. v. Hasbrouck, </em>496 U.S. 543, 572-73, 110 S.Ct. 2535, 110 L.Ed.2d 492 (1990). \u201c[T]he fact that damages may have to be ascertained on an individual basis is not, standing alone, sufficient to defeat class certification ... [but] it is nonetheless a factor [to be] considered] in deciding whether issues susceptible to generalized proof \u2018outweigh\u2019 individual issues.\u201d <em>McLaughlin, </em>522 F.3d at 231; <em>see also EPDM, </em>256 F.R.D. at 96; <em>Industrial Diamonds, </em>167 F.R.D. at 382 (\u201cCourts have routinely held, however, that the need for individualized determinations of the putative class members\u2019 damages do not, without more, preclude certification of a class under Rule 23(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Here, Plaintiffs have shown that the existence of damages sufficient to establish the final element of an antitrust claim is susceptible to class-wide proof. <em>See Zenith Radio, </em>395 U.S. at 114 n. 9, 89 S.Ct. 1562. Based on Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed methodology for determining the difference between the \u201cbut for\u201d fee and the actual fee, it should be possible to calculate the amount of the fee paid by each member for each transaction that was an overcharge on a class-wide basis. <em>See Scrap Metal, </em>527 F.3d at 535 (noting \u201cthe court found that the \u2018fact of damages\u2019 was a common question even if the amount of damages sustained by each individual class member varied\u201d); <em>Klay v. Humana, Inc., </em>382 F.3d 1241, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cParticularly where damages can be computed according to some formula, statistical analysis, or other easy or essentially mechanical methods, the fact that damages must be calculated on an individual basis is no impediment to class certification.\u201d); <em>see also Yokoyama v. Midland Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>2009 WL 2634770, at *6 (9th Cir. Aug.28, 2009) (noting that the need for individual \u201cdamage calculations alone cannot defeat certification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Indeed, Defendants offer no argument that there are individual issues about how any overcharge should be calculated \u2014 rather, they argue only that there are class members who have either been fully compensated by the MDL Settlement or have released their claims under the LiPuma Settlement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is insufficient to deny class certification at this point. <em>See, e.g., In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., </em>192 F.R.D. 68, 86 (E.D.N.Y.2000) (\u201cHowever, the presence of individualized defenses, such as mitigation, going only to damages are generally regarded as no barrier to class certification.\u201d); <em>Krueger v. N.Y. Tel. Co., </em>163 F.R.D. 433, 440-41 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (\u201cTo the extent that there may be specific defenses against specific members of the class, they would not justify denying class action certification.\u201d); <em>see also Scrap Metal, </em>527 F.3d at 535-36 (noting \u201ceven where there are individual variations in damages the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) are satisfied if the plaintiffs can establish that the defendants conspired to interfere with the free-market pricing structure\u201d). To the extent these potential defenses could present some individual issues, there are many ways in which this Court can deal with those issues when they arise. <em>See Visa Check, </em>280 F.3d at 141 (listing possible \u201cmanagement tools\u201d available to a district court to address individualized damages issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Accordingly, this Court finds that common issues will strongly predominate over individual issues in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">2. <em>Superiority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Finally, \u201c[f]or Rule 23(b)(3) certification to be proper a class action also must be the most \u2018fair and efficient\u2019 method of resolving this case.\u201d <em>In re Nassau Cty. Strip Search Cases, </em>461 F.3d 219, 230 (2d Cir.2006) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)). \u201cIn analyzing that question, courts consider four nonexclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>sive factors: (1) the interest of the class members in maintaining separate actions; (2) \u2018the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class\u2019; (3) \u2018the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum\u2019; and (4) \u2018the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nassau Cty., </em>461 F.3d at 230 (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)). However, \u201cfailure to certify an action under Rule 23(b)(3) on the sole ground that it would be unmanageable is disfavored and should be the exception rather than the rule.\u201d <em>Visa Check, </em>280 F.3d at 140 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">A class action is the superior method of adjudicating these claims. Many of the class members\u2019 claims will be small relative to the high costs of maintaining an antitrust action. Also, this Court has significant experience regarding this action as a consequence of the MDL Proceeding. Streamlining the litigation in one forum will simplify the process and avoid inconsistency. Thus, conservation of judicial resources warrants litigating this case as a class action on the issues of liability and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">As for Defendants\u2019 concerns regarding manageability of the class, they do not pose a specter preventing certification. In the end, Defendants\u2019 manageability concerns turn on the precise amount of damages each class member suffered. Such concerns are premature. <em>See Kohen v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co., </em>571 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir.2009) (\u201cWhat is true is that a class will often include persons who have not been injured by the defendant\u2019s conduct; indeed this is almost inevitable ... [s]uch a possibility or indeed inevitability does not preclude class certification.... \u201d). As the MDL Proceeding demonstrated, while classes of this size present challenges, they are manageable. Although the proposed class is large, it is defined. The members\u2019 names and addresses are known, they have certified that they paid foreign currency conversion fees, and many have submitted claims including the actual amounts of transactions. Indeed, a number of the large claims have been audited by the claims administrator. While this action involves a narrower period than the underlying MDL Proceeding, many of the issues that Defendants raise can be resolved later, if liability is found. Therefore, this Court concludes that the class methodology is clearly superior because it is most likely to promote fairness and efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">D. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Accordingly, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b)(3), and certifies the following class:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">All Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club general purpose cardholders who used cards issued by any of the Co-Conspiring Banks during the Damages Period from July 22, 2000 to November 8, 2006, and were assessed a foreign transaction fee or surcharge for using such cards to purchase goods and/or services priced in foreign currencies or in foreign countries and who have submitted valid claims, regardless of timeliness in the settlement of <em>In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation, </em>No. 01-MD-1409 (WHP), Master File No. 21-95 (S.D.N.Y.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Robert Ross and Randall Wachsmuth are appointed the class representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">III. <em>Appointment of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">An order certifying a class must also appoint class counsel who will adequately represent the interests of the class. Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(e)(1)(B), 23(g)(1). The court must consider the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the actions, counsel\u2019s experience in handling potential claims in the actions, counsel\u2019s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and claims of the type asserted in the present action, counsel\u2019s knowledge of the applicable law, and the resources counsel will commit to representing the class. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(g)(1)(C). This Court is satisfied that Merrill G. Davi-doff, Esq. and his law firm Berger &amp; Montague, P.C. meet these criteria and will adequately represent the interests of the class as lead counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>IV. <em>Amendment of Defendants </em>\u2019 <em>Answer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u201cOnce the deadline for amendment in a scheduling order has passed, leave to amend may be denied \u2018where the moving party has failed to establish good cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., </em>582 F.3d 244, 264 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., </em>204 F.3d 326, 340 (2d Cir.2000)). This is because Rule 16 \u201cis designed to offer a measure of certainty in pretrial proceedings, ensuring that at some point both the parties and the pleadings will be fixed.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>204 F.3d at 340 (citation omitted). \u201c[A] finding of \u2018good cause\u2019 depends on the diligence of the moving party.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>204 F.3d at 340. Therefore, the movant must \u201cshow that the deadlines [could not] be reasonably met despite its diligence.\u201d <em>Lincoln v. Potter, </em>418 F.Supp.2d 443, 454 (S.D.N.Y.2006). Also, \u201c[w]here the amended portion of the [pleading] would fail to state a cause of action ... the district court may deny the party\u2019s request to amend.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>204 F.3d at 339. An amendment to add an affirmative defense is futile when \u201cthe proposed affirmative defense is not a defense to liability,\u201d that is, \u201cwhen the proposed affirmative defense lacks a sound basis in law....\u201d <em>Greenes v. Vijax Fuel Corp., </em>326 F.Supp.2d 464, 466, 468 (S.D.N.Y.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">American Express\u2019s conduct in this action has not been a paradigm of diligence. American Express was well aware of the LiPuma Release from the moment this litigation began in July 2004. Yet it omitted any reference to the LiPuma Release or LiPuma Action when it answered the Complaint on September 20, 2004. At the December 8, 2004 initial pre-trial conference, the Court engaged the parties in a lengthy colloquy regarding the LiPuma Action. At that conference, American Express never suggested it would assert any defense related to the LiPuma Release. This Court fixed February 1, 2005 as the deadline for amendment to the pleadings. However, this Court need not determine whether American Express has been diligent because American Express\u2019s amendment would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u201cIt is well established that settlement agreements are contracts and must therefore be construed according to general principles of contract law.\u201d <em>Collins v. Harrison-Bode, </em>303 F.3d 429, 433 (2d Cir.2002); <em>see also Info. Superhighway, Inc. v. Talk Am., Inc., </em>274 F.Supp.2d 466, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When interpreting unambiguous contracts, the terms must be afforded their plain meaning. <em>LaSalle Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Nomura Asset Capital Corp., </em>424 F.3d 195, 206 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Krumme v. WestPoint Stevens Inc., </em>238 F.3d 133, 139 (2d Cir.2000). The interpretation of a contract is a legal matter for the court. <em>See 805 Third Ave. Co. v. M. W. Realty Assocs., </em>58 N.Y.2d 447, 461 N.Y.S.2d 778, 448 N.E.2d 445, 447 (1983). \u201c[U]nless a contract provides otherwise, the law in force at the time the agreement is entered into becomes as much a part of the agreement as though it were expressed or referred to therein, for it is presumed that the parties had such law in contemplation when the contract was made and the contract will be construed in the light of such law.\u201d <em>Dolman v. U.S. Trust Co. of N.Y, </em>2 N.Y.2d 110, 157 N.Y.S.2d 537, 138 N.E.2d 784, 787 (1956). Such a presumption applies to federal law as well. <em>See Hugo Boss Fashions, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>252 F.3d 608, 618 (2d Cir.2001). On a motion to amend, a contract integral to the amendment may be considered by the judge, who \u201cneed not accept [the moving party\u2019s] description\u201d of the contract \u201cbut may look to the agreement itself.\u201d <em>Broder v. Cablevision Sys. Corp., </em>418 F.3d 187, 196 (2d Cir.2005) (concluding that the \u201ccontract language ... unambiguously foreclosefd]\u201d plaintiffs claims). This Court may also consider the orders and docket of another court. <em>See Rivera-Powell v. N.Y. City Bd. of Elections, </em>470 F.3d 458, 463 n. 6 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">\u201c[C]lass action releases may include claims not presented [in the complaint] and even those which could not have been presented so long as the released conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>arises out of the \u2018identical factual predicate\u2019 as the settled conduct.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., </em>396 F.3d 96, 107 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>TBK Partners, Ltd. v. W. Union Corp., </em>675 F.2d 456, 460 (2d Cir.1982) (\u201c[A] court may permit the release of a claim based on the identical factual predicate as that underlying the claims in the settled class action.\u201d)); <em>see also In re Global Crossing Sec. &amp; ERISA Litig., </em>225 F.R.D. 436, 458 (S.D.N.Y.2004). Thus, \u201c[a] class action settlement may \u2018prevent class members from subsequently asserting claims relying on a legal theory different from that relied on in the class action complaint, but depending on the very same set of facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re World-Com, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 02 Civ. 3288(DLC), 2005 WL 2495554, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct.11, 2005) (quoting <em>Nat\u2019l Super Spuds, Inc. v. N.Y. Mercantile Exch., </em>660 F.2d 9, 18 n. 7 (2d Cir.1981)). This rule of law serves the important policy interest of judicial economy by permitting parties to enter into comprehensive settlements that \u201cprevent relitigation of settled questions at the core of a class action.\u201d <em>TBK Partners, </em>675 F.2d at 460; <em>see also </em>4 Alba Conte &amp; Herbert Newberg, New-berg on Class Actions \u00a7 12:15, at 312 (4th ed. 2002) (\u201cThe scope of a judgment must be limited to the claims that were asserted or that may arise out of the transactions or events pleaded in the complaint ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Plaintiffs seek compensation for a fee imposed on cards issued by the MDL Defendants and paid to the MDL Defendants. The claims and damages in this case are not premised on any fee imposed by American Express or collected by American Express, but rather, on American Express\u2019s alleged agreement and conspiracy with the MDL Defendants to raise prices. <em>See Ambook Enters. v. Time, Inc., </em>612 F.2d 604, 620 (2d Cir.1979) (\u201cPlaintiff having dealt with these members of the alleged illegal conspiracy, all other members are jointly and severally liable for the damages [Plaintiff] sustained.\u201d). Indeed, all Plaintiffs must prove is that American Express reached an agreement or conspired with the MDL Defendants to fix prices. The success or failure of American Express\u2019s foreign currency conversion fee practices is immaterial. <em>See United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., </em>273 U.S. 392, 402, 47 S.Ct. 377, 71 L.Ed. 700 (1927) (noting it is \u201cimmaterial whether the agreements were ever actually carried out, whether the purpose of the conspiracy was accomplished in whole or in part, or whether an effort was made to carry out the object of the conspiracy into effect\u201d); <em>United States v. Foley, </em>598 F.2d 1323, 1333 (4th Cir.1979) (\u201cSince the agreement itself, not its performance, is the crime of conspiracy, the partial non-performance of [the defendant] does not preclude a finding that it joined the conspiracy.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Giordano, </em>693 F.2d 245, 249 (2d Cir.1982) (\u201cSince the conspiratorial plan itself raises-the danger, the illegality of the agreement does not depend on the achievement of its goal ... [m]oreover, it does not matter that the ends of the conspiracy were from the beginning unattainable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">To circumvent this obstacle, American Express now claims that any allusion to American Express\u2019s foreign currency conversion practices in the Complaint \u2014 even though these claims bear no transactional relationship to American Express\u2019s currency conversion charges \u2014 is sufficient to invoke the Li-Puma Release. However, such a broad reading would violate the identical factual predicate doctrine by releasing claims that do not arise out of the same core nucleus of fact, <em>see Nat\u2019l Super Spuds, </em>660 F.2d at 16-18; <em>In re Auction Houses Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 00 Civ. 648(LAK), 2001 WL 170792, at *11-13 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.22, 2001), <em>aff'd, </em>42 Fed. Appx. 511 (2d Cir.2002), and would be inconsistent with the LiPuma court\u2019s understanding on final approval, <em>see Lipuma, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 1317-18. That approval was premised on the transactional relationship between the harms alleged in the LiPuma Amended Complaint and those that the objectors complained were within the scope of the release. Indeed, the LiPuma court noted that the transactional relationship was essential to the validity of the notice sent to class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">American Express\u2019s elastic interpretation of the release would unmoor it from LiPuma Action and lead to bizarre results. For example, the LiPuma Release includes the claims of \u201crespective heirs, executors, administrators, representatives, agents, attorneys, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>partners, spouses, successors, predecessors-in-interest, assigns, and any authorized users of their accounts.\u201d If the LiPuma Release is untethered from the transactional or \u201ccore nucleus of fact\u201d understanding and stretched to encompass claims like those in this action, this provision becomes nonsensical \u2014 purporting to release claims of persons who were not even members of the LiPuma class and may have received no compensation. But if the release is understood as releasing only claims arising from the same core nucleus of fact, this language is logical: no other party, by assignment or operation of law, can assert claims arising from those same transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Therefore, this Court finds that the LiPu-ma Release cannot include the claims asserted in this action and an affirmative defense based on the LiPuma Release would be futile. Accordingly, American Express\u2019s motion to amend its answer is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for class certification is granted. This Court certifies the following damages class:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">All Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club general purpose cardholders who used cards issued by any of the Co-Conspiring Banks during the Damages Period from July 22, 2000 to November 8, 2006, and were assessed a foreign transaction fee or surcharge for using such cards to purchase goods and/or services priced in foreign currencies or in foreign countries and who have submitted valid claims, regardless of timeliness in the settlement of <em>In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation, </em>No. 01-MD-1409 (WHP), Master File No. 21-95 (S.D.N.Y.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">This Court appoints Robert Ross and Randall Wachsmuth as class representatives.
