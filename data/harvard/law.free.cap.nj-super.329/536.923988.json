This act is generally referred to as the Three-Strikes Law and provides for a life sentence without parole for any person convicted on three separate occasions of certain violent crimes. The sentences for the remaining third-degree convictions were for five years in prison each with a two and one-half year period of parole ineligibility, concurrent with each other and concurrent to the sentence of life imprisonment. The sentence on the fourth-degree offense was for a concurrent term of eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Defendant seeks a reversal of his convictions or, alternatively, the modification of his sentence on the following grounds set forth in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">POINT I \u2014 DEFENDANT\u2019S CUSTODIAL ADMISSION SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED SINCE THE POLICE FAILED TO SCRUPULOUSLY HONOR DEFENDANT\u2019S INVOCATION OF HIS RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT AND REQUEST FOR COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">The <em>Miranda </em>Hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\"><em>Miranda </em>and the <em>Per Se Edwards </em>Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">POINT II \u2014 THE COURT\u2019S SUGGESTION TO THE JURY THAT DEFENDANT INTENDED TO PURPOSELY DEPRIVE THE OWNER OF THE PERCOCET WAS A DIRECTED VERDICT THAT IMPROPERLY INTRUDED ON THE FUNCTION OF THE JURY AND DIMINISHED DEFENDANT\u2019S PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">POINT III \u2014 THE COURT SHOULD HAVE GRANTED DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO RECUSE THE TRIAL PROSECUTOR WHO PREVIOUSLY REPRESENTED THE SAME PERSON THAT WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE PERPETRATOR; DEFENSE COUNSEL WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO CALL THE PROSECUTOR AS A WITNESS TO SHOW BIAS \u2014 THAT THE PROSECUTOR FAILED TO INVESTIGATE THAT INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE HE PREVIOUSLY REPRESENTED HIM IN PRIVATE PRACTICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">POINT IV \u2014 THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S COMMENTS DURING SUMMATION\u2014 PERSONALLY VOUCHING FOR THE STATE\u2019S CASE, ALLUDING TO MATTERS OUTSIDE OF THE EVIDENCE AND ALLUDING TO DEFENDANT\u2019S FAILURE TO TESTIFY \u2014 WERE IMPROPER.

We reverse the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>dant\u2019s convictions based on our judgment that his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights were not scrupulously honored. Furthermore, apart from the <em>Miranda </em>violation, we are convinced that defendant was not subject to a sentence of life imprisonment without parole under the Three-Strikes Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">By way of factual background, on the evening of October 27, 1995, a clerk at a local pharmacy in Raritan Township had opened the establishment\u2019s rear door to take out some garbage. As she returned, she heard a noise and saw a man standing behind her. The man produced a knife and ordered her back into the store. She was then ordered to stand with two other clerks and the man demanded drug compounds known as Percodan and Percocet. A paper bag was filled with the products and the man took some cash from the register. After the man fled the store, one of the employees called \u201c911\u201d and reported the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Detectives identified a car that was observed speeding from the direction of the scene as belonging to the wife of defendant. The victims, who gave descriptions of the robber, were unable to positively identify defendant from a photo array. The next day, a twelve-inch knife was found on the ground not far from the pharmacy. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on October 29, 1995, a warrant to search the defendant and the car was executed. However, the results thereof proved unproductive.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">At 3:30 a.m. on October 29, 1995, defendant and his wife were asked to come to police headquarters for questioning. They voluntarily complied. They were questioned in separate rooms. Defendant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and he chose not to answer any questions without counsel being present. Defendant was placed under arrest at about 6:10 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>At about 10:00 a.m., Detective Mark Taggart began observing defendant. He was aware that defendant \u201cwas not talking.\u201d Taggart knew defendant from an earlier occasion in September 1994, when Taggart had notified defendant and his wife about the death of defendant\u2019s step-daughter in North Carolina. About a month before the robbery, Taggart had assisted defendant in gaining more information about the step-daughter\u2019s death. Tag-gart knew that defendant, who had confided in him at that time, had gone hack to using drugs. On the morning in question, October 29,1995, Taggart admitted to speaking with defendant for about thirty minutes about his drug problem \u201camong other things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">At about 10:30 that morning, defendant\u2019s wife was transported to her home so that she could obtain her medication. She was returned to headquarters and defendant, who had requested all morning to talk with her, was permitted to speak with her at about 11:50 a.m. After they had finished their chat, defendant told Taggart that he wanted to talk. Taggart informed a lieutenant from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office that defendant had changed his mind and wished to speak because he learned that his wife had confessed. He did not want her to be blamed for the robbery which was solely his idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Defendant was <em>re-Mirandized </em>and, at approximately 12:50 p.m., he gave a taped confession. The description he gave of the knife used in the robbery was consistent with the knife found on the nearby road.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress his taped confession based on his claim that Ms <em>Miranda </em>rights were not scrupulously honored. Defendant claimed that Taggart improperly initiated a conversation with him after his assertion of his right to remain silent and after he had requested counsel. On appeal, defendant relies upon (1) <em>State v. Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>252, 261, 511 A.2d 80 (1986), which states that the police must scrupulously honor a suspect\u2019s assertion of Ms right to remain silent \u201cindependent of the requirement that any waiver be knowing, intelligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>and voluntary,\u201d and upon\u2019 (2) <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 <em>U.S. </em>477, 484-85,101 <em>S.Ct </em>1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, 386 (1981), where the United States Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">We further hold that an accused .. having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, <em>unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations urith the police.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\"><em>[ </em>(emphasis added) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">A pre-trial hearing was conducted to determine the admissibility of defendant\u2019s confession. We disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s confession was admissible and note that the judge specifically found that it was Detective Taggart who initiated the custodial conversation with defendant. According to defendant, the conversation initiated by Taggart started with small talk. They talked about defendant\u2019s brother, a drug user, who had committed suicide and that defendant and his wife, Patty, needed treatment for their own drug problems. Taggart offered to get help for their drug treatment. From our review of the record it is clear that the conversation initiated by Taggart was not limited to defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s medical condition but concerned other matters as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">It is certain that defendant\u2019s earlier invoked right to remain silent without counsel being present was not properly respected. The in-custody conversation, which started on a personal basis, regardless of the intention of Taggart, was, to paraphrase the language of <em>Miranda, </em>an inherently compelling pressure to undermine defendant\u2019s will to resist and remain silent and to compel him to speak where he would not do so freely. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 467, 86 <em>S.Ct </em>at 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d at 719; <em>see also Hartley, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 262-63, 511 A.2d 80. As our Supreme Court made clear in <em>Hartley, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 268, 511 A2d 80 \u201ca previously-invoked right to silence is not scrupulously honored in the absence of, at the least, fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings____\u201d Here, the thirty-minute conversation initiated by Detective Taggart subsequent to defendant\u2019s earlier invocation of his <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>rights was not preceded by the administration of \u201cfresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We are satisfied that while Taggart\u2019s conversation with defendant was-not express questioning or interrogation, it nevertheless was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of questioning. <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 <em>U.S. </em>291, 299-301, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1682, 1688-90, 64 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>297, 306-08 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">For these reasons, defendant\u2019s confession should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">We assume that defendant may be retried and find it appropriate to express our view concerning the applicability of the Three-Strikes Law to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Like the federal government and other jurisdictions, New Jersey has adopted the Persistent Offenders Accountability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a, generally referred to, by way of shorthand expression, as the \u201cThree-Strikes Law.\u201d The law provides for mandatory life imprisonment without parole for third-time criminal offenders of certain violent crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">A person convicted of a crime under any of the following: <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:ll-3; subsection a. of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:ll-4; a crime of the first degree under <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:13-1, paragraphs (3) through (6) of subsection a. of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:14-2; <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:15-1; or section 1 of P.L.1993, c.221 (C.2C:15-2), who has on two or more prior and separate occasions been convicted of a crime under any of the foregoing sections or under any similar statute of the United States, this state, or any other state for a crime that is substantially equivalent to a crime under any of the foregoing sections, shall be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment by the court, with no eligibility for parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">In addition to the present first-degree robbery conviction, defendant had also been convicted of armed robbery in New Jersey on November 2, 1973. The State attempted to use defendant\u2019s robbery conviction in Ulster County, New York in 1970 as the \u201cthird strike\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a. Defendant does not challenge his 1973 New Jersey armed robbery conviction but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>argues that his 1970 New York robbery conviction, in the words of the statute, was not \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to the enumerated crime of robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1, under the Three-Strikes Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The 1970 New York conviction was precipitated either by defendant\u2019s robbery or alleged participation in a robbery. Defendant was charged with first-degree robbery pursuant to <em>N.Y. Penal Law </em>\u00a7 160.15 (McKinney 1999), which defines robbery in the first-degree as a crime in which the actor forcibly steals property while \u201carmed with a deadly weapon.\u201d However, defendant was later indicted for second-degree robbery. <em>N.Y. Penal Law </em>\u00a7 160.10 (McKinney 1999) defines robbery in the second degree as a crime in which the actor forcibly steals property and \u201c[displays what appears to be a pistol ... or other firearm.\u201d Nevertheless, on November 5, 1970, defendant pled guilty to the crime of third-degree robbery. <em>N.Y. Penal Law </em>\u00a7 160.05 (McKinney 1999), in contrast to the previous sections, defines robbery in the third-degree as follows: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the third degree when he forcibly steals property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Significantly, \u00a7 160.05 of the New York Penal Law defining robbery in the third degree makes no mention of or reference to the use or display of a weapon or the threatening of or infliction of serious bodily injury. On the other hand, the New Jersey offense of first-degree robbery <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1) which is a constituent offense of the Three-Strikes Law requires the actor to be either armed with or threatening the immediate use of a deadly weapon, or to purposely inflict or attempt to inflict serious bodily injury. Clearly, because of this material difference, third-degree robbery as defined by the New York Penal Law is not substantially equivalent to the New Jersey offense of first-degree robbery. We point out that the Legislature did not intend second-degree robbery to be an offense which is comprehended by the Three-Strikes Law. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-7.1b(l) specifically refers to second-degree robbery as an offense to be considered as one of the constituent crimes necessary for authorizing an extended term for repeat violent offenders. <em>See State v. Oliver, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>564 n. 10, 689 A.2d 876 (Law Div.1996), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>592, 720 A.2d 1001 (App.Div.1998), <em>affd </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>580, 745 A.2d 1165(2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The fact that defendant was initially charged with and first indicted for a New York offense which is substantially equivalent to similar offenses under New Jersey law is of no moment. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43:7.1a pointedly requires defendant to have been \u201cconvicted\u201d of a crime in another jurisdiction that is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to one of the New Jersey offenses which are constituent parts of the Three-Strikes Law. No such <em>conviction </em>occurred in New York.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The substantial equivalency of crimes committed in other jurisdictions with the enumerated Three-Strikes Law offenses depends upon the statutory elements of the offense for which defendant was actually convicted. <em>See State v. Simon, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>416, 509-10, 737 A.2d 1 (1999). Hence, in light of this distinction, defendant\u2019s criminal history did not make him subject to the Three-Strikes Law. It was error for the judge to have sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without parole under that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In passing, we note that in his brief submitted to this court, defendant questions the constitutionality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a and asserts that the statute \u201cviolates his rights of due process of law, equal protection, as well as bans on cruel and unusual punishment and <em>ex post facto </em>laws____\u201d Since the submission of defendant\u2019s brief, the New Jersey Supreme Court has decided <em>State v. Oliver, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>580, 745 A.2d 1165 (2000), which rejects each of defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">For the foregoing reasons, defendant\u2019s confession is suppressed and his convictions are reversed. In addition to the reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions, we note that his sentence to life imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ment -without parole was an improper application of the Three-Strikes Law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\"> <em>Miranda v.
