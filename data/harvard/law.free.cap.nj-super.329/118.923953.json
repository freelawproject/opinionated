By Order to Show Cause and Verified Complaint filed November 30, 1998, her husband, Leo Bilse (Leo) sought an elective share of Wilma\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>estate pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-15. Leo died testate on December 11, 1998. Robert J. Bilse (Robert), executor of Leo\u2019s estate, was substituted as plaintiff to pursue Leo\u2019s elective share claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">By written opinion, Judge Boyle in the Chancery Division, Probate Part, determined that Leo\u2019s estate may pursue his elective share only to the extent that the share was necessary for Leo\u2019s support for the period between Wilma\u2019s and Leo\u2019s deaths. An order of dismissal was entered and plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by Judge Boyle in his comprehensive opinion rendered on March 8, 1999, and reported at 329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 746 A.2d 1090 (Ch. Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
