We hold that, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-304a(2), a cheek becomes \u201coverdue\u201d ninety days after the date it is actually issued and, thus, the bank retains its holder in due course status.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">The facts, which are not in dispute, may be summarized as follows. On January 5,1998, defendant, Bruce Rickett, individually and trading as Rick\u2019s Auto Sales, presented a check to Commerce Bank, N.A. (the Bank), issued to him on January 3,1998 by DeSimone Auto, Inc., Va Executive Auto Sales (DeSimone), in the amount of $12,000, for deposit into Rickett\u2019s checking account with the Bank. The Bank credited Rickett\u2019s account and shortly thereafter allowed him to draw against same.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">The check, dated January 3, 1997, was drawn upon DeSimone\u2019s account at the Bank of Gloucester County for payment of a 1997 B\u00fcick LeSabre motor vehicle. The understanding between Rick-ett and DeSimone was that the check would not be presented for payment if the motor vehicle was damaged. Shortly after issuance of the check, DeSimone inspected the vehicle and found frame damage. DeSimone telephoned Rickett, advising him to pick up the vehicle and return the check. DeSimone returned the vehicle to Rickett, who accepted it. Thereafter, DeSimone issued a \u201cstop payment\u201d on the check, although the record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>reveal when the \u201cstop payment\u201d was requested. Contrary to their agreement, Rickett had already presented the check for payment on January 5, 1998, and drawn against it. The check was returned by the Bank of Gloucester County to the Bank as unpaid on January 13, 1998. The amount charged back to Rickett\u2019s account by the Bank was $11,016.48.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The Bank filed a complaint against both Rickett and DeSimone, seeking the amount charged back to Rickett\u2019s account. Rickett could not be located by the Bank. As to DeSimone, the Bank asserted that it was a \u201cholder in due course\u201d and, therefore, entitled to payment from DeSimone. DeSimone contended that the erroneous date of \u201cJanuary 3,1997\u201d placed the Bank on notice that the check may be overdue, and, accordingly, the Bank cannot be a holder in due course because \u201cholder-in-due-course\u201d status attaches at the time the transaction is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In support of its motion for summary judgment, the Bank submitted the certification of its assistant vice president, which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">I have been employed by Commerce Bank, N.A. for approximately 17 years and have 11 years of branch experience. It has been my experience that checks presented for negotiation are often misdated in the first few days of a new year with the prior year still being written on the cheek.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In granting summary judgment in favor of the Bank in the amount of $11,016.48, Judge Supnick found that the Bank was a holder in due course, largely relying on the fact that DeSimone had admitted that the check was actually issued on January 3, 1998, not January 3, 1997, and on the Bank\u2019s proof that \u201cchecks presented for negotiation are often misdated in the first few days of a new year with the prior year still being written on the check.\u201d DeSimone moved for reconsideration. Judge Supnick denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">On appeal, DeSimone contends that the application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-302a(2) negates the Bank\u2019s status as a holder in due course. That section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>a. Subject to subsection c. of this section and subsection d. of 12A:3-106, \u201cholder in due course\u201d means the holder of an instrument if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">(2) the holder took the instrument for value, in good faith, <em>without notice that the instrument is overdue </em>or has been dishonored or that there is an uneured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series, without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered, without notice of any claim to the instrument described in 12A:3-306, and without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in subsection a. of 12A:3-305.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-302a(2)(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">DeSimone asserts that the \u201cJanuary 3, 1997\u201d date on the face of the check made it \u201coverdue.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-304 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">a. An instrument payable on demand becomes overdue at the earliest of the following times:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">(2) <em>if the instrument is a check, 90 days after its date </em>[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">DeSimone also cites to <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-113, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">a. An instrument may be antedated or postdated. The date stated determines the time of payment if the instrument is payable at a fixed period after date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">DeSimone reasons that, because the cheek was dated January 3, 1997, and deposited in early January 1998, the Bank had actual notice that the cheek was overdue, as defined by the ninety-day period for checks set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-304a(2), and was therefore not a holder in due course under <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A-3:302a(2). DeSimone also construes <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-113a to mean that the fact that the check was dated January 3, 1997, establishes the check\u2019s \u201cdate\u201d as January 3, 1997, automatically rendering the check overdue when it was deposited on January 5,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">DeSimone\u2019s reliance on <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-113a to support its argument that January 3, 1997 must be viewed as the check\u2019s \u201cdate\u201d for purposes of determining whether the instrument was overdue under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-304a(2) is misplaced. <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-113a refers to an instrument payable at a fixed period of time. A cheek does not fit within that definition, but rather is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>demand instrument. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-104f; <em>Santos v. First Nat\u2019l State Bank of N.J., </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 74, 451 A.2d 401 (App.Div. 1982). Accordingly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-113a is inapplicable. <em>Compare N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-108a <em>with N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-108b.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The issue presented is whether, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-304a(2), a check becomes overdue ninety days after the date on the face of the check or ninety days after its date of issue. We construe <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-304a(2) to mean that a check becomes overdue ninety days after the date it is actually issued. To interpret <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-304a(2) otherwise is impractical and inconsistent with other provisions in the Code. <em>See </em>2 James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 17-7 at 174 (4th ed.1995) (stating that the 1995 revision of <em>U.C.C. </em>\u00a7 3-304(a)(2) means that \u201ca party can now take a check up to 90 days after its <em>issue </em>\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\"><em>Pazol v. Citizens Nat\u2019l Bank of Sandy Springs, </em>110 <em>Ga.App. </em>319, 138 S.E.2d 442 (1964), is factually similar. There, a check that bore the date \u201cJanuary 4, 1963\u201d was deposited on or about January 9,1964. <em>Id. at </em>444. The drawer entered a stop payment order, but the payee-depositor was permitted to withdraw its full value before the depositary bank received notice that the check had been dishonored. <em>Ibid. </em>The payor bank refused to transfer funds, and the depository bank sued the drawer for the value of the check. <em>Ibid. </em>The drawer sought a general demurrer on the ground that the depository bank had actual notice that the check was overdue based on the date on the face of the instrument and that it could not claim to be a holder in due course. <em>Id. </em>at 447. The court rejected this argument, ruling that, although the date on an instrument is presumed to be correct, \u201cthis presumption is not conclusive, and may be overcome by parol evidence that it was in fact made on another date[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The reasoning of the <em>Pazol </em>court is persuasive. Here, the Bank has established that the date on the face of the check was incorrect by DeSimone\u2019s admission that the check was actually issued on January 3,1998. Accordingly, the Bank was a holder in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>due course, as DeSimone only challenges that status on the ground that the Bank had notice that the cheek was overdue.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The court in <em>Pazol </em>relied in part on <em>U.C.C. </em>\u00a7 3-114(3) (former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-114(3)) which provided that, \u201c[w]here the instrument or any signature thereon is dated the date is <em>presumed </em>to be correct.\u201d <em>Pazol, supra, </em>138 S.E.2d at 447 (emphasis added). In our State, this section was repealed <em>(L. </em>1995, <em>c. </em>28, \u00a7 1), and replaced by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-113, which does not contain any language as to whether the date on the face of an instrument is presumptively or conclusively correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions have allowed parol evidence to prove or disprove a party\u2019s status as a holder in due course. <em>See Johnson v. Primerica Life Ins. Co., </em>34 F.Supp.2d 562, 567 (W.D.Mich.1998)(\u201c[E]vidence outside the transaction is admissible to show the party\u2019s status as a holder in due course.\u201d); <em>First Int\u2019l Bank of Israel, Ltd. v. L. Blankstein &amp; Son, Inc., </em>59 <em>N.Y.2d </em>436, 465 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>888, 452 <em>N.E.2d </em>1216, 1221 (1983)(holding that parol evidence is \u201cclearly admissible\u201d to establish that a party who took an instrument that was clear on its face did not take the instrument for value, in good faith, or without notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The Bank has offered incontrovertible evidence, namely DeSi-mone\u2019s very admission, that the check was not in fact overdue at the time it was deposited. DeSimone is correct that the Bank did not conclusively learn that the check was really made in 1998 until months after deposit. Had the check actually been made out in 1997, there is little question that the Bank would have had notice that the check was overdue and would not be able to lay claim to holder in due course status. To that extent, the Bank was taking a calculated risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Here, however, the check was not overdue. It is impossible for the Bank to have had notice of a circumstance which simply did not exist. While DeSimone was the victim of Rickett\u2019s breach, there is no doubt that, had the check been correctly dated, DeSimone would be liable for payment on it. To adopt DeSi-mone\u2019s reasoning would create a perverse incentive for drawers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>intentionally misdate checks with knowledge that recourse could be sought in the courts should the transaction break down.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Moreover, the goal of the overdue provision is to prevent drawers from being indefinitely liable for payment on cheeks, not to prevent the type of fraud or breach of contract of which DeSimone was apparently the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">DeSimone\u2019s claim that equities weigh in its favor is unavailing. DeSimone was improvident in issuing an otherwise facially valid cheek for the full price of an uninspected vehicle, and the Bank should not bear the loss merely because DeSimone was also careless in filling out the instrument. Because it is admitted that the check was actually issued on January 3, 1998, the Bank was a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
