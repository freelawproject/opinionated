We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The State presented evidence that sixteen-year old K.B., the alleged victim, had been defendant\u2019s friend since her childhood. During their long friendship, they communicated daily. They \u201cwent for rides\u201d and defendant often took K.B. shopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">On November 28, 1996, at approximately 11:30 p.m., K.B. and her friend, Wakeen Conover, walked towards Conover\u2019s vehicle, which was parked in front of K.B.\u2019s sister\u2019s house on James Street in Lakewood. K.B. got into the passenger seat of the vehicle. When defendant suddenly appeared and got into the driver\u2019s seat, Conover ran back into the house. K.B. testified that she attempted to jump out of the vehicle, but was restrained by defendant. Defendant then drove the vehicle away at approximately thirty-five to forty miles per hour while KB.\u2019s feet were scraping along the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">K.B.\u2019s brother chased defendant in his own vehicle. According to Brown, during the chase his vehicle reached a speed of up to fifty-five miles per hour. He testified that defendant\u2019s vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>made a \u201csharp\u201d turn \u201call the way in the other lane\u201d before coming to a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">According to K.B., during the chase she asked to be returned to her sister\u2019s home. Defendant responded that he would do so once her brother-in-law, who was also following them, stopped the chase. K.B. testified that defendant proceeded throughout the neighborhood at approximately twenty-five to thirty miles per hour for approximately thirty minutes. Defendant was \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201cunder control\u201d and insisted that he intended to return K.B. to her sister\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Eventually, defendant stopped the vehicle one block behind K.B.\u2019s sister\u2019s home. Defendant and K.B. then walked around the neighborhood with defendant holding K.B.\u2019s hand. Her attempts to run away were unsuccessful. They returned to the vehicle, drove by K.B.\u2019s sister\u2019s home and noticed that police officers were present. Defendant then parked one block from K.B.\u2019s sister\u2019s house and walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">K.B. acknowledged that she was testifying because her parents threatened that if she did not, a warrant would be issued for her arrest. She admitted that on the day of the episode she had been with defendant earlier and that defendant had paged her on her beeper. She also acknowledged that after the episode she explained to the police and the prosecutor\u2019s office that defendant had not threatened her or forced her \u201cto do anything\u201d while they were in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Defendant testified that on the day of the incident K.B. attempted to page him. She later called him and gave him directions to her sister\u2019s house. When defendant arrived at the house, he got into Conover\u2019s vehicle with K.B. The vehicle was running and in gear and began to \u201cbuck just like a horse\u201d while his left leg was still outside the vehicle. He asked K.B. to get into the car and close the door for her safety. During the \u201cbucking,\u201d the vehicle did not exceed seven miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>While driving through the neighborhood, a relative of defendant told him that the police were looking for him. When he proceeded toward K.B.\u2019s sister\u2019s house, K.B. told him not to stop. He therefore parked the vehicle one block from the house, walked away and presented himself to the Lakewood Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">Now, Mr. Worthy is accused of violating a statute which reads in pertinent part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">A person is guilty of criminal restraint if he knowingly restrains another unlawfully in circumstances exposing the other to the risk of serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">In order for you to find Mr. Worthy guilty of this offense, the State must prove the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, and those essential elements are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">One, the State must prove that Brian Worthy <em>knowingly restrained </em>[K.B.];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">And, two, that the <em>restraint was known </em>by Brian Worthy <em>to be unlawful;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">And, three, the restraint was under circumstances exposing [K.B.] to the risk of serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">Now, I\u2019ve used the terms restraint, knowingly, unlawfully, and serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">After defining \u201cknowingly,\u201d the court summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">[TJhe State must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-16\"><em>One, </em>that Mr. Worthy <em>knowingly restrained </em>[K.B.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-17\">Restraint means to confine, limit, or restrict one\u2019s liberty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-18\"><em>Two, </em>that the <em>restraint was known </em>by Mr. W'orthy <em>to be unlawful. </em>The term unlawful means it was accomplished by restraint, by force, threat, or deception;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-19\">And, <em>three, </em>that the restraint was under circumstances exposing [K.B.] to the risk of serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-20\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-21\">At the close of the instruction, defense counsel took issue with the trial court\u2019s failure to make clear that the requisite mental state of knowledge applied to all three elements. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axz\">When you were discussing the element of criminal restraint, you read a charge saying that he has to knowingly restrain, that the restraint was known to be unlawful, and then you talked about whether the restraint was under circumstances that exposed [K.B.] to the risk of serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-22\">It appeared to me that\u2014 that the circumstances exposed ... [K.B.] to serious bodily injury wasn\u2019t contained in there. It sounded as though knowledge is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>required on two of the three elements, and I think you\u2019ve got to show that he knowingly did all three.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">I don\u2019t think that it requires that he knowingly exposed her to serious bodily injury, only that he acted knowingly with respect to the restraint, exposing her to serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">I listened to your summation, but I don\u2019t find necessarily that I have to affirmatively charge that he knew he was exposing her to serious bodily injury, only whether he acted unlawfully and restrained her under circumstances. So I have modeled my instructions around the model jury charge and I believe that would encompass what I think the jury should be charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">During deliberations the jury asked for a recharge on the three elements of criminal restraint. The jury also asked for a recharge on the definition of false imprisonment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-3, which had been charged as a lesser-included offense. The court repeated the elements of criminal restraint as previously given. Defense counsel repeated his objection, arguing that it was his view that the model jury charge followed by the trial court did not make clear that the mental state of \u201cknowledge\u201d applied to all elements of the offense. The court noted the objection and overruled it.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">We agree with defendant that the jury instruction was erroneous and a reversal is required. As noted earlier, the criminal restraint statute provides that \u201c[a] person commits a crime of the third degree if he <em>knowingly: </em>a. Restrains another unlawfully in circumstances exposing the other to risk of serious bodily inju-ry____\u201d (Emphasis added). Because \u201cknowingly\u201d is part of the introductory sentence of the statute, the Legislature no doubt intended that the \u201cknowing\u201d mental state applies to each of the elements in subparagraph a; that is, he knowingly restrains, he knows the restraint is unlawful, and knows that the restraint is under circumstances exposing the victim to serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">The Legislature\u2019s intent is also clear from the legislative history of the statute. According to the Model Penal Code, after which our criminal restraint statute is modeled, criminal restraint was intended to provide an \u201cintermediate offense between kidnapping and false imprisonment.\u201d <em>Model Penal Code </em>\u00a7 212.2 comment 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>(Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980). The offense is distinguished from kidnapping \u201ceither by the lack of substantial removal or confinement, as required for the greater offense, or by the absence of any of the specified kidnapping purposes.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is distinguished from false imprisonment in that criminal restraint requires that the unlawful restraint occur under circumstances creating a risk of serious harm. <em>Ibid. See also </em>II <em>New Jersey Penal Code </em>\u00a7 2C:13-2 comment 1 (Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Comm\u2019n 1971); <em>State v. Brent, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>107, 121, 644 A2d 583 (1994). The Model Penal Code\u2019s formulation is intended to punish \u201cone who is <em>aware </em>of the risk\u201d involved. <em>Model Penal Code, supra, </em>at \u00a7 212.2 comment 2 (emphasis added). Consequently, \u201c[s]ection 212.2 requires proof that the accused acted <em>knowingly. </em>Thus [the actor] must have been <em>aware </em>that he was restraining his victim, that the restraint was unlawful, <em>and </em>that it exposed the victim to physical danger.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). <em>See also Key v. State, </em>463 A.2d 633, 641 (Del.1983) (Criminal restraint \u201crequires the defendant to have acted knowingly, and he must do so with respect to all elements of the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Further, any ambiguity as to whether \u201cknowingly\u201d was intended to apply to each element of the offense is clarified by reference to other provisions of the Criminal Code. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2a provides that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in subsection c.(3) of this section, a person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted purposely, <em>knowingly, </em>recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to <em>ea,ch </em>material element of the offense.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In addition, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2c(l) provides that \u201c[w]hen the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such provision <em>shall apply to all the material elements of the offense, </em>unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.\u201d (Emphasis added). Subparagraph 2c(l) was intended to \u201cassist in resolution\u201d of precisely the type of ambiguity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>we have here, namely \u201cthe statement of a particular culpability requirement in the definition of an offense in such a way that it is unclear whether the requirement applies to all the elements of the offense or only to the element that is immediately introduced.\u201d II <em>New Jersey Penal Code, supra, </em>at \u00a7 2C:2-2 comment 7. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">[t]he Code proceeds in the view that if a particular kind of culpability has been articulated at all by the Legislature, as sufficient with respect to any element of the offense, the normal probability is that it was designed to apply to all material elements. Hence this construction is required, unless a \u201ccontrary purpose plainly appears.\u201d When a distinction is intended, as it often is, proper drafting ought to make it clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">[Ibid.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\"><em>See also </em>Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 7 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2 (2000). This approach is consistent with the established rule of construction providing that courts are \u201cenjoined to construe penal statutes strictly and to construe ambiguous language against the State.\u201d <em>State v. Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 658-59, 628 A.2d 735 (1993). We therefore hold that a jury instruction on criminal restraint must make clear that the mental state of knowledge applies to all material elements of the offense, including the risk of serious bodily injury to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The State argues that, when the jury charge is read as a whole,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">there is no question that the jurors were aware that \u201cknowingly\u201d applied to all three elements of the offense. While the culpable state of mind of \u201cknowingly\u201d was not explicitly stated with the third element regarding defendant\u2019s exposing the victim to the risk of serious bodily injury, it is evident from the charge as a whole that it was intended to apply to all three elements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">\u201cAn essential ingredient of a fair trial is that a jury receive adequate and understandable instructions.\u201d <em>State v. Afanador, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>41, 54, 697 A.2d 529 (1997); <em>State v. Martini (Martini I), </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 271, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993). As the Court stated in <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2,15, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990), \u201cA charge is a road map to guide the jury, and without an appropriate charge a jury can take a wrong turn in its deliberations.\u201d Therefore, because the need for accuracy is critical, \u201cerroneous instructions on material points are presumed to be reversible error,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>ibid., </em>and are ordinarily considered \u201cpoor candidates for rehabilitation under the harmless error philosophy.\u201d <em>Slate v. Simon, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>191, 206, 398 A 2d 861 (1979). <em>See also State v. Clousell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>298, 317, 580 A2d 221 (1990) (holding that it was reversible error where trial court, on a charge of aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12~lb(4), defined \u201cknowing\u201d conduct but \u201csuggested that defendant had to know merely that he was pointing a gun, not that he had to know he was pointing it at or towards a person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Here, it is significant that during the jury charge the trial court separated the three elements of criminal restraint, stating on two occasions that the State must prove that: (1) defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d restrained the victim; (2) the restraint was \u201cknown\u201d by defendant to be unlawful; and (3) the restraint was under circumstances exposing the victim to serious bodily injury. The emphasis on the mental state of \u201cknowing\u201d as to the first two elements and not the third had the clear capacity to persuade the jury that the defendant need not have knowingly exposed K.B. to the risk of serious bodily injury. The risk of confusion is underscored by the fact that the jury, during deliberations, requested a read-back of the elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">With a proper instruction the jury could well have found that defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a knowing and unlawful restraint, but that he had not knowingly exposed the victim to the risk of serious bodily injury. \u201cA person acts knowingly with respect to a result of his conduct if he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(2). Defendant testified that when he entered the vehicle it was already in gear. It began to \u201cbuck just like a horse\u201d while his left leg was still outside the vehicle. He then asked K.B. to \u201c[sjhut the door. You\u2019re going to hurt yourselfl,]\u201d suggesting concern for her safety because of the erratic nature of the vehicle\u2019s movement. According to defendant, at the time the vehicle was \u201cbuck[ingj\u201d he was proceeding at approximately six to seven miles per hour and during the ensuing drive he was proceeding at approximately twenty miles per hour before he dropped off K.B. K.B. testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>that attempted to explain to the police that defendant had not threatened her or forced her \u201cto do anything.\u201d On these facts, the jury may have concluded defendant was not aware that it \u201cwas practically certain\u201d that his conduct exposed K.B. to the risk of serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-13\"> The court granted the State's motion to sentence defendant to an extended term pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3, and sentenced defendant to a term of eight years, with a three-year period of parole ineligibility. Because we reverse the convictions, we do not address the sentencing issues raised by defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
