The Court of Federal Claims upheld the government\u2019s authority to do so, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">A. This case arises out of the federal government\u2019s program, thus far unsuccessful, to remove and dispose of spent nuclear waste resulting from the operation of this country\u2019s nuclear electric generating facilities. The program is described in <em>Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. United States, </em>225 F.3d 1336, 1337-39 (Fed.Cir. 2000). In brief, in 1983 the Department of Energy, pursuant to a statutory directive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>entered into standard contracts with the country\u2019s nuclear electric generating companies, under which (1) the government agreed to begin accepting and disposing of spent nuclear waste by January 1, 1998 and (2) the utilities agreed to pay the government substantial amounts for its service, including both a one-time fee based on past nuclear generation of electricity and on-going fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The government was unable to inaugurate its waste disposal program and the utilities filed suits challenging that default. In <em>Maine Yankee, </em>this court held that the government had breached the standard contract by failure to commence the waste disposal program by the specified date and that the utilities could maintain breach-of-contract damage suits against the government for that default.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">B. The appellees PSEG Nuclear and Public Service Electric and Gas Co. (collectively \u201cPSEG\u201d) own and operate nuclear facilities. The appellants Delmarva Power <em>&amp; </em>Light Co. (\u201cDelmarva\u201d) and Atlantic City Electric Co. (\u201cAtlantic City\u201d) (collectively \u201cthe Assignors\u201d) are electric utilities that owned minority undivided interests in those nuclear plants. In September 1999, the Assignors by written contracts (the \u201cTransfer Agreements\u201d) agreed to transfer to PSEG, in return for approximately $30 million, their interests in those nuclear plants. In the Transfer Agreements the Assignors also transferred to PSEG \u201c[a]ll claims of Seller relating to or pertaining to the Department of Energy\u2019s defaults ... including all claims for failure by the Department of Energy to take Spent Nuclear Fuel....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">In January 2004, Delmarva and Atlantic City each filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims seeking damages from the United States for the Department of Energy\u2019s breach of its contracts to begin removal of the waste from PSEG\u2019s nuclear plants in which each had a minority interest. Although the original complaints alleged various theories of liability, in this appeal they rely only on their claim that the government\u2019s breach of contract constituted a taking of their former property interests in the nuclear plants, for which they are entitled to just compensation. The takings theory is that the government\u2019s breach of the removal contracts diminished the value of the nuclear plants, and as a result, they received less on the sale of their interest in those plants. The two cases have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">When PSEG became aware of the claims the Assignors had asserted in this lawsuit, it invoked the arbitration clause of the Transfer Agreements to argue that the claims the Assignors had assigned in the Transfer Agreements included the taking claims. In proceedings to which the government was not a party, the arbitrators sustained PSEG\u2019s contention. The Assignors challenged the arbitration decision in a New Jersey state court, which upheld the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">The Assignors moved the Court of Federal Claims to vacate the arbitration award. The court then stated that the government should indicate whether it waived its rights under the Assignment-of-Claims Act. In response, the government filed a document which included the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-11\">[T]he Government is exercising its sole discretion to accept the assignments of those claims that the plaintiffs purported to make to PSEG Nuclear, to the extent that we have been made aware of those claims through the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in this action and through the assignment provisions in the purchase and sale agreements that have been included in the appendices to some of the briefing in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>The Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgment for the government and dismissed the case. The court held that the government properly waived its right, under the Assignment of Claims Act, to invalidate the assignments; that the assignments included the takings claims; and that having assigned those claims to PSEG, the Assignors had no basis for asserting those claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">A. The language of the assignment clause of the Transfer Agreements on its face covers the takings claims, and the Assignors apparently do not contend otherwise. The Transfer Agreements included among the \u201cPurchased Assets\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">All claims of Seller relating to or pertaining to the Department of Energy\u2019s defaults under the Department of Energy Standard Contract (including all claims for failure by the Department of Energy to take Spent Nuclear Fuel) accrued prior to, on or after the Closing Date, whether relating to periods prior to, on or after the Closing Date, and all other claims of Seller against the Department of Energy with respect to, arising out of or in connection with the Purchased Assets, other than the claims described in Section 2.2(1)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">This provision was followed by 13 separate \u201cExcluded Assets\u201d that were \u201chereby specifically excluded from the definition of Purchased Assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The takings claims were \u201cclaims ... relating to or pertaining to the Department of Energy\u2019s defaults under the Department of Energy Standard Contract\u201d and \u201cclaims for failure by the Department of Energy to take Spent Nuclear Fuel.\u201d None of the exceptions in the \u201cExcluded Assets\u201d covered the takings claims. Since the assigned claims include the takings claims, the remaining issue is whether the Anti-Assignment Act barred those assignments, as the Assignors contend. In deciding that issue, we assume <em>arguendo, </em>but do not decide, (1) that parties other than the United States may challenge under the Anti-Assignment Act an assignment of claims against the government and (2) that the Assignors are not estopped from challenging their voluntary assignment of such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">B. As this court has noted, \u201c[w]hat is commonly called the Anti-Assignment Act consists of two statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. England, </em>313 F.3d 1344, 1349 (Fed.Cir.2002). Under 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a), which is not directly at issue in this case, \u201c[n]o contract ... or any interest therein, shall be transferred by the party to whom such contract ... is given to any other party, and any such transfer shall cause the annulment of the contract or order transferred, so far as the United States is concerned.\u201d This prohibition is inapplicable when the monies due from the United States are assigned to a \u201cfinancing institution.\u201d The other provision, here at issue, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727(a)(1), (b), provides that an</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">assignment of any part of a claim against the United States Government or of an interest in the claim ... may be made only after a claim is allowed, the amount of the claim is decided, and a warrant for payment of the claim has been issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">This provision contains a similar exception for assignment to a \u201cfinancing institution\u201d of money due under a contract. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">\u201cThese two provisions together broadly prohibit ... transfers of contracts involving the United States or interests therein, and assignment of claims against the United States.\u201d <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund, </em>313 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>On its face, this language covers the assignments of the takings claims. The claims had not been allowed (indeed, the government contested them), their amount was undecided, and no warrant for their payment had been issued. The assignee of the claims was not a \u201cfinancing institution,\u201d but a power company. The only basis upon which the assignments could be validated under the Act is if the government validly waived the application of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">C. In <em>Tuftco Corp. v. United States, 222 </em>Ct.Cl. 277, 614 F.2d 740 (Ct.Cl.1980), our predecessor court, the Court of Claims, whose decisions are binding precedent here, <em>South Corp. v. United States </em>690 F.2d 1368, 1370 (Fed.Cir.1982), held that the government validly waived the prohibitions against the assignment of government contracts in 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 15, <em>Tuftco, </em>614 F.2d at 744. Although the case involved quite different facts, its analysis and reasoning are instructive and helpful in deciding the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In <em>Tuftco, </em>parties to two government contracts to sell goods to the government assigned the contracts to Tuftco and its affiliate to perform them. Prior to the assignments, the original contractors informed the contracting officer about the proposed action, and the latter agreed to and recognized the assignments. The as-signee performed the contracts. The government, however, paid a portion of the contract price to the original contractor rather than to the assignee. When the assignee sued the government for the amount it had not been paid, the government contended that the Anti-Assignment Act barred the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The Court of Claims rejected the contention. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">[T]he contracting officer was fully aware of the assignments, recognized them, and communicated such recognition to plaintiff. In this case the action of defendant constituted a waiver of the Act\u2019s provisions, including the notice provision applicable to banks and financial institutions. Having chosen to recognize the assignments, defendant was bound to act in accordance with their terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-10\"><em>Tuftco, </em>614 F.2d at 743-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">The court noted \u201cthe long-recognized principle that \u2018Despite the bar of the Anti-Assignment statute (41 U.S.C. \u00a7 15), the Government, if it chooses to do so, may recognize an assignment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745 (citations omitted); <em>see Maffia v. United States, </em>143 Ct.Cl. 198, 163 F.Supp. 859, 862 (Ct.Cl.1958) (\u201cDespite the bar of the [Assignment of Claims Act], the Government, if it chooses to do so, may recognize an assignment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">The primary dispute in <em>Tuftco </em>was not whether \u201cthe Government may recognize an assignment\u201d\u2014the parties had \u201cagreed\u201d it may do so\u2014but over \u201cwhat actions by the Government will constitute recognition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Claims held that \u201cthe Government was aware of, assented to, and recognized the assignments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case there is no question that if the government may recognize an otherwise invalid assignment of claims against it, the government\u2019s written \u201cacceptance]\u201d of the claims filed in the Court of Federal Claims was a \u201crecognition\u201d of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">We see no valid reason why the government should not also be able to waive the Anti-Assignment Act\u2019s prohibition in section 3727(a) against the assignment of claims. Both provisions of that statute \u201care for the protection of the Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>338 U.S. 366, 371, 70 S.Ct. 207, 94 L.Ed. 171 (1949) (quoting <em>Martin v. Nat\u2019l Sur. Co., </em>300 U.S. 588, 594, 57 S.Ct. 531, 81 L.Ed. 822 (1937)). Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>two provisions deal with different aspects of relationships and dealings with the government, they serve the common goal of protecting the government from similar problems that may arise from those relationships. \u201cIn general terms, however, the concerns of the two statutes and the legal concepts involved in their applicability are the same.\u201d <em>Tuftco, </em>614 F.2d at 744, n. 4. <em>As </em>the Court of Federal Claims here stated, the two statutes \u201cembody similar principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">If, as in this case, the government concludes that it is appropriate and in its best interest to accept the assignment, it may do so. As the Court of Federal Claims here properly concluded, the \u201cGovernment\u2019s recognition and acceptance of such an assignment makes it a valid assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The Assignors rely upon older Supreme Court cases that describe assignments within the scope of the Anti-Assignment Act as \u201cnull and void\u201d unless they complied with all of the statutory requirements, e.g., <em>National Bank of Commerce v. Downie, </em>218 U.S. 345, 31 S.Ct. 89, 54 L.Ed. 1065 (1910); <em>Nutt v. Knut, </em>200 U.S. 13, 26 S.Ct. 216, 50 L.Ed. 348 (1906); and <em>McKnight v. United States, </em>98 U.S. 179, 14 Ct.Cl. 584, 25 L.Ed. 115 (1878). At that time, however, the statute itself stated that such assignments were \u201cnull and void.\u201d The present statute does not so provide; instead, it merely specifies the conditions under which an assignment of a claim against the United States \u201cmay be made\u201d and that \u201c[a]n assignment under this subsection is valid for any purpose.\u201d Even more significantly, none of those cases involved any question of, or decided whether the government could recognize as valid, an assignment of claims that otherwise would violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The Assignors also contend that the government should be judicially estopped here from arguing that the Anti-Assignment Act does not preclude the assignment because in <em>Rochester Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. U.S., </em>65 Fed.Cl. 431 (2005), a parallel case, it argued that a similar claim assignment was invalid under that Act. In <em>Rochester </em>Gas, however (unlike the present case), the government had not waived the application of the Anti-Assignment Act to the particular claim assignment at issue. In the present case, as we have indicated, except for the waiver, the assignment of the takings claims would violate the Anti-Assignment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">The judgment of the Court of Federal Claims granting summary judgment for the United States is</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
