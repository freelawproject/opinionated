We conclude he does not, but we nonetheless affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">Michael Antonelli, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, asks us to reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas corpus petition. Antonelli, convicted of bank fraud in 1978 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, sought habeas relief in the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, alleging he was denied certain credits toward his sentence to which he was entitled. Specifically, he claimed the United States Parole Commission erroneously denied him credit for an eight month period of federal parole in 1994 during which he committed two other offenses in Cook County, Illinois. He eventually pled guilty to these state crimes (criminal trespass and DUI), but now contends the convictions were unconstitutional because his guilty pleas were uncounseled. He sought, among other things, (i) an order vacating the DUI and criminal trespass convictions and (ii) an eight month reduction in his sentence, reflecting the time served on parole during which he committed the offenses in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">Antonelli previously filed a \u00a7 2241 habe-as petition in the Eastern District of Arkansas alleging the same grounds for relief. The earlier petition was rejected on the merits, and the rejection was affirmed on appeal by the Eighth Circuit in an unpublished disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">The district court, adopting a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, dismissed the instant petition for two reasons: first, that Antonelli had not obtained permission from this court to file a second or successive petition, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3), and alternatively, that the petition failed on the merits because it is either successive or abusive. Because the \u00a7 2244(b) gatekeeping requirement implicates the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the petition at all, <em>see, e.g., Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003), we address it first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">As the government concedes, the district court\u2019s first reason for dismissing the petition was erroneous. The gatekeep-ing scheme of \u00a7 2244(b)(3) does not apply to \u00a7 2241 petitions by federal prisoners. By its terms, the gatekeeping requirement applies only to \u201ca second or successive application permitted by this section,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), that is, \u201ca second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2). There is simply no basis in the statutory text for extending the gatekeeping requirement to federal prisoners entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">Four circuits have considered whether second or successive \u00a7 2241 petitions are subject to gatekeeping requirements, but in slightly different contexts. They are generally in agreement. First, the Seventh Circuit in the case of <em>Valona v. United States, </em>138 F.3d 693, 694-95 (7th Cir.1998), considered the issue in circumstances similar to those presented here: a convicted federal prisoner challenging a parole determination under \u00a7 2241, after previously seeking relief under \u00a7 2255. The court concluded no gatekeeping was required for collateral attacks by a federal prisoner that \u201cdo not address the conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695. Other circuits have held that \u00a7 2241 petitioners fil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>ing second or successive petitions for relief from deportation, <em>Zayas v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 247, 255-56 (3d Cir.2002), or from extradition, <em>Barapind v. Reno, </em>225 F.3d 1100, 1111 (9th Cir.2000), need not obtain prior appellate approval. The important point to derive from these cases is that the above types of petitioners \u2014 federal prisoners challenging the execution of their sentence, and persons in federal custody awaiting either deportation or extradition \u2014 raise claims which, if they are to succeed, must do so under \u00a7 2241, not \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">Nor does <em>Rittenberry v. Morgan, </em>468 F.3d 331 (6th Cir.2006), suggest a contrary result. In that case, the Sixth Circuit held that some \u00a7 2241 petitions are subject to gatekeeping under \u00a7 2244(b). But any appearance of conflict is illusory. In <em>Rittenberry, </em>unlike the other three cases cited <em>supra, </em>the prior petition was filed under \u00a7 2254. Then, the state prisoner simply filed successive claims, nominally under \u00a7 2241, that sought to collaterally attack his judgment of conviction. In other words, the petitioner sought to avoid the procedural strictures of \u00a7 2254 by captioning his petition \u201c2241.\u201d Subjecting such petitions to gatekeeping is not inconsistent with the above-cited authority, nor with the logic of our own cases. Our cases hold that a prisoner collaterally attacking his conviction or sentence may not avoid the various procedural restrictions imposed on \u00a7 2254 petitions or \u00a7 2255 motions by nominally bringing suit under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1060-61 (11th Cir.2003) (state prisoner cannot avoid restrictions on \u00a7 2254 petitions \u201csimply by writing \u2018\u00a7 2241\u2019 on his petition for federal post-conviction relief\u2019); <em>Peoples v. Chatman, </em>393 F.3d 1352, 1353 (11th Cir.2004) (\u00a7 2244(d) statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 2241 petitions by state prisoner in custody after parole revocation); <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sauyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 945 (11th Cir.2005) (federal prisoner may not circumvent bar on successive \u00a7 2255 petitions by filing under \u00a7 2241). In other words, the cases in this circuit consistently recognize that prisoners who seek to collaterally attack a conviction or sentence must satisfy the procedural requisites of \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2255, however their petition is captioned, but persons challenging detention that is not pursuant to a judgment, or challenging the execution of their sentence, need not.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>of these cases suggests that a prisoner may not avoid gatekeeping under \u00a7 2244(b) or \u00a7 2255(h) by a mere change of caption when, in substance, their lawsuit collaterally attacks a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\"> Here, Antonelli\u2019s petition is properly brought pursuant to \u00a7 2241. A \u00a7 2241 action is the appropriate vehicle to challenge a decision of the federal Parole Commission. <em>Hajduk v. United States, </em>764 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1985) (ordering a jurisdictional dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging Parole Commission decision). This is because challenges to the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself, are properly brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Bishop v. Reno, </em>210 F.3d 1295, 1304 (11th Cir.2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">Because Antonelli\u2019s petition raises claims cognizable under \u00a7 2241 but not \u00a7 2255, it was not subject to gatekeep-ing in this court, and the district court had jurisdiction to entertain it. Hence, the dismissal for failure to obtain prior appellate permission to file was erroneous. Nonetheless, the district court is due to be affirmed on its alternate rationale: the petition\u2019s claims are successive. Successive \u00a7 2241 petitions by federal prisoners are subject to threshold dismissal in the district court because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-6\">No circuit or district judge shall be required to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the detention of a person pursuant to a judgment of a court of the United States if it appears that the legality of such detention has been determined by a judge or court of the United States on a prior application for a writ of habeas corpus, except as provided in section 2255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Antonelli\u2019s claims that his Illinois convictions are constitutionally infirm has been previously adjudicated on the merits by the Arkansas habe-as court and affirmed on appeal by the Eighth Circuit. His current petition for habeas corpus was therefore successive, and properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">. Members of this court have disagreed in the past concerning the relationship between \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 2254. Specifically, they have disagreed about whether the two statutes embody distinct remedies, and thus whether a state prisoner may avoid the procedural restrictions on \u00a7 2254 petitions by filing under \u00a7 2241. <em>Compare Thomas v. Crosby, </em>371 F.3d 782, 785-88 (11th Cir.2004) (Black, J.) (citing <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049 (11th Cir. 2003)) <em>with id. </em>at 802-11 (Tjoflat, J., concurring specially). There is no such dispute concerning federal prisoners. It is well-settled that a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate is a separate and distinct remedy from habeas corpus proper. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622 (11th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted); <em>see also Medberry, </em>351 F.3d at 1056-57 (discussing history of \u00a7 2255). It is also clear that a \u00a7 2255 motion is the exclusive remedy for a federal prisoner to collaterally attack his conviction and sentence, except in the rare cases where it is inadequate to do so. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999). Hence, the domains of the different collateral remedies are more clearly distinct for federal prisoners than their state counterparts. Accordingly, it is uncontroversial that federal prisoners cannot avoid the procedural restrictions on \u00a7 2255 motions by changing the caption on their petition to \u00a7 2241. <em>Cf. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d at 945. A prisoner in custody pursuant to a federal court judgment may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only when he raises claims outside the scope of \u00a7 2255(a), that is, claims concerning execution of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">. At first glance, one might conclude from the proviso (\"except as provided in section 2255\u201d) that \u00a7 2241 petitions by federal prisoners are indeed subject to gatekeeping via \u00a7 2255(h), which is the only provision of \u00a7 2255 addressing the fate of successive motions to vacate. But \u00a7 2255(h), by its terms, applies only to a \"second or successive <em>motion\" </em>\u2014 that is, a second or successive motion to vacate a sentence under \u00a7 2255. Hence, \u00a7 2255(h) does not apply to \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus <em>petitions, </em>assuming the prisoner raises claims properly brought under the latter provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
