L. Brown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>It is alleged that defendant, W. A. Klinke, grew on the premises mentioned in said contract in 1917 certain four hundred sacks of Black Bye beans, weighing thirty-one thousand pounds, being the same beans mentioned in said contract; that on October 31, 1917, said beans were of the value of $.08 per pound; that said Klinke did not deliver said beans on said date, or at all, although plaintiff demanded delivery and \u201csaid defendants do still fail and refuse to deliver such beans or any part thereof\u201d; that defendant Hatton claims an interest in said beans by virtue of a certain chattel mortgage; that by the terms of said contract plaintiff is entitled to the possession and was so entitled at the commencement of the action, but that defendants \u201cboth of whom have possession of said beans refused and still refuse to deliver possession of said beans to plaintiff\u201d; that on November 3, 1917, plaintiff demanded of defendants, and each of them, possession of said property, but defendants, and each of them, refused to deliver the same to plaintiff and still refuse to deliver said beans.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The complaint was filed on November 3, 1917. The defendants answered and filed a counterclaim; they denied .that the defendant Klinke sold to the copartnership of Hamilton &amp; Henderson said Klinke\u2019s crop of - beans, but do not deny the execution of the before-mentioned contract and allege there was no consideration for the said alleged written contract; deny that said Klinke grew on any ranch belonging to him in the year 1917 any beans whatever; they deny that the said beans were of the quantity and value alleged, but do not allege any value; deny that plaintiff demanded delivery of said beans as alleged in the complaint; \u201cdeny that both of said defendants have possession of said beans belonging to plaintiff and to the possession of which plaintiff is entitled\u201d; deny that on November 3d, or at any other time, plaintiff demanded of defendants \u201cdelivery to plaintiff of any beans belonging to plaintiff\u201d; and deny that they or either of them refused to deliver to plaintiff any beans belonging to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Further answering said complaint, it is alleged \u201cthat on March 3, 1917, defendant Klinke and his wife were and ever since have been the owners as tenants in common of a certain forty-acre tract of land [describing the same]\u201d; that about June 1st, they planted \u201cbeans on about thirty-nine acres of said above described land\u201d prior to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>date no beans had been planted thereon; that they thereafter jointly cared for, cultivated and harvested the same and each of said parties is the owner of an undivided one-half interest in said crop of beans; it is then alleged that on October 18, 1917, the said Klinke and his wife executed and delivered to defendant Hatton their promissory note for $750, secured by a chattel mortgage on said beans; that about November 2, 1917, a part of said beans, to wit, 294 sacks, were stored in a certain designated warehouse in the town of Modesto and were so stored in the name of defendant Hatton, as mortgagee; the commencement of the present action is then alleged and that on the affidavit filed therein were written instructions to the sheriff to take possession of certain beans, being the same beans referred to in said warehouse; that in pursuance of said order, the sheriff took possession of 294 sacks; that the papers in the said action were served upon the defendants on or about November 7, 1917; that on November 12, 1917, defendants Klinke and Hatton executed and delivered to the sheriff an undertaking for the delivery to defendants of said 294 sacks of said beans, together with a written demand for a return to defendants of the same; that said sheriff \u201chas failed and refused to deliver to said defendants, or either of them, said 294 sacks of beans or any part thereof\u201d; that at the time of the taking of said beans they were in the rightful and lawful possession of the defendants ; they allege the value of said beans to be the market price of said beans, being $.08% per pound, and they pray for judgment for the recovery of the possession of said beans or their value thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">For further defense defendants set up substantially the foregoing facts by way of counterclaim. Plaintiff answered the counterclaim by denials and admissions which we do not deem it necessary to set forth; Geneva R. L. Klinke filed a complaint by way of intervention by leave of the court, in which she set forth her interest in the beans substantially as set forth in the answer of defendants; the pleadings are verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The action was tried by the court without a jury and findings of fact and judgment were in favor of the defendants. The judgment directed that the defendants and intervener recover the- said beans and the possession thereof, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>in case delivery cannot be had that they have judgment for the sum of $2,129.40, the value of said beans, and costs of the action. The appeal is on the judgment-roll alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Appellant makes three points: I. The judgment is not supported by the findings; II. The court failed to find on a material fact; III. The findings are inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">By finding II the court found that the said copartnership W. A. Klinke made the contract set forth in the complaint. Finding III is \u201cthat said defendant, W. A. Klinke, did not sell any beans whatever to said Hamilton and Henderson by the written contract set forth in finding II herein.\u201d Finding IV is \u201cthat there never was any consideration whatever for the execution by said defendant W. A. Klinke, of said written contract set forth in finding II,\u201d and \u201cthat neither of the defendants received any consideration in connection with the execution of said contract.\u201d Finding VI is that prior to the commencement of the action said Klinke did not at any time sell to said copartnership any beans for any purchase price whatever. Finding XI is that the beans were planted in June and afterward harvested, and Finding XIII is that they were stored in the warehouse on November 2, 1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Concededly these findings were made and are now defended by respondents upon the assumption that inasmuch as the contract was made March 3, 1917, and no beans were planted by defendant Klinke until June 1, 1917, as found by the court, the subject of the sale (the beans) had no existence when the contract was entered into and there was, therefore, no sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The argument of respondents is based upon the code provisions as follows: \u201cSale is a contract by which, for a pecuniary consideration, called a price, one transfers to another an interest in property.\u201d (Civ. Code, sec. 1721.) Says the brief: \u2018 \u2018 The definition of sale above given uses the word \u2018transfers\u2019 and does not use the words \u2018agrees to transfer.\u2019 \u201d Again quoting from the code: \u201cTransfer is an act of the parties, or of the law, by which the title to property is conveyed from one living person to another.\u201d (Civ. Code, sec. 1039.) The brief proceeds: \u201cWe submit that if property does not exist, title to said property does not exist, and, therefore, that there cannot be a transfer of title to nonexistent property.\u201d Again resorting to the code: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>subject of sale must be property, the title to which can be immediately transferred from the seller to the buyer.\u201d (Civ. Code, sec. 1722.) Says the brief: \u201cTitle to property which has no existence cannot be immediately transferred.\u201d Respondents quote section 1730, which reads: \u201cAny property which, if in existence, might be the subject of sale, may be the subject of an agreement for sale, whether in existence or not,\u201d as to which the brief says: \u201cabove section needs no comment.\" <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It seems to us that this section should not be thus summarily disposed of. In note to this section, Kerr\u2019s Cyclopedic Civil Code, under the heading \u201cCrops to be grown may be subject of sale,\u201d we find cited: <em>Argues </em>v. <em>Wasson, </em>51 Cal. 620, [21 Am. Rep. 718]; <em>Callender </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>74 Cal. 376, 379, [16 Pac. 194]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>77 Cal. 236, [19 Pac. 487]; <em>Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Acker, </em>116 Cal. 239, [48 Pac. 62]; <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>121 Cal. 272, [53 Pac. 801].</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Said the court in <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Wolf, supra: </em>\u201cWhether a chattel mortgage upon a crop yet to be planted is valid is a question which has not received a uniform decision. (See Pingree on Chattel Mortgages, sec. 217 et seq.) Whatever may be the law in other states, the right to make a chattel mortgage upon crops to be raised before the same have been planted was affirmed in <em>Argues </em>v. <em>Wasson, </em>51 Cal. 620, [21 Am. Rep. 718], and has become an established rule of property in this state.\u201d In <em>Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Acker, </em>116 Cal. 239, 245, [48 Pac. 62, 64], the court said: \u201cContracts for the purchase and sale of future crops running through a series of years have been recognized as valid (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1768; <em>Blackwood </em>v. <em>Cutting Packing Co., </em>76 Cal. 212, [9 Am. St. Rep. 199, 18 Pac. 248]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>77 Cal. 236, [19 Pac. 487]); and actions have frequently been maintained for damages for the destruction of growing crops, although, of course, there was no absolute certainty that they would have matured. (Sutherland on Damages, sec. 120, and cases cited.)\u201d Section 1768 of the Civil Code seems to contemplate the sale of merchandise not in existence. And in <em>Blackwood </em>v. <em>Cutting Packing Co., supra, </em>the court said: \u201cFuture crops of fruit come under the head of merchandise not then in existence.\u201d So, also, we think, would beans. Respondents contend that the contract was an agreement to sell and does not import a sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>and hence title did not pass. Relying, we assume, upon the fundamental difference between a sale, .properly so called, and an agreement to sell, which is that in the former the title passes, while in the latter case it does not, respondents cite <em>Blackwood </em>v. <em>Cutting Packing Co., </em>quoting from Benjamin on Sales, as follows: \u201cWhere by the agreement the vendor is to do anything to the goods for the purpose of putting them in that state into which the purchaser is to be bound to accept them, or, as it is sometimes worded, into a deliverable state, the performance of these things shall, in the absence of circumstances indicating a contrary intention, be taken to be a condition precedent to the vesting of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In considering the contract in that case the court said: \u201cIt seems well settled that the question as to whether the title has passed is one as to the intention of the parties. And such intention is, as a matter of course, to be gathered from the language of the parties, considered in the light of all the circumstances.\u201d The court found that there were certain enumerated things to be done connected with the contract which had a controlling force indicating that it was not intended to mean a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In the present case we cannot discover that Klinke was to do anything which he would not naturally or ordinarily be required to do in case of a sale. Besides, to make his intention unmistakable the following was made part of the contract: \u201cIt is mutually understood that this contract, . . . constitutes an absolute sale\u201d; and until a bill of lading or warehouse receipt \u201ccovering the beans\u201d is received by the vendee, Klinke, the vendor agrees to assume \u201call risks of loss or damage to said beans.\u201d As to this latter provision as bearing upon the question appellant says in his brief: \u201cIn the <em>Elgee Cotton Cases, </em>22 Wall. (U. S.) 180, [22 L. Ed. 863, see, also, Rose\u2019s U. S. Notes], the courts say in discussing the case of <em>Martineau </em>v. <em>Kitching, </em>L. R. 7 Q. B. 436: \u2018There it was stipulated that the goods should remain at the risk of the sellers, and Lord Coekburn asked, \u201cIf the property in the goods had not passed to the buyers, why was it said the goods should remain at the risk of the seller?\u201d adding further, \u201cwhat would be the necessity, what would be the object and purpose of such a stipulation if the property still remained in them? Of course it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>would be at their risk.\u201d \u2019 \u201d So here, we may ask, why did Klinke \u201cassume all risks of loss or damage to said beans\u201d if it was not intended that the title passed to the vendee?</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In the ease of <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Waldo, </em>97 Mich. 255, [23 L. R. A. 449, 56 N. W. 608], the question was whether or not a crop not in being was the subject of a sale. In the course of an exhaustive opinion the case of <em>Argues </em>v. <em>Wasson, </em>51 Cal. 620, [21 Am. Rep. 718], was cited and the court said: \u201cIn a legal sense things are said to have a potential existence when they are the natural product or expected increase of something already belonging to the vendor. When one possesses a thing from which a certain product, in the very nature of things, may be expected, such product, we think, has a potential existence. The following rule seems to be well established by reason and authority, viz., that while one owns property from which products naturally arise, such product may be the subject of sale and mortgage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> As between the parties a sale may be completed without either delivery or payment of the consideration. That a sale may be consummated without delivery was decided in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Dixon Farms Co., </em>29 Cal. App. 52, [155 Pac. 134, 136]. Section 1721 of the Civil Code provides: \u201cSale is a contract by which, for a pecuniary consideration, called a price, one transfers to another an interest in property.\u201d It was said in <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Nevada Bank, </em>99 Cal. 89, 93, [37 Am. St. Rep. 32, 33 Pac. 737, 738]: \u201cIt is, however, the agreement to pay a price, rather than the actual payment of the price, which is the essential element of a sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Some other questions are presented, but it seems to us that the foregoing is the basic question involved and on its correct-solution the judgment must stand or fall. If, as we think is true, a sale was intended, plaintiff succeeded to Klinke\u2019s interest as cotenant with the latter\u2019s wife, subject to Hatton\u2019s lien as mortgagee of the interest of both Klinke and wife. In the adjustment of the property rights of the parties, plaintiff\u2019s interest shonld have been considered, whereas by the findings and judgment of the court it was determined that plaintiff has no interest whatever in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The court found that the beans in question were grown upon a tract of land owned by Klinke and wife as tenants in common and that the beans were the result of their joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>effort and were owned by them jointly, each one-half thereof, and that the beans were grown \u201con about thirty-nine acres\u201d of a certain forty-acre tract of land of which, as we understand, it is not disputed, the thirty acres referred to in said contract as Klinke\u2019s \u201cown ranch\u201d was a part; that the beans grown on this land were stored in the name of mortgagee Hatton and when taken by plaintiff were in the possession of Hatton and Klinke and wife. Whether or not the call in the contract for thirty acres would limit plaintiff\u2019s right to the beans grown on that proportion of the thirty-nine acres, the fact that the 294 sacks included beans harvested from the entire tract, including this thirty acres, should not, it seems to us, deprive plaintiff of the right, at least, to the possession of Klinke\u2019s interest in the beans grown on thirty acres of the land, as tenant in common with mortgagee Hatton and Klinke.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The point that the findings are inconsistent must be held well taken if, as we hold, there was a sale. Finding II is that the contract sued upon was entered into and finding III is that defendant Klinke did not sell any beans to Hamilton &amp; Henderson by that contract, and finding VI is to like effect, while finding IV is that there was no consideration for the execution of the contract. Findings II and III are not only inconsistent but repugnant. Findings II and IV are inconsistent, as we have seen there was a consideration and the contract shows that the consideration for the promise was a \u201cgood consideration\u201d under the definition given in section 1605 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">It is not necessary to consider appellant\u2019s second point that the court failed to find upon material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Because of what we deem to have been an erroneous meaning given to the contract in question by the court, the judgment must be reversed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Hart, J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on August 27, 1919; and a petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on September 25, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
