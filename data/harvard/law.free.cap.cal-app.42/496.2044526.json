H. Howell, moved into and took possession thereof under an agreement that they would occupy the same jointly, each contributing his own belongings and, in a way, sharing the living expenses, in accordance with which arrangement they lived until the acts of defendant complained of. That at most plaintiff\u2019s possession was a joint possession in conjunction with Howell and defendant, all having equal possession and right of egress and ingress to the house, to which defendant had a key, clearly appears. While a joint tenant or tenant in common may maintain an action of this character against a cotenant who has ejected him, his right to restitution is restricted to his right of reinstatement to the common possession only. (19 Cyc. 1141; <em>Lick </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>3 Cal. 59, [58 Am. Dec. 383].) The effect of the findings and judgment based thereon is to oust defendant from the property in which his right to possession is at least equal to that of plaintiff, to whom the exclusive right to the possession of the property is adjudged. \u201cAll that plaintiff was entitled to, therefore, was to be let into possession with the defendant,\u2014to enjoy his moiety.\u201d <em>(Lee Chuck </em>v. <em>Quan Wo Chong &amp; Co., </em>91 Cal. 593, [28 Pac. 45].) Our conclusion renders it unnecessary to discuss other alleged errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Conrey, P. J., and James, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
