The action was commenced one year and six months after said treatment had ceased. The defendant\u2019s demurrer upon the ground that the action was barred by the provisions of subdivision 3 of section 340 of the Code of Civil Procedure was sustained, and judgment in his favor followed, from which judgment this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">We are unable to distinguish this case either as to its substantial facts or as to the issue of law involved from the case of <em>Harding et al. </em>v. <em>Liberty Hospital Corp., </em>decided by this court in 24 California Appellate Decisions, page 1021, which decision was upon rehearing affirmed by the supreme court in 177 Cal. 520, [171 Pac. 98], On the authority of that case and of the cases cited therein the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Waste, P.
