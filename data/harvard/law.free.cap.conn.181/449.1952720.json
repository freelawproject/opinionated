The arbitrators rendered their written award in favor of the plaintiff, William Yail, on July 23, 1979, pursuant to a demand for arbitration that he had earlier filed. On August 2, 1979, the defendant, American Way Homes, Inc., was duly notified of the award. When the defendant took no action in response to this notification, the plaintiff on September 6, 1979, more than thirty days after the notification, applied for an order that his award be confirmed. The trial court, <em>Melville, J., </em>after a hearing, confirmed the award and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The dispute before the arbitrators arose out of a written contract between the parties dated October 14, 1977. In that contract the defendant promised to construct a house and, upon its completion, to convey title to the underlying land and the house to the plaintiff. The contract contained a broad arbitration clause, providing: \u201cAny and all disputes and controversies of every kind and nature between Buyer and Seller arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or related to any aspect thereof shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules then obtaining of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The defendant does not dispute the breadth of this arbitration clause. He argues instead that the award is unenforceable because it was not entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>on the land records and hence violates General Statutes \u00a7 47-28. That statute requires recordation of any arbitral award \u201cpurporting to decide the title to real estate.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court held that \u00a7 47-28 had no application to the case before us, even though the arbitrators awarded specific performance of the contract to the plaintiff. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The process which governs the confirmation of arbitral awards is well settled by our cases. If the parties have agreed in the underlying contract that their disputes shall be resolved by arbitration, the arbitration clause in the contract is a written submission to arbitration. <em>Gores </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>150 Conn. 554, 557, 192 A.2d 210 (1963); <em>Batter Building Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Kirschner, </em>142 Conn. 1, 9, 110 A.2d 464 (1954). This submission can be invoked by a demand for arbitration by one or both parties when a dispute arises. The agreement for submission constitutes the charter for the entire ensuing arbitration proceedings. <em>Malecki </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>181 Conn. 211, 213, 435 A.2d 13 (1980); <em>Ramos Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin Construction Co., </em>174 Conn. 583, 587, 392 A.2d 461 (1978); <em>Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>148 Conn. 192, 197, 169 A.2d 646 (1961); <em>Amalgamated Assn. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>142 Conn. 186, 191, 112 A.2d 501 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The award of specific performance in this case, on its face, falls squarely within the terms of the arbitration clause to which the defendant agreed. Had the defendant wished to challenge the arbitrators\u2019 award as exceeding the powers conferred upon them by the contract, he could have asked that the award be vacated under General Statutes \u00a752-418 (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant concededly failed to do so within the thirty-day period stipulated by General Statutes \u00a7 52-420 for such an application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The arbitral award was, therefore, properly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>firmed by the trial court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> since the defendant, the party attacking the award, failed to establish its invalidity. <em>Malecki </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>supra, 214; <em>Von Langendorff </em>v. <em>Riordan, </em>147 Conn. 524, 527, 163 A.2d 100 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Upon confirmation of the award, the order of specific performance will have to be entered upon the land records to affect legal title and to bind innocent third persons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The arbitral award itself does not resolve a dispute about title to real estate. As in the case of an arbitral award concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>location of a boundary line; see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Seitz, </em>87 Conn. 678, 683-84, 89 A. 257 (1914); \u00a747-28 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47-28 provides: \u201cadmissibility of award of arbitrators as evidence.
