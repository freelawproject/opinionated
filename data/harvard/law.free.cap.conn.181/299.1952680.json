He was found guilty by a jury of six of a lesser included crime, second degree larceny by receiving stolen property, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-119 (8) and 53a-123 (a) (2). The defendant has appealed from the judgment rendered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The trial court\u2019s finding on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence is as follows: Officer Marlin Livey was on patrol on route 8 in Trumbull on October 12, 1976, at about 1 p.m., when he observed a brown vehicle with no license plate at the front but one at the rear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Livey turned his police car around, turned on his overhead lights and pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road. He stopped the vehicle because the front license plate was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>When the vehicle had stopped, the driver, Ealph Berrios, immediately left the car and hurriedly walked back approximately half a car length to the police car, before Livey could get out. Livey exited the police car and instructed Berrios to return to his car and to produce his license and registration. While standing next to the Berrios vehicle, Livey observed a television set on the rear seat. Livey then asked Berrios to accompany him back to the police car. Livey asked Berrios if he owned the television set and Berrios replied that he did. Livey then asked Berrios to remain alongside the police vehicle while he walked over to the passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The passenger was the defendant, Louis Anibal Perez. Livey tried to speak to him but the window was rolled shut and Livey could barely hear the conversation. When Livey asked him to roll down the window, Perez replied that it was broken. Livey asked the defendant to open the door. Livey and Perez opened the door together. Livey observed Perez using his feet and legs in an attempt to hide a silver pitcher and some jewelry, and saw earrings, necklaces and things of that nature scattered all over the carpet of the vehicle. Perez did not answer Livey\u2019s questions and became argumentative. Livey asked Perez to remain in the vehicle and closed the door, then returned to the police car and called for assistance. After Livey had completed his call he heard something strike the ground in the dry leaves to the right of Berrios\u2019 car. He saw a black object fly through the air and land on the ground. Perez was seated in the passenger side of the car and the sunroof was open.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">When additional officers arrived, they detained Berrios while Livey approached Berrios\u2019 car and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>asked Perez to step ont. When Perez got out, Livey saw in full view all of the jewelry he had not seen before. On the floor of the driver\u2019s side he found a jewelry box. In the jewelry box was a piece of paper with the name and address of a Westport resident and half of a black leather case with identification. Outside the ear, in the area where he had seen objects thrown, he found jewelry, necklaces, a few earrings, and the other half of the black leather case containing a numbered Fairfield police badge.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Livey contacted police headquarters and furnished them with the information found on the two pieces of identification. When they informed him of a burglary at the Westport residence in which items of jewelry had been taken, Livey arrested both Berrios and Perez. After the defendants were arrested, the trunk was opened and searched. Other items of silver were found in the trunk. The Ber-rios vehicle was towed to police headquarters and inventoried. Additional jewelry was found during the inventory search at headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The defendant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has assigned error in one paragraph of the court\u2019s finding, claiming that this fact was found without evidence. An appendix to the state\u2019s brief contains evidence from the transcript which supports the court\u2019s finding. The attacked paragraph in the finding cannot be stricken. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>174 Conn. 434, 443, 389 A.2d 756 (1978). The defendant also assigns error in the court\u2019s failure to include other facts which the defendant claims are material and either admitted or undisputed. \u201cTo secure an addition to the finding, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>appellant must point to some part of the appendix, the pleadings, or an exhibit properly before us which discloses that the appellee admitted that the fact in question was true or that its truth was conceded to be undisputed.\u201d <em>Malarney </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>159 Conn. 342, 344, 269 A.2d 274 (1970). Facts which are not material and could not affect the result cannot be added to the finding. <em>Xerox Corporation </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>175 Conn. 301, 304, 397 A.2d 1367 (1978). The facts which the defendant seeks to add to the finding are either contradicted by other facts found or implied in the findings made. No additions to the finding are warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The defendant has raised three other issues on appeal. First he claims error in the court\u2019s denial of a pretrial motion to suppress and subsequent admission into evidence of items seized in the allegedly illegal search of the vehicle and surrounding area. The defendant claims that the evidence seized without a warrant from the automobile in which he was riding as a passenger was obtained in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights. U.S. Const., amends. IV, XIV; Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 7. The defendant has standing to assert a violation of his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution because although he was only a passenger in the Berrios vehicle and had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the areas of the car searched; <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 99 S. Ct. 421, 58 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1978), reh. denied, 439 U.S. 1122, 99 S. Ct. 1035, 59 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1979); he was charged with an offense in which possession is an essential element and that same possession establishes standing under <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 263-64, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1960), which in this respect has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>not been overruled. <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 135 n.4; <em>State </em>v. <em>Paoletto, </em>181 Conn. 172, 177, 434 A.2d 954 (1980). Here the defendant was charged with receiving stolen property by retaining such property knowing that it had been stolen. Since retention of the property is an esssential element of the crime charged and retention is tantamount to possession, the defendant had standing to challenge the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The defendant concedes the legality of Livey\u2019s initial stop of his vehicle for an apparent motor vehicle violation under General Statutes \u00a7 14-18. The stop was clearly permissible under <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 663, 99 S. Ct. 1391, 59 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1979). The court found that Berrios then immediately exited the vehicle and hurriedly walked back to the police car. At this point Berrios was required under General Statutes \u00a7 14-217 to surrender his operator\u2019s license and registration to Livey upon Livey\u2019s request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Livey returned with Berrios to his car to obtain Berrios\u2019 license and registration, and saw the television set on the rear seat in plain view, Livey was standing in a position where he had a right to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Livey was performing a reasonable and legitimate investigative function when he asked Berrios <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>who owned the television set. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 22, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968). \u201cEffective crime prevention and detection underlie the recognition that a police officer may, in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner, approach a person for purposes of investigating possible criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>165 Conn. 577, 584-85, 34:5 A.2d 532 (1973). The finding states that \u201cOfficer Livey asked Mr. Berrios if he owned the television set, and Mr. Berrios responded that he did.\u201d As the defendant states in his brief, mere suspicion is insufficient justification for the warrantless search of an automobile. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 50-51, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1970); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 155-56, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 (1925); 1 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 3.1 (a), pp. 440-41. If, however, a police officer\u2019s suspicions upon a lawful stop are further aroused, the stop may be prolonged and the scope enlarged as required by the circumstances, provided the scope of the investigation remains within the limits created by the facts upon which the stop is predicated and the suspicion which they arouse. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 21-22, 29; <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 585. Berrios\u2019 manner could well have precipitated Livey\u2019s minimal intrusion into the constitutionally protected interests of Perez which occurred when Livey tried to ask Perez, from outside the car, who owned the television set. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 20-22. After Livey asked Perez to roll the window down and Perez indicated that he couldn\u2019t because it was broken, Livey asked Perez to open the door. This was a reasonable request in view of the circumstances. <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>434 U.S. 106, 108-109, 98 S. Ct. 330, 54 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1977). It was also a request in which Perez acquiesced; Perez and Livey together opened the door. It was then that the jewelry and silver which Perez was trying to conceal with his feet came into plain view. \u201c[OJbjeets falling in the plain view of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 234, 236, 88 S. Ct. 992, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1067 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoffler, </em>174 Conn. 452, 461, 389 A.2d 1257 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>163 Conn. 76, 82-83, 301 A.2d 234 (1972). The court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The defendant claims error in the court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial and a motion to suppress evidence of a previously undisclosed oral statement allegedly made by the defendant to a police detective. At the scene of the arrest, the defendant made two oral statements at different times; one to a police detective, the other to a police sergeant. Both statements were elicited by police questioning. Despite a court order issued four months before trial which directed the state to disclose \u201call statements, admissions, or confessions made by the defendant whether written, oral, or electronically recorded,\u201d only one of those statements was disclosed to the defense before trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The other was elicited on direct examination by the state of the police detective to whom the statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The detective testified that he appeared on the scene of the arrest to photograph the items found in the car. Just prior to taking the photographs he had a conversation with the defendant. When he asked Perez where he had gotten the items found in the car, Perez responded that he was helping his friend move these items from one apartment to another. As soon as this testimony was given, defense counsel objected and asked that the jury be excused. In the jury\u2019s absence, defense counsel moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the state had elicited an oral admission from the defendant which it had failed to disclose to the defense as required by the court order. Counsel was particularly concerned because the state acknowledged that it still intended to introduce the defendant\u2019s other statement to the police sergeant that he had found those items on the side of the Merritt Parkway.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In the jury\u2019s absence it was established that the detective did not file a report concerning the defendant\u2019s statement and had not revealed this information to anyone prior to the day of his testimony. Defense counsel contended that the state had a continuing duty to disclose such information under Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 2145<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (now Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 734) as soon as the state became aware of it and certainly before introducing it as evidence in front of the jury. The state responded by telling the court that it was only a few minutes before 2 o\u2019clock, when the detective was scheduled to take the stand, that it first learned of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>statement and that, if anything, the statement appeared to be exculpatory. The court offered defense counsel a continuance but the offer was not accepted. The state then introduced, in the presence of the jury, testimony of the police sergeant whom Perez had told he found the items by the roadside in some bushes.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The defendant concedes that \u201c[tjhere is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case.\u201d <em>Weatherford </em>v. <em>Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S. Ct. 837, 51 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1977); <em>Wardius </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>412 U.S. 470, 474, 93 S. Ct. 2208, 37 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1973); 2 Wharton, Criminal Procedure (12th Ed.) \u00a7 381. The defendant argues that although his statement was exculpatory on its face, its eviden-tiary effect, when juxtaposed with his other statement to the police sergeant, was inculpatory because the statements were contradictory. Since the net effect of the introduction of both statements was to cast doubt on the defendant\u2019s credibility, the defendant could have benefited from the state\u2019s prior disclosure of the statement made to the detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The defendant does not deny that the prosecutor was unaware of his statement to the detective until a few minutes before the detective was to testify as a witness for the state. Nor does the defendant claim that he was denied an opportunity to cross-examine the detective to whom the statement was made. The defendant admits that the court offered him a continuance to prepare other evidence to counter the effects of the detective\u2019s testimony. Here the item which the state failed to disclose to the defendant is the defendant\u2019s own statement. The purpose of criminal discovery is \u201cto prevent surprise and to afford the parties a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>opportunity to prepare for trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>181 Conn. 254, 265, 435 A.2d 38 (1980). It cannot be said that Perez was surprised by the introduction of his statement to the detective. Whether Perez chose to disclose to his attorney the fact that he made that statement is another matter. Perez\u2019 attorney had reason to believe the detective would testify on behalf of the state to introduce the photographs he had taken. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>225 Kan. 259, 261, 589 P.2d 616 (1979) (\u201c[Ejvidence not disclosed to the defendant before trial is not suppressed . . . if the defendant has personal knowledge thereof ----\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>587 S.W.2d 299, 302-303 (Mo. App. 1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>571 S.W.2d 776, 778 (Mo. App. 1978) (Evidence subject to disclosure only if the facts indicate that the state is in possession of such evidence which is unknown to the defense and did not disclose its existence; not if the defendant knows the evidence exists and is in the state\u2019s possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The sole issue presented is whether the trial court abused its discretion by offering a continuance under Practice Book, 1963, \u00a72158 (2)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (now Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7747 [2]) instead of granting the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the statement or the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018The general principle is that a mistrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>should be granted only as a result of some occurrence on the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial. . . . Although it is true that a state\u2019s attorney should scrupulously avoid questions of probable impropriety, we recognize that the trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during a trial . . . [and that] [t]he trial court has a wide discretion in passing on motions for mistrial. . . . (Citations omitted.)\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 720-21, 419 A.2d 866 (1979). Suppression of relevant, material and otherwise admissible evidence is a severe sanction which should not be invoked lightly. . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>supra, 265. In determining what sanction is appropriate for failure to comply with court ordered discovery, \u201cthe trial court should consider the reason why disclosure was not made, the extent of prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other relevant circumstances.\u201d Id. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by offering the defendant a continuance in lieu of granting his motions to strike the evidence and for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The defendant\u2019s brief includes passing mention of the fact that the state did not show, before introducing the defendant\u2019s statement as evidence, that the defendant had been advised of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). Although the record is silent, the defendant\u2019s rendition of the facts would show that no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given before the police detective asked Perez where he obtained the items found in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The defendant\u2019s statement in itself was not inculpatory. Nor was it relevant to the state\u2019s proof of any element of the crime charged. The court, in summarizing the evidence, stated that the ownership of the property was not in dispute. The statement was merely cumulative of evidence already overwhelming with regard to guilt. The error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967); <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>State, </em>173 Conn. 334, 338-39, 377 A.2d 1087 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The defendant argues that he was denied due process of law by the court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the issue of intent. This claim is considered although no exception was taken because it affects a fundamental right. <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>180 Conn. 171, 429 A.2d 457 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The court instructed the jury that \u201cthere is just one crime\u201d in this case: \u201cThat\u2019s larceny by receiving stolen property.\u201d The court recited the contents of the information which alleged that Perez \u201cdid retain the legal property of one Todd L. Boersma, valued in excess of two thousand dollars, knowing that said property was probably stolen in violation of section 53a-119, subsection 8, and section 53a-122, subsection (a) (2) of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d The court continued by stating the statutory definition of receiving stolen property,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> then said: \u201cNow, you will recall I have read the information. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The state alleges in the information that it was retained. That\u2019s what the state is restricted to here. So for onr purposes the statute reads as follows: A person is guilty of larceny by receiving stolen property if he retains stolen property knowing that it has probably been stolen or believing it has probably been stolen, unless the property is retained with purpose to restore it to the owner. I\u2019ll read it once more because I want to make sure you have it clearly in mind as we go through the rest of it. A person is guilty of larceny by receiving stolen property if he retains stolen property knowing that it has probably been stolen or believing it has probably been stolen, unless the property is retained with purpose to restore it to the owner. Now, each one of those elements has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and again let me reiterate. This does not deal with two separate crimes just because there are two separate statutes. There is only one crime and that\u2019s larceny by receiving stolen property, and the receiving part, part of the receiving statute which the state has alleged is that the property was retained knowing it was stolen. So there is just one crime even though there are two statutes mentioned. That\u2019s larceny by receiving, stolen property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The court then stated the general definition of larceny as it appears in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and instructed the jury on its elements, followed again by the statutory definition of receiving stolen property as contained in \u00a7 53a-119 (8) and elaboration on its elements. In charging the jury on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>crime of larceny, in which intent is an element, the court gave some preliminary instructions on intent,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> then said: \u201cUnder our law every person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act. Accordingly you may know a person\u2019s intent by his acts or by his words, and so larceny by receiving really consists, is defined and really consists of three elements: There must be a retention or withholding. . . . The withholding, the retention, must be wrongful. . . . The retention must be with the intent to deprive the owner of the use and benefit of the property or to appropriate it to the use of the taker or a third person.\u201d The court then proceeded to discuss the elements of receiving stolen property which do not include intent but do include the element of knowledge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The court summed np its instructions with the following statement: \u201cTherefore, if yon should find proven beyond a reasonable doubt that on the 12th day of October, 1976, that this property was stolen, the property that yon have seen come into evidence, and that the defendant retained it knowing or believing that it bad probably been stolen and that he did not retain it with the purpose of restoring it to the owner, then yon would be justified in finding him guilty of the crime of larceny by receiving stolen property. So yon have to find three elements: It was stolen, 'that he knew it was stolen or knew it was probably stolen, and he didn\u2019t retain it with the purpose of restoring it to the rightful owner. Now, on the other hand., if after reviewing all the evidence in this -case you should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>find that one of the elements has not been proved or that yon have reasonable donbt as to the guilt of the defendant, you obviously must find the defendant not guilty of the charge and acquit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The defendant claims these instructions violated his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution because a reasonable juror could have interpreted the court\u2019s instructions on intent as creating a conclusive rather than a permissive presumption. <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 173-75; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>178 Conn. 689, 695-96, 425 A.2d 111 (1979). The court\u2019s use of the word \u201cpresumed\u201d was preceded by instructions that limited the jury\u2019s finding of intent to an inference from surrounding circumstances, followed by the words \u201cyou <em>may </em>know,\u201d and then followed immediately thereafter by a correct and precise charge on all the elements of \u00a7 53a-119 (8). (Emphasis added.) The court\u2019s instructions, when considered as a whole, \u201ccould not be reasonably construed to require a conclusive presumption or a shifting of the burden of proof and did not deprive the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. <em>Sandstrom, </em>supra; <em>Ulster County Court </em>[v. <em>Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 99 S. Ct. 2213, 60 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1979) ]; <em>Harrison, </em>supra, 697.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Although neither the briefs nor the record raise the point, intent is not an element of the crime charged in this case. As the court stated, the defendant was charged with larceny by receiving stolen property under General Statutes ^ 53a-119 (8). None of the elements of this crime includes a specific intent. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>legislature may, if it so chooses, ignore the common-law concept that criminal acts require the coupling of the evil-meaning mind with the evil-doing hand and may define crimes which depend on no mental element, but consist only of forbidden acts or omissions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Husser, </em>161 Conn. 513, 515, 290 A.2d 336 (1971). If the legislature may define crimes which depend on no mental element, then it certainly may require an element of knowledge but no specific intent. \u201cIf the statute does not include intent or knowledge as an element of the crime, their proof is not necessary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 5, 291 A.2d 240 (1971); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 250-51, 188 A.2d 65 (1963); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaetano, </em>96 Conn. 306, 316-17, 114 A. 82 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The trial court\u2019s instructions on knowledge as an element of the crime charged were competent and have not been attacked by the defendant. Although the court included at the beginning of its charge an instruction on intent which would have been required had the information or bill of particulars not specified subsection (8) of \u00a7 53a-119, this instruction was unnecessary and could not have confused the jury on the crime charged. If anything, the court\u2019s instructions on intent, which may have embodied a permissive presumption or inference, were too favorable to the defendant because intent was not an element of the crime charged. The court did not err in its instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-18 requires \u201ceach motor vehicle\u201d to display \u201cin a conspicuous place at the front and the rear of such vehicle the number plates and inserts or stickers denoting the expiration month and year of such registration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\"> Berrios was originally scheduled to be tried with Perez.

A person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> \u201cNow, intent to deprive another of property. What do we mean by intent? Intent is a mental operation which can be proved usually by the facts and circumstances surrounding, leading up to and following the events in question. Intent is basically a subjective element, the operation of a person\u2019s mind. We cannot x-ray a person\u2019s mind to determine what he\u2019s thinking. However, experience has shown that in determining the question of intent you may simply consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding and leading up to and following the events in question and from that you may determine what a person intended. Obviously you can\u2019t look into a person\u2019s head and determine what his intention was. It\u2019s very obvious that the only way you can determine intention is from the surrounding circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\"> \u201cNow, knowingly, what does that mean? A person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to circumstances described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware his conduct is of such nature or that such circumstance exists. That is to say, a person to act knowingly must act consciously, deliberately and willfully, being fully aware that his act is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Now, I have said that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant retained stolen property knowing or believing that it was probably stolen. You will note from that that the state does not have to prove that the defendant had actual knowledge that the property was stolen. Of course, if you find that the evidence supports beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>knowledge that the property was stolen you will obviously in that event return a verdict of guilty, provided -\u25a0 the state proves all the other necessary elements in accordance with the. charge. The state must, however, only prove that the defendant received or that he retained the property knowing that it-had probably been, stolen. You may find that he knew it was stolen but the only obligation or burden that the state has is that he knew jt .was probably stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Now, the bald fact that stolen property is found in the possession of a person is not sufficient evidence, to 'warrant -a- conviction unless the state proves beyond a reasonable \u2019 doubt, that the defendant retained the property knowing or Believing' that its had. probably been stolen. In other words, ladies and gentlemen, it is not-criminal to receive or retain stolen property unless it\u2019s done knowipgly. So that at the time he retained it he must have known that-it was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Now, that knowledge, whether or not'lhe^property was'stolen, -can be either actual or inferred. If may be proyen-by .direct evidence or it may be inferred from- -all the. circumstances of the \u25a0 case but the circumstances must be suck as'to satisfy you-beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant retained the property knowing or believing that the property had probably .been stol\u00e9n.' Now, ordinarily whether a person knows or believes that property, has probably -been, stolen can be established only through, the circttmsfanees \u00e1nd through inferences from other proven facts and circumstances.^ -In.-.other words, it is for you to determine tfrom all Jhe evidence and. from- hny inferences that you derive from-..provei;_ facts v^eth\u00e9r- 'the defendant knew or believed that the property had. prob\u20184bky'.been-stole\u00a3:\u2019,'';'r</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
