The defendants have appealed from the judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rendered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">The facts of the case can be summarized as follows : On April 15, 1977, at approximately 10 p.m., Officer Patrick Murphy of the Stamford police department was assisting the investigation of a traffic accident in a \u201cwell-to-do\u201d residential area of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Stamford. While directing traffic, he observed a black Ford automobile approaching at a rate in excess of the posted speed limit. The driver accelerated upon spotting the police officer, which led Murphy to believe he was taking evasive action. Since Murphy always watched vehicles in that area of town at this time of night, his curiosity was aroused and he gave chase. He told his fellow officer, \u201cI don\u2019t think you need me. I think I got something going with this vehicle in the area it is in. And due to the rate of speed, he appears to be taking off. I am going to pursue the vehicle.\u201d The other officer remarked that one of the occupants in the rear seat ducked down when the car passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">When Murphy discerned the marker number of the car, his curiosity turned to suspicion. This number had been listed by the police department in the past as a suspicious motor vehicle in this area of Stamford.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, Murphy recognized the car as one which belonged to a Stamford resident. He knew the woman who owned the car and knew her son, Dominick Fabricatore, whom he had stopped once or twice for minor incidents while driving the Ford. When the driver turned north on West Hill Road, Murphy knew that the car and driver were headed away from home, \u201cout of his element,\u201d and thought that the driver was attempting to \u201cgive me the brush-off.\u201d He activated his red light and siren and the driver of the Ford promptly pulled over. Murphy radioed headquarters for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Fabricatore immediately alighted from his automobile, closed the door and approached Murphy to offer his operator\u2019s license. Murphy asked for his registration. When Fabricatore returned to the car and opened the door and the glove compartment to get it, Murphy shone his spotlight at the glove compartment where he saw a screwdriver. Murphy took Fabricatore to the police cruiser and placed him in the back seat. When he asked Fabricatore who the passengers were, Fabricatore answered Gonzalez, Paoletto and Johnson. Murphy returned to the Ford alone, looked through the window and observed a pry bar in plain view on the floor in front of the back seat. He reached in through the door left open by Fabricatore and seized the pry bar. Murphy returned to the cruiser and asked Fabricatore to open the trunk. He responded that the trunk was empty, that he had no key and that Murphy had no right to search the trunk. Murphy then arrested Fabricatore for possession of burglar\u2019s tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Shortly thereafter, a police sergeant and two other officers from the burglary division arrived on the scene. One of the officers properly identified the third passenger in the car as Wayne Green,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and not Johnson as Fabricatore had told Murphy. The sergeant advised Murphy that he believed there was probable cause to search the car. All three passengers were arrested for possession of burglar\u2019s tools and placed in separate vehicles. The sergeant and the officers then proceeded to search the Ford. The officers found a screwdriver and two pair of gloves under the driver\u2019s seat, a clothes basket in the back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>seat, and numerous items, later identified by the victims of a housebreak, in the trunk to which the officers gained access by removing the back seat and back rest. The officers summoned a tow truck which towed the Ford to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">All four suspects were taken to the police station. From there Fabricatore accompanied a police detective and a sergeant of the burglary and robbery squad to the residence of C. David Baer where the three entered through an open rear door. The police officers took pictures of the ransacked house which were later introduced into evidence. The sergeant then drove Fabricatore back to the police station where he made a written statement. Fabricatore testified for the state at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The defendants raise three claims of error concerning violation of their rights upon search and seizure and arrest. They claim: (1) that the assertion of fourth amendment rights by them as passengers in Fabricators automobile has not been foreclosed by <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 99 S. Ct. 421, 58 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1978), reh. denied, 439 U.S. 1122, 99 S. Ct. 1035, 59 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1979); (2) that Murphy\u2019s stopping of the automobile was pretextual and unreasonable under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution; and (3) that Murphy did not have probable cause to arrest Fabricatore for possession of burglar\u2019s tools. We address each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress evidence seized from the car after a hearing on the motion in October, 1977. The defendants excepted to the court\u2019s ruling to preserve their fourth amendment claims for appeal. On appeal the state claims that the defendants, as mere passen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>gers in a vehicle belonging to another, have no standing to assert a fourth amendment violation concerning the search of that vehicle because under <em>Rakas, </em>supra, decided in 1978, the defendants had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the automobile, the glove compartment, the area under the front seat, or the trunk. Although the facts are similar, <em>Rakas </em>does not deny the defendants standing in this case. As the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Rakas, </em>supra, 135 n.4, the rule of automatic standing to contest an allegedly illegal search where the same possession needed to establish standing is an essential element of the offense charged, which was established in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1960), has not been overruled.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here the defendants were charged in separate informations which alleged first degree larceny and second degree burglary. Although the statutory definitions of these crimes do not specify \u201cpossession\u201d as an essential element,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendants\u2019 motion for a bill of particulars was denied and the prosecutor stated at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the suppression hearing that the state was proceeding on a theory of larceny by possession.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is true that at the time the suppression hearing was held, <em>Bakas </em>had not yet been decided. But even the prosecutor conceded that on the state\u2019s theory of the case the automatic-standing rule of <em>J ones </em>accorded the defendants the right to challenge the legality of the search. Because the rule of standing established in <em>J ones </em>survives Rakas<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we review the defendants\u2019 fourth amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The defendants claim that the court erred in denying their motion to suppress evidence seized from the car because the stop of the car was pre-textual and unreasonable under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and under <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 99 S. Ct. 1391, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>59 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1979).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>supra, 663, the court held that \u201cexcept in those situations in which there is at least articulable and reasonable suspicion . . . that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law, stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check his driver\u2019s license and the registration of the automobile are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d In <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>supra, the patrolman testified that he had not observed any traffic or equipment violations or any suspicious activity before stopping the defendant\u2019s vehicle, and that the only reason he made the stop was to check the driver\u2019s license and registration. The patrolman explained, \u201c \u2018I saw the car in the area and wasn\u2019t answering any complaints, so I decided to pull them off.\u2019 \u201d Id., 650-51. By comparison, the stop of the Fabricatore vehicle in this case was hardly the type of random spot-check of motor vehicles held unconstitutional in <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The conduct of the defendants and Fabricatore, the driver, as recited above, provided Murphy with an articulable and reasonable suspicion that the vehicle and its occupants were subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>to seizure for violation of the law; <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>supra, 663; and justified the stop for investigative purposes. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S. Ct. 1921, 32 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoffler, </em>174 Conn. 452, 457-59, 389 A.2d 1257 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Acklin, </em>171 Conn. 105, 110-11, 368 A.2d 212 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>165 Conn. 577, 584-85, 345 A.2d 532 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The defendants also claim that there was no probable cause to arrest them for possession of burglar\u2019s tools in violation of General Statutes \u00a753a-106.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Police officers may arrest without a warrant \u201cany person for any offense in their jurisdiction, when such person is taken or apprehended in the act or on the speedy information of others . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-1f (formerly \u00a76-49). The issue before the court is whether Murphy, when he stopped the Fabricatore vehicle, had probable cause to believe that the defendants were engaged in a violation of \u00a7 53a-106. \u201cProbable cause means more than mere suspicion. There must be facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has trustworthy information, sufficient to justify the belief of a reasonable person that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Penland, </em>174 Conn. 153, 155, 384 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 436 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 2237, 56 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>404 (1978), citing <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S. Ct. 223, 13 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1964); <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879 (1949). Murphy was well aware of the high incidence of burglaries in the area and recognized the Fabricatore vehicle by its marker number as one which had been identified by the police department as possibly connected with the crimes. The car accelerated upon passing him and a fellow officer noticed that one of the passengers ducked as they rode by. This prompted Murphy to articulate his belief that the driver and the occupants were trying to give him \u201cthe brush-off.\u201d Murphy also knew the identity of the driver and knew that he was neither near nor headed in the direction of his home. When Murphy stopped the car, he noticed that Fabricatore immediately hopped out and approached the cruiser to offer his license, as if to keep Murphy away from the car. It was when Murphy told Fabricatore to return to the vehicle to get the registration that he saw, by means of a spotlight, the screwdriver in the glove compartment. A few moments later he saw the pry bar<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in plain view on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">To establish probable cause, it is not necessary to produce a quantum of evidence necessary to convict. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 311, 79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327 (1959); <em>State </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>170 Conn. 601, 603, 368 A.2d 66 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>161 Conn. 371, 376, 288 A.2d 439, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1017, 92 S. Ct. 677, 30 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>664 (1972). Flight from a police officer may be a substantial factor in the determination of whether he has probable cause to arrest. <em>State </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>supra, 605. Here the conduct of the defendants and the surrounding circumstances which preceded the arrest support a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendants\u2019 two remaining claims concern evidence introduced by the state. The defendants contend that the prosecution, to prove that the value of the property taken exceeded $2000, introduced testimony of a jeweler who testified to its replacement value, not its market value.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-121 (a) (1) provides that \u201cvalue of property or services,\u201d as used to define first degree larceny in \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cshall be ascertained as follows: (1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, value means the market value of the property or services at the time and place of the crime or, if such cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, the cost of replacement of the property or services within a reasonable time after the crime.\u201d The jeweler testified on direct examination that the total market value of all the items identified as having been taken from the house and found in the trunk of the Fabricator vehicle was $2310. On the basis of his knowledge and experience, he estimated that there would have been no more than a 5 percent rise in the valuation of those items from the date they were taken, April 15, 1977, to the date of his appraisal, September 9, 1977. Thus, according to his appraisal and testimony on direct, the market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>value of the property taken on April 15, 1977, exceeded $2000. On cross-examination, defense counsel solicited a response from the witness in which he described his appraisal of one of the rings as \u201cwhat it would cost to replace it then, September 9.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is this response which the defendants claim indicates that the witness\u2019 appraisal was based on replacement and not market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The defendants\u2019 interpretation of the witness\u2019 testimony on cross-examination is not reasonable. It is true that he used the word \u201creplace.\u201d In view of the wording of the question posed to him, however, it is clear that the appraiser was testifying to what the ring was worth as a used ring, that is, what it would cost the victims of the burglary to replace it or another to purchase it as a used ring. Furthermore, the statute provides that replacement value is determinative if and only if market value \u201ccannot be satisfactorily ascertained.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-121 (a) (1). The state\u2019s expert testified to market value on direct examination, and there was no evidence that the market value of the property taken could not be satisfactorily ascertained. Nor was there any evidence that the replacement value for the jewelry and silver would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>differed from the market value set by the witness on direct. Furthermore, the defendants concede that the court properly instructed the jury on value. In addition to being instructed that the state had to prove market value, the jury was instructed that if they found the market value of property taken<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to be less than or equal to $2000, they could find the defendants guilty of larceny in the second, third or fourth degrees. Considering the testimony on value as a whole, we cannot conclude that the appraisal of the state\u2019s expert was conducted according to replacement and not market value, or even that replacement value differed from market value. The court\u2019s instructions were proper and the jury could have reasonably concluded that the defendants were guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of first degree larceny without resort to speculation and conjecture. <em>State </em>v. <em>Saracino, </em>178 Conn. 416, 419, 423 A.2d 102 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>McGinnis, </em>158 Conn. 124, 129-30, 256 A.2d 241 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendants\u2019 final claim of error is that the trial court should have stricken the pry bar and a screwdriver from evidence because the prosecution failed to show their relationship to the alleged crimes and the prejudicial impact of these items outweighed their probative value.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This court has repeatedly said that \u201c \u2018 \u201cEvidence as to articles found in the possession of an accused person sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>sequent to the time of the commission of a crime for which he is being tried is admissible only if it tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case; otherwise the law does not sanction the admission of evidence that the defendant possessed even instruments or articles adapted to the commission of other crimes . . . . The reason is analogous to that applicable to evidence of other crimes committed by a defendant but unrelated to the offense under investigation.\u201d . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) State v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 28, 425 A.2d 560 (1979). As the state concedes, there was no direct evidence that the pry bar and screwdriver found in the defendants\u2019 possession were the tools used to forcibly enter the home. The state\u2019s introduction of the pry bar and the screwdriver, however, tended to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. The state introduced these items through the testimony of Murphy who identified them as the pry bar he had taken from the back seat of the vehicle and the screwdriver found in the glove compartment. Mrs. Baer, the victim of the housebreak, then described the appearance of the door which had been equipped with dead bolt locks. She said that \u201csome sort of instrument had broken the door down and the molding around the door was knocked off.\u201d The police sergeant who had accompanied Fabricatore to the home to begin an investigation the night the defendants were arrested testified that \u201cthe rear door of the house had been forcibly entered\u201d and \u201cthe inner molding on the right hand side which was in the area of the lock . . . was pushed in toward the inside of the house.\u201d The state also introduced as exhibits two photographs from which the jury could observe the extent of the damage done to the door and the extent to which an unusually strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>object would have been necessary to effectuate the break-in. Fabricatore also testified that when he drove the defendants to the scene of the crime that night \u201ctwo pairs of gloves, two screwdrivers and a pry bar\u201d were in the car and \u201cthe two screwdrivers were in the front seat with the crowbar underneath the front seat between Wayne and I and the gloves were in the same place.\u201d His testimony indicates that the location of the pry bar and screwdriver in question changed sometime between the defendants\u2019 arrival at the home and their encounter with Murphy. \u201c \u2018Evidence is admissible when it tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. One fact is relevant to another fact whenever, according to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in connection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable. Unless excluded by some rule or principle of law, any fact may be proved which logically tends to aid the trier in the determination of the issue.\u2019 . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>171 Conn. 644, 674-75, 372 A.2d 82 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1106, 97 S. Ct. 1137, 51 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1977). The state\u2019s introduction of the pry bar and screwdriver tended to corroborate other direct evidence in the case, and their probative value as exhibits was not outweighed by their prejudicial effect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>160 Conn. 47, 52, 273 A.2d 689 (1970).
