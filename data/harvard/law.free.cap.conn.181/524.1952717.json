The defendant Ducci Electric Company, Inc. (hereinafter Ducci) attacks the court\u2019s action because it asserts that there were no facts to support a conclusion that Ducci might be liable to the plaintiff in the amount of $51,839.46, and that the attachment was therefore granted without probable cause, contrary to statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">This controversy arises from a letter whereby Ducci purportedly agreed to pay for goods sold to the defendant Harris Electric Supply, Inc. (hereinafter Harris) pursuant to certain purchase orders submitted to it by Ducci. When Harris defaulted on its payment to the plaintiff this action was instituted against both defendants. The plaintiff applied for a prejudgment remedy against Ducci for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>entire amount it claimed was owed by Harris. After a hearing the court granted the prejudgment remedy in the amount requested, and Ducci appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The remedy of attaching and securing a defendant\u2019s property to satisfy a judgment which the plaintiff may recover is unknown to the common law and is founded on and regulated by our statutory law. <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>172 Conn. 577, 582, 376 A.2d 60 (1977). No prejudgment remedy is available to a person in any action unless that person has complied with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-278a through 52-278g, which provisions govern prejudgment remedies. General Statutes \u00a7 52-278b; <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>supra, 583. Except in certain instances not applicable to this case, one of the prerequisites to the granting of such a remedy is that the plaintiff or some competent person sign an affidavit stating facts sufficient to establish probable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff. General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c (A) (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Facts enabling the court to establish the amount of damages involved must be alleged in such an affidavit. Led<em>gebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>supra, 585. The plaintiff\u2019s affiant <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stated that Ducci issued a letter of guarantee to the plaintiff, that Harris failed to pay the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>it owed and that that amount totaled $51,839.46. The affiant nowhere stated that the entire amount of the Harris debt was guaranteed by Ducci. On the contrary, at the hearing the plaintiff\u2019s own witness, responding to questioning by the court, testified that $51,839.46 was the sum total of the amounts Harris owed the plaintiff. This statement, coupled with the witness\u2019 prior testimony that Harris owed the plaintiff for transactions unrelated to the material ordered for Ducci, establishes that Ducci did not owe the plaintiff the entire amount demanded in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Because the plaintiff failed to establish the amount Dueci would be liable for were the plaintiff to secure a judgment, it did not sufficiently comply with the probable cause requirements of \u00a7 52-278c (A) (b), and the court erred in granting the prejudgment remedy. <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">There is error, the judgment granting the application for prejudgment remedy is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\"> \u201cAFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OP P.J.R.
