Her assignment of errors included a broad attack on the trial court\u2019s finding, but these claims have not been briefed and are therefore considered abandoned. <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>173 Conn. 438, 441, 378 A.2d 540 (1977). Those assigned errors which were pursued by the defendant in her brief are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The defendant first challenges both the complaint form prescribed by Practice Book, Form 504.1, and the method for service of process authorized by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-45 and 52-57. In particular, she claims that abode service is constitutionally deficient within the context of a dissolution proceeding. We disagree. \u201cAbode service is only a step removed from manual service and serves the same dual function of conferring jurisdiction and giving notice.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>150 Conn. 15, 20, 183 A.2d 848 (1962). The defendant also maintains that because the plaintiff did not affirm the truth of his allegations in a sworn complaint, the complaint does not satisfy constitutional standards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant has not demonstrated any prejudice flowing from the use of a complaint unsupported by the plaintiff\u2019s oath. In any event, in order to prevail at trial the plaintiff must prove the allegations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>complaint by competent evidence. In the present case, this was accomplished by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony taken under oath. The complaint used in this case did not give rise to any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Next, the defendant asserts that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-40 (c), to the extent that it authorizes the dissolution of a marriage if the marriage has broken down irretrievably, is vague, nullifies the other grounds for dissolution, prevents defenses and impairs the obligation of contracts, all in violation of constitutional strictures. The vagueness issue was resolved in <em>Joy </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>178 Conn. 254, 255-56, 423 A.2d 895 (1979); what was said there need not be repeated here. The gravamen of the unparticularized claim that irretrievable breakdown nullifies the other grounds for dissolution set forth in \u00a7 46b-40 (c) and prevents defenses appears to be that the legislature has sanctioned divorce on demand. This claim too was rejected in <em>Joy </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>supra. The notion that allowing marital dissolu-tions based on irretrievable breakdown impairs the obligation of contracts within the meaning of article one, \u00a7 10 of the United States constitution is bankrupt. Marriage is not a contract within the meaning of this clause of the constitution. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>125 U.S. 190, 210, 8 S. Ct. 723, 31 L. Ed. 654 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Again relying on constitutional grounds, the defendant argues that she was deprived of a jury trial in violation of both the United States constitution, amendment seven, and the Connecticut constitution, amendment four. The seventh amendment to the United States constitution applies only in federal courts. <em>Olesen </em>v. <em>Trust Company of Chicago, </em>245 F.2d 522, 524 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 896, 78 S. Ct. 270, 2 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1957); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Colt </em>v. <em>Eves, </em>12 Conn. 243, 251-52 (1837). See also <em>Hardware Dealers\u2019 Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Glidden, </em>284 U.S. 151, 158, 52 S. Ct. 69, 76 L. Ed. 214 (1931). Under onr state constitution, no party has a right to a trial by jury in an equitable action. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Spring Brook Dairy, Inc., </em>135 Conn. 294, 297, 64 A.2d 39 (1949). A dissolution of a marriage, although a creature of statute, is essentially an equitable action. <em>Pasqua-riello </em>v. <em>Pasquariello, </em>168 Conn. 579, 584, 362 A.2d 835 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The defendant next contends that the trial referee who heard the matter and rendered the dissolution decree acted without subject matter jurisdiction because the case was referred to him without the written consent of the parties or their attorneys as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-434.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While this section governs generally both the reference of cases to trial referees and the procedures for conducting hearings before such referees, the more particular provisions of \u00a7 46b-9<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> control the reference of dissolution actions. Although reference by consent may well be a preferable procedure, the latter statute contains no express requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the parties consent in writing to the reference. The question arises, however, whether the final sentence of \u00a7 46b-9, which provides that \u201c[a]ny hearing by such referee shall be conducted as provided in section 52-434,\u201d incorporates the written consent provision of \u00a7 52-434. We hold that it does not. Section 52-434 details both reference procedures and hearing procedures. In incorporating the hearing procedures from \u00a7 52-434 into \u00a7 46b-9, the legislature refrained from similarly engrafting any reference provisions into \u00a7 46b-9. The expression, in \u00a7 46b-9, of an alternative method for referring dissolution actions to a referee explicitly does away with the written consent of the parties or their attorneys as a precondition to the exercise of jurisdiction by the referee. See also Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The defendant also urges reversal on the basis of the exclusion of certain testimony that she claims denied her, as a female, the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Not even a trace of disparate treatment on the basis of gender has been pointed out by the defendant; our review of the record reveals no ground for such a claim being raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Finally, the defendant asserts that she is entitled to pendente lite relief upon reversal and remand of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>this case. Whatever the merits of her position may be, onr disposition of the ease renders further discussion of this issue unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\"> The defendant relies on article first, \u00a7 7 of the Connecticut constitution and amendments IV, V and XIV of the United States constitution. Of these provisions, the first two relate to searches and seizures. In her brief, the defendant has shown no connection between these provisions and the present case; we discern none. Therefore, we review the claimed error against the due process standards delineated by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\"> General Statutes 5 52-434 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cThe superior court may, with the written consent of the parties or their attorneys, refer any case pending before such court in which the issues have been closed to such a state referee who shall have and exercise the powers of the superior court in respect to trial, judgment and appeal in such case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46b-9.
