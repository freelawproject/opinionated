Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"atv-dedup-0\">The central issue in this appeal is whether the Superior Court properly ordered the sale, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-500,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of property owned by the plaintiffs and the defendant as tenants in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The plaintiffs, Angelo and William Delfino, and the defendant, Helen C. Vealeneis, own, as tenants in common, real property located in Bristol, Connecticut. The property consists of an approximately 20.5 acre parcel of land and the dwelling of the defendant thereon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs own an undivided 99/144 interest in the property, and the defendant owns a 45/144 interest. The defendant occupies the dwelling and a portion of the land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>from which she operates a rubbish and garbage removal business.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Apparently, none of the parties is in actual possession of the remainder of the property. The plaintiffs, one of whom is a residential developer, propose to develop the property, upon partition, into forty-five residential building lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In 1978, the plaintiffs brought an action in the trial court seeking a partition of the property by sale with a division of the proceeds according to the parties\u2019 respective interests.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant moved for a judgment of in-kind partition<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the appointment of a committee to conduct said partition. The trial court, after a hearing, concluded that a partition in kind could not be had without \u201cmaterial injury\u201d to the respective rights of the parties, and therefore ordered that the property be sold at auction by a committee and that the proceeds be paid into the court for distribution to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims essentially that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the parties\u2019 interests would best be served by a partition by sale is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>not supported by the findings of subordinate facts, and that the court improperly considered certain factors in arriving at that conclusion. In addition, the defendant directs a claim of error to the court\u2019s failure to include in its findings of fact a paragraph of her draft findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-495<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> authorizes courts of equitable jurisdiction to order, upon the complaint of any interested person, the physical partition of any real estate held by tenants in common, and to appoint a committee for that purpose. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When, however, in the opinion of the court a sale of the jointly owned property \u201cwill better promote the interests of the owners,\u201d the court may order such a sale under \u00a7 52-500.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Kaiser </em>v. <em>Second National Bank, </em>123 Conn. 248, 256, 193 A. 761 (1937); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Olmsted, </em>49 Conn. 509, 517 (1882).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">It has long been the policy of this court, as well as other courts, to favor a partition in kind over a partition by sale. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>78 Conn. 417, 420, 62 A. 342 (1905); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Olmsted, </em>supra; 2 American Law of Property, Partition \u00a7 6.26, pp. 112-14; 4A Powell, Real Property 612, p. 650; 59 Am. Jur. 2d, Partition \u00a7 118, pp. 864-65; 68 C.J.S., Partition \u00a7 125. The first Connecticut statute that provided for an absolute right to partition by physical division was enacted in 1720; Statutes, 1796, p. 258; the substance of which remains virtually unchanged</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>today.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Due to the possible impractieality of actual division, this state, like others, expanded the right to partition to allow a partition by sale under certain circumstances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>175 Conn. 463, 470-71, 399 A.2d 1280 (1978); see also Restatement, 2 Property c. 11, pp. 658-61. The early decisions of this court that considered the partition-by-sale statute emphasized that \u201c[t]he statute giving the power of sale introduces ... no new principles; it provides only for an emergency, when a division cannot be well made, in any other way. <em>The Earl of Clarendon </em>v. <em>Hornby, </em>1 P. Wms., 446.4 Kent\u2019s Com., 365.\u201d <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Monson, </em>23 Conn. 94, 97 (1854); see <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>supra, 471; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>78 Conn. 417, 420, 62 A. 342 (1905); <em>Vail </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>60 Conn. 374, 379, 22 A. 954 (1891). The court later expressed its reason for preferring partition in kind when it stated: \u201c [A] sale of one\u2019s property without his consent is an extreme exercise of power warranted only in clear cases.\u201d <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Kirk, </em>41 Conn. 9, 12 (1874). See also 59 Am. Jur. 2d, Partition \u00a7 118, p. 865. Although under General Statutes \u00a7 52-500 a court is no longer required to order a partition in kind even in cases of extreme difficulty or hardship; see <em>Scovil </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>14 Conn. 349, 360-61 (1841); it is clear that a partition by sale should be ordered only when two conditions are satisfied: (1) the physical attributes of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>are such that a partition in kind is impracticable or inequitable; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Olmsted, </em>supra; and (2) the interests of the owners would better be promoted by a partition by sale. <em>Kaiser </em>v. <em>Second National Bank, </em>supra; see <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Rosenfeld, 178 </em>Conn. 503, 423 A.2d 146 (1979). Since our law has for many years presumed that a partition in kind would be in the best interests of the owners, the burden is on the party requesting a partition by sale to demonstrate that such a sale would better promote the owners\u2019 interests. Accord, 4A Powell, Real Property If 612, p. 651; 59 Am. Jur. 2d, Partition \u00a7 118, p. 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The defendant claims in <em>effect </em>that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the rights of the parties would best be promoted by a judicial sale is not supported by the findings of subordinate facts. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Under the test set out above, the court must first consider the practicability of physically partitioning the property in question. The trial court concluded that due to the situation and location of the parcel of land, the size and area of the property, the physical structure and appurtenances on the property, and other factors,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a physical partition of the property would not be feasible. An examination of the subordinate findings of facts and the exhibits, however, demonstrates that the court erred in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">It is undisputed that the property in question consists of one 20.5 acre parcel, basically rectangular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>in shape, and one dwelling, located at the extreme western end of the property. Two roads, Dino Boad and Lncien Court, abut the property and another, Birch Street, provides access through use of a right-of-way. Unlike cases where there are numerous fractional owners of the property to be partitioned, and the practicability of a physical division is therefore drastically reduced; see, e.g., <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>175 Conn. 463, 464\u201465, 399 A.2d 1280 (1978); <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>98 Conn. 393, 394-95, 119 A. 361 (1923); <em>Candee </em>v. <em>Candee, </em>87 Conn. 85, 89-90, 86 A. 758 (1913); in this case there are only two competing ownership interests: the plaintiffs\u2019 undivided 99/144 interest and the defendant\u2019s 45/144 interest. These facts, taken together, do not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a physical partition of the property would not be \u201cfeasible\u201d in this case. Instead, the above facts demonstrate that the opposite is true: a partition in kind clearly would be practicable under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Although a partition in kind is physically practicable, it remains to be considered whether a partition in kind would also promote the best interests of the parties. In order to resolve this issue, the consequences of a partition in kind must be compared with those of a partition by sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The trial court concluded that a partition in kind could not be had without great prejudice to the parties since the continuation of the defendant\u2019s business would hinder or preclude the development of the plaintiffs\u2019 parcel for residential purposes, which the trial court concluded was the highest and best use of the property. The court\u2019s concern over the possible adverse economic effect upon the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>tiffs\u2019 interest in the event of a partition in kind was based essentially on four findings: (1) approval by the city planning commission for subdivision of the parcel would be difficult to obtain if the defendant continued her garbage hauling business; (2) lots in a residential subdivision might not sell, or might sell at a lower price, if the defendant\u2019s business continued; (3) if the defendant were granted the one-acre parcel,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on which her residence is situated and on which her business now operates, three of the lots proposed in the plaintiffs\u2019 plan to subdivide the property would have to be consolidated and would be lost; and (4) the proposed extension of one of the neighboring roads would have to be rerouted through one of the proposed building lots if a partition in kind were ordered. The trial court also found that the defendant\u2019s use of the portion of the property that she occupies is in violation of existing zoning regulations. The court presumably inferred from this finding that it is not likely that the defendant will be able to continue her rubbish hauling operations from this property in the future. The court also premised its forecast that the planning commission would reject the plaintiffs\u2019 subdivision plan for the remainder of the property on the finding that the defendant\u2019s use was invalid. These factors basically led the trial court to conclude that the interests of the parties would best be protected if the land were sold as a unified unit for residential subdivision development and the proceeds of such a sale were distributed to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Before we consider whether these reasons are sufficient as a matter of law to overcome the prefer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ence for partition in kind that has been expressed in the applicable statutes and our opinions, we address first the defendant\u2019s assignment of error directed to the finding of subordinate facts relating to one of these reasons. The defendant claims that the trial court erred in finding that the defendant\u2019s use of a portion of the property is in violation of the existing zoning regulations, and in refusing to find that such use is a valid nonconforming use. The plaintiffs properly point out, however, that the defendant failed to demonstrate that the paragraph of the draft finding that recites that the defendant\u2019s use is nonconforming was either admitted or undisputed by the plaintiffs. An examination of that portion of the parties\u2019 briefs directed to this issue discloses that, for some unexplained reason, the applicable zoning regulations and the date of their enactment were never introduced into evidence at the hearing below. Instead, the parties introduced only inconclusive and hearsay testimony to establish their respective positions on this issue. This deficiency in the evidence cuts both ways, however, and requires us to conclude that the particular paragraph of the defendant\u2019s draft finding cannot be added to the finding and that the court\u2019s finding in this regard must be stricken as unsupported by sufficient competent evidence. We are left, then, with an unassailed finding that the defendant\u2019s family has operated a \u201cgarbage business\u201d on the premises since the 1920s and that the city of Bristol has granted the defendant the appropriate permits and licenses each year to operate her business. There is no indication that this practice will not continue in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Our resolution of this issue makes it clear that any inference that the defendant would probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>be unable to continue her rubbish hauling activity on the property in the future is unfounded. We also conclude that the court erred in concluding that the city\u2019s planning commission would probably not approve a subdivision plan relating to the remainder of the property. Any such forecast must be carefully scrutinized as it is difficult to project what a public body will decide in any given matter. See <em>Rushchak </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>167 Conn. 564, 569, 356 A.2d 104 (1975). In this case, there was no substantial evidence to support a conclusion that it was reasonably probable that the planning commission would not approve a subdivision plan for the remainder of the property. Cf. <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 83, 90, 239 A.2d 482 (1968). Moreover, there is no suggestion in the statute relating to subdivision approval; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-25; that the undeveloped portion of the parcel in issue, which is located in a residential neighborhood, could not be the subject of an approved subdivision plan notwithstanding the nearby operation of the defendant\u2019s business. The court\u2019s finding indicates that only garbage trucks and dumpsters are stored on the property; that no garbage is brought there; and that the defendant\u2019s business operations involve \u201cmostly containerized . . . dumpsters, a contemporary development in technology which has substantially reduced the odors previously associated with the rubbish and garbage hauling industry.\u201d These facts do not support the court\u2019s speculation that the city\u2019s planning commission would not approve a subdivision permit for the undeveloped portion of the parties\u2019 property. See <em>Rogers Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth, </em>161 Conn. 6, 12, 282 A.2d 882 (1971); <em>White </em>v. <em>Herbst, </em>128 Conn. 659, 661, 25 A.2d 68 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The court\u2019s remaining observations relating to the effect of the defendant\u2019s business on the probable fair market value of the proposed residential lots, the possible loss of building lots to accommodate the defendant\u2019s business<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the rerouting of a proposed subdivision road, which may have some validity, are not dispositive of the issue. It is the interests of all of the tenants in common that the court must consider; see <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>98 Conn. 393, 395-96, 119 A. 361 (1923); 59 Am. Jur. 2d, Partition \u00a7 118, p. 865; and not merely the economic gain of one tenant, or a group of tenants. The trial court failed to give due consideration to the fact that one of the tenants in common has been in actual and exclusive possession of a portion of the property for a substantial period of time; that the tenant has made her home on the property; and that she derives her livelihood from the operation of a business on this portion of the property, as her family before her has for many years. A partition by sale would force the defendant to surrender her home and, perhaps, would jeopardize her livelihood. It is under just such circumstances, which include the demonstrated practicability of a physical division of the property, that the wisdom of the law\u2019s preference for partition in kind is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">As this court has many times stated, conclusions that violate \u201claw, logic or reason or are inconsistent with the subordinate facts\u201d cannot stand. <em>Russo </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>179 Conn. 250, 255, 425 A.2d 1282 (1979); <em>Connecticut Coke Co. </em>v. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>Haven, </em>169 Conn. 663, 675, 364 A.2d 178 (1975). Since the property in this case may practicably be physically divided, and since the interests of all owners will better be promoted if a partition in kind is ordered, we conclude that the trial court erred in ordering a partition by sale, and that, under the facts as found, the defendant is entitled to a partition of the property in kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-500 states: \u201csaee op rear or personae property owned by two OR more.
