Whether an agreement makes arbitration a condition precedent to an action in court depends on the language of the arbitration clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>true that in the absence of express language a provision for arbitration may be construed, by implication, to be a condition precedent to suit that implication must be so plain that a contrary intention cannot be supposed. It must be a necessary implication. The mere agreement to arbitrate, standing alone, does not give rise to the necessary implication that arbitration is a condition precedent to an action in court. For arbitration to be a condition precedent, the agreement to arbitrate must expressly so stipulate, or it must necessarily be implied from the language used. <em>Kantrowitz </em>v. <em>Perlman, </em>supra, 227-28; <em>First Ecclesiastical Society </em>v. <em>Besse, </em>98 Conn. 616, 119 A. 903 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In <em>Mayron\u2019s Bake Shops, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arrow Stores, Inc., </em>149 Conn. 149, 152, 176 A.2d 574 (1961), the arbitration clause read as follows: \u201cIn the event that any dispute shall arise hereunder or in relation to matters of payment or any matter or thing contained in this Agreement or in the rights or obligations of the parties hereto, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration . . . .\u201d By the terms of that agreement, disputes arising under it were arbitrable. Because no application was filed to set the arbitration procedure in motion, however, and no relief was sought under \u00a7 52-410<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to compel arbitration, this court there held that the trial court was warranted in refusing to order a stay of proceedings until arbitration was had.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The arbitration clause in this case does not require, either by express language or by necessary implication, arbitration as a condition precedent to court action. Nor was an application to compel arbitration ever made in this case. The court therefore erred in granting the defendant town of Vernon\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that arbitration was a condition precedent to bringing an action on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">As already noted, the parties to the contract are the town of Vernon and the plaintiff. Count four of the complaint names the members of Vernon\u2019s building committee, both individually and in their official capacities, as defendants. Since they are not parties to the contract and cannot be joined in arbitration without their consent, the court erred in granting their motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to overrule the granting of the motions to dismiss and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> The plaintiff also argues that the court erred in not granting a stay pursuant to \u00a7 52-409 of the General Statutes. Section 52-409 provides: \u201cstay of proceedings in court. If any action for legal or equitable relief or other proceeding is brought by any party to a written agreement to arbitrate, the court in which such action or proceeding is pending, upon being satisfied that any issue involved in such action or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such agreement, shall, <em>on motion of any party to the arbitration agreement, </em>stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration has been had in compliance with the agreement, provided the person making application for the stay shall be ready and willing to proceed with such arbitration.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Sinee no such motion for a stay was before the court, the court clearly did not err in not granting one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\"> The arbitration clause in <em>Kantrowitz </em>v. <em>Perlman, </em>156 Conn. 224, 240 A.2d 891 (1968), read as follows: \u201cIn the event that the parties shall be unable to agree with respect to any question relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>to the Beereational Area which may arise under the provisions of this Article, or otherwise, it is agreed that such question or controversy shall be submitted for arbitration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> General Statutes \u00a752-410 provides in pertinent part: \u201cA party to a written agreement for arbitration claiming the neglect or refusal of another to proceed with an arbitration thereunder may make application to the superior court . . . for an order directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in compliance with their agreement. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
