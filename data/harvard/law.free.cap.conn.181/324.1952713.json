Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9J\">This case presents an important question of first impression in this state that concerns the extent to which documents in the possession of state agencies are subject to public disclosure under our Freedom of Information Act (General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-15, l-18a, l-19-l-19b, 1-21, l-21a, l-21c-l-21k). In February of 1975, Kenneth G. Wilson, vice president for academic affairs at the University of Connecticut, appointed seven people to serve on a committee he had established and denominated the program review committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>(hereinafter the PEC). The PEC was composed of the deans of the graduate school of engineering and the college of arts and sciences and four faculty members, one of whom was a member of the executive committee of the university senate and another who was a member of the university\u2019s budget committee. The function of the PEC was to review the operations of the various academic departments of the university and to make recommendations to Wilson aimed at improving efficiency in those departments. The recommendations, which took the form of periodic memoranda directed to Wilson, included changes in the existing administrative structure and programs within the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On September 14, 1976, William Pinch, chairman of the federation of students and service organizations, which is the university\u2019s student government, directed a letter to Wilson seeking access to the documents received by him from the PEC. Wilson refused to permit the examination of these documents and Pinch appealed that decision to the freedom of information commission (hereinafter the commission) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (b). The commission, which never examined the documents, concluded that they were records subject to disclosure under \u00a7 1-19 of the Freedom of Information Act and ordered Wilson to provide Pinch with access to them. Wilson, the university, and the state of Connecticut appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the Court of Common Pleas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (d).</p>\n<p id=\"Aik\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The university claimed that the PRC documents were not public records; that if they were public records, they were exempt from the act\u2019s disclosure provision because they were (1) preliminary drafts or notes it is in the public\u2019s interest not to disclose; (2) files similar to personnel or medical files, the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy; and (3) records, reports or statements of strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining. See footnote 4, infra. The trial court concluded that the PRC documents were not preliminary drafts or notes exempt from disclosure under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) but that there was evidence that these documents con-tain\u00e9d information similar to personnel or medical files, the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy, and that some of the documents contained records, reports or statements of strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining. Accordingly, the trial court remanded the_cas'e.to the commission with direction to conduct \"a hearing and to examine the PRC documents-so as .to determine which portions of them are not subject to disclosure under the above exemptions.-</p>\n<p id=\"ach-dedup-0\">- The commission has appealed and the university has cross appealed. The university claims, that the court erred in concluding that the PRC documents are not exempt from disclosure as being preliminary' drafts' or notes. The commission claims that the trial court erroneously concluded that portions of the PRC documents are exempt from disclosure under the \u201c-similar file\u201d and the \u201ccollective bargain-i\u2019ng\u201d exceptions to the act\u2019s disclosure mandate.\u2019 The-commission also claims that -the court exceeded-its.. authority by remanding the case to it with direction for'further proceedings. \u2022-</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The Freedom of Information Act expresses a strong legislative policy in favor of the open conduct of government and free public access to government records. Representative Martin B. Burke, who sponsored the bill, commented on the floor of the house: \u201cThe legislature finds and declares that . . . the people do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. That the people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for them to know and that it is the intent of this law that actions taken by public agencies be taken openly and their deliberations be conducted openly and that the records of all public agencies be open to the public except in those instances where superior public interest requires confidentiality.\u201d 18 H. R. Proc., Pt. 8,1975 Sess., p. 3911; see also the remarks of Senator Robert L. Julianelle then cochairman of the Government Administration and Policy Committee, 18 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1975 Sess., pp. 2323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">As the remarks of Representative Burke indicate, however, the act does not confer upon the public an absolute right to all government information. Its careful delineation of the circumstances in which public meetings may be held in executive session; General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e); and in which agency records, or preliminary drafts or notes of such records, may properly remain undisclosed; General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b); reflects a legislative intention to balance the public\u2019s right to know what its agencies are doing, with the governmental and private needs for confidentiality. Contrary to the suggestion of the commission,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is this balance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>governmental and private needs for confidentiality with the public right to know that must govern the interpretation and application of the Freedom of Information Act. The general rule, under the act, however, is disclosure. General Statutes \u00a7 1-19. Exceptions to that rule will be narrowly construed in light of the underlying purpose of the act; cf. <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>169 Conn. 344, 355, 363 A.2d 170 (1975); <em>Church of Scientology of California </em>v. <em>United States Department of the Army, </em>611 F.2d 738, 742 (9th Cir. 1979); and the burden of proving the applicability of an exemption rests upon the agency claiming it.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Subsection (a) of \u00a7 1-19 of the General Statutes contains the broad public right to inspect or copy agency records.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsection (b) (1) of \u00a7 1-19<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>exempts from the pnrview of that right the following documents: \u201c[Preliminary drafts or notes provided the public agency has determined that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d Both the commission and the trial court concluded that the PBC documents were not \u201cpreliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>drafts or notes.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They based this conclusion on the fact that the \u201cdocuments in question are final drafts as far as the PRC is concerned, not subject to alteration\u201d; they are \u201cseparate, distinct and completed documents in and of themselves.\u201d This analysis misses the mark and is inconsistent with the object of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Although the legislative history on this portion of the act is not illuminating; see 18 H. R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1975 Sess., pp. 3901-13; 18 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1975 Sess., pp. 2322-36; it is clear from the language of \u00a7 1-19 (b) that the exemption contemplates two types of agency documents: one that is \u201cfinal\u201d and another that is \u201cpreliminary.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The distinction between these two types of documents does not consist of the extent to which the person or persons from whom they originate expect to alter them. If that were the case, a research memorandum that an administrative official requests from an aide con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>cerning a potential policy or staff change might he considered a \u201cfinal document\u201d subject to disclosure simply because the research aide does not intend to alter further the memorandum. It is clear that had the administrative officer prepared the memorandum himself but later decided to abandon the plan he studied, the memorandum would fall under the heading of \u201cpreliminary draft or notes.\u201d We do not think that the concept of preliminary, as opposed to final, should depend upon who generates the notes or drafts, or upon whether the actual documents are subject to further alteration. That the documents in question here were not subject to alteration, and hence were \u201cfinal\u201d vis-a-vis the PRC, is of little consequence if those documents do not have an operative and direct effect upon university policy or administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Instead, we believe that the term \u201cpreliminary drafts or notes\u201d relates to advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of the process by which government decisions and policies are formulated. See <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 150, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 44 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1975); <em>Exxon Corporation </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>466 F. Sup. 1088, 1097 (D. D.C. 1978) (construing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 [b] [5]); <em>Carl Zeiss Stiftung </em>v. <em>V.E.B. Carl Zeiss Jena, </em>40 F.R.D. 318, 324 (D. D.C. 1966), affirmed, 384 F.2d 979, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 952, 88 S. Ct. 334, 19 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1967). Such notes are predecisional. They do not in and of themselves affect agency policy, structure or function. They do not require particular conduct or forbearance on the part of the public. Instead, preliminary drafts or notes reflect that aspect of the agency\u2019s function that pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>cedes formal and informed decisionmaking. We believe that the legislature sought to protect the free and candid exchange of ideas, the uninhibited proposition and criticism of options that often precedes, and usually improves the quality of, governmental decisions. It is records of this preliminary, deliberative and predecisional process that we conclude the exemption was meant to encompass.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">This interpretation of the disclosure exemption of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) comports with similar law from other jurisdictions. Although our Freedom of Information Act does not derive from any model act or the federal Freedom of Information Act, other similar acts, because they are in pari materia, are interpretatively helpful, especially in understanding the necessary accommodation of the competing interests involved. See 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 51.06, 52.03. The federal Freedom of Information Act requires the disclosure of, among other documents, \u201c(A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases; (B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register; and (C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a) (2). In 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (b) (5) the act goes on to exempt from the disclosure requirements \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Addressing this exemption to the federal act and cases interpreting it, Professor Davis has written: \u201cThe key to all the cases is that the fifth exemption protects the deliberative materials produced in the process of making agency decisions, but not factual materials, and not agency law.\u201d 1 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (1978) \u00a7 5.33.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 44 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1975) the United States Supreme Court concluded that exemption five in the federal act, \u201cproperly construed, calls for \u2018disclosure of all \u201copinions and interpretations\u201d which embody the agency\u2019s effective law and policy, and the withholding of all papers which reflect the agency\u2019s group thinking in the process of working out its policy and determining what its law shall be.\u2019 \u201d Id., 153, quoting Davis, \u201cThe Information Act: A Preliminary Analysis,\u201d 34 U. Chi. L. Rev. 761, 797 (1967); see <em>McClelland </em>v. <em>Andrus, </em>606 F.2d 1278, 1286-87 (D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Cir. 1979); <em>Tabcor Sales Clearing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Treasury, </em>471 F. Sup. 436, 438 (N.D. Ill. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Moreover, the fact that the recommendational input derives from a person or body not charged with making the ultimate decision has been considered insignificant in determining whether the exemption from disclosure applies. See <em>Wu </em>v. <em>National Endowment for Humanities, </em>460 F.2d 1030, 1032 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Brinton </em>v. <em>United States Department of State, </em>476 F. Sup. 535 (D. D.C. 1979); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>465 F. Sup. 815, 820-21 (M.D. Pa. 1978); <em>Martin Marietta Aluminum, Inc. </em>v. <em>Administrator, General Services Administration, </em>444 F. Sup. 945, 949 (C.D. Cal. 1977); <em>Washington School District No. 6 </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>112 Ariz. 335, 541 P.2d 1137 (1975); <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>100 Misc. 2d 904, 420 N.Y.S.2d 265 (Sup. Ct. 1979). The Supreme Court made this point clear in <em>Renegotiation Board </em>v. <em>Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, </em>421 U.S. 168, 95 S. Ct. 1491, 44 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1975), where it applied exemption five to advisory memoranda presented to the Renegotiation Board by a regional board not responsible for making the ultimate decision in an adjudicative process. It once again made clear that the fifth exemption and the case law applying it \u201cdistinguish between predecisional memoranda prepared in order to assist an agency decisionmaker in arriving at his decision, which are exempt from disclosure, and postdecisional memoranda setting forth the reasons for an agency decision already made, which are not.\u201d Id., 184. It concluded that the advisory memoranda originating from the regional board, which lacks \u201cdecisional authority,\u201d were within the disclosure exemptions. See also <em>Tabcor Sales Clearing, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>v. <em>Department of Treasury, </em>471 F. Sup. 436 (N.D. Ill. 1979); <em>Exxon Corporation </em>v. <em>F.T.C., </em>466 F. Sup. 1088 (D. D.C. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Thus, the analysis employed by the federal courts in construing exemption five of the federal act is a temporal one: It distinguishes between pre-decisional, decisional, and postdecisional documents relating to agency law, policy, or procedure. Although exemption five in the federal act does not employ the same language as that appearing in our act\u2019s parallel exemption, the temporal measurement of documents, by the use of the term \u201cpreliminary\u201d and the implicit reference to the term \u201cfinal,\u201d in our statute suggests that the same analysis reflected in the federal decisions construing exemption five is appropriate in construing our statute\u2019s similar exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Under New York\u2019s Freedom of Information law the same result would also obtain. Drawing on federal case law on the subject, the court in <em>Miracle Mile Assn. </em>v. <em>Yudelson, </em>68 App. Div. 2d 176, 182, 417 N.Y.S.2d 142 (1979) said: \u201c[A]n agency may refuse to produce material integral to the agency\u2019s deliberative process and which contains opinions, advice, evaluations, deliberations, policy formulations, proposals, conclusions, recommendations or other subject matter.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See also <em>Dunlea </em>v. <em>Goldmark, </em>54 App. Div. 2d 446, 448, 389 N.Y.S.2d 423 (1976), aff\u2019d, 43 N.Y.2d 754, 372 N.E.2d 798 (1977) (on the opinion of the Appellate Division).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">These decisions recognize a legislative determination, implicit in the type of exemptions from dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>closure typically created, that good government requires in the predecisional stage uninhibited communication and exchange of opinions, ideas, and points of view. See <em>Mead Data Central, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Department of Air Force, </em>566 F.2d 242, 256 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Disclosure of documents containing snch communication would be \u201cinjurious to the consultative functions of government.\u201d See <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation </em>v. <em>United States, </em>157 F. Sup. 939, 946 (Ct. Cl. 1958), quoted in <em>Environmental Protection Agency </em>v. <em>Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 87, 93 S. Ct. 827, 35 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">It was this very communication that Wilson sought and obtained from the PRC. Wilson assured the members of the committee that their communications would remain strictly confidential.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This he was entitled to do under the circumstances of this case. The PRC was a wholly advisory committee. It had no statutory or university delegated anthority. Its members served at the pleasure of Wilson and its function was determined by Wilson. In a sense, the PRC was a \u201cresearch aide\u201d to vice president Wilson. See <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>579 P.2d 815, 819-20 (Okla. 1978) (open meetings law); cf. <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Athletic Council of Iowa State University, </em>251 N.W.2d 559, 561 (Iowa 1977) (open meetings law).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is significant, moreover, that because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>PRC does not constitute an \u201cagency\u201d under the act,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> its meetings would not be open to the public under \u00a7 1-21 of the act. Although this fact is by no means dispositive of the applicability of the preliminary drafts exemption, it does reinforce our interpretation of the exemption. See note, \u201cThe Definition of \u2018Agency Records\u2019 Under the Freedom of Information Act,\u201d 31 Stan. L. Rev. 1093, 1111-13 (1979). It would be difficult to understand why the legislature would not recognize the public\u2019s right to be present at the meeting of such an advisory body yet recognize a public right to inspect the documents containing the recommendations and ideas generated at that meeting. See <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Parkinson, </em>48 Ill. App. 3d 797, 800-801, 363 N.E.2d 438 (1977) (university advisory committee); <em>McLarty </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of University System of Georgia, </em>231 Ga. 22, 23, 200 S.E.2d 117 (1973) (university advisory committee) ; <em>Washington School District No. 6 </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>112 Ariz. 335, 337-38, 541 P.2d 1137 (1975) (advisory committee established for benefit of board of trustees of school district).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Determining that the documents in question constitute preliminary drafts and notes under the act is not enough, however. The statute further requires the public agency to determine \u201cthat the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>General Statutes \u00a71-19 (b). Although the statute places the responsibility for making that determination on the public agency involved, the statute\u2019s language strongly suggests that the agency may not abuse its discretion in making the decision to withhold disclosure. The agency must, therefore, indicate the reasons for its determination to withhold disclosure and those reasons must not be frivolous or patently unfounded. Here, the university determined that disclosure of the documents would inhibit the PRC\u2019s candid advisory input and violate Wilson\u2019s promise of confidentiality; might embarrass members of the faculty and administration whose performance was criticized therein; and might cause \u201cneedless panic\u201d in the university community because of the recommendations for wide scale revisions of departmental structures contained in them. These reasons are sufficient under the circumstances of this case to satisfy the requirement of General Statutes \u00a71-19 (b) (l).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We direct our attention briefly to the trial court\u2019s concern over the fact that the documents in question were never examined by the commission or presented to the court. Where the nature of the documents, and, hence, the applicability of an exemption, is in dispute it is not only within the commission\u2019s power to examine the documents themselves, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>it is contemplated by the act that the commission do so. General Statutes \u00a7 1-21 j (d) provides in part: \u201cSaid commission shall have the power to investigate all alleged violations of [the act] and may for the purpose of investigating any violation hold a hearing, administer oaths, examine witnesses, receive oral and documentary evidence, have the power to subpoena witnesses under procedural rules adopted by the commission to compel attendance and <em>to require the production for examination of any hooks and papers which the commission deems relevant in any matter wider investigation or in question.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The commission may seek enforcement of orders made under this subsection by application to the Superior Court. Ibid. This provision anticipates that the commission will play a central role in resolving disputes administratively under the act. To fulfill this role effectively, the commission\u2019s determinations must be informed. It should not accept an agency\u2019s generalized and unsupported allegations relating to documents claimed to be exempt from disclosure. See <em>Church of Scientology of California </em>v. <em>United States Department of the Army, </em>611 F.2d 738, 742 (9th Cir. 1979). Unless the character of the documents in question is conceded by the parties, an in camera inspection of the particular documents by the commission may be essential to the proper resolution of a dispute under the act. Where such an inspection would be burdensome on the <em>commission; </em>see <em>Environmental Protection Agency </em>v. <em>Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 92-93, 93 S. Ct. 827, 35 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1973); or ineffective because of the absence of the adversarial process; see <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 820, 825 (D.C. Cir. 1973); other methods for ascertaining the character of the documents may be employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>by the parties and the commission. The agency representative may testify concerning the content and use of the documents, or supply affidavits to the commission relating to their content and use. Any such testimony or affidavits must not be couched in eonclusory language or generalized allegations, however, but should be sufficiently detailed, without compromising the asserted right to confidentiality, to present the commission with an informed factual basis for its decision in review under the act. See id., 826-27; <em>Mead Data Central, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Department of Air Force, </em>566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <em>Booth Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of Michigan, </em>93 Mich. App. 100, 111-12, 286 N.W.2d 55 (1979). No matter what method is utilized before the commission, however, one thing is clear: It is the agency that bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exemption, and therefore, the nature of the documents in question. See <em>Church of Scientology of California </em>v. <em>United States Department of the Army, </em>supra, 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In light of our disposition of this case, the commission\u2019s examination of the PRC documents is not necessary. This is so because the record discloses that Wilson testified before the commission concerning their contents in sufficient detail and neither the commission nor Finch questions the advisory and predecisional nature of those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In concluding,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we note the commission\u2019s argument that the trial court exceeded its authority under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) when it reviewed the commission\u2019s determination that none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>statutory exemptions was applicable in this case. The commission claims in its brief that it was not within the province of the trial court to determine whether the statutory exemptions were applicable and that the court was limited only to a determination of whether the commission\u2019s findings and conclusions were \u201cclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d General Statutes \u00a74-183 (g) (5). This argument cannot be substantiated. Judicial review of the commission\u2019s action is conducted pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (b) of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (d).
