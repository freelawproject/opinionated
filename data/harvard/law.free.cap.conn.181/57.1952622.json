Instead, the court entered an order of default and three days later, without a motion for judgment as required by Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 364, rendered judgment upon default for the plaintiff. In denying the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion to open this judgment, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">The purpose of the rule requiring the filing of a motion for judgment along with a motion for default is to put the other parties on notice that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>they fail to take any action to protect their interests they risk the entry of a judgment against them. \u201c \u2018It is fundamental in proper judicial administration that no matter shall be decided unless the parties have fair notice that it will be presented in sufficient time to prepare themselves upon the issue.\u2019 <em>Oster-lund </em>v. <em>State, </em>129 Conn. 591, 596, 30 A.2d 393.\u201d <em>Winick </em>v. <em>Winick, </em>153 Conn. 294, 298-99, 216 A.2d 185 (1965). The effect of the entry of the default was to preclude the defendant from making any defense to liability in the action. <em>Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Indomar, Ltd., </em>173 Conn. 269, 272, 377 A.2d 316 (1977). This alone, however, did not prevent it from raising defenses, on proper notice, at a hearing in damages. Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 367; <em>New England Floor Covering Co. </em>v. <em>Architectural Interiors, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 352, 356, 269 A.2d 267 (1970). Because the defendant was deprived of appropriate notice and an opportunity to be heard on the question of damages, the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to be proceeded with according to law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
