It is not, either in form or effect, an adjudication against the plaintiff upon matter alleged in arrest of judgment, but is merely the legal consequence of a ruling by the court that, upon all the evidence, the defendant was entitled to a verdict. Such a ruling, when, made upon the trial, is given effect through binding instructions, and between a <em>judgment </em>for defendant in pursuance of a directed verdict, and a judgment entered in his favor notwithstanding a verdict which had been taken for the plaintiff subject to a point reserved, there is no substantial distinction. They rest upon precisely the same foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">We adopt the opinion which was filed by the learned judge of the circuit court (109 Fed. 744), and for the reasons there presented the judgment of that court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
