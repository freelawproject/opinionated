The head of his department did define his duty as sea duty. This definition was .authorized by the Pay Readjustment Act of 1942, 37 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101 et seq., and the determination of the head of the department was final. There are no grounds upon which its finality may be questioned. Flying over the waters to-track down enemy submarines navigating under the waters, or surfacing, is sea duty of a decided nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-20\">But this same pay act provided that \u201cNo-rental allowance shall accrue to an officer having no dependents while he is on field' [or sea] duty,\u201d and that regulations in execution of this section shall be made by the President. 37 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-21\">The President proceeded to make these-regulations, and therein defined sea duty as-respects rental allowances as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018sea duty\u2019 shall mean service at sea by an officer on a vessel under orders,\u201d' etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-22\">Now the plaintiff was not performing service at sea on board a vessel, and therefore as regards rental allowance was not on sea duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-23\">There is no inconsistency whatever between the definition given by the President and that given by the head of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-24\">\u201cSea duty\u201d is not a self-defining term- and neither the President nor the head of the department were defining it in a universal sense. Their definitions were in authorized aid of separate statutory provisions. One definition was directed to the housing of an officer, the other to the hazardous nature of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-25\">We have no occasion for inquiring into-the validity of these definitions. Their application, we think, is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-26\">The plaintiff is entitled to recover.. Judgment will be entered for him in the-sum of $465, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-27\">JONES, WHITAKER, and LITTLE-TON, Judges, concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-28\">MADDEN, Judge, took no part in the-decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
