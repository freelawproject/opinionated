The Unjust Enrichment Claim ..........................................484</p>\n<p id=\"b497-47\">III.Conclusion................................................................485</p>\n<p id=\"b497-48\">This case had its genesis in the desire of Parmalat, which collapsed in 2003, to raise money by selling a minority of the stock of its Brazilian subsidiary, Parmalat Administracao (\u201cParmalat Brazil\u201d), at a time when that stock could not be sold in equity markets. Bank of America (together with its affiliates, \u201cBoA\u201d) conceived of and Parmalat engaged in a pair of matched trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>actions that were intended to provide off-balance sheet debt financing to bridge the gap until the Parmalat Brazil stock could be sold on attractive terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In concept, the transactions were no different from many other structured finance deals. BoA arranged for the creation of two special purpose entities (\u201cSPEs\u201d) \u2014 in this case, both Cayman Islands companies \u2014 that would exist only on paper and only for the purpose of completing the transaction. The SPEs would (a) borrow $300 million from institutional investors, and (b) buy the Parmalat Brazil stock from Parmalat Brazil for $300 million. The debt eventually was to have been repaid with the proceeds of the sale by the SPEs of the Parmalat Brazil stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">This deal had at least two attractions to Parmalat beyond the fact that it raised $300 million. First, assuming that it was structured to conform to the relevant accounting rules \u2014 and no one suggests that it was not \u2014 the debt incurred by the SPEs would not appear on Parmalat\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. Second, by \u201cselling\u201d this minority interest to the SPEs for $300 million, the transaction implied a high value for Parmalat Brazil as a whole and thus for the majority stake in Parmalat Brazil that Parmalat continued to own.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">But why would institutional investors pay $300 million for notes of the SPEs in circumstances in which the only source of money to pay the notes when due would have been the hoped-for proceeds of a minority interest in Parmalat Brazil that could not have been sold for such a price at the inception of the deal? The short answer is that they would not. So BoA, in order to make the deal salable, recommended and Parmalat provided two additional sources of funds to pay the debt in the event the Parmalat Brazil stock could not be sold at a price sufficient to satisfy the notes. The first was a \u201cput\u201d option to give the SPEs the right to sell their Parmalat Brazil stock to Parmalat Capital Finance Limited (\u201cPCFL\u201d) for $300 million if that stock could not otherwise be sold for a sufficient sum. The second was a guarantee by Parmalat of PCFL\u2019s obligation to perform if the put option were exercised. Thus, the ability of the institutional investors to be repaid depended upon any one of three conditions being satisfied: (1) the successful sale of the SPEs\u2019 Parmalat Brazil stock for at least $300 million, (2) the performance by PCFL of its obligations under the put, or (3) Parmalat\u2019s performance of its guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">In the end, none of these conditions was satisfied. The structure failed. The institutional investors' \u2014 chief among them BoA, which had bought $165 million of the notes \u2014 were left holding the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In hindsight, the reasons for this debacle are plain. Even when the deal closed, the likelihood that the Parmalat Brazil stock was worth or, in any reasonable time frame, likely to be worth $300 million was uncertain at best. The only apparently solid sources of funds to repay the debt issued by the SPEs were the PCFL put and the Parmalat guarantee. But Parmalat and its entire organization, including PCFL, collapsed in December 2003 upon the discovery of a massive fraud. This resulted in defaults on the PCFL put and on the Parmalat guarantee, not to mention a blizzard of lawsuits of which this is one. This case, however, is particularly interesting because the plaintiffs are the SPEs created by BoA, who claim that they were defrauded and otherwise wronged by the entity that created them and that held a majority of the debt they issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Like any other fraud plaintiffs, the SPEs argue that they would not have bought the overvalued Parmalat Brazil stock in the first place if they had known the truth regarding Parmalat Brazil and BoA\u2019s internal assessments of the deal. One focus of this case therefore must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>on what BoA knew, when it knew it, what if any material information it failed to disclose, and the other facts pertinent to claims of fraud and breach of trust. But the fact that the plaintiffs are the SPEs creates a second focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">SPEs formed to engage in structured finance transactions like this one have no past, no future, and no employees. They are creatures of the financial services companies that cause their creation. They are phantoms, endowed by law with legal personality but having no real existence. The questions whether these SPEs could have been deceived or whether they would have acted differently if only one or another piece of information had been fully and fairly disclosed therefore arise in a context rather different from that of the usual fraud or breach of fiduciary duty case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In the last analysis, I conclude that BoA did not commit fraud because it lacked culpable intent. In the particular circumstances of this case, however, BoA owed the SPEs fiduciary duties and breached them by failing to disclose all material facts. But the SPEs were not injured because they never considered the business merits of this deal in the first place and would have gone forward regardless of any other or additional disclosures by BoA.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">This conclusion would be almost inconceivable if the controversy had arisen between substantial and responsible companies. But it should not be surprising here. The SPE \u201cdirectors\u201d who nominally approved the deal were hired by BoA for a fee. They never met or discussed the transaction. They made no serious business judgment as to the desirability of the deal from the SPEs\u2019 standpoint \u2014 after all, had the deal worked, the SPEs neither would have benefitted nor been harmed. The directors consented to the transaction essentially on the basis that it was sponsored by Parmalat, then thought to be a reputable company, and BoA. In short, they were engaged to vote \u201cyes.\u201d This they did. This they would have done even if the allegedly concealed information had been disclosed to them. Hence, there is no causal relationship between BoA\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty and any injury suffered by the SPEs.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">\n<em>A. Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Plaintiffs Food Holdings Limited (\u201cFHL\u201d) and Dairy Holdings Limited (\u201cDHL\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cCompanies\u201d) are two Cayman Islands SPEs that entered into the matched transactions at issue in this case. Defendants are Bank of America Corp., Bank of America, N.A., and Banc of America Securities, LLC (collectively, \u201cBoA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">BoA created and used the Companies as vehicles for an investment in Parmalat\u2019s Brazilian operations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">\n<em>B. Structured Finance Transactions and Cayman Islands Special Purpose Entities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">\n<em>1. Structured Transactions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">Structured finance transactions typically involve an \u201coriginator\u201d that transfers one or more assets to an SPE for the purpose of raising capital. The SPE is a separate corporate entity that raises funds from investors, uses the money to acquire specific assets from the originator, and later\u2014 if all goes well \u2014 repays the borrowed money with proceeds derived from the acquired assets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The SPE typically is liquidated once the transaction is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">As noted, structured transactions can be attractive means of raising capital because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>perhaps among other things, the SPE\u2019s financial statements are not consolidated with those of the originator. Hence, the debt incurred by the SPE does not appear on the originator\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. In addition, such transactions are \u201cbankruptcy remote\u201d in that the bankruptcy of the sponsor usually would not affect the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\n<em>2. Cayman Islands SPEs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">SPEs usually are located in and formed under the laws of tax neutral jurisdictions. The Caymans are a particularly attractive venue for SPEs because SPEs are not taxed there when they buy or sell assets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, there are no foreign exchange controls or regulatory requirements applicable to Cayman Islands SPEs that lend, borrow, or issue debt securities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\n<em>C. Parmalat</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Parmalat was founded in 1961 as a small, family-run dairy distributor in Par-ma, Italy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It expanded rapidly in the 1990s by acquiring other food and dairy companies, including companies in Brazil.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By 2003, Parmalat had operations in over thirty countries and was the leading milk distributor in Italy, Canada, and Brazil. It had tens of thousands of employees and reported more than $7 billion in revenues worldwide.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\n<em>D. BoA\u2019s Relationship with Parmalat</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Au2\">Financial institutions such as BoA viewed Parmalat as a potentially lucrative client and sought to profit from its growth. BoA began financing Parmalat transactions in 1994.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From 1994 until Parmalat\u2019s collapse in 2003, BoA provided $665 million in loans to Parmalat entities in ten different transactions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">\n<em>E.The BoA Deal Team</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1l\">Luca Sala, an officer at BoA\u2019s Milan branch, was involved in all transactions between Parmalat and BoA during all or most of that period. He served also as BoA\u2019s Parmalat relationship manager from 1997 through June 2003 and was among the BoA officers most knowledgeable about BoA\u2019s relationship with Parmalat.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\">Sala\u2019s assistant, Antonio Luzi, was an officer at BoA\u2019s Milan branch beginning in 2000. He assessed Parmalat\u2019s financial statements and creditworthiness and prepared certain internal credit approval memoranda (\u201cCAMs\u201d) relating to proposed BoA-Parmalat transactions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> CAMs and Standard Credit Memoranda (\u201cSCMs\u201d) outlined proposed transactions and contained BoA\u2019s credit and risk analyses. They were required to contain all material information underlying a proposal to extend credit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-20\">Patrizia Medvedich, a BoA vice president, and Luis Moneada also worked on Parmalat CAMs and SCMs at BoA\u2019s Milan branch.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A senior credit officer at the Milan branch, Moneada was responsible for evaluating the creditworthiness of Parmalat transactions that Sala proposed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The SCMs proposed by the Milan branch were subject to review by a hierarchy of officers within BoA\u2019s Credit Risk Management Group. Omar Bouhadiba, head of BoA\u2019s Europe, Middle East, and Africa Division Credit Administration, reviewed transactions emanating from the Milan branch. After BoA merged with NationsBank in September 1998, Paolo Rizzuti assumed Bouhadiba\u2019s responsibilities and reported his recommendations to his superior, Trevor Kelly.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> David Chalk succeeded Rizzuti as the credit officer responsible for reviewing Parmalat transactions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Chalk, who later became the head of BoA\u2019s Global Financial Institutions Risk Management Group, approved BoA\u2019s investment in the transaction between BoA and the Companies. Paul Dorfman, head of credit for the International Division, was the credit officer senior to Bouhadiba and Chalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\n<em>F. This Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\n<em>1. Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In this instance, Parmalat sought to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for its Brazilian subsidiary, Parmalat Brazil. In 1997, it contacted BoA to work on a deal that would achieve its objective.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> BoA agreed to structure a transaction allowing an SPE to sell debt to investors and then use the proceeds to purchase equity in Parmalat Brazil. The proposed transaction underwent several iterations before BoA ultimately approved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">\n<em>2. Early Iterations of the Deal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">\n<em>a. January 1998 Proposal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">In January 1998, Sala proposed a $800 million \u201cequity placement\u201d to Pier Giorgio Rota Baldihi, BoA\u2019s Italian country manager. He contemplated that an equity investor \u2014 BoA, a \u201cpool of investors\u201d led by BoA, or an SPE \u2014 would purchase a minority of the shares of Parmalat Brazil for $300 million.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The investor was to be repaid with the proceeds of an anticipated initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) of the Parmalat Brazil shares.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Repayment would be assured through a \u201cput option ... in case the agreed price of the stocks to be placed is not consistent with the then prevailing market conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> He urged that BoA \u201cexpress its interest in doing this transaction at the highest management level.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">It is not clear from the record what happened to that proposal in the ensuing months save that the deal was not done in the form proposed. Nevertheless, perhaps with a view toward that proposed transaction, BoA\u2019s Milan branch retained Deloitte &amp; Touche Corporate Finance in Sao Paolo (\u201cDeloitte\u201d) to perform a valuation of Parmalat Brazil.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\n<em>b. July 1998 SCM and the Deloitte Valuation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">At Sala\u2019s request, Moneada on July 14, 1998 submitted an SCM outlining a structured transaction involving the purchase of Parmalat Brazil shares by an SPE for $500 million, which the SPE would borrow from and through BoA.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The SPE later would sell the Parmalat Brazil stock in a public offering to raise the money needed to repay the debt. If the public offering proved not to be feasible, Parmalat would refinance and sell its Brazilian assets to repay the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The SCM described the public offering as the \u201cprimary source of repayment\u201d of the debt and the refinancing and sale of Parmalat\u2019s Brazilian assets as the \u201csecondary source.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> To assure repayment, the SCM provided also that the SPE would have the right to put the Parmalat Brazil stock to Parmalat S.p.A. if the anticipated proceeds of an IPO should prove insufficient to repay the loan.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> BoA sought \u201cto fully underwrite the transaction\u201d and planned to \u201cplace up to $400 million of the debt\u201d among institutional investors \u201cwithin 6 months of disbursement.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The SCM noted, however, that SPE would \u201cnot have the opportunity to perform a detailed due diligence.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">A short time later, Deloitte issued a report that concluded that the equity value of Parmalat Brazil as a whole was between $1.36 billion and $1.57 billion,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> which implied a value of no more than $247 to $285 million for an 18.18 percent interest, the amount ultimately purchased.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The valuation was based upon \u201cbase\u201d and \u201cdownside\u201d forecasts of Parmalat Brazil EBIT<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> of $151 million and $122.8 million, respectively, for 1999.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Despite the rosy Deloitte valuation, Moncada\u2019s superior, Omar Bouhadiba, advised on July 30, 1998, that he would \u201cnot be supporting this deal.\u201d He believed that the proposed public offering of Parmalat Brazil, the primary source of repayment, was predicated on an operation that had \u201cno track record of significant profitability or cash generation\u201d and that Deloitte\u2019s valuation of Parmalat Brazil was \u201cbased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>... on Parmalat\u2019s assumptions [including its EBIT projections] that have not been tested.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In addition, Bouhadiba advised that a sale of Parmalat Brazil\u2019s assets and the right to put the Parmalat Brazil shares to Parmalat S.p.A. were \u201cunreliable and dependent\u201d on the primary source of repayment because \u201cclose to 40% of [Parmalat S.p.A\u2019s] consolidated EBIT is generated in Brazil.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> He concluded that the deal was \u201ca purely Brazilian play\u201d because of Parmalat\u2019s dependence on the earnings of its Brazilian subsidiary.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">c. <em>August 1998 SCM</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Sala and Moneada in August 1998 prepared a revised SCM, which reduced the size of the transaction. It proposed a $300 million \u201cbullet loan\u201d to an SPE, of which $250 million would be underwritten by BoA.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The SPE would use the proceeds to purchase a minority equity interest in Parmalat Brazil for $300 million. The proposal involved also an anticipated public offering of Parmalat Brazil shares to repay the debt at maturity and the right to put the Parmalat Brazil shares to Parmalat S.p.A if a public offering were not feasible.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Moneada stated that the SPE \u201cwill not take any equity market risk nor Brazilian country risk as the Put Option will protect it from such events, making the transaction a pure U.S. dollar [Parmalat S.p.A.] risk.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> BoA planned to \u201csell down\u201d the entirety of its debt \u201cwithin 180 days of disbursement\u201d and claimed to have \u201creceived written sell down commitments\u201d from several institutional investors.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Bouhadiba initially approved this iteration of the proposed transaction on August 3, 1998 at a meeting with Sala.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> He soon thereafter withdrew that approval, however, asserting that the \u201cprimary source\u201d of repayment, the IPO of Parmalat Brazil shares, would be \u201cunreliable\u201d because the Brazilian market was deteriorating.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> He reasoned also that the strength of the put was \u201cmarginal\u201d because Parmalat S.p.A. was dependent on Parmalat Brazil\u2019s cash flow.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">Although Sala and Moneada appealed Bouhadiba\u2019s assessment to Paul Dorfman, the credit officer senior to Bouhadiba, Dorfman also rejected the transaction. On September 8, 1998, he informed Sala that \u201c[t]he deal structure is not as straight forward as loaning the money to the parent or the Brazilian subsidiary with the guarantee of the parent\u201d because the \u201cvarious sources of repayment ... are so closely intertwined as to decrease one\u2019s confidence in repayment.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> He feared that a public offering of Parmalat Brazil shares would not be successful and that \u201cParmalat itself is materially dependent on Brazil.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> He therefore concluded that he did \u201cnot agree with the repeated statement in the [SCM] that this is a transaction with Italian risk rather than Brazilian risk.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Daniel Heitner of the BoA Credit Derivatives Group reiterated Dorfman\u2019s rejection of the transaction on October 19, stating that Dorfman had \u201cmade perfectly clear that he\u2019d had more than one reason to reject the Parmalat deal into Brasil when it first came to him, and that he was not going to approve anything that touched it in any way, shape, form, or degree.... So the instant proposal seems unpromising.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\n<em>d. October 1998 SCM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqV\">To address the credit group\u2019s concerns, Moneada prepared a revised SCM, which reduced BoA\u2019s debt contribution, on October 13, 1998.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Like its predecessor, it provided that BoA would arrange a structured transaction in which an SPE would take on $300 million in debt and use the proceeds to purchase equity in Parmalat Brazil. It too anticipated a public offering of Parmalat Brazil shares to repay the debt and proposed a put guaranteed by Parmalat S.p.A.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> This proposal, however, contemplated that the $300 million would be provided in three \u201ctranches\u201d: (1) $100 million to be underwritten by BoA, (2) $100 million \u201cfrom a U.S. investor,\u201d and (3) $100 million \u201cto be placed in the U.S. Private Placement market.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In addition, BoA would retain the \u201cwhole equity upside ... on the portion to be retained on the bank\u2019s books.\u201d The SCM stated also that, \u201c[a]t our request, a valuation of [Parmalat Brazil] has been completed by Deloitte &amp; Touche,\u201d whose opinion, it said, supported the value BoA had applied to the transaction.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> BoA was to receive a fee of 1.5 percent of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">This proposal too was turned down by BoA. Paolo Rizzuti recommended to his superior, Trevor Kelly, that BoA reject it because he was concerned about the \u201cBrasilian nature of this deal.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> He stated, \u201cAs you are aware the primary source of repayment will be represented by an IPO on the Brasilian market in the next two years. While possible, we have to be skeptical on the probability of this exit strategy, given the current markets [sic ] condition.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> In addition, he cautioned Kelly, \u201cthe alternative repayment source, Parmalat S.pA. (PI) carries a significant amount of risk in that PI derives half of its revenues from South American Operations.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Kelly therefore rejected Moncada\u2019s proposal.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\n<em>e. The NMS Valuation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">On September 30, 1998, NationsBank acquired Bank of America, thus creating a much larger bank.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> One month later, NationsBanc Montgomery Securities (\u201cNMS\u201d), its investment banking subsidiary, valued Parmalat Brazil based on, among other things, discounted cash flow and comparable transaction analyses.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> On November 3, 1998, it issued a report that valued Parmalat Brazil at between $9 million and roughly $2 billion according to various methodologies and assumptions.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The opinion was based in part upon base and downside forecasts of Parmalat Brazil\u2019s 1999 EBIT of $155.9 million and $110.4 million, respectively.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\n<em>f. January 1999 SCM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ANBs\">Undaunted by the rejection of the October 1998 proposal, the Milan branch persisted. Moneada on January 7, 1999 submitted another revised SCM, which yet again proposed the creation of an SPE to take on $300 million in debt and use the debt proceeds to purchase $300 million of Parmalat Brazil equity.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> As before, the debt ultimately was to be repaid with the proceeds of an anticipated public offering of the Parmalat Brazil shares. This time, however, repayment was to be assured by giving the SPE the right to put the Parmalat Brazil shares to a Parmalat Luxembourg subsidiary or to convert the SPE\u2019s investment into shares of Parmalat\u2019s Italian parent company.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The performance by Parmalat Luxembourg under the put was to be fully guaranteed by Parmalat S.p.A. In addition, the proposal tweaked the framework of the debt tranches as follows: (1) $150 million was to be underwritten by BoA and \u201csold down to zero in the U.S. private placement market,\u201d (2) $50 million was to be placed in the U.S. private placement market by NMS on a \u201cbest effort basis,\u201d and (3) $100 million was to come from an American investor.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The SCM described the sale of debt in the U.S. private placement market as the \u201cprimary source of repayment\u201d and the IPO of Parmalat Brazil shares as the \u201csecondary source.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> BoA stood to receive a 1.5 percent fee \u201cas well as most of the expected equity upside\u201d for arranging the transaction.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-16\">Rizzuti and Kelly reiterated their rejection of the deal on January 12, 1999 because of \u201cthe continued problems Brasil is experiencing and ... the possible impact those problems might have on Parmalat\u2019s creditworthiness.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The next day, the Brazilian government devalued its currency because of volatility in the Brazilian market.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-17\">\n<em>S. BoA Prepares to Close the Deal Even Before Approving It</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">Despite the fact that BoA repeatedly had rejected the deal, work went ahead on the transaction, apparently in anticipation that it ultimately would be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>As early as September 1998, BoA\u2019s counsel, Mayer Brown, retained Maples &amp; Calder, a Cayman Islands law firm that had an extensive relationship with BoA and had worked on other BoA transactions, and its related entity, QSPV Limited (\u201cMaples Finance\u201d), to work on the proposed Parmalat Brazil transaction and to incorporate a Cayman Islands SPE for that purpose.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Among the tasks that Maples was to perform was to supply directors for the SPE. A Maples &amp; Calder marketing brochure stated that the SPE directors it supplied typically approved structured transactions upon the receipt of the \u201cfee[s] for undertaking the transaction[s],\u201d the board\u2019s determination of the \u201coverall integrity of the transaction documents,\u201d and a conclusion that \u201cthere is ultimately little risk to the <em>SP[E].\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>67</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APh\">In late 1998, Sala negotiated the fee BoA would receive for arranging the transaction and hatched a scheme to steal a portion of it. Although the previous internal BoA proposals contemplated a fee to the bank of 1.5 percent of the transaction, Sala on December 11, 1998 sent a term sheet \u2014 which he did not share with BoA<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> \u2014to Fausto Tonna, Parmalat\u2019s chief financial officer, stating that the bank\u2019s fee would be 2.75 percent.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Tonna, as revealed by his later conduct, agreed. Six days later, Sala told several BoA officers that BoA\u2019s fee would be 1.5 percent.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> As we shall see, Sala ultimately stole the remaining 1.25 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">On April 22, 1999, still long before BoA had approved any transaction, Bank of America Securities, LLC, and Bank of America, N.A., entered into an indemnification agreement with Parmalat S.p.A. in which they expressly acknowledged BoA\u2019s \u201cengagement ... to advise and assist Food Holdings Limited and Dairy Holdings Limited,\u201d the names chosen for the as-yet unformed SPEs, with respect to an as-yet unapproved $300 million private placement.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Furthermore, in June 1999, BoA prepared and Parmalat chief financial officer Tonna approved a Parmalat private placement memorandum (\u201cPPM\u201d) for use in selling the debt contemplated by the proposed transaction. The PPM included Parmalat\u2019s consolidated financial statements but contained also a disclaimer that stated that BoA \u201cmake[s] no representation or warranty, express or implied, and assume[s] no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information contained herein and furnished herewith regarding Parmalat.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">On October 21, 1999, Maples &amp; Calder sent BoA a letter quoting its fee for the deal. The letter stated that the necessary due diligence regarding investors and sources of funds would be the responsibility of Parmalat or BoA as opposed to the SPEs.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\n<em>U- BoA Finally Approves the Transactions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Toward the end of 1999, Moneada prepared new CAMs in another effort to obtain approval. These incorporated by reference the transaction outlined in Moncada\u2019s January 7, 1999 proposal but added a credit default swap (\u201cCDS\u201d)<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> provision to further protect BoA.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In the meantime, David Chalk had succeeded Rizzuti in reviewing Moncada\u2019s proposals. On November 30 and December 17, 1999, respectively, he approved the revised CAMs concerning the FHL and DHL transactions.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> In doing so, he reasoned that the CDS would \u201ccover[ ]\u201d BoA\u2019s \u201cfull exposure\u201d and allow its loan to the SPEs to \u201cserve as a bridge to an anticipated private placement that was to take place in 2000.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> At trial, he testified that he did not recall having reviewed the rejections of earlier iterations of the transaction.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">\n<em>5. SPE Board Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AxEP\">Maples Finance incorporated FHL and DHL on November 30, 1999 and December 20, 1999, respectively.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Neither Company had any management, staff, offices, or operations.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Each had four directors\u2014 Hugh Thompson, Martin Couch, Phillip Hinds, and Anthony Baker \u2014 all supplied by Maples Finance for a fee.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Each director served simultaneously on the boards of between three hundred and eight hundred other SPEs created and administered by Maples Finance.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">The FHL and DHL boards approved the transactions on December 15 and 21, 1999, respectively.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Although the FHL board \u201cminutes\u201d state that the board\u2019s formal approval came at a \u201cmeeting\u201d at which \u201call the Directors were present in person or by proxy,\u201d no meeting in fact took place. The directors never met to discuss or deliberate and never asked any questions of BoA.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Although Anthony Baker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the Companies\u2019 \u201clead director,\u201d did review the transaction documents, he approved the transaction based primarily on the reputations of Parmalat and BoA.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> He testified that the SPEs were not equipped to perform due diligence, which he understood to be the sole responsibility of BoA.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> In all the circumstances, I find that three of the four directors paid no material attention to the transactions at all and that none of the four evaluated the transactions from a business or economic perspective. They \u2014 actually, Baker alone \u2014 simply read the contracts and other documents. Nor did Maples do anything more in terms of exercising business judgment. It did, however, issue an opinion letter to the FHL board on December 17, 1999 \u2014 two days after the FHL board approved the deal \u2014 recommending its approval of the transaction based on its assessment of the transaction documents.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In addition, the FHL and DHL boards appointed Sala and Medvedich attorneys in fact to \u201capprove, settle, amend, sign or execute\u201d the transaction documents on behalf of the SPEs and to \u201cdo all acts ... as may be necessary or desirable in connection with\u201d those documents.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\n<em>6. Sala\u2019s Diversion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQC\">At just about the same time, Sala took the final steps in furtherance of his scheme to steal a portion of BoA\u2019s arrangement fee. On December 11, 1999, he sent Parmalat a revised term sheet that reduced BoA\u2019s fee from 2.75 to 1.5 percent, the fee that BoA thought all along that it would receive.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> He did not send that revised term sheet to BoA.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">On the following day, PCFL paid $3.75 million, the 1.25 percent difference between the 2.75 percent fee to which Parmalat had agreed and the 1.5 percent that was paid to BoA, as a commission to a Swiss bank, Graubundner Kantonalbank (\u201cGKB\u201d), ostensibly for services provided by GKB in connection with the transaction.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> In fact, however, GKB performed no services and, without BoA\u2019s knowledge, diverted those funds to an entity owned and controlled by Sala.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">\n<em>7. Closings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">The FHL and DHL transactions closed on December 17, 1999 and December 22, 1999, respectively.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Through transaction documents prepared by BoA\u2019s attorneys, Mayer Brown, BoA caused the Companies then to sell notes to BoA and institutional investors it had procured for $300 million and then to use the proceeds to buy $300 million of Parmalat Brazil shares.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Indeed, BoA\u2019s Medvedich signed the subscription agreements on behalf of FHL and DHL as attorney in fact.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> The SPEs pledged the shares thus acquired to Wells Fargo as trustee for the benefit of the noteholders.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> When the notes came due, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>repayment was to come from a public offering of the Parmalat Brazil shares. BoA was to get the upside if a sale of the Parmalat Brazil stock yielded more than was necessary to repay principal and pay the interest on the notes.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">As previously contemplated, the SPEs received from PCFL a \u201cput,\u201d i.e., a right sell the Parmalat Brazil shares to PCFL for $300 million when the notes matured.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Its purpose was to provide an alternative means of turning the Parmalat Brazil shares into cash in the event that an IPO to repay the notes proved not to be feasible. Parmalat S.p.A. guaranteed PCFL\u2019s performance of its obligations under the put. Thus, the anticipated IPO, the put, and the guarantee were the three potential sources of funds to repay the notes.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">From the perspective of the SPEs, these transactions indisputably were a $300 million equity purchase in Parmalat Brazil. Given the overall structure of the deals, however, BoA ultimately had come to view them internally as loans by the noteholders secured by (1) a pledge of Parmalat Brazil stock of uncertain value and liquidity, (2) the PCFL put, and (3) Parmalat\u2019s guarantee.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> In other words, the bank internally thought of these transactions in substance as loans made on the credit of Parmalat.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\n<em>8. Transaction Documents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Although the minutiae of the transaction documents need not detain us, a few details warrant mention in light of the claims asserted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">First, the Companies and Parmalat Brazil entered into subscription agreements pursuant to which the Companies purchased Parmalat Brazil shares. Attached to those agreements was Parmalat Brazil\u2019s business plan, which contained Parmalat Brazil\u2019s 1998 annual financial statements and updated 1999 earnings projections.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> A comparison between the business plan earnings projections, on one hand, and even the downside projections upon which the Deloitte and NMS valuations rested, at least in part, shows that the outlook for Parmalat Brazil at the time of the closings was significantly worse than it had been when Deloitte and NMS had valued the company.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> The updated 1999 earnings projections in the business plan would have made clear to a knowledgeable business person aware of the Deloitte and NMS valuations that the minority interest in Parmalat Brazil the Companies bought probably was worth dramatically less than $300 million at the dates of the closings. BoA, however, never disclosed the Deloitte and NMS valuations to the Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">Second, the Companies entered into support and inducement agreements with Parmalat S.p.A. and PCFL. These represented that the PPM \u201cfairly describes, in all material respects, the general nature of the business and principal properties of Parmalat Italy and its Subsidiaries and does not contain any untrue statement of fact or omit to state any material of fact....\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> The Companies argue that BoA is chargeable with the Parmalat representations and that it thereby defrauded them because BoA knew that Parmalat\u2019s financial statements were materially false.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-17\">Third, BoA entered into management agreements, drafted by Mayer Brown, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>with the Companies. Pursuant to those agreements, each of the Companies appointed BoA \u201cManager,\u201d which \u201cshall be fully invested with and responsible for the general management and conduct of the business of the [SPE] and shall advise the Board on all matters of policy.\u201d <footnotemark>103</footnotemark> The Companies likewise \u201cinvest[ed] the Manager with all rights and powers\u201d necessary to manage the SPEs\u2019 \u201cday to day business affairs.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> In addition, BoA undertook to \u201ckeep the Board fully informed as to the discharge of the Manager\u2019s duties hereunder.\u201d <footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\n<em>G. Parmalat\u2019s Collapse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We now know that Parmalat perpetrated one of the largest financial frauds in history. From 1990 through 2003, it offered and sold more than $1 billion in debt securities in the United States based on fraudulent financial statements that concealed rising debts and shrinking assets and on materially false representations by its senior management. A subsequent investigation revealed that Parmalat in fact had operated at a loss during that period. Its actual debt was 14.5 billion, 8 billion more than it had reported. Although Parmalat announced aggregate net profits from 1990 to 2003 of 1.513 billion, it in fact sustained losses of 3.694 billion. During that time Parmalat\u2019s insiders falsified the company\u2019s financial statements, hiding the company\u2019s true financial condition.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In December 2003, Parmalat entered extraordinary administration in Italy upon the revelation of its fraud.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Parmalat Brazil went into bankruptcy in Brazil, and PCFL was placed into liquidation.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> The Companies\u2019 Parmalat Brazil shares could not be sold. PCFL defaulted on the put, Parmalat S.p.A. defaulted on the guarantee, and the Companies defaulted on the notes. The noteholders filed \u201cwinding up\u201d petitions in a Cayman Islands court, and the Companies too were placed into liquidation.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\n<em>PL. The Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Many actions were brought after Parmalat\u2019s collapse. All federal suits were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in this Court.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The Companies here seek damages from BoA for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. The complaint alleges that the transactions orchestrated by BoA \u201cserved primarily, if not exclusively, to enrich various Bank of America entities (and certain Bank of America personnel and Parmalat insiders) while creating the illusion that Parmalat was a profitable company and an attractive credit risk.\u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> It further asserts that BoA\u2019s plan was a sham from the beginning and that its formation of the Companies was part of a scheme to hide Parmalat\u2019s fraud.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> In particular, the Companies argue that BoA defrauded them by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>disclose Sala\u2019s diversion, Parmalat\u2019s true financial condition, and BoA\u2019s internal credit documentation and valuations, which allegedly would have revealed that the Companies\u2019 minority interest in Parmalat Brazil was worth far less than $300 million. Those allegedly material omissions are the basis also for the Companies\u2019 negligent misrepresentation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The Companies\u2019 fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims share a common factual basis. They assert that BoA misstated or failed to disclose facts material to the SPEs\u2019 decisions to approve the transaction. Those fall into three categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">First, as we have seen, Sala diverted \u201cfor his personal use\u201d<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> $3.75 million of the arrangement fee Parmalat agreed to pay BoA. The Companies contend that Sala\u2019s personal stake in the deal gave him a conflict of interest and improper incentive to obtain approval of the transaction. They assert that knowledge of Sala\u2019s scheme is chargeable to BoA and that BoA\u2019s failure to disclose it to the Companies was wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Second, the Companies claim that BoA adopted and is responsible for Parmalat\u2019s concededly fraudulent financial statements. They assert that Parmalat\u2019s financial condition was material to their decision to approve the transaction because it reflected on the value of the put and guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Third, the Companies argue that BoA failed to disclose facts material to their assessment of the value of the Parmalat Brazil shares. Specifically, BoA did not disclose the Deloitte and NMS valuations or the projections that underlay them. A comparison between those projections and the updated figures in the 1999 business plan that was attached to the subscription agreements strongly would have suggested that the value of the minority interest in Parmalat Brazil that the Companies bought was far below what it had been when Parmalat and/or BoA attributed the $300 million value to it. The Companies contend that they would have rejected the deal if BoA had disclosed those valuations and the projections that were at least part of the basis upon which they rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">\n<em>A. The Fraud Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AmQ\">To succeed on a fraud claim under New York law, a plaintiff must establish (1) a material misrepresentation or omission (2) made with knowledge of its falsity, (3) intent to defraud, (4) reliance, and (5) damage caused by the misrepresentation or omission.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> Fraud must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">\n<em>1. Sala\u2019s Diversion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">The Companies assert that Sala\u2019s scheme to steal $3.75 million from these transactions gave him an improper incentive to obtain approval for them. They seek to impute knowledge of that scheme to BoA and maintain that BoA\u2019s failure to disclose the scheme and the fact that Sala had a conflict of interest in pushing the deal was fraudulent. There is not the slightest merit in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">Corporations act only through their agents. Acts performed and knowledge acquired by a corporate agent within the scope of his or her employment are imputed to the corporation.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> The misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>of an agent therefore is imputed to the corporation if committed within the scope of the agent\u2019s employment. This principle, however, is not without limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">A principal is not charged with the acts or knowledge of an agent when the agent acts outside the scope of the agent\u2019s employment. As our Circuit has stated, \u201c[Wjhere an agent, though ostensibly acting in the business of the principal, is really committing a fraud for his own benefit, he is acting outside the scope of his agency, and it would therefore be unjust to charge the principal with knowledge of it.\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> But what about the middle ground where an agent might be said to have been committing a fraud for his own benefit while serving also the interests of the principal?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Under New York law, a principal is chargeable with the acts and knowledge of an agent as long as the agent in some respect served the principal or, stated differently, unless the agent \u201ctotally abandoned\u201d the principal\u2019s interests and \u201cacted entirely for his own or another\u2019s purpose.\u201d <footnotemark>118</footnotemark> But \u201c[wjhen an agent is engaged in a scheme to defraud his principal, either for his own benefit or that of a third person, he cannot be presumed to have disclosed that which would expose and defeat his fraudulent purpose.\u201d <footnotemark>119</footnotemark> \u201cAccordingly, whatever an agent does or knows purely in the course of defrauding the principal, such as stealing from it, is not chargeable to the principal.\u201d <footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Indeed, I have applied that precept in ruling that theft by Parmalat and PCFL officers from their respective companies was outside the scope of their employment and not chargeable to their employers.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Contrary to the Companies\u2019 assertions, Sala did not divert funds in the course of \u201cperforming his normal job responsibilities\u201d <footnotemark>122</footnotemark> except in the somewhat indirect and immaterial sense that he was employed by BoA when he did it. Rather, he stole \u201cfor his personal use\u201d $3.75 million that Parmalat had agreed to pay BoA.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> He did it by falsely telling BoA that Parmalat had agreed to pay a 1.5 percent fee when in fact it had agreed to pay 2.75 percent and then taking the $3.75 million difference for his own benefit through the Swiss bank, GKB.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Although Sala did this during his term of employment by BoA, he did it solely to benefit himself at BoA\u2019s expense. In this respect, he totally abandoned his role as BoA\u2019s agent.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> That BoA may have benefitted from its role as arranger of the larger transactions is immaterial because BoA was the victim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Sala\u2019s fraud. In consequence, knowledge of Sala\u2019s' diversion of $3.75 million from BoA cannot be imputed to BoA. That branch of the fraud claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">A <em>Parmalat\u2019s Financial Condition</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">The Companies allege that BoA misrepresented and omitted material facts concerning Parmalat\u2019s financial condition in the PPM and other pertinent documents, including the support and inducement agreements and note purchase agreements,<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> which attached Parmalat\u2019s materially false consolidated financial statements. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the misrepresentations and omissions concerning Parmalat\u2019s financial condition that appeared in the PPM and the other documents relied upon are attributable to BoA, however, the Companies nevertheless have not established, even by a preponderance let alone the requisite clear and convincing evidence, that BoA acted with the requisite <em>scienter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The Companies assert that Sala and Moneada were aware of or recklessly indifferent to Parmalat\u2019s true financial condition. They rely heavily on a purported expert witness, who pointed to their failure to respond to what the witness called \u201cred flags.\u201d They point also to Sala\u2019s and Moncada\u2019s awareness that BoA on various occasions failed to verify Parmalat\u2019s cash and debt balances, to require Parmalat to provide consolidated financial statements, and to apply \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d to Parmalat\u2019s high cash balances.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">All that may be. And certainly Sala was a crook to the extent that he stole the $3.75 million from BoA. But the fact remains that none of the evidence plaintiffs rely upon convinces me that Sala or Moneada knew that the Parmalat financial statements were materially misleading or was reckless in any respect material to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">The Companies assert also that others at BoA, particularly those in the hierarchy that passed on the various deal proposals, knew or were recklessly indifferent to the fraudulent nature of Parmalat\u2019s financial statements and the vastly overstated picture of its financial soundness that Parmalat portrayed. The testimony of BoA\u2019s credit officers, including those who approved and promoted the transactions, however, reveals that BoA was unaware of Parmalat\u2019s fraud and that the Parmalat financial information contained in the PPM was inaccurate.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> In fact, BoA bought $165 million of the Companies\u2019 debt based on its faith in Parmalat\u2019s guarantee, whereas its fee for the deal was only $4.5 million.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> It would not have done so, even in the extraordinary atmosphere that brought about the financial crisis that befell the world in the fall of 2008, if it had had any real inkling that Parmalat was a financial house of cards. In short, there is no persuasive evidence that BoA knew of or recMessly disregarded Parmalat\u2019s disastrous financial situation. This aspect of the fraud claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\n<em>3. Parmalat Brazil</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The Companies claim also that BoA fraudulently failed to disclose the Deloitte and NMS valuations and the earnings projections they contained which, they assert, were material to their decision to approve the transaction.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">As previously noted, Deloitte in July 1998 valued the equity of Parmalat Brazil at between $1.86 billion and $1.57 billion<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> based, at least in part, on base and downside forecasts of that company\u2019s 1999 EBIT of $122.8 to $151 million.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> Similarly, NMS on November 3, 1998, valued Parmalat Brazil at $9 million and roughly $2 billion<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> based, in part, upon base and downside Parmalat Brazil 1999 EBIT forecasts of $110.4 to $155.9 million.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The Parmalat Brazil business plan attached to the December 1999 subscription agreements contained a revised EBIT projection for 1999 of 106.1 million reals ($58.6 million), or slightly more than half of the lowest downside figure used by either Deloitte or NMS. Thus, disclosure of the Deloitte and NMS valuations, to one who considered the matter with any care, would have revealed that Parmalat Brazil was underperforming significantly even the downside earnings projections on which the valuations upon which the $300 million purchase price had been based or, at least, justified internally at BoA. The Companies therefore contend that BoA knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that stock being sold <em>to </em>the Companies was worth substantially less than they were paying and, in any case, fraudulently withheld the Deloitte and NMS valuations.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">I assume that the Deloitte and NMS valuations, including but not limited to the 1999 EBIT projections upon which they at least party rested, were material and that the failure to disclose them was a material omission. That said, the question remains whether the charge of fraud has been proved, which requires among other things clear and convincing proof that BoA acted with <em>scienter </em>in failing to make this disclosure. The Court concludes that plaintiffs have not met their burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">There is no persuasive evidence that BoA ever made the analysis that underlies this claim, i.e., a comparison of the projections disclosed in the business plan with those contained in the earlier Deloitte and NMS work coupled with an evaluation of the effect that the much poorer December 1999 EBIT figures would have had on the earlier valuations had those figures been known to Deloitte and NMS. The fact is that BoA ultimately viewed these transactions internally as loans on the strength of a pledge of Parmalat Brazil stock of uncertain value,<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> the PCFL put, and Parmalat\u2019s guarantee. At the time it approved the transaction, BoA\u2019s credit group believed that the put and guarantee were reliable and compensated for the potential uncertainty of an IPO of Parmalat Brazil shares.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> David Chalk, the BoA credit officer, who approved the transaction notwithstanding his knowledge of the valuations, credibly testified that his credit assessment focused on only Parmalat S.p.A. because the guarantee \u201cprovided assurance that the principal and interest would be repaid regardless of the performance (or value) of the Parmalat Administracao <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>shares.\u201d<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> BoA in fact bought $165 million of the debt on its faith in Parmalat\u2019s credit and belief that the deal would be profitable.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> In the absence any reason to believe that BoA connected the dots that plaintiffs now connect, I am not persuaded that BoA knew that the failure to disclose the Deloitte and NMS opinions and the projections they contained was misleading. Nor am I convinced that it recklessly disregarded any likelihood that the omission rendered what was disclosed misleading. The Companies therefore have failed to prove <em>scienter </em>because they have not shown by clear and convincing evidence that BoA acted with the requisite culpable knowledge and intent. Their fraud claim fails entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\n<em>B. The Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The alleged misstatements and omissions that ground plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim are the basis of its claim of breach of fiduciary duty. Under New York law, a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty requires a showing of (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2) the intentional or negligent breach of that duty, and (3) damages suffered because of that breach.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> The Companies therefore need not prove <em>scienter </em>to recover on this theory, and the claim must be proven only by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">\n<em>1. Fiduciary Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">The parties first lock horns on the question whether BoA owed the Companies a fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">BoA correctly asserts that a fiduciary duty typically does not arise from an arm\u2019s-length business transaction.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the existence of a fiduciary duty \u201ccannot be determined by recourse to rigid formulas\u201d<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> and often is a factual question.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> It arises, for example, when a party \u201crepose[s] trust or confidence in another who thereby gains a resulting superiority or influence over the first.\u201d<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> It exists also when a party exercises <em>\u201cdefacto </em>control\u201d over or assumes responsibility for the affairs of another. This is exemplified by the \u201clong ... settled law that the promoter of a corporation owes that corporation a fiduciary duty\u201d and that the promoter\u2019s fiduciary duty ends only \u201cwhen the corporation has been established and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>independent board of directors takes charge.\u201d<footnotemark>145</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In this case, BoA exercised absolute or virtually absolute control over the Companies even after their boards were appointed. In 1998, it retained Maples &amp; Calder and its affiliate, Maples Finance\u2014firms with which both BoA and Parmalat had established relationships\u2014to work on the proposed Parmalat Brazil transaction <footnotemark>146</footnotemark> and to supply the Companies\u2019 directors.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> BoA expressly recognized that the directors would rely upon BoA to perform the necessary due diligence, not only because that was the custom in such transactions involving Caymans SPEs,<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> but because of the \u201ctime constraints\u201d that BoA imposed.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> Indeed, through BoA\u2019s attorneys, Mayer Brown, it arranged for Maples to incorporate FHL and DHL only seventeen and two days, respectively, before the transactions closed.<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> The directors, consistent with their usual practice and constrained also by the force of circumstances created by BoA, relied on BoA and Mayer Brown to structure the deal, to make sure that it was sound, to draft the papers, to supply the Companies\u2019 lawyers and themselves as directors, and \u2014 in a phrase \u2014 to put the whole package together.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> The only function of the directors was to say \u201cyes\u201d and thereby enable Maples &amp; Calder and Maples Finance to collect their fees. And although Maples <em>&amp; </em>Calder suggested changes in some of the legal documents, neither it nor its affiliate ever purported to give any business advice.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> In short, BoA well knew that the directors\u2019 approval was a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d <footnotemark>153</footnotemark> Moreover, the subscription agreements by which the Companies committed to buy the Parmalat Brazil stock were signed on their behalf by a BoA officer who had their powers of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Despite all of this, BoA persists in contending that the Companies were independent entities that made their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>judgments with the benefit of independent advice. They argue, among other things, that the Companies had directors and were represented independently by \u201ccounsel negotiating on [their] behalf ... at arm\u2019s length.\u201d<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The fact that the Companies ultimately came to have directors does not preclude a finding that BoA\u2019s fiduciary duty continued. \u201c[Establishment of a board of directors which is not truly independent will not suffice to terminate the promoter\u2019s fiduciary duty.\u201d<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> The directors were not independent and certainly were not expected to perform any substantial function.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> In light of the relationships between Maples <em>&amp; </em>Calder and Maples Finance, on the one hand, and BoA and its counsel, on the other, BoA\u2019s assertion with respect to those firms is entitled to no credence, either. Maples and its affiliate were beholden to BoA and Mayer Brown, not in any meaningful degree to their nominal clients. In these circumstances, BoA quite plainly owed the Companies a fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">BoA further argues that the \u201cassumption\u201d is that a fiduciary duty does not arise between two commercial parties when a contract governs their relationship \u201cunless the contract provides otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> It then contends, on the one hand, that the indemnification agreement, the management agreements, the fee letter, and the powers of attorney are, at most, ordinary contracts that do not give rise to fiduciary duties and, on the other, that they do not reflect any acceptance by BoA of any position of special trust or confidence. The argument, whichever way BoA wants to have it, is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">A party may maintain a claim for breach of fiduciary duty so long as it is not \u201cmerely duplicative\u201d of a claim for breach of contract.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> Here, however, the Companies allege that BoA\u2019s fiduciary duty is a product of its superior knowledge and position of trust as arranger and promoter the transaction, not merely of contractual obligations. These Companies were entirely dependent on BoA for all of the reasons previously stated. The existence of these agreements is not inconsistent with the existence of a fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">BoA next seeks to deny the existence of a fiduciary duty by arguing that such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>duty would have conflicted with the duties it owed its client, Parmalat. That rather nervy assertion, however, is singularly unconvincing. It is no different in principle from an argument by a lawyer who represents both sides in a transaction that he or she could not owe a fiduciary duty to Client A because that would conflict with the duty owed to Client B. If, as occurred here, a bank or other entity conducts itself with respect to one party to a transaction in a manner that gives rise to a fiduciary duty, it is no answer to say that the bank owed a conflicting duty to another. That makes matters worse, not better.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Nor is it any answer to say that this is the way things are done in structured finance transactions generally or in the Cayman Islands in particular.<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Perhaps it is. But that is beside the point. In the overwhelming majority of these deals, the question whether the arranger owes a fiduciary duty to the SPE never arises because the cash flow proves sufficient to service the debt or the deal, .however precisely it is structured, works out without controversy. This one did not. It therefore falls to the Court to determine, on the particular facts of this case, whether BoA, the arranger, owed a fiduciary duty to the SPEs. I hold that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\n<em>2. Breach</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The duties owed by a fiduciary are plain. \u201cPerfect candor, full disclosure, good faith, in fact, the utmost good faith, and the strictest honesty are required of promoters [and other fiduciaries], and then- dealings must be open and fair, or without undue advantage taken.\u201d<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> As Chief Judge, later Justice, Cardozo famously put it years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-12\">\u201cA trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior. As to this there has developed a tradition that is unbending and inveterate. Uncompromising rigidity has been the attitude of courts of equity when petitioned to undermine the rule of undivided loyalty by the \u2018disintegrating erosion\u2019 of particular exceptions, [citation omitted] Only thus has the level of conduct for fiduciaries been kept at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd.\u201d<footnotemark>161</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">Hence, \u201cit is well established that, when a fiduciary, in furtherance of its individual interests, deals with the beneficiary of the duty in a matter relating to the fiduciary relationship, the fiduciary is strictly obligated to make full disclosure of all material facts.\u201d<footnotemark>162</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">BoA concededly failed to disclose (1) BoA\u2019s rejections of prior iterations of the transaction, and (2) the Deloitte and NMS valuation opinions and the Parmalat Brazil 1999 EBIT projections that were among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>their bases. It maintains that these were immaterial to the transaction.<footnotemark>163</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\n<em>a. The Bank\u2019s Rejections of the Deal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">I begin with BoA\u2019s several rejections of early iterations of the transaction before its ultimate approval in November 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Like the approved transaction, each of those iterations involved (1) the creation of an SPE to take on debt, (2) the SPE\u2019s use of the debt proceeds to buy equity in Parmalat Brazil, (3) an anticipated IPO of Parmalat Brazil stock at a price sufficient to repay the debt, and (4) the right of the SPEs to put the Parmalat Brazil stock to Parmalat or an affiliate if the IPO proved infeasible. Until the very last moment, each of these proposals was rejected by BoA, essentially because a successful Parmalat Brazil IPO was too uncertain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u2022 In July 1998, Omar Bouhadiba rejected the deal because, among other things, he believed that the proposed public offering of Parmalat Brazil was predicated on an operation that had \u201cno track record of significant profitability or cash generation\u201d and that Deloitte\u2019s valuation of Parmalat Brazil was \u201cbased ... on Parmalat\u2019s assumptions that have not been tested.\u201d<footnotemark>164</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u2022 Later that summer, Bouhadiba and Dorfman turned down a somewhat revised proposal for much the same reasons.<footnotemark>165</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u2022 In October 1998, Rizzuti and Kelly declined to approve yet another iteration of the deal because, as Rizzuti put it, \u201cthe primary source of repayment [would] be represented by an IPO on the Brasilian market in the next two years. While possible, we have to be skeptical on the probability of this exit strategy, given the current markets [sic ] condition.\u201d <footnotemark>166</footnotemark> In addition, \u201cthe alternative repayment source, Parmalat S.pA. (PI) carrie[d] a significant amount of risk in that PI derives half of its revenues from South American Operations.\u201d <footnotemark>167</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-19\">\u2022 Rizzuti and Kelly turned down another version of the deal in January 1999 because uncertainty in the Brazilian market made a Parmalat Brazil IPO an uncertain proposition and threatened Parmalat\u2019s credit worthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-20\">BoA insists that these rejected proposals and internal credit assessments were immaterial and therefore did not have to be disclosed because the approved transaction was entirely different from the earlier proposals. BoA underscores changes in the size of the deal and the fact that BoA\u2019s merger with NationsBank increased BoA\u2019s lending capacity and ability to absorb risk.<footnotemark>168</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-21\">BoA misses the point. Although the modifications to the proposed transaction help explain why BoA ultimately approved it, they do not go to the question of whether BoA\u2019s internal reservations about Parmalat Brazil would have been material to the Companies, the beneficiary of its fiduciary duty. The standard for materiality is whether a reasonable person \u201cwould attach importance [to the omission] in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question.\u201d<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> Materiality there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>fore is assessed objectively from the standpoint of the Companies\u2019 decision to approve the transaction, not BoA\u2019s assessment of its own exposure as a lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">From the point of view of a reasonable purchaser of the Parmalat Brazil shares in the Companies\u2019 position, what mattered was whether the purchaser ultimately would be in a position to pay off the notes. The IPO was one of only three possible sources of funds for that purpose, the others being the option to put the shares to PCFL and Parmalat\u2019s guarantee of performance of that option. While the issue is not entirely free of doubt, I find that an objective purchaser in the Companies\u2019 position would have considered important that BoA repeatedly had rejected earlier iterations of the transactions on the grounds that (1) the likelihood of a successful IPO was speculative and (2) Parmalat itself was sufficiently dependent upon the uncertain Brazilian situation. That information would have cast doubt on the values of the shares as well as the value of the PCFL put and the Parmalat guarantee. The Court therefore concludes that the failure to disclose this information was material and that it breached BoA\u2019s duty of candor to the Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\n<em>b. The Deloitte and NMS Valuation Opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The Companies claim also that BoA breached its fiduciary duty by failing to disclose the 1998 Deloitte and NMS opinions and the 1999 Parmalat Brazil EBIT projections upon which they rested, at least to some extent. Their point is that a comparison between the updated EBIT projection attached to the Companies\u2019 subscription agreements and those in the Deloitte and NMS valuations would have revealed that Parmalat Brazil had significantly underperformed the projections on which the price of the Parmalat Brazil shares had been based. BoA, however, contends that the valuation opinions were not subject to disclosure for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">First, BoA argues that disclosure would have been contrary to BoA policy, which precludes disclosure of internal credit analyses. But that contention is preposterous. It amounts to an assertion that BoA may avoid duties imposed upon it by law by adopting internal policies inconsistent with its legal obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">BoA next contends that the Deloitte and NMS valuations and the underlying projections were not material to BoA\u2019s consideration of the transaction.<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> But even BoA\u2019s internal credit memoranda belie that assertion. In fact, three different BoA SCMs touted the Deloitte opinion as supporting the Bank\u2019s valuation of Parmalat Brazil.<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> Although BoA asserts that the conditions in the market at the time it approved the transaction in 1999 were \u201cmaterially different from the scenario in 1998,\u201d a comparison between the projections used by Deloitte and NMS and those in the business plan showed clearly that Parmalat Brazil had underperformed since 1998 and had not recovered from the Brazil currency crisis. In any case, this information would have been important to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>reasonable business person in the position of the Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Finally, in a variation on the preceding argument, BoA contends that the Deloitte and NMS valuations were too \u201cold\u201d and therefore \u201cirrelevant\u201d to a transaction that was \u201cmaterially different\u201d by the time it closed in 1999.<footnotemark>172</footnotemark> In fact, however, the EBIT projections in the Deloitte and NMS valuations were for the same 1999 time period as that in the later business plan. They key point was that the considerably poorer figures in the business plan demonstrated that Parmalat Brazil had underperformed expectations. That would have raised substantial questions as to whether the Parmalat Brazil shares that the Companies were buying had been priced appropriately in light of that deterioration. And the changes in the deal were not relevant to this point. The backstop for the anticipated IPO ultimately remained the Parmalat guarantee, and Parmalat remained materially dependent on Brazil.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Accordingly, the Court finds that the 1998 Deloitte and NMS opinions and the Parmalat Brazil EBIT projections for 1999 upon which they rested were material to the Companies and holds that BoA\u2019s failure to disclose them breached its duty of candor.<footnotemark>173</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">\n<em>S. Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">A plaintiff seeking damages for breach of fiduciary duty must demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s conduct proximately caused its injury.<footnotemark>174</footnotemark> Where, as here, a plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for injuries allegedly sustained as a result a defendant\u2019s misstatements or omissions, it therefore must establish a causal link between the wrongful conduct and any damages sustained.<footnotemark>175</footnotemark> The Court therefore passes to the question whether BoA\u2019s breach of its fiduciary duty proximately caused any loss to the Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">To be sure, disclosure to the directors of BoA\u2019s internal credit memoranda and the Deloitte and NMS materials would have been unusual for transactions like these. The Companies, moreover, emphasize Baker\u2019s testimony that the value of the Parmalat Brazil stock was material to the directors and that they would not have approved the transaction if they had known the stock was not worth $300 million.<footnotemark>176</footnotemark> They likewise assert that it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>been illogical for the directors to have approved the purchase of stock worth a fraction of the purchase price.<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> But Baker\u2019s claim is subject to substantial doubt in and of itself, and other evidence points in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">As an initial matter, Baker testified also that he believed the potential uncertainty of a public offering of Parmalat Brazil shares posed no risk to the Companies. He said that he had \u201c[n]o concern\u201d about Parmalat Brazil because \u201c[w]e felt good about the guarantee being in place as a protection for the financial interests of the company. And also we felt that if these companies were being put forward by Banc of America Securities and Parmalat as arranger and principal they were fit for purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>178</footnotemark> He said that he therefore \u201cdid not think it would have been necessary\u201d to review a valuation of Parmalat Brazil<footnotemark>179</footnotemark> because \u201cthere was no risk to [the Companies], there was no reason to carry out detailed business analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>180</footnotemark> To Baker, it was sufficient that \u201c[w]e had limited recourse, we had a put, we had a guarantee.\u201d<footnotemark>181</footnotemark> In consequence, there is reason to doubt his claim that the Deloitte and NMS valuations and the Parmalat Brazil projections would have made a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">There is, moreover, ample evidence that the Companies\u2019 directors would have approved the transaction notwithstanding any disclosure of the internal credit memoranda and the Deloitte and NMS materials. Three of the four SPE directors testified that they did not engage in any substantive analysis of the transaction, read the transaction documents, or ask any questions of BoA.<footnotemark>182</footnotemark> The board conducted no due diligence, and Baker, the only SPE director who reviewed even the transaction documents, testified that he approved the transaction based primarily on the reputation of the parties involved and saw \u201cno reason\u201d to carry out a detailed business analysis.<footnotemark>183</footnotemark> He did not even review the financial statements or the PPM.<footnotemark>184</footnotemark> As the Court has found, none of the directors of either company made any business judgment about the wisdom or attractiveness of the transactions.<footnotemark>185</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>was, quite simply, not the job they were hired to do. Nor is this surprising. As an expert on Caymans practice in these situations, Andrew Galloway, testified, it was the custom and practice of Caymans directors to assume the trustworthiness of the promoter and approve such transactions on the basis of its reputation.<footnotemark>186</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In addition, the Companies\u2019 directors had a strong financial incentive not to disrupt or refuse approval for the transactions that BoA had assembled. The directors were employees of Maples Finance, a company controlled by Maples <em>&amp; </em>Calder, which had a \u201cpreexisting\u201d and \u201cextensive relationship with BoA.\u201d<footnotemark>187</footnotemark> As would have been expected of individuals who, as a result of their relationships with Maples Finance, served simultaneously as directors of several hundred companies, their common interest was to generate additional business for Maples and appointments as directors of SPEs for themselves in exchange for fees paid to Maples Finance, their employer. They therefore had a powerful motive to further Maples Finance\u2019s business relationship with BoA, of which the Food and Dairy Holdings transactions were only a small part.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In all of the circumstances, disclosure of the materials BoA withheld would not likely have altered the directors\u2019 decision to approve the deal. I therefore am not convinced that BoA\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty was a proximate cause of the Companies\u2019 alleged injury.<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> While BoA most assuredly did not conduct itself in an appropriate manner, it is not liable for damages for its breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">\n<em>C. The Breach of Contract Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">The Companies assert that BoA breached the management agreements whereby BoA agreed to \u201cbe fully invested with and responsible for the general management and conduct of the business of the [SPE] and [ ] advise the Board on all matters of policy.\u201d <footnotemark>189</footnotemark> They reason that BoA abandoned its due diligence obligations and failed adequately to advise the SPE boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">The management agreements expressly limited BoA\u2019s liability to \u201cgross negligence or wilful breach of duty.\u201d <footnotemark>190</footnotemark> As the New York Court of Appeals has stated, \u201cgross negligence, when invoked to pierce an agreed-upon limitation of liability in a commercial contract, must \u2018smaek[] of intentional wrongdoing\u2019 [and] evince[ ] a reckless indifference to the rights of others.\u201d<footnotemark>191</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">Although BoA\u2019s failure to disclose material information to the Companies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>constituted a breach of fiduciary duty, it cannot be said that its failure \u201csmack[ed] of intentional wrongdoing.\u201d BoA viewed the transaction as a loan made on the strength of Parmalat\u2019s credit, not as an equity purchase in Parmalat Brazil by the noteholders. It believed that the put and guarantee ensured repayment of the notes. While BoA acted poorly, its breaches of duty were not wilful and did not rise to the level of gross negligence. In any case, the management agreements were signed at the same time as the deals closed. BoA\u2019s wrongful failure to disclose the pertinent facts preceded the closings. BoA\u2019s actions breached no contractual duty that existed at the time its missteps occurred. Nor may liability be premised on actions following the closing, as the Companies have offered no evidence of any breach of duty thereafter. The contract claim therefore is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\n<em>D. The Unjust Enrichment Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-Nn\">To prevail on a claim of unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant was enriched (2) at the plaintiffs expense and (3) that it would be against equity and good conscience to permit the defendant to retain what is sought to be recovered.<footnotemark>192</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Although the complaint alleges that BoA \u201cobtain[ed] some of the funds FHL and DHL were wrongfully induced to provide to [Parmalat Brazil],\u201d <footnotemark>193</footnotemark> there was no such evidence. After Parmalat Brazil received $300 million from the SPEs in exchange for its shares, it transferred approximately $288 million to Wishaw Trading, a Parmalat subsidiary. Wishaw used approximately $280 million from the transaction to purchase bonds issued by another Parmalat subsidiary and held by Bank of Boston and ING Capital.<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> The Companies have not adduced any evidence that BoA received any of the remaining funds from Parmalat Brazil. And while BoA received an arrangement fee, there is no evidence that the fee was paid from the funds Parmalat Brazil received from the Companies. BoA therefore did not receive its fee at the Companies\u2019 expense.<footnotemark>195</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">The Companies\u2019 unjust enrichment claim fails for the independent reason that valid agreements cover the subject matter that gives rise to the alleged enrichment. \u201cThe existence of a valid and enforceable written contract governing a particular subject matter ordinarily precludes recovery in quasi contract for events arising out of the same subject matter.\u201d<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> Here BoA\u2019s relationship with the Companies and its obligations as arranger are governed by the transaction agreements, including the management and note purchase agreements. The Companies\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment therefore must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\n<em>III.

It is more likely that the testimony reflects Mr. Baker\u2019s current view of the matter, formed with the benefit of hindsight, and that he did not consider the transactions from that point of view at the time.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"182\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Couch Dep. 21:18-24:23, 39:23-42:16, 124:4-126:3; Hinds Dep. 28:24-29:11, 32:24-33:20; Thompson Dep. 46:14-25, 74:9-25, 91:9-92:5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"183\">\n<p id=\"b522-14\">. <em>See </em>Baker Dep. 37:7-21, 55:15-56:20, 57:14-20, 157:20-158:8, 165:10-25, 178:1-8.

The foregoing analysis is fatal also to the Companies' negligent misrepresentation claim, as injury proximately caused by the breach of duty is an essential element of the cause of action. <em>See, e.g., Friedman v.

Had it done so, the disclosure might have brought down the house of cards and affected the Companies\u2019 directors. But I am not persuaded that BoA was negligent in this respect. After all, Parmalat fooled the entire world for more than a decade.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"189\">\n<p id=\"b523-19\">.
