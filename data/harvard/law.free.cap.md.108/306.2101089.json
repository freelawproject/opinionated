The evidence on the part of the defendant was that the plaintiff was not a passenger, that the conductor did not touch him, but told him to get off as the car stopped; that plaintiff did not then get off but afterwards when he saw the conductor returning to the platform, jumped off and fell down in so doing. <em>Held, </em>that there was no error in rejecting the prayers offered by the plaintiff, and in lieu thereof instructing the j ury that if they believe that the plaintiff got upon the defendant\u2019s car for the purpose of riding as a passenger and duly tendered or was about to tender his fare to the conductor, but that the conductor without reason refused to receive the same, and wantonly ejected him from said car, with a kick, then the verdict should be for the plaintiff.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-5\"><em>Held, </em>further, that it was also correct to grant, in connection with that instruction, a prayer offered by the defendant to the effect that if the jury believe that the plaintiff was upon the car for the purpose of selling newspapers, then the verdict must be for the defendant, unless the jury also find that the injury to the plaintiff was caused by the conductor\u2019s either wantonly or with reckless carelessness pushing and kicking the plaintiff off the car while it was in motion.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-6\"><em>Held, </em>further, that in regard to damages, the jury were properly instructed that if they believe the conductor refused to accept the plaintiff\u2019s fare and kicked him off the car, that being a wanton and wilful act,, they may allow the plaintiff punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages, and that in making their computation as to the latter, they are to allow the plaintiff only such damages as are shown with reasonable certainty to have resulted as the direct effect of the injury received by him, and that the defendant is not responsible as a part of the compensatory damages for any ailments from which the plaintiff may suffer but which resulted from any other cause than the injury received in the manner mentioned.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-7\">A newsboy who boards a car for the purpose of selling papers, without paying a fare, is not a passenger but a mere licensee, and the railway company owes him no duty except to observe ordinary care for his protection after discovering that he is in a perilous position and to refrain from inflicting upon him a wilful and wanton injury.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-8\">The trial Court may give to the jury an oral instruction of its own, or may explain orally the effect of instructions granted at the instance of the parties.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-9\">But when an oral instruction given by the Court is somewhat inconsistent with the written instructions granted by it, and is in part a duplication of the latter, it is calculated to mislead and confuse the jury and constitutes revers\u2019ble error.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b334-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\n<em>Decided June 24th, 1908.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Baltimore City (Niles, J.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\"><em>Defendant\u2019s 3rd Prayer. </em>\u2014 If the jury believe from the evidence that at the time he received the injuries for which this suit is brought, the plaintiff was upon the car of the defendant for the purpose of selling newspapers to the passengers, then the verdict must be for the defendant, unless the jury further find that the injury to the plaintiff was caused by the conductor of the car either wantonly or with reckless carelessness, pushing and kicking the plaintiff off the car while it was in-motion. <em>(Granted in connection with the Court's instruction.')</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-7\"><em>Defendant's 6th Prayer. </em>\u2014 The Court instructs the jury that even if they find for the plaintiff, the jury, in making their computation as to compensatory damages, are to allow him only such damages as in their opinion it has been affirmatively-proven with reasonable certainty to have resulted as the natural, approximate and direct effects of the injury received by him and mentioned in the evidence.

Three relate to the rulings of the Court upon the admissibility of testimony, and the fourth presents the action of the Court in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s prayers, in granting the defendant\u2019s third, fourth, and sixth prayers, and further in granting a writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ten instruction designated as Court\u2019s Instruction No. i in lieu of the plaintiff\u2019s rejected prayers, and also to the action of the Court, at its own instance, in granting a verbal instruction, which will be quoted in full in a subsequent part of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The suit was brought by the plaintiff, an infant, by his father and next friend, in the Superior Court of Baltimore City, against the defendant corporation to recover damages for personal injuries sustained while upon one of the defendant\u2019s cars, as particularly detailed in the several counts of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The <em>narr. </em>contains three counts. The first alleges that whilst the infant was a passenger and was conducting himself In an orderly and properly manner, the defendant corporation by its servants and agents wrongfully and unlawfully assaulted \u25a0and beat him, and forcibly and unlawfully ejected him from the car, whereby he was seriously and permanently injured and suffered mental and physical pain and anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The second avers that the plaintiff, an infant of about nine years of age, was with the leave and license of the defendant company, upon one of its cars, and while so rightfully upon the car was assaulted, beaten and permanently injured in the manner stated and set out in the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">And the third count charges, in substance, that the plaintiff boarded the defendant\u2019s car on or about the 3rd of July, 1905, intending to become a passenger and offered to pay his fare, but that he was wrongfully assaulted and ejected from the car while it was moving rapidly by the conductor thereof in the manner described in the previous two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The case was tried before a jury and the judgment being for the defendant, the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The substantial issue in the case is presented by the rulings \u2022of the Court as set out in the bills of exception and the conclusion reached by the jury on the facts renders it unnecessary for us to do more than to examine the questions raised by the action of the Court in its rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">The plaintiff was a newsboy about nine years of age, selling papers upon the streets in the city of Baltimore, and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>3rd of July, 1905, boarded one of the appellee\u2019s cars near Exeter and Lombard streets, for the purpose of selling papers and for the purpose of proceeding further in the city to serve his customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The theory of the infant plaintiff\u2019^ case is that he was upon the defendant\u2019s car as a passenger, or that he intended to become such and offered to pay his fare, but when he was handing the conductor the fare, the latter grabbed him and said, \u201cGet off, you damned Jew,\u201d and kicked him off the platform of the car while it was in motion. The boy\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the witnesses\u2019 Salerno and Hartman, who testified on behalf of the plaintiff. They were on the street, near the car, and stated they saw the conductor grab the boy and kick him off the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The evidence on the part of the defendant company was in direct conflict with that offered on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The conductor testified that he never assaulted the boy, did not grab or kick him, or say to him, \u201cget off, you damned Jew,\u201d and the boy did not offer to pay his fare. He further testified: \u201cOn July 3rd, 1905, a newsboy boarded the car at Pratt and Exeter streets. The car stopped at Granby and Exeter streets to let a lady on, and I told him to get off, and he had plenty of time to get off when the lady got on, and I went in to collect the lady\u2019s fare, and when I came out the .boy was still on the rear platform, and he saw me coming out and got scared and jumped off and fell over some watermelons. I didn\u2019t touch him; never had my hands on him. He got on at Pratt and Exeter streets and I stopped at Granby street to let a lady on and I told him to get off; the boy was then standing on the. sidewalk on the street; when I told him to get off he was on the rear platform standing beside the rail on the right-hand side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The conductor\u2019s testimony was supported by that of two&gt; passengers, who were on the platform of the car at the time of the occurrence, and who testified on the part of the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">In this state of the proof, and there being a manifest con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>flict in the evidence, it is clear upon all the authorities that the questions of fact were for the jury to determine upon proper instructions from the Court, and the verdict of the jury is conclusive on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The questions then upon this branch of the case are exceedingly narrow, because unless the Court committed some error whereby the plaintiff was injured, in its rulings on the evidence and the prayers, or in its action in submitting its own written and verbal instructions, the judgment of the Court must stand and cannot be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The record does not disclose any reversible error in the rulings of the Court in permitting the questions to be asked the witness set out in the first, second and third bills of exception. The questions may be regarded as somewhat leading, and for this reason, bad in form for examination in chief, but it is difficult to perceive in what way either the questions propounded or the answers given could have injured the plaintiff\u2019s case. Leading questions are defined to be those which ordinarily suggest to the witness the answer desired or which, embodying a material fact, admit of a direct answer by a simple yes or no, or which instruct a witness how to answer on material points.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In <em>Buschman </em>v. <em>Morling, </em>30 Md. 388, it is said: \u201cUnder what circumstances such questions may be asked is a matter very much under the control of the Court, in the exercise of a sound discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">There was no objection offered to the questions as leading at the time they were propounded and before they were answered. There was no reversible error in the rulings under these exceptions, <em>Frownfelter </em>v. <em>State, 66 </em>Md. 80; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>36 Md. 447; <em>Black </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>107 Md. 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">We come now to the rulings of the Court upon the prayers, as presented by the fourth exception and here, it will be observed that neither the granted, rejected nor modified prayers, make any reference to the pleadings, nor are they referred to in either the written or oral instructions given by the Court. In such case, no question upon the pleadings can arise in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Court, but the broad proposition is presented whether the evidence establishes a case entitling the plaintiff to recover in any form of action. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>107 Md. 420; <em>Bldg. Asso. </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>41 Md. 569; <em>Leopard </em>v. <em>Canal Co., </em>1 Gill, 222; <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Fauntleroy, </em>13 Md. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">At the trial of the case, the Court rejected all of the instructions submitted by the plaintiff and stated to the jury, that he gave in lieu of them, \u201cCourt\u2019s Instruction No. 1,\u201d covering the general grounds sought to be presented by the instructions asked by the plaintiff. The Court\u2019s Instruction No. 1, was as follows: \u201cIf the jury believe that the plaintiff got upon the defendant\u2019s car -for the purpose of riding as a passenger and duly tendered or was about to tender his fare to the conductor, but that the conductor without reason or excuse refused to receive said fare, called him a \u201cdamned Jew\u201d and forcibly and wantonly ejected him from said car, giving said plaintiff a kick as he ejected him, then the verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The defendant\u2019s third prayer it appears from the record, was granted, in connection with the Court\u2019s written instruction, and is to this effect: \u201cIf the jury believe that at the time he received the injuries the plaintiff was upon the car of the defendant for the purpose of selling newspapers to the passengers, then the verdict must be for the defendant, unless the jury further find that the injury to the plaintiff was caused by the conductor of the car either wantonly or with reckless carelessness pushing and kicking the plaintiff off the car while it was in motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">It is the settled law of this Court, says Bartol, C. J., in <em>P. W. &amp; B. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>29 Md. 330, that \u201cit is competent for the Court below to reject all the prayers offered and grant instructions to the jury in its own language, and where these are correct and cover the whole ground, the judgment will not be reversed though some of the prayers might have been granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">But when this is done, all the cases hold \u201cthe law ought to be declared fully and accurately and in terms certain, explicit and intelligible to the jury upon the points raised by counsel. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>There was no error in the Court\u2019s Instruction No. i, in lieu of the plaintiff\u2019s prayers under the evidence in the case, nor to the defendant\u2019s third prayer granted in connection with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The defendant\u2019s sixth prayer as to compensatory damages, and the Court\u2019s verbal instruction as to punitive damages, in connection with the Court\u2019s Instruction No. I, are also free from objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">It will not then be necessary in deciding the law applicable to this branch of the case to refer to the plaintiff\u2019s prayers, becayse they were all rejected by the Court, and Court\u2019s Instruction No. i, was given in lieu thereof. If that instruction covered the law of the case as we have held in connection with the other granted prayers the appellant would have no cause of complaint in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The gravamen of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint against the defendant as offered by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence was that as a passenger upon the car, he had been wrongfully assaulted and ejected therefrom, and even if not a passenger, he was entitled to protection from the violence of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">* The defendant\u2019s theory as presented by the testimony was that the plaintiff was a newsboy, that the conductor did not assault him, but that he contributed to his own injury -by jumping from the car while in motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">There can be no' reasonable dispute as to the law applicable to a case of this character upon either theory as herein stated. If the assault was made and the plaintiff was ejected whilst a passenger, and whilst the conductor was in its employ, executing \u201cthe contract of transportation\u201d (provided the jury found these facts), the company would clearly be responsible. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. Barger, 80 Md. 23; <em>C. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Peacock, </em>69 Md. 259; <em>Cate </em>v. <em>Schaum, </em>51 Md. 309; <em>Consol. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>89 Md. 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">In <em>Steamboat Co. </em>v. <em>Brochett, </em>121 U. S. 649, the Court holds, that a common carrier of passengers undertakes absolutely to protect them against the misconduct and illegal acts of its own servants engaged in executing the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">The duty and obligation of a street railway company to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>newsboy who enters upon its cars for the purpose of selling papers and who pays no fare, has been clearly defined by the Courts of this country. He is not a passenger but a mere licensee or trespasser and the company owes him no duty except to use ordinary care for his preservation after discovering his peril and to refrain from inflicting wilful, reckless and wanton injury. The recognized law upon this subject is well stated in a case note, entitled \u201cDuty of carrier to one whom it permits to enter its cars upon his own business and not as a passenger,\u201d in the report of the case of <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>South. &amp; Western </em>Railroad, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1240, where the leading cases are cited and collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In this State the rule of law applicable to cases where injuries result to persons bearing the relation of mere licensees has been established by a long line of decisions. <em>B. &amp; O. </em>R. <em>R. Co. </em>v. State, 79 Md. 335; <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Traction Co., </em>77 Md. 535; <em>Maenner </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>46 Md. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The defendant\u2019s third prayer substantially presented these propositions of law as herein stated and the Court committed no error in granting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The fourth prayer as modified submitted in substance the proposition that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiff to show by the weight of the evidence that the injury was caused by the violent and wrongful act of the conductor and unless the jury so found, their verdict must be for the defendant. The prayer was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">This brings us to a consideration of the remaining question in the case, and this arises on the fourth exception, in the action of the Court, at its own instance, in submitting the following verbal instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u201cGentlemen of the Jury. \u2014 The instructions under which the case now comes to you are these: I have refused all the instructions that the plaintiff prepared, and in place of those give this instruction as covering the general grounds sought to be covered by the instructions asked by the plaintiff (aforesaid \u2018Court\u2019s instruction\u2019 No. 1 was here read); in connection with that, I grant the prayer as to damages as follows: The Court instructs the jury that if the jury find for the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>under the Court\u2019s instruction, then in estimating the damages, they are to consider the health and condition of the plaintiff before the injuries complained of, as compared with his present condition in consequence of said injuries and whether said injuries are, in their nature, permanent, and how far they are calculated to disable the plaintiff from engaging in those business pursuits for which, in the absence of said injuries, he would have been qualified, and also the physical and mental suffering to which he has been subject by reason of the injujuries, and to allow such damages as in the opinion of the jury, will be fair and just compensation for the injuries which the plaintiff has suffered, and the jury may also in their discretion allow punitive or exemplary damages. At the instance of the defendant I have granted this prayer (defendant\u2019s third prayer read);. at the instance of the defendant, I have granted his fourth prayer as follows (defendant\u2019s fourth prayer, as modified, read). The defendant\u2019s sixth prayer I grant as follows (defendant\u2019s sixth prayer read). The object of these instructions, taken as a whole, is to present to you the two theories of this case, held by the plaintiff and the defendant. The Court instructs you practically that if you believe the story which the plaintiff told here that the conductor refused to accept his fare, put him off the car and kicked him off in the process of his ejectment, that then you are to find for the plaintiff, and being a wanton, wilful and inexcusable act, you are at liberty first to allow compensatory damages and in addition to that punitive damages. But if, on the other hand, you believe the defendant\u2019s story that the newsboy got upon the car, went in the car and sold such papers as he could, got off in pursuance of the conductor\u2019s order at Granby street, then got on the step after that and then seeing the conductor approach, or as the conductor was approaching, got off the car himself while the car was in motion, and the conductor never laid his hands upon him, then your verdict must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u201cThe object of these prayers is to eliminate such matters as were not contained either in the defendant\u2019s case or plaintiff\u2019s case, and submit the stories of each side; and it is in your province to determine what you believe in regard to this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The plaintiff insists that there was error in granting this instruction, as it tended to mislead and confuse the jury to his manifest prejudice and injury, and in this objection we all concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Whatever maybe the rule and practice in other jurisdictions, under the settled practice in this State, the Courts are not bound to give either written or oral instructions. While it is competent for the Court to give instructions of its own, either written or oral or explain the effect of those granted provided they are not inconsistent, we have found no case in this State, and none has been cited, where the Court has gone to the extent in an oral instruction, it did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In <em>Smith </em>v. Crichton, 33 Md. 103, it is said, the law may be <em>sufficiently </em>expounded to the jury through oral instructions. In <em>Downey </em>v. Forrester, 35 Md. 117, it was held to be competent for the Court by an oral instruction to make an explanation, <em>ex mero motu </em>of written instructions previously granted by the Court. And in <em>Hussey v. Brown, </em>64 Md. 426, it is said, so far as defendant\u2019s exception to this last instruction rests upon its being voluntary or an explanation of the prayer to which it relates, it is well settled that the Court may give instructions of its own or explain the effect of those granted <em>at the instance of the parties, </em>provided they are not inconsistent therewith. Such an interposition is often salutary and pro-motive of a clear understanding of the law, especially if its rulings are not understood or as sometimes occurs are contravened or misconstrued in the argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">While it is clear that the power exists in the Courts of submitting an oral instruction in cases where it applies, or may be considered necessary, yet it is a power that should be cautiously exercised and will be found in practice a dangerous one and open to abuse. Under our practice, it is not to be approved or commended, except to promote the ends of justice as indicated by the cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">In the case at bar, it is difficult to reconcile parts of the oral instruction with those previously given. It is somewhat inconsistent with the written instructions and may have misled the jury to the prejudice of the plaintiff In part, it was practically a \u201cduplication of instructions.\u201d In <em>Storr </em>v. <em>James, </em>84 Md. 290, the duplication of instructions was condemned by this Court. It is there said: \u201cInstructions are intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>give to the jury a clear and concise statement of the law governing the case. The duplication of instructions has a tendency to mislead or confuse rather than to guide the jury and thus to frustrate the very object intended to be accomplished by their being given at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">It is also well settled, where a correct and an incorrect instruction have been given on the same subject, it cannot be shown that no injury resulted because it cannot be ascertained by which the jury was governed. <em>Adams </em>v. Capron, 21 Md. 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>94 Md. 203, this Court, in passing upon the effect of an oral statement made by the Court in the presence of the jury, said: \u201cIf a written instruction had been granted to the effect of what we have quoted, there could be no doubt that it would have been error, and such oral statements in the presence of the jury were calculated to greatly injure the defendant, and perhaps made it useless for his counsel to argue that question before the jury.\u201d 11 <em>Ency. of Pl. &amp; Pr., </em>114.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We are therefore of opinion that the oral instruction submitted by the Court in this case was calculated to confuse and mislead the minds of the jury, to the injury of the plaintiff\u2019s case and should not have been given them. For this error, the judgment will be reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\n<em>Reversed and new trial azvarded, zvith costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
