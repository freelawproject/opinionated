Challenging his convictions, the defendant argues that his right to counsel was violated when an officer engaged in the functional equivalent of questioning after he had asserted his right to counsel, and that his sixth amendment right to a public trial was violated when the courtroom was closed to the public during the testimony of the fourteen-year-old victim. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">A general recitation of facts is unnecessary to our review of the defendant\u2019s arguments. The defendant first asserts that his right to the assistance of counsel during custodial interrogation was violated when an officer engaged in the functional equivalent of questioning after the defendant had asserted his right to counsel. The State maintains that the officer\u2019s comment was not \u201cthe functional equivalent of questioning\u201d and, therefore, that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his incriminating response.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">While at the police station, the defendant was advised of \u201cwhat he was there for\u201d and of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant requested the assistance of counsel and indicated that he did not want to say anything. Subsequently, while at a local hospital for a collection of evidence procedure, a police officer who had been present when the defendant requested counsel told him that two additional charges would probably be filed against him. The defendant responded: \u201cHow much time am I looking at?\u201d This response was admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u201cWhen a suspect who is in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes requests an attorney, police must cease all questioning and its functional equivalents.\u201d <em>State v. Dedrick, </em>132 N.H. 218, 226, 564 A.2d 423, 428 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>110 S. Ct. 1305, 1308 (1990) (citing <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 297-301 (1980)). The State concedes that the defendant was in custody. Therefore, the only question for our review is whether the police engaged in the functional equivalent of questioning after the defendant asserted his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\"> The functional equivalent of questioning occurs when police officers use words that they should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. <em>Dedrick, </em>132 N.H. at 226, 564 A.2d at 428. Viewing the officer\u2019s statement from the reasonable perception of the suspect, <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 297-302, we cannot say that the officer should have known that his comment was reasonably likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>elicit an incriminating response. The officer could have reasonably assumed that the defendant would respond just as he did at the police station to statements about the pending charges; namely, with silence. Because the trial court applied the proper legal standard and because its factual findings were sufficient and not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, <em>Dedrick, </em>132 N.H. at 226, 564 A.2d at 428, we find no error in its denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the incriminating statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The defendant next argues that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to a public trial by closing the courtroom to the public during the fourteen-year-old victim\u2019s testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">RSA 632-A:8 provides that \u201c[i]n the cases where the victim is under 16 years of age, the victim\u2019s testimony shall be heard in camera unless good cause is shown by the defendant. The record of the victim\u2019s testimony shall not be sealed and all other testimony and evidence introduced during the proceeding shall be public.\u201d The trial court properly acknowledged that the statute should be construed in light of the sixth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39 (1984), the United States Supreme Court held that under the sixth amendment any closure of a suppression hearing must meet the tests set out in <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., </em>464 U.S. 501 (1984). <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 47. The Court likened suppression hearings to bench trials and stated that the same considerations apply to both in this area. To meet the requirements of <em>Waller, </em>\u201cthe party seeking to close the [courtroom] must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> Under the first prong of the test, the prosecution must \u201cadvance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48. Where the victim is under sixteen years of age, the State has a compelling interest in safeguarding the minor\u2019s physical and psychological well-being. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, </em>457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982). That interest alone does not justify mandatory closure, however. The trial court must \u201cdetermine on a case-by-case basis whether closure is necessary to protect the welfare of a minor victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608. In making this determination, the trial court may consider \u201cthe minor victim\u2019s age, psychological maturity and understanding, the nature of the crime, the desires of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>victim, and the interests of parents and relatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the trial court heard testimony from the victim\u2019s guardian ad litem that \u201cthis is an exceedingly difficult matter for her to talk about, even in front of just me, that the more individuals that are here, the more difficult that becomes. . .. [I]t is not going to be an easy thing.\u201d The victim/ witness coordinator, who had met with the victim at least three times a month since the beginning of the case, testified that the witness was \u201cvery sensitive\u201d and \u201cvery shy,\u201d and that \u201cif somebody she doesn\u2019t know comes into the room, she will withdraw.\u201d She added that the victim was very nervous about testifying in court and that, in her opinion, closing the courtroom would be in the victim\u2019s best interest. After hearing this testimony, the trial court asked the guardian ad litem to speak with the victim about closing the courtroom. The guardian ad litem reported that the victim wanted the victim/witness coordinator to be present but no one else, other than those people who had to be there. After hearing this testimony, the trial court found an \u201coverriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced.\u201d We cannot say that the court abused its discretion in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The defendant concedes that the second prong of the <em>Waller </em>test, that closure be no broader than necessary to protect the interest, has been met, because the courtroom was closed only during the testimony of the minor victim. Further, the trial court ordered an expedited transcript of the victim\u2019s testimony, which was available for public inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The defendant asserts that the third prong of <em>Waller, </em>which requires the court to consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, was not met, because \u201cthe trial court failed to consider the most reasonable alternative \u2014 to allow the minor witness to testify in open court up to the point where she might have appeared to be suffering emotional or physical trauma.\u201d We specifically reject the notion that the trial court must withhold action on a closure request until the victim is on the stand and becomes unable to testify. \u201cSuch a requirement would unnecessarily subject the witness to the sort of emotional trauma that the exclusion of spectators is intended to avoid.\u201d <em>State v. Santos, </em>413 A.2d 58, 63 (R.I. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The defendant lastly maintains that <em>Waller\u2019s </em>fourth prong, that the trial court make findings adequate to support closure, was not met. <em>Press-Enterprise </em>requires only that findings be \u201cspecific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.\u201d 464 U.S. at 510. The trial court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201c[B]ased on what I have heard, the Court does find that the nature of the sexual offenses alleged in this case, coupled with the age of the victim, and her personality, as has been testified to, that closure is in the victim\u2019s best interests. There is no doubt in my mind that it would be difficult for the victim in this case to testify about these matters in front of the persons whose presence is essential. And if others were to be present, then it seems to me that her testimony would be that much more difficult, and traumatic. Therefore, I will be concerned about the affect [sic] on her testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The trial court made specific findings articulating its basis for determining that the presence of non-essential persons in the courtroom would traumatize the victim and affect the victim\u2019s testimony. Consequently, the closure order was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
