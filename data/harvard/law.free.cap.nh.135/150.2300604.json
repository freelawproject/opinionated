The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in ruling that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff\u2019s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was employed part-time by defendant Wickson Trucking Company (Wickson) as a mechanic. On November 23, 1985, at approximately 8:00 p.m., the plaintiff punched out of work for the day. He was driving home in a service truck owned by his employer when he encountered two of his coworkers walking along the road. Each had run out of gas while driving his own car home after work.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">The plaintiff picked them up and drove to his home, where he left the service truck, picked up a gas can, and took another vehicle, a Honda. He drove his co-workers to a gas station and, on the way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>back to the stranded cars, made a U-turn and collided with another vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the injuries he sustained in the accident was denied by the New Hampshire Department of Labor. The plaintiff then appealed to the superior court. The defendants moved for summary judgment, and the plaintiff filed a counter-motion for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the court found that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the defendants had established an entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. The court\u2019s order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">\u201c[A]t the time of the accident, the Plaintiff was performing a personal activity, not related to his employment at Wickson Truck, and ... the incidents which occurred were within the ordinary peril of travel between home and work. Therefore, the Court is unable to find that the cause of the injuries sustained by Cook can properly be considered a hazard of his employment at Wickson Trucking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that he received a \u201ccall to employment\u201d when he encountered his stranded co-employees, because his activities in assisting them were integrally related to his employment relationship with Wickson. The defendants, on the other hand, argue that the trial court correctly ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from the ordinary perils of travel between home and work and, as such, are not covered under workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u201c\u2018Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits filed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Lourie v. Keene State College, </em>121 N.H. 233, 235, 428 A.2d 902, 903 (1981) (quoting RSA 491:8-a (Supp. 1979)). The plaintiff does not dispute that there is no \u201cgenuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d This review is limited, therefore, to the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts as set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">We turn now to the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in concluding that his injury was not the result of a hazard created by the plaintiff\u2019s employment. The New Hampshire workers\u2019 compensation statute requires that an accidental injury, to be compensable, must \u201caris[e] out of and in the course of employment.\u201d RSA 281-A:2, XI (Supp. 1990). \u201cThis requirement imposes on the claimant an obligation to prove that the injury is related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>employment in terms of time, space, and subject matter.\u201d <em>Whittemore v. Sullivan Cty. Homemaker\u2019s Aid Serv., </em>129 N.H. 432, 434, 529 A.2d 919, 920 (1987). This court has established that the claimant must prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\u201c(1) that the injury arose out of employment by demonstrating that it resulted from a risk created by the employment, <em>Maheux v. Cove-Craft Co., </em>103 N.H. 71, 74, 164 A.2d 574, 576 (1960); and (2) that the injury arose in the course of employment by demonstrating that (A) it occurred within the boundaries of time and space created by the terms of employment, <em>Heinz v. Concord Union School Dist., </em>117 N.H. 214, 218, 371 A.2d 1161, 1164 (1977); and (B) it occurred in the performance of an activity related to employment, which may include a personal activity if reasonably expected and not forbidden, <em>see Hanchett v. Brezner Tanning Co., </em>107 N.H. 236, 238-39, 221 A.2d 246, 247 (1966); or an activity of mutual benefit to employer and employee, <em>see Hanchett v. Brezner Tanning Co., supra </em>at 239, 221 A.2d at 248.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\"><em>Murphy v. Town of Atkinson, </em>128 N.H. 641, 645-46, 517 A.2d 1170, 1171-73 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The plaintiff argues that merely because the accident occurred after work hours does not mean that his activity was personal and not related to his employment. While this court has questioned the utility of the strict \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule, under which an employee having fixed hours and a fixed place of work is compensated only for injuries which occur on the employer\u2019s premises, <em>see Brousseau v. Blackstone Mills, </em>100 N.H. 493, 495, 130 A.2d 543, 545 (1957), we have repeatedly recognized that the ordinary perils of travel between home and work are not considered hazards of employment and, therefore, that injuries arising from such travel are noncompensable. <em>See Donnelly v. Kearsarge Tel. Co., </em>121 N.H. 237, 240, 428 A.2d 888, 890 (1981); <em>Heinz, supra </em>at 218, 371 A.2d at 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">There are two exceptions to this rule. First, an employee may recover for injuries sustained while travelling to or from his place of employment if he is on a \u201cspecial duty or errand\u201d for the employer. <em>Heinz, supra </em>at 219, 371 A.2d at 1164; <em>see Henderson v. Sherwood Motor Hotel, </em>105 N.H. 443, 445, 201 A.2d 891, 894 (1964). Second, personal activities are compensable if they are \u201creasonably to be expected\u201d and \u201cnot forbidden,\u201d <em>Hanchett supra, </em>or if they confer a \u201cmutual benefit [on] the employee and employer.\u201d <em>N.E. Telephone Co. v. Ames, </em>124 N.H. 661, 664, 474 A.2d 571, 573 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The first exception is not available to the plaintiff in the case before us because he has not argued that he was on a special errand for his employer at the time of the accident. However, even if the plaintiff has raised the \u201cspecial duty or errand\u201d exception, as the dissent contends, the instant circumstances do not fall within that exception. A special employment errand normally arises \u201c[w]hen any person in authority directs an employee to run some private errand or do some work outside his normal duties for the private benefit of the employer or supervisor ....\u201d 1A Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 27.41, at 5-424 (1990). The record before us contains no evidence that either the plaintiff\u2019s employer or his supervisor directed him either to stop and render assistance to his fellow employees or to be prepared to do so. The dissent points out that before leaving from work the plaintiff knew of his coworkers\u2019 after-work excursion to the gas station. Although the plaintiff might have known of these plans, there is no evidence that the plaintiff was, in any way, a part of those plans. The dissent also notes that when the plaintiff stopped to aid his co-workers, he was driving the work vehicle that the co-workers had intended to retrieve for their own use. However, neither the plaintiff\u2019s mere operation of a company truck, nor the intention of co-workers, unknown to the plaintiff, is sufficient to bring the plaintiff\u2019s actions within the \u201cspecial duty or errand\u201d exception as described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">Furthermore, the dissent broadly construes the special employment errand rule to include circumstances in which \u201cthe employee\u2019s impression of what is expected of him in serving the interests of his employer or superior, are in fact sufficient to motivate his undertaking the service in question.\u201d 1A Larson, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 27.48, at 5-438-40. The dissenting justices argue that because the plaintiff encountered his <em>supervisor </em>on the road, the plaintiff was compelled to stop and render assistance, knowing \u201cthat his supervisor will judge his next day\u2019s performance on the job, and for the employee to fail to offer assistance is certainly not what would be reasonably expected of an employee.\u201d For this reason, the dissent concludes that the plaintiff\u2019s actions should fall within the \u201cspecial errand or duty\u201d exception. We disagree, because if these analyses were adopted, and the roles of the plaintiff and supervisor were reversed, all other circumstances remaining unchanged, the supervisor would not be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits because he could not argue that he risked work-related repercussions for failing to stop and render assistance to an employee whom he supervised. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Similarly, if the plaintiff had encountered only his co-worker, and not his supervisor, he would not be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. If, however, the plaintiff had chanced to encounter his supervisor on a non-work day, the analysis urged by the dissent conceivably would lead to a finding of workers\u2019 compensation coverage. Workers\u2019 compensation coverage would turn on a worker\u2019s status on the totem pole of employment classification; workers in supervisory positions would be less likely to receive the benefit of workers\u2019 compensation coverage than other employees. We cannot agree that such a result is consistent with the workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\">The second exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule is likewise unavailable to the plaintiff. The plaintiff cites <em>Maheux v. Cove-Craft </em>and <em>Hanchett v. Brezner </em>in support of his position that activities even of a personal nature may be a natural incident of employment. In both of the cited cases, however, the injured employees were engaged in activities on the employer\u2019s premises, utilizing the employer\u2019s equipment, with the employer\u2019s knowledge. <em>See Maheux v. Cove-Craft, </em>103 N.H. at 74-75, 164 A.2d at 576-77 (employee injured during lunch time while operating employer\u2019s machine to make a checkerboard for his own use); <em>Hanchett v. Brezner Tanning Co., </em>107 N.H. at 237, 221 A.2d at 248 (mechanic killed during working hours while using his employer\u2019s jack to repair his own automobile). We decline to hold under these circumstances that the risk that the plaintiff might be injured while assisting his fellow employees after work was \u201cincidental to, and inextricably interwoven into the fabric of his employment\u201d as a part-time mechanic. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 221 A.2d at 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Further, the plaintiff suggests that aiding his co-workers provided a mutual benefit to both the employer and employees. In <em>N.E. Telephone Co. v. Ames, supra </em>at 664, 474 A.2d at 574, we held that collective bargaining negotiations constituted a mutual benefit to the employer and employee, so as to allow for workers\u2019 compensation coverage for an injury sustained by a union representative during such negotiations. In contrast, offering a ride to the gas station to a stranded co-employee encountered on the road after work is simply \u201ctoo vague and attenuated a benefit to satisfy the <em>N.E. Telephone </em>rule.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Town of Atkinson, </em>128 N.H. at 647, 517 A.2d at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The fact that one of the stranded co-employees was the plaintiff\u2019s immediate supervisor is not sufficient to characterize the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>tiff\u2019s actions as employment-related. All three employees were finished with work for the day and returning home. None of them was scheduled to return to work that night. <em>Cf. Heinz v. Concord Union School Dist., </em>117 N.H. at 219, 371 A.2d at 1164 (school teacher killed in accident while on his way home to change clothes and return to school to chaperone a dance); <em>Henderson v. Sherwood Motor Hotel, </em>105 N.H. at 444, 201 A.2d at 894 (cocktail waitress killed on way home after working at special evening duty). The plaintiff was not required, by nature of his employment, to render assistance. The bare fact that the plaintiff knew through his employment the two individuals whom he assisted does not make this personal activity sufficiently related to the nature of employment to require the payment of workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">The dissent relies on the testimony of Mr. Wickson, the company president, to conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s actions were \u201creasonably expected and not forbidden.\u201d Mr. Wickson purportedly testified, at a labor department hearing, that if one employee were stranded on the road, another would be authorized and expected to give assistance. However, reliance on this purported testimony is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The moving party is charged with establishing a record sufficient to decide the questions of law raised on appeal. Sup. Ct. R. 13(3); <em>see also </em>Sup. Ct. R. 16(3)(d) (the moving party\u2019s brief shall set forth \u201ca statement of facts material to the consideration of the questions presented, with appropriate references to the appendix or to the record\u201d). The record before us does not contain a transcript of Mr. Wickson\u2019s testimony at the labor department hearing. <em>See Bussiere v. Cunningham, Warden, </em>132 N.H. 747, 754, 571 A.2d 908, 912 (1990) (without a transcript the question of sufficiency of the evidence cannot be determined on appeal, and we presume that the evidence supports the lower court\u2019s finding); Sup. Ct. R. 15(3) (in order to contend that a finding is unsupported by the evidence the moving party must include in the record a transcript of all relevant evidence). Thus, what the dissent relies on is the testimony of Mr. Wick-son as paraphrased by the plaintiff. <em>Cf. State v. Sampson, </em>132 N.H. 343, 347, 565 A.2d 1040, 1043 (1989) (in reviewing whether the trial court committed error, we are limited by the record presented and we refrain from basing our finding upon mere speculation). Because we do not have the transcript of his testimony, we do not know exactly what Mr. Wickson may have said, to what question he may have responded, or the context in which he may have made such a statement. Moreover, although the dissent states that the substance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Mr. Wickson\u2019s statement was uncontested, the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, also relying on testimony from the labor department hearing, notes that Mr. Wickson never encouraged, instructed, or required the plaintiff to render assistance to his coworkers, and was unaware of what took place until hours after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The trial court did not err in ruling that the cause of the injuries sustained by the plaintiff could not properly be considered a hazard of his employment. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-7\">JOHNSON and Batchelder, JJ., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b172-8\">JOHNSON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8-\">dissenting: I disagree with the majority\u2019s characterization of the circumstances surrounding Cook\u2019s accident, as well as its interpretation of the applicable law and its reading of Cook\u2019s argument. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">I first note that the majority omits three crucial items in its recitation of the facts which were set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s brief and uncontested by the defendants: (1) Cook knew before he left work on the night of the accident that his co-worker Stanley\u2019s car was low on gas, and that their mutual supervisor, Bouchard, had decided to follow Stanley to a gas station after work, in case Stanley\u2019s car did not make it to the station; (2) Mr. Wickson himself testified at the department of labor hearing that he would expect that if one employee was stranded by virtue of having run out of gas, another one of his employees would be authorized \u2014 and even expected \u2014 to help him out; and (3) the trial court\u2019s order, on the cross-motions for summary judgment, stated that when Cook encountered Bouchard and Stanley on foot, both of their cars having run out of gas on the way to the station, the two were walking back to the worksite to get a gas can and the company service truck Cook was driving at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">It is important to remember here that it is this court\u2019s duty to construe liberally the workers\u2019 compensation statute, RSA 281-A:2, XI (Supp. 1990), in order to give the broadest reasonable effect to its remedial purpose, <em>see Whittemore v. Sullivan Cty. Homemaker\u2019s Aid Serv., </em>129 N.H. 432, 435, 529 A.2d 919, 920-21 (1987), and that all reasonable doubts must be resolved in favor of the injured worker, <em>see Ranger v. N.H. Youth Dev. Center, </em>117 N.H. 648, 652, 377 A.2d 132, 135 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">I would find that Cook\u2019s accident did \u201caris[e] out of\u201d employment, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:2, XI (Supp. 1990), a criterion \u201cprimarily concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>with causal connection.\u201d <em>Whittemore, supra </em>at 435, 529 A.2d at 921. \u201cWith respect to perils of travel,... th[is] court has held that special travel risks imposed by special duties are properly considered hazards of the employment,\u201d and thus arise out of employment. R. Galway, New Hampshire Workers\u2019 Compensation Manual \u00a7 24, at 19 (1990) (citing <em>Heinz v. Concord Union School Dist., </em>117 N.H. 214, 371 A.2d 1161 (1977); <em>Henderson v. Sherwood Motor Hotel, </em>105 N.H. 443, 201 A.2d 891 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Professor Larson cites with approval the trend in other States to adopt an \u201cactual risk\u201d test for determining whether an injury arose out of employment. Consistent with this trend, courts \u201cdo not care whether this risk was also common to the public, if in fact it was a risk of this employment.\u201d 1 A. Larson, The Law of Workmen's Compensation \u00a7 6.40, at 3-6 (1990) (hereinafter \u201cLarson\u201d). He notes that \u201c[o]ne effect [of adopting the \u2018actual risk\u2019 test] is to permit recoveries in most street-risk cases . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Certainly there is a causal connection here between Cook\u2019s accident and his employment with the defendant; if Cook had not been a company employee, the chances are overwhelming that he never would have encountered Bouchard and Stanley on the road leading back to the worksite that evening and stopped to assist them. Moreover, as discussed in greater detail below, a \u201cspecial travel risk\u201d was imposed on Cook by virtue of his \u201cspecial dut[y]\u201d to assist his supervisor from his predicament. At the very least, Cook\u2019s accident was an \u201cactual risk\u201d of his employment, because it was <em>in fact </em>a risk which grew out of his employment. Thus, Cook\u2019s injuries arose out of employment as contemplated by our workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Turning now to the \u201cin the course of employment\u201d requirement, the majority correctly notes that recovery is permitted for an injury which occurred during performance of a personal activity \u201creasonably expected and not forbidden.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Town of Atkinson, </em>128 N.H. 641, 646, 517 A.2d 1170, 1173 (1986); <em>see Hanchett v. Brezner Tanning Co., </em>107 N.H. 236, 238-39, 221 A.2d 246, 247 (1966). Wick-son\u2019s testimony makes it clear that Cook\u2019s activity was \u201creasonably expected and not forbidden.\u201d The majority, however, fails to discuss this broad, compelling language, and instead, simply distinguishes two cases cited by Cook in his brief, <em>Maheux v. Cove-Craft Co., </em>103 N.H. 71, 164 A.2d 574 (1960) and <em>Hanchett supra. </em>When a part-time, teen-aged worker encounters his adult supervisor walking along the road in the direction of their worksite shortly after the supervisor has left work, in search of the company truck the worker is driving, it certainly is \u201creasonably expected\u201d that the worker will give his su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>pervisor a lift and render whatever aid the supervisor seems to need. Not surprisingly, the company president testified at the labor department hearing that, if one employee were stranded on the road, another would be <em>authorized, </em>and even <em>expected, </em>to offer aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In addition to not fully considering the \u201creasonably expected and not forbidden\u201d rule, the majority gives short shrift to the \u201cspecial duty or errand\u201d doctrine, <em>see Heinz, </em>117 N.H. at 219, 371 A.2d at 1164; <em>Henderson, </em>105 N.H. at 443, 201 A.2d at 894, which allows recovery for injuries sustained while travelling to or from a worksite where the worker is on a \u201cspecial duty or errand\u201d of the employer. Cook\u2019s brief asserts that \u201c[e]mployment occurs when there is a call or requirement to perform some activity which is integrally related to the object of the employment relationship.\u201d The brief then argues in detail that \u201cCook\u2019s injuries occurred in just such a situation,\u201d and concludes that \u201cCook\u2019s assistance to his immediate supervisor under these circumstances was certainly \u2018integrally related\u2019 to \u2014 if not compelled by \u2014 his employment.\u201d In light of this language, I find unnecessarily and unjustifiably harsh the majority\u2019s position that Cook forfeited the \u201cspecial duty or errand\u201d issue because \u201che has not argued that he was on a special errand for his employer at the time of the accident.\u201d The \u201cspecial duty or errand\u201d doctrine simply states that when an off-duty worker is called to duty on the way to or from work, any injury suffered in performance of that duty is compensable. The basic issue this doctrine presents is fully argued in Cook\u2019s brief, and the absence of the magic words \u201cspecial duty or errand\u201d should not be a reason to fail to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">When a worker\u2019s trip is undertaken with both an employment errand and a personal errand in mind, Professor Larson states that \u201cif the employment errand comes first, and the injury occurs before it is completed, the case for compensability is very plain.\u201d 1 Larson \u00a7 19.26, at 4-364. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, to be classified as an \u201cemployment errand,\u201d the errand need not be one normally associated with the person\u2019s work, as Professor Larson explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">\u201cWhen any person in authority directs an employee to run some private errand or do some work outside his normal duties for the private benefit of the employer or superior, an injury in the course of that work is compensable. . . . [1A. Larson \u00a7 27.47, at 5-424] The question of the actual authority of the person issuing the order is sometimes adverted to in the cases, but should not be <em>decisive----[Id. </em>at \u00a7 27.46, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>5-437] [Moreover,] the employer\u2019s \u2018order\u2019 need not take the form of an outright command, if in the circumstances the employer\u2019s \u2018suggestion,\u2019 or even the employee\u2019s impression of what is expected of him in serving the interests of his employer or superior, are in fact sufficient to motivate his undertaking the service in question.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at \u00a7 27.48, at 5-438-40.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">In light of this language, Cook\u2019s abortive attempt to help his supervisor and co-worker falls squarely within the \u201cspecial errand or duty\u201d rule. Cook was performing a private errand for his supervisor at the time of the accident; as such, the errand qualifies as a compensable employment errand. Again, my resolution of this issue flows from my view of the circumstances surrounding Cook\u2019s decision to render assistance. I think the majority ignores the realities of the workplace in assuming that this decision was unaffected by the supervisor-worker relationship, and belies the testimony of the parties. It strains credulity to argue seriously that Cook could have encountered his supervisor and co-employee, returning on foot to their mutual place of employment, knowing that they had left under the threat that the co-employee\u2019s car would run out of gas, and that he would continue merrily along without offering assistance. Every employee knows that his supervisor will judge his next day\u2019s performance on the job, and for the employee to fail to offer assistance is certainly not what would be reasonably expected of an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">I would reverse the decision of the trial court and order payment of compensation benefits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b175-5\">BATCHELDER, J., joins in the dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
