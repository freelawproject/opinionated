We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The plaintiff was employed by Coiffures By Michael as a hairdresser from November 1987 until her injury on January 11, 1989. The plaintiff\u2019s work as a hairdresser frequently required prolonged periods of standing behind or next to a customer with her hands raised, as well as various cleaning tasks. In mid-December 1988, Tzimas began to experience a tightness or stiffness in her neck. She neither sought medical attention nor stopped working as a result of her pain. Then, on January 11,1989, the pain worsened. Although in obvious pain, she worked her regular shift, but later that night the pain became so severe that her husband took her to Elliot Hospital emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Following her visit to the emergency room, Tzimas saw her family doctor, Stephen Tzianabos, M.D., who in turn referred her to a physiatrist, Irina Barkan, M.D. Dr. Barkan performed a comprehensive neurological evaluation, made a preliminary diagnosis, and suggested that the plaintiff have other diagnostic tests performed. The plaintiff was subsequently seen by several other specialists, and ultimately had surgery to remove a herniated disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">On January 31, 1989, the plaintiff filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the department of labor, claiming that her neck injury was caused by her work as a hairdresser. The department denied her claim and she filed an appeal with the superior court. After a trial <em>de novo, </em>the court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove that her injury was causally related to her work. Following the court\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider, the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">In the absence of any evidence of a traumatic event, both the plaintiff\u2019s and the defendants\u2019 experts agreed that the injury to her neck was the result of a degeneration of the cervical disc combined with a minor incident that caused the herniation of the disc. The defendants concede that if the degeneration occurred as a result of her work, regardless of where the actual precipitating event took place, she would be covered by workers\u2019 compensation. Further, the plaintiff does not contend that a traumatic event occurred at work; therefore, the issue is whether the degeneration was caused by her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number> In a workers\u2019 compensation case, the claimant bears the burden of proof on the issue of causation. <em>Town of Hudson v. Wynott, </em>128 N.H. 478, 483, 522 A.2d 974, 977 (1986). \u201cThe claimant must. . . prove legal causation, that is, that [her] injury is work-connected, and medical causation, that is, that [her] disability was actually caused by the work-related event.\u201d <em>Town of Goffstown v. Morgrage, </em>122 N.H. 591, 593, 448 A.2d 385, 386 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">At her trial before the superior court, the plaintiff offered Dr. Barkan\u2019s deposition testimony to prove the causal connection between the degeneration of her C6-C7 disc and her occupation. Dr. Barkan opined that \u201cworking with the repetitive arm motion is a high-risk profession for the neck,\u201d but she could not definitively determine the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s disc degeneration. In fact, when specifically asked whether the repetitive nature of the plaintiff\u2019s work caused a cumulative type trauma to the cervical disc, she replied: \u201cI\u2019m not saying [the plaintiff\u2019s work as a hairdresser] caused it; I\u2019m saying it\u2019s quite probable because this type of work may cause a cumulative trauma to cervical disks and may gradually degenerate . . ..\u201d Later still, the following colloquy ensued between the defendants\u2019 attorney and the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cQ. . . . So, your opinion that her occupation as a hairdresser probably\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">A. Could have caused it; it\u2019s based on the lack of notation of trauma, mainly on the lack of notation of trauma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">Q. But it\u2019s based on your understanding of what a hairdresser generally does?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">A. Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">Q. As opposed to what Katina did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">A. No, I don\u2019t know what she did. I didn\u2019t ask her how many hours she worked, how extensive; and so what I\u2019m saying, because the woman is relatively young, she didn\u2019t have any trauma, she didn\u2019t do anything, construction work or lifting or anything that I would suspect as a very strong reason for adverse trauma, and she worked in a profession that in my practice I see as a risky profession because of repetitive abuse of the cervical muscles, I say it\u2019s \u2014 probably this profession had caused early degeneration of the cervical disk and eventually led to its herniation. It\u2019s possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">Further, the defendants introduced expert testimony by Donald Cusson, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Cusson firmly disagreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>with Dr. Barkan\u2019s opinion that the disc degeneration exhibited by the plaintiff could have been caused by her work as a hairdresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u201c[A] trier of fact is free to accept or reject an expert\u2019s testimony, in whole or in part, when faced with conflicting expert testimony.\u201d <em>Bartlett Tree Experts Co. v. Johnson, </em>129 N.H. 703, 706, 532 A.2d 1373, 1374 (1987); <em>see also State v. Chase, </em>135 N.H. 209, 215, 600 A.2d 931, 935 (1991) (\u201cWe will not overturn the credibility ruling of the factfinder, who is in the best position to make such a determination . . . .\u201d). The factfinder expressly found the defendants\u2019 expert credible. In so finding, the judge was unable to determine the cause of the degeneration, and, thus, concluded that the plaintiff had failed to meet her burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The plaintiff claims that the judge erred in so ruling because \u201cthe defendant produced no medical expert who opined that her injury was probably caused by a specific non-work trauma.\u201d In other words, according to the plaintiff, once she produced evidence that the injury probably resulted from her work, the burden of proof then shifted to the defendants to prove that it was caused by some non-work related action. The plaintiff, however, confuses the burden of persuasion with the burden of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u201cIt is well established that while the ultimate burden of proof never shifts, the burden of going forward may do so.\u201d <em>Blethen v. Lawrence, </em>116 N.H. 840, 841, 376 A.2d 884, 884 (1976). In order to prove causation, the plaintiff must produce evidence to prove it is more likely than not that her injury was work-related. <em>New Hampshire Supply Co. v. Steinberg, </em>119 N.H. 223, 230, 400 A.2d 1163, 1168 (1979). Assuming that she did this with Dr. Barkan\u2019s testimony, the burden of <em>production </em>then shifted to the defendants to show that the injury probably did not occur at work. The burden of persuasion did not shift to the defendants; thus, at no time were the defendants ever required to prove where or how the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">In this case, the defendants rebutted the plaintiff\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case with Dr. Cusson\u2019s testimony; the evidence was equivocal and the factfinder was unable to determine what caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. Because it was reasonable for the factfinder to be unable to conclude that the injury resulted from her work, the plaintiff has failed to meet her burden of proof. Therefore, the trial court was correct in denying workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b515-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
