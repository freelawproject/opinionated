The defendant alleges that there was a genuine issue of material fact that entitled him to a trial. For the reasons stated, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-19\">The defendant, Andrew Hancock, is the sole shareholder, sole director and president of Baker Valley Lumber, Inc. (Baker Valley), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>New Hampshire corporation which runs a sawmill in Rumney. In the fall of 1988, the plaintiff, John W. O\u2019Connor, agreed to purchase a quantity of bark mulch from Hancock which, it is contended, was to be picked up by O\u2019Connor in 1989. O\u2019Connor made an initial $7,500 deposit by check made out to Hancock personally. Hancock alleged that he endorsed the check and deposited it in the Baker Valley business account.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">O\u2019Connor alleged that he never received the mulch from Baker Valley, and he then sued Hancock for the return of his $7,500 deposit. Hancock, on behalf of Baker Valley, counterclaimed that O\u2019Connor failed to pick up the mulch and that his failure to do so resulted in damages relating to the disposal and resale of the mulch. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted on January 17, 1991. In a memorandum to set aside the decree granting summary judgment to O\u2019Connor, Hancock stipulated that he would \u201cseek no greater damage than to set off the plaintiff\u2019s claim in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">On appeal, Hancock argues that the grant of summary judgment was in error because a genuine issue of material fact exists: namely, whether Hancock was acting as an agent for an undisclosed principal, Baker Valley, and is therefore entitled to assert any defenses Baker Valley could have asserted against O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> A motion for summary judgment may be granted only where no genuine issue of material fact is present, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. RSA 491:8-a, III; <em>Green Mt. Ins. Co. v. Bonney, </em>131 N.H. 762, 766, 561 A.2d 1057, 1059 (1989). The court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Bonney, </em>131 N.H. at 766, 561 A.2d at 1059. Hancock alleged that O\u2019Connor breached his contract with Baker Valley by failing to remove the bark mulch, and that as a result of the breach, Baker Valley incurred damages in an amount that exceeds O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim. Hancock also alleged that he was acting as an agent for Baker Valley, and therefore is entitled to assert the corporation\u2019s defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">It is well-settled that where an individual acts as an agent for an undisclosed principal, the agent [Hancock] may be sued personally on contracts between the principal [Baker Valley] and a third party [O\u2019Connor]. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 186 cmt. b (1958). Thus, since Hancock conceded that he was acting as an agent for an undisclosed principal, Hancock could be sued by O\u2019Connor for return of the deposit on the contract which was deposited into Baker Valley\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>We next consider whether Hancock may assert any defenses which Baker Valley could have asserted against O\u2019Connor. The Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 334 (1958), states that \u201cthe agent has all the defenses which arise out of the transaction itself....\u201d Comment a to \u00a7 334 makes it clear that Hancock is entitled to assert the defenses of Baker Valley against O\u2019Connor in this action, as it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201cDefenses to the action arising out of the transaction itself, such as fraud, misrepresentation, recoupment, breach of condition, non performance . . . are available to the agent</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Baker Valley\u2019s counterclaim against O\u2019Connor arises out of the same transaction giving rise to O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim against Hancock. As such it has been labeled a \u201crecoupment,\u201d <em>Zurback Steel Corp. v. Edgcomb, </em>120 N.H. 42, 44, 411 A.2d 153, 155 (1980). This claim may be asserted by Hancock as a defense to O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim, upon a finding by the trial court, as alleged by Hancock, that he has corporate consent to assert the corporation\u2019s defense. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 333 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The trial court, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for rehearing, found that the defendant \u201cfailed to institute action under Rule 3.9.\u201d District and Municipal Court Rule 3.9 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">\u201cWhenever a third party [Baker Valley] is, or may be, liable to a defendant in any pending action for all or part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against said defendant. . . said defendant <em>may </em>bring an action against said third party. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">(Emphasis added.) Joinder of the corporation, under these facts, is not required under Rule 3.9, since Hancock, as agent, may assert Baker Valley\u2019s defenses, including the recoupment claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">We reverse the summary judgment and remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-12\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
