The director of personnel did not act upon the appellants\u2019 requests for job reclassifications after the legislature enacted a moratorium, which the appellants claim denied them their right to consideration of their requests. Because the appellants\u2019 questions are moot or not ripe for review, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">On May 19, 1989, the appellants submitted a request for reclassification of their positions, pursuant to RSA 21-1:54, III, and the then applicable N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Per 303.04, which provide State employees a procedure for the reclassification of their positions. Effective June 5, 1989, however, Laws 1989, 408:105, I, took effect. This statute, enacted by the legislature in anticipation of a restructuring of the State employee classification system, provided that \u201cthe director of personnel shall not consider any requests for reclassification or reallocation until July 1, 1990.\u201d Laws 1989, 408:105,1. The legislature then enacted another moratorium making it expire on July 1, 1991. Laws 1990, 209:04.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The director of personnel took no action on the appellants\u2019 reclassification request prior to June 5,1989, and on July 24,1990, she informed the appellants that in light of the moratoria she \u201cwill remain unable to review the classification\u201d of the appellants\u2019 positions. The appellants appealed the decision to the personnel appeals board (PAB), which dismissed the appeal in February 1991. The PAB cited the moratorium then in effect until July 1, 1991, and quoted its earlier decision in another case, in which the PAB ordered the director of personnel \u201cto consider the classification of the affected positions . . . as soon as she is lawfully and reasonably able .. ..\u201d The appellants sought reconsideration of the PAB\u2019s dismissal on the grounds that Tancrede\u2019s case was distinguishable from the earlier case. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>PAB disagreed and denied the motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\">The appellants ask this court to determine whether the PAB erred in ruling that the director of personnel, in the words of the appellants, \u201cwas permanently barred from considering the appellants\u2019 request for position reclassification.\u201d Contrary to the appellants\u2019 contention, the record reveals that neither the PAB nor the director of personnel ever considered themselves \u201cpermanently barred\u201d from considering the request. Both the PAB and the director made it clear to the appellants that consideration was barred only as long as the moratoria were in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The appellants argue that the PAB misconstrued or misapplied the moratoria statutes, and rely upon the New Hampshire Constitution, part I, article 23, .which bars the application of retrospective laws. The appellants seek an \u201corder that their classified reviews and upgrade requests go forward, retroactive to May 14, [sic] 1989; with appropriate retroactive pay and benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"> We decline to address the appellants\u2019 request. First, the moratoria statutes have expired, and the PAB ordered the director of personnel \u201cto consider the classification of the affected positions ... as soon as she is lawfully and reasonably able ....\u201d Because the only bar to review by the director that is alleged by the parties is the moratoria, their expiration renders the appellants\u2019 request to construe them moot. Absent any other bar, the appellants are now entitled to a review of their May 19,1989 application. <em>See Durell v. City of Dover, </em>130 N.H. 700, 546 A.2d 1072 (1988) (appeal dismissed for mootness where party entitled to records she sought). Second, the agency has not yet ruled on the appellants\u2019 request. Thus, we cannot tell whether the appellants will be granted any relief, nor whether the agency will act unlawfully. Therefore, the appellants\u2019 remaining claims are not ripe for review. <em>See City of Portsmouth v. Assoc. of Portsmouth Teachers, </em>134 N.H. 642, 650, 597 A.2d 1063, 1068 (1991). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b618-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
