Challenging his conviction, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting an out-of-court photographic identification by the minor victim\u2019s mother, contending that the procedure used was unnecessarily suggestive and violative of due process. Because we uphold the trial court\u2019s finding that the out-of-court identification was not unnecessarily suggestive, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">In July 1989, the victim\u2019s mother informed the Manchester Police Department that the defendant had sexually assaulted her eight-year-old daughter. To confirm the identity of the alleged perpetrator, the police compiled a photographic array containing a 1986 picture of the defendant and photographs of six other men. The defendant was wearing a neck brace and had his eyes closed in the photograph. Although the victim\u2019s mother knew the defendant from prior personal meetings, she stated after viewing the array that the defendant\u2019s photograph looked \u201cmost like\u201d Philbrick, but that she could not be sure that it was his picture. The police then put together a second array, consisting of a photograph of the defendant taken three days prior to the array and pictures of five men different from those in the first array. When shown the second array, both the victim and her mother separately identified the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\"> To sustain his claim, the defendant must first demonstrate that the identification procedures used were \u201cunnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification ....\u201d <em>State v. Fecteau, </em>133 N.H. 860, 867, 587 A.2d 591, 594 (1991) (quotation omitted). We will not overturn the trial court\u2019s finding on this issue unless it is contrary to the weight of the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\"> Review of the two photographs of the defendant sustains the trial court\u2019s finding that the first array photograph bears little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>resemblance to the defendant. The defendant\u2019s photograph in the second array, however, represents an accurate likeness of him at the time of the assault. Significant variance between suspect photographs in successive arrays may support a finding of absence of suggestibility. <em>State v. Rezk, </em>135 N.H. 599, 609 A.2d 391 (1992). We affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress the identification based on the second photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b745-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
