On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the superior court erred in: (1) allowing USF&amp;G to relitigate issues of fact after its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>insured, A&amp;E Forklift Company (A&amp;E), had defaulted in the underlying tort action; (2) allowing USF&amp;G to file an amended motion for summary judgment; and (3) finding that USF&amp;G was not obligated to insure A&amp;E under the relevant insurance policy language. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The record establishes the following facts. Donald Marston was employed by Sandhill Warehouse Wholesale Company (Sandhill). Sandhill had purchased a forklift from A&amp;E that continually leaked hydraulic fluid onto the warehouse floor. On October 6,1982, Marston slipped on the hydraulic fluid while working and sustained serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">A&amp;E maintained a comprehensive general liability insurance policy underwritten by USF&amp;G. The policy did not cover A&amp;E for \u201ccompleted operations hazards,\u201d defined to include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201cbodily injury and property damage arising out of operations . . . but only if the bodily injury or property damage occurs after such operations have been completed or abandoned and occurs away from premises owned by or rented to the Named Insured. \u2018Operations\u2019 include materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith. Operations shall be deemed completed at the earliest of the following times:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">(3) when the portion of the work out of which the injury or damage arises has been put to its intended use by any person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor engaged in performing operations for a principal as a part of the same project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">Operations which may require further service or maintenance work, or correction, repair or replacement because of any defect or deficiency, but which are otherwise completed, shall be deemed completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">This policy was in effect at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">In July 1985, the plaintiffs sued A&amp;E to recover for Donald Marston\u2019s injuries. Several months later, USF&amp;G determined that the injury was not covered under A&amp;E\u2019s insurance policy. Accordingly, USF&amp;G informed all parties that it would not defend A&amp;E in any further proceedings. In response to USF&amp;G\u2019s refusal to defend A&amp;E, the plaintiffs initiated a declaratory judgment action against A&amp;E and USF&amp;G in January 1986 to determine whether A&amp;E was covered under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>USF&amp;G moved for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action, claiming that A&amp;E\u2019s operations were \u201ccompleted\u201d under the \u201ccompleted operations hazards\u201d provision. The Superior Court (Holman, J.) denied this motion in December 1987. It was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">\u201cunable to determine whether [A&amp;E] had a continuing duty to service and maintain the forklift, such as would arise, for example, under an agreement to provide routine service on an ongoing basis, or whether [A&amp;E] merely had an obligation to provide service and maintenance sporadically .... If [A&amp;E] had an ongoing service contract with [Sandhill] for routine maintenance, then its operations would not have been completed within the meaning of the [\u201ccompleted operations hazards\u201d exclusion]____In that situation, the insurer would have an obligation to defend [A&amp;E] in the underlying tort action. If, on the other hand, [A&amp;E] had merely agreed to repair the forklift if and when necessary, then the operation performed by it in this case would be considered as \u2018completed\u2019 for purposes of the policy exclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">In October 1988, after A&amp;E had filed for bankruptcy, A&amp;E\u2019s attorney withdrew from the declaratory judgment and the tort actions. It was advised to obtain new counsel or default. A&amp;E failed to obtain new counsel. Accordingly, it defaulted in both the declaratory judgment action and the tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Having obtained a default order against A&amp;E in the underlying tort action, the plaintiffs filed a motion in limine to preclude USF&amp;G from relitigating issues of fact in the ongoing declaratory judgment action. A&amp;E argued that such issues were \u201calready decided in the underlying [tort] action.\u201d The Superior Court <em>(Goode, </em>J.) denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Next, USF&amp;G filed an amended motion for summary judgment addressing the factual issue that the superior court had been unable to decide in December 1987: \u201cwhether A&amp;E had a continuing duty to service and maintain the forklift.\u201d USF&amp;G attached the affidavit of Edward G. Robinson, a former president of A&amp;E, to its amended motion. According to Mr. Robinson, \u201calthough [A&amp;E] after the sale did perform maintenance work on the subject forklift for [Sandhill], on each occasion necessary maintenance work was completed with no obligation or plans to return and perform further work.\u201d Based on this new information, the Superior Court <em>(Dalianis, </em>J.) granted USF&amp;G\u2019s amended motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs appeal from this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The plaintiffs first contend that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>barred USF&amp;G from litigating in the declaratory judgment action whether A&amp;E\u2019s operations were completed. Under <em>res judicata, </em>\u201ca final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive upon the parties in a subsequent litigation involving-the same cause of action.\u201d <em>Eastern Marine Const. Corp. v. First Southern Leasing, </em>129 N.H. 270, 273, 525 A.2d 709, 711-12 (1987) (citations and quotation omitted); <em>see also Barton v. Barton, </em>125 N.H. 433, 435, 480 A.2d 199, 200 (1984) <em>(res judicata </em>applies to proceedings following default judgments). The term \u201ccause of action\u201d is defined as \u201cthe right to recover, regardless of the theory of recovery.\u201d <em>Eastern Marine Const. Corp., supra </em>at 274, 525 A.2d at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">We hold that the underlying tort action did not involve the same cause of action as the declaratory judgment action from which the plaintiffs now appeal. In the tort action, the court had to determine whether A&amp;E was liable to the plaintiffs for the slipping incident. In the declaratory judgment action, the court had to determine whether the insurance policy underwritten by USF&amp;G entitled A&amp;E to coverage. The declaratory judgment action did not involve A&amp;E\u2019s liability to the plaintiffs and was, therefore, completely independent of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover from A&amp;E for injuries incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred USF&amp;G from litigating the completed operations issue in the declaratory judgment proceeding. We disagree. Collateral estoppel \u201cbars a party to a prior action, or a person in privity with such a party, from relitigating any issue or fact <em>actually litigated </em>and determined in the prior action.\u201d <em>Daigle v. City of Portsmouth, </em>129 N.H. 561, 570, 534 A.2d 689, 693 (1987) (emphasis added). \u201cIn the case of a judgment entered by ... default, none of the issues is actually litigated.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27, comment <em>e </em>at 257 (1980); <em>see also Caouette v. Town of New Ipswich, </em>125 N.H. 547, 557, 484 A.2d 1106, 1113 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the superior court erred in allowing USF&amp;G to file an amended motion for summary judgment. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of New Hampshire law, nothing in the summary judgment statute, RSA 491:8-a, or this court\u2019s summary judgment jurisprudence significantly limits a trial court from allowing a party to submit an amended motion for summary judgment after the original motion has been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The plaintiffs next argue that the \u201ccompleted operations hazards\u201d clause was ambiguous and did not apply to the facts of this case. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>preliminary matter, we must determine whether Massachusetts or New Hampshire law will govern our interpretation of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Our interpretation of insurance policy language is governed by the law of the state that is the \u201c\u2018principal location of the insured risk.\u2019\u201d <em>Glowski v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>134 N.H. 196, 198, 589 A.2d 593, 595 (1991) (quoting <em>Ellis v. Royal Inc. Co., </em>129 N.H. 326, 331, 530 A.2d 303, 306 (1987)); <em>see also Stevens v. Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>135 N.H. 26, 28, 599 A.2d 490, 491 (1991). In this case, Sandhill, Marston\u2019s employer, was located in New Hampshire, and the injury therefore arose in New Hampshire. A&amp;E, however, was located in Ashby, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We find that Massachusetts was the \u201cprincipal location of the insured risk.\u201d The insurance policy was intended to insure A&amp;E, rather than its customers, from liability. Additionally, the \u201ccompleted operations hazards\u201d clause, which precludes coverage when \u201coperations have been completed\u201d and when the injury \u201coccurs away from premises owned by or rented to [A&amp;E],\u201d ensures that in the great majority of instances in which A&amp;E is covered, liability will have arisen in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Under Massachusetts law, the superior court did not err in finding the \u201ccompleted operations hazards\u201d clause to be unambiguous. In 1976, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that an identical provision was not ambiguous. <em>See Ronald Bouchard, Inc. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>369 Mass. 846, 849, 343 N.E.2d 372, 374 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Nor did the superior court err in applying the \u201ccompleted operations hazards\u201d clause to the facts in this case. The plaintiffs argue that A&amp;E\u2019s operations were not completed at the time of the injury because the forklift was defective and A&amp;E had a continuing duty to maintain the forklift. The superior court disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">\u201cViewed in the light most favorable to Mr. Marston, the Court finds that A&amp;E Forklift did not have a continuing duty to maintain the forklift because the \u2018operation\u2019 as defined in the policy had at the time of injury, been completed. Mr. Robinson in his affidavit states that A&amp;E Forklift did not agree to provide maintenance on an ongoing basis to Sandhill Warehouse Wholesale after it sold the forklift, that it had no maintenance contract with it, and that when it completed the necessary maintenance work it had no obligation to perform additional work. Mr. Robinson\u2019s position is sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ported by the definition of the term \u2018completed operations hazard,\u2019 which provides that operations that require maintenance work because of a defect but which are otherwise completed are deemed to be completed. The operation was completed when the forklift was put into operation in its intended use, shortly after delivery to Sandhill Warehouse Wholesale and before the date of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-3\">Mr. Marston does not dispute that no maintenance contract existed; nor does he dispute that from August 1, 1982 until October 6, 1982, the date of the accident, the forklift had been put to its intended use. According to discovery documents, Mr. Marston responded to an interrogatory that he and others plugged the forklift into a charger every night so it would be charged and ready to use the next day. He stated in response to other interrogatories that the forklift was used to unload and put away stock, and that he did not claim that the forklift was inadequate for its normal purpose^] or uses. Since the forklift had been put to its intended use before the accident occurred, the operation was completed as so defined in the insurance policy. Because completed operations hazards were expressly excluded from coverage, the Court finds that USF&amp;G does not have a duty to defend A&amp;E Forklift in the underlying action or to indemnify it for any judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">We agree with the superior court. Its interpretation of the \u201ccompleted operations hazards\u201d clause is consistent with the plain meaning of the provision\u2019s language.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b726-6\">BROCK, C.J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
