The defendant was sentenced to twelve months in the house of correction with three months suspended, and two years of probation. The defendant filed a motion to set aside the verdict and order a new trial after the jury returned a verdict. The motion was denied. The defendant appeals, alleging that the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial on the ground that the court\u2019s several instructions to the jury were improper and thus denied him a fair trial. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">At the conclusion of the evidence and arguments, the court instructed the jury regarding the crime of sexual assault as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">\u201cThe definition of the crime of sexual assault has three parts. The State must prove each part of the definition beyond a reasonable doubt. First, the State must prove that the defendant had sexual contact with another person. . . . The second element that the State must prove is that the defendant overcame the other person through the actual application of physical force; and the third element is that the defendant acted purposely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The court went on to instruct the jury on the issue of consent. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">\u201cEvidence has been presented that there was consent to the acts of the defendant which constitute the crime of sexual assault. Consent to the acts of the defendant is a complete defense to the crime of sexual assault. The defendant is not required to prove consent. Instead, the State must prove that there was no consent. Therefore, you must decide whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no consent. If you decide that the State has not proven that there was no consent, then you must find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>defendant not guilty. If, however, you decide that the State has proven lack of consent and the other parts of the definition of the crime of sexual assault which I just gave to you, then you may find the defendant guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The defendant did not object to the initial charge to the jury, and on appeal the defendant concedes that the charge was \u201cadequate because the trial court instructed the jury separately that consent had to be disproven beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, this part of the charge was not erroneous ....\u201d After two hours of deliberation, the jury submitted the following question to the court: \u201cWhat are the elements involved in the charge of sexual assault, 1) 2) 3)?\u201d The court\u2019s written reply to that question did not include lack of consent as an element, but counsel for the defendant, who was shown the reply before it was submitted to the jury, did not at first object.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Ten minutes after the written instruction was given to the jury, defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the supplementary instruction because it failed to include lack of consent as an <em>element </em>of the offense. The court then recessed until the next day. After an unrecorded conference in chambers, the trial judge delivered a new instruction to the jury that included lack of consent as an element of the crime of sexual assault, and instructed the jury to disregard the previous day\u2019s supplemental instructions. However, before the new replacement instruction was delivered the following morning, the defendant moved for a mistrial, on the basis that approximately one-half hour of jury deliberation had occurred the previous day after an erroneous jury instruction, and that the defendant thus had been denied the right to a fair trial. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">We find that the defendant preserved the issue of an improper jury instruction, after the jury\u2019s question, by objecting to the court\u2019s instruction in a timely manner. <em>See State v. Niquette, </em>122 N.H. 870, 873, 451 A.2d 1292, 1294 (1982). The defendant objected ten minutes after the instruction was given to the jury, and before the jury had reached a verdict. There was thus ample opportunity to cure the alleged error, <em>see id., </em>and the trial court did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court should have declared a mistrial because the jury deliberated for approximately one-half hour after being given an improper supplemental instruction, and before a new, and proper, instruction was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">We turn first to whether consent is an element of the offense. The legislature has chosen to define \u201cconsent\u201d separately and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>make it an element of sexual assault, RSA 632-A:4. RSA 626:6 and :7, read together, have the effect of shifting the burden of proving a lack of consent to the State once the defendant raises the defense of consent. RSA 626:6 states that \u201c[t]he consent of the victim to conduct constituting an offense is a defense if such consent negatives an element of the offense or precludes the harm sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.\u201d In this case, put simply, if the victim had consented to the defendant\u2019s sexual advances, rather than having been overcome by the defendant\u2019s application of physical force, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2,1, the defendant would not be guilty of the misdemeanor of sexual assault. RSA 632-A:4. As to the burden of proof, RSA 626:7 states that where evidence of a defense is admitted, such as consent, \u201cthe state must disprove such defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d RSA 626:7, 1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">The definition of \u201celement of an offense,\u201d as set forth in RSA 625:11, III, can not be read to include the defense of consent. Subparagraph (c) of RSA 625:11, III, refers to conduct which \u201cnegatives an excuse or justification for such conduct.\u201d Consent is not an excuse or justification. To plead a justification, a defendant must \u201c[admit] the substance of the allegation but [point] to facts that excuse, exonerate or justify his actions. . . .\u201d <em>State v. Bruneau, </em>131 N.H. 104, 117, 552 A.2d 585, 594 (1988) (quoting <em>State v. Guaraldi, </em>124 N.H. 93, 97, 467 A.2d 233, 235 (1983)). Here, the defendant did not admit the substance of the allegation. He did not concede that he overcame the victim through physical force, the second element of sexual assault. In fact, had he done so, he would have negated his defense of consent. Therefore, because consent is not a justification, lack of consent is not an \u201celement\u201d under RSA 625:11, III(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">We agree with the trial court that lack of consent is an appropriate addition to its answer to the jury\u2019s question, regardless of its classification as an \u201celement of the offense\u201d or a \u201cdefense\u201d to the charge. Upon the defendant\u2019s objection, the court recognized this, and added consent. <em>State v. Feole, </em>121 N.H. 164, 169, 427 A.2d 43, 46 (1981) (errors in instructions to the jury may be cured and become immaterial where promptly cured by the court). The critical part of the instruction regarding consent is that the State has the burden of disproving it. Both the court\u2019s initial jury instruction, and, most importantly, its final instruction to the jury, correctly explained the defense of consent and the State\u2019s burden of proving lack of consent. Nothing in the court\u2019s first supplemental instruction was improper; it was directly responsive to the question asked. We believe the jury was able to understand and apply the court\u2019s directive which came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the following day to disregard its initial supplementary instruction. <em>State v. LaVerne, </em>83 N.H. 419, 421, 143 A. 594, 596 (1928) (\u201cIn absence of evidence to the contrary it is presumed that instructions are followed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In summary, we hold that the defendant was not prejudiced by the supplemental instruction and therefore was not entitled to a mistrial. The final supplemental instruction improperly treated the lack of consent as an element of the offense, but properly required the State to prove lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt and was therefore adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
