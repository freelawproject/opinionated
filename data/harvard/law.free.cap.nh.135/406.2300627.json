For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Teichman, a police officer for the Town of Hudson, was directing traffic on November 8, 1983, when he was struck by an automobile operated by Leonard Budd. Budd had been following a vehicle operated by Gabriele Dollet. When Dollet stopped her vehicle, Budd passed Dollet\u2019s vehicle and hit Teichman.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Teichman sued both Budd and Dollet, each of whom had liability coverage under their respective automobile policies of $50,000. Budd\u2019s insurance carrier agreed to settle for its policy limit, but the carrier became insolvent before payment was made. Teichman\u2019s case against Dollet is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">At the time of the accident, Teichman was insured under a family automobile policy issued by Liberty Mutual, which contained an uninsured motorist endorsement in the amount of $100,000. As a result of the accident, Teichman collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Fireman\u2019s Fund in the amount of $55,080.53. The effect of these payments on Teichman\u2019s total recovery is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Teichman\u2019s claim against Liberty Mutual under the uninsured motorist provision was arbitrated on August 21, 1989. The arbitrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>awarded Teichman the full amount of uninsured motorist coverage under the policy, <em>i.e., </em>$100,000, less whatever credit might be received from the resolution of the Dollet case. At a subsequent hearing concerning taxation of costs, the trial court ruled that \u201cLiberty is ordered to pay $50,000.00 immediately and an additional $50,000.00 less the operative credit at the time of the resolution of the claim against Dollet. Said sums being subject to a lien by the [insured\u2019s] worker\u2019s compensation carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\">Liberty Mutual has tendered a check in the amount of $50,000 made payable jointly to Teichman and Fireman\u2019s Fund. Teichman, however, rejected the attempted payment, maintaining that Fireman\u2019s Fund does not have a lien on the proceeds and, therefore, that the check should have been payable to him alone. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Teichman first argues that Fireman\u2019s Fund does not have a valid lien on the benefits of his uninsured motorist coverage, because the 1985 amendment to RSA 281:14, I (currently codified at RSA 281-A:13 (Supp. 1991)), which expressly permits a lien against uninsured motorist proceeds, cannot be applied retrospectively to an accident that occurred in 1983. The defendant contends that the 1983 statute permitted this lien. We need not consider the defendant\u2019s response, however, because we hold that application of the 1985 amendment is not retrospective.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We have previously discussed the nature of a workers\u2019 compensation carrier\u2019s lien on damages recovered by an injured employee and the operative event which triggers its application. In <em>Lakin v. Daniel Marr &amp; Son Co., </em>126 N.H. 730, 495 A.2d 1299 (1985) we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">\u201cThe lien does not attach to a mere right of action against a third party, or even to a third-party judgment. It is a lien on \u2018the amount of damages recovered\u2019 in the third-party action. RSA 281:14, I (Supp. 1983). It does not apply until the injured plaintiff actually receives damages to which he has been adjudged entitled. Thus, until the verdict is about to be paid there is nothing due to the carrier, and nothing that could be withheld and upon which interest could run.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 733, 495 A.2d at 1302; <em>see also Moores v. Greenberg, </em>834 F.2d 1105, 1113 (1st Cir. 1987) (lien had no life of its own and \u201cdied of natural causes\u201d when third parties were exonerated). Because the lien has no vitality unless and until damages are actually recovered, the statute in effect on the date of the recovery of those damages should govern the lien\u2019s validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>In this case, the operative statute, RSA 281:14,1, permits the attachment of a lien to \u201cthe amount of damages or benefits recovered\u201d under \u201ca contractual obligation to pay benefits under the uninsured motorist provisions of any motor vehicle policy.\u201d Based on the principle \u201cthat the injured work[er] should not be allowed to keep the entire amount of both his [or her] compensation award and his [or her] common law recovery which would amount to a double recovery,\u201d <em>Bilodeau v. Oliver Stores, Inc., </em>116 N.H. 83, 87, 352 A.2d 741, 744 (1976) (citation omitted), we hold that Fireman\u2019s Fund, which provided workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Teichman, has a statutory lien on Teichman\u2019s uninsured motorist recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"> Teichman also raises the following question in his notice of appeal: \u201cGiven the judgement [sic] against Budd in an amount equal to the [uninsured motorist] coverage does Liberty Mutual retain the right of consent to settlement of the case against Dollet?\u201d In its order of April 4,1990, the trial court did not resolve this issue. Consequently, it is not ripe for appellate review. <em>See N.H. Munic. Trust Workers\u2019 Comp. Fund v. Flynn, Comm\u2019r, </em>133 N.H. 17, 26, 573 A.2d 439, 445 (1990). We also note that Teichman\u2019s \u201cdiscussion\u201d of this issue in his brief and at oral argument actually addressed whether he had to resolve the case against Dollet before receiving the full $100,000 from Liberty Mutual. However, Teichman failed to raise this issue in his notice of appeal and, therefore, we will not consider it. <em>Dombrowski v. Dombrowski, </em>131 N.H. 654, 662, 559 A.2d 828, 833 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
