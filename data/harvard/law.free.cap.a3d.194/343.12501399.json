On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in (1) dismissing the complaint; (2) concluding that the plaintiff lacked standing to assert his claim of fraud; and (3) denying the plaintiff's motion for reargument. The defendant claims that the action was not ripe because the underlying conviction had not been vacated. We affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are pertinent to our decision. In a previous criminal case, the plaintiff pleaded guilty to murder under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on September 12, 2001, and was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the following years, he has brought at least twelve petitions seeking posttrial relief and has included as grounds\n   for the relief claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant was appointed to represent the plaintiff in one of the habeas\n   proceedings; the representation occurred between February 16, 2011, and January 28, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In his present complaint alleging legal malpractice, dated April 18, 2016, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant provided deficient representation and used the plaintiff's name and circumstance to commit fraud against the state. On June 8, 2016, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the plaintiff's claims were barred by statutory immunity. At oral argument on the motion, the defendant claimed additionally that the plaintiff lacked standing to claim that the defendant had defrauded the state. After oral argument, the court granted the motion to dismiss, concluding that the defendant was entitled to statutory immunity as to the plaintiff's legal malpractice claim. The court also addressed the plaintiff's claim that the defendant committed fraud against the state, and concluded that the plaintiff did not have standing to pursue that claim. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We begin with generally applicable legal principles. \"[In reviewing] the trial court's decision to grant a motion to dismiss, we take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader....

Despite multiple attempts, the plaintiff has not invalidated his conviction, and, at the time of argument before this court, at least one habeas action alleging that the defendant provided ineffective assistance as habeas counsel was pending.

A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.

The habeas court concluded from the complaint that any fraud the defendant may have committed was against the state, not the plaintiff. The plaintiff argues that this conclusion is incorrect because the defendant used \"the plaintiff's case and name to commit a criminal act, forcing him to become an unwitting and unwilling participant,\"\n   such that injury to him was distinct from injury to the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Standing is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented.... These two objectives are ordinarily held to have been met when a complainant makes a colorable claim of direct injury he has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity. Such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy ... provides the requisite assurance of concrete adverseness and diligent advocacy.... The requirement of directness between the injuries claimed by the plaintiff and the conduct of the defendant also is expressed, in our standing jurisprudence, by the focus on whether the plaintiff is the proper party to assert the claim at issue....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Two broad yet distinct categories of aggrievement exist, classical and statutory.... Classical aggrievement requires a two part showing. First, a party\n   must demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the [controversy], as opposed to a general interest that all members of the community share.... Second, the party must also show that the [alleged conduct] has specially and injuriously affected that specific personal or legal interest....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Statutory aggrievement exists by legislative fiat, not by judicial analysis of the particular facts of the case.

One difficulty with his position is that the injury, a necessary element in a tort action, is the conviction. To prove his malpractice action, he presumably would have to prove that he would not have sustained the injury had professional negligence not occurred. Thus, a successful result in this case would necessarily imply that the conviction was improper. Inconsistency of judgments is avoided by the requirement that the conviction first be vacated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Put differently, a court could not provide practical relief in the current posture. If the malpractice action were to be pursued, recovery for the injury would be barred as a collateral attack on a judgment. The action would be hypothetical, and thus nonjusticiable.
