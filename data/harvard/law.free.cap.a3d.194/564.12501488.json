One such exception to the warrant requirement is the \"emergency aid exception,\" which this Court has characterized as belonging to a broader group of exceptions justified by the \"community caretaking doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Pursuant to the community caretaking doctrine, certain warrantless actions of police officers do not offend constitutional principles because they are motivated by a \"desire to render aid or assistance, rather than the investigation of criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12354382\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/609/#p627\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12354382\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/609/#p627\">\n    at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this discretionary appeal, we consider whether a police officer who properly entered a residence to render emergency aid could, after the emergency had passed, thereafter reenter the dwelling to perform administrative tasks in follow-up to the emergency entrance. For the following reasons, we conclude that the emergency aid exception did not permit reentry after the emergency had dissipated\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 27, 2013, while on foot patrol in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State Troopers Smolleck and Shoap (the \"Troopers\") observed a number of people on the roof of a sorority house's porch. N.T., 7/6/2015, at 7. One of these people, a young man, appeared to be visibly intoxicated and unsteadily stumbling around on the roof.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The Troopers feared that this individual would fall off the roof and injure himself, and so they approached the front door and sought permission to enter, but the occupants refused their requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10. Trooper Shoap tried, unsuccessfully, to kick the door open, and those inside laughed at his inability\n   to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. He then kicked through the window next to the door and reached in and unlocked it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The Troopers called fire, EMS, and the Shippensburg Borough Police to the scene to assist in the matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. To gain access to the roof on the second floor, the Troopers removed an air conditioning unit from a window, potentially damaging it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. By the time the Troopers gained access to the roof, the young man had fallen and was being treated by first responders on the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As the Troopers exited the house, Trooper Smolleck saw a bag of marijuana and a marijuana grinder on a coffee table, which he seized and took to his patrol vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Trooper Smolleck testified that he then reentered the sorority house to obtain information to complete a report that he intended to file regarding the broken window and air conditioner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Upon reentry, he knocked on a closed bedroom door.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The door opened, and Appellant Ashley Wilmer (\"Wilmer\") raised her hand when Trooper Smolleck asked the six young women inside if any of them were residents of the house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. While Wilmer was providing Trooper Smolleck with her name and other requested information, he observed a glass marijuana bong and a pipe sitting in plain view on a nightstand next to Wilmer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Wilmer admitted that the items belonged to her and she was subsequently charged with one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 15, 2015, Wilmer filed a motion to suppress the evidence, challenging the lawfulness of the Troopers' initial entry and Trooper Smolleck's reentry into the sorority house without consent, a warrant, or probable cause and exigent circumstances. Following the hearing, the trial court denied Wilmer's motion to suppress. N.T., 7/6/2015, at 35. In its subsequent written opinion pursuant to Rule 1925(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, the trial court concluded that the Troopers' original entry was justified by their \"good faith belief that the young man was in imminent danger of injury or death[,]\" and that Trooper Smolleck's reentry into the home was justified by \"the exigent circumstances that gave rise to the original entry.\" Trial Court Opinion, 4/19/2016, at 4. The trial court further reasoned that because the damage was caused in the course of the initial entry, a second entry was needed \"to establish the identity of the residents of the house to file an incident report.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because Trooper Smolleck was lawfully present in the residence when he observed the drug paraphernalia in plain view, the trial court determined that the evidence was not subject to suppression.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On February 16, 2016, Wilmer's case proceeded to a stipulated nonjury trial, at which the trial court found Wilmer guilty and sentenced her to pay the costs of prosecution and a fifty dollar fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal to the Superior Court, Wilmer again challenged the legality of both the Troopers' initial entry and Trooper Smolleck's reentry into the house. Concerning the initial entry, Wilmer asserted \"there was no evidence that the [intoxicated] individual actually needed emergency aid or that he requested assistance from the Troopers.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Super. Dec. 5, 2016) (unpublished memorandum). The Superior Court rejected this argument, stating that \"police will be excused from compliance with the warrant and probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment ... when the police\n   reasonably believe that someone within a residence is in need of immediate aid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207048810\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 5-6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Super. 2013) ). The panel concluded that \"[i]n light of the totality of the circumstances, [the initial] police entry to the sorority house was reasonable under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With respect to Trooper Smolleck's reentry of the sorority house, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court's denial of suppression on the grounds that it was \"entirely reasonable\" for Trooper Smolleck to reenter to obtain information for his incident report and because Trooper Smolleck's reentry was \"merely part of one continuous episode, initially justified by exigent circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The Superior Court explained that \"when police are properly authorized to enter a dwelling under the exigent circumstances doctrine,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   they are also authorized to return to complete the necessary paperwork required by the emergency situation that allowed them to enter the building in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Superior Court further stated that \"there is no ... rule that prohibits an officer, legitimately on the premises, from returning to the residence to perform the police functions which are then immediately justified and required.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the court observed that as to the reentry, \"[t]here was no unwarranted delay in time, nor was there any purposeful search,\" but rather, \"[t]he items taken into the custody of police were in plain view as the trooper completed his report.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We granted allowance of appeal solely to consider the legality of Trooper Smolleck's reentry into the residence\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   after the emergency that supported the Troopers' initial entry had dissipated.

It found that while the emergency created by the shooting provided justification \"for what would be otherwise illegal\" (i.e., the first search), it did not justify an open-ended exhaustive search of Mincey's apartment without a warrant for evidence. Instead, the Court made clear that a warrantless intrusion pursuant to the emergency aid exception must be commensurate with, and limited to, the perceived need to provide immediate assistance. Specifically, the Court held that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   a warrantless search must be\n   <strong>\n    \"strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation\n   </strong>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

All the persons in Mincey's apartment had been located before the investigating homicide officers arrived there and began their search. And a four-day search that included opening dresser drawers and ripping up carpets can hardly be rationalized in terms of the legitimate concerns that justify an emergency search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 393,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180644\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/385/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In determining whether Trooper Smolleck's reentry into the sorority house was \"strictly circumscribed\" by the nature of the emergency justifying his initial entry, we turn first to Professor Wayne LaFave's treatise on search and seizure law, in which he offers the following useful explanation of this phrase:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A warrantless search must be strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation.

The evidence established that the Troopers observed a visibly intoxicated young man stumbling around on the roof, and they reasonably believed that he was in danger of falling. Upon gaining access to the roof, however, the Troopers learned that the young man had fallen and was being treated by first responders on the ground.

We summarized the relevant law in this area as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Firemen have the right to enter a private residence without a warrant without violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, if done so for the purpose of extinguishing a fire. While performing the task, firemen may seize any evidence, which is in plain view, of the cause and origin of the fire. In fighting the fire, fire officials are also immediately charged with determining the cause and origin of the fire. The purposes of the investigation into the cause and origin of the fire may properly include prevention of the rekindling of the fire, and prevention of the destruction of evidence, either accidentally or intentionally. When the search is conducted for one of these purposes, no search warrant is necessary, even if consent has not been granted, but only if the search is a continuation of an initial entry. If the nonconsenting, warrantless entry is begun, but must be terminated due to the condition of the building, then that search may be continued at the first instance reentry is possible. Finally, if it is clearly shown that the search is not for the\n   purpose of determining the cause and origin of the fire, but rather to obtain evidence of criminal activity, then such search must either be with consent or with a valid search warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 801.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As is evident from a review of the cases relied upon by the Superior Court in the case before us, they are readily distinguishable.\n   <em>\n    Witman\n   </em>\n   did not involve any application of the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement. Moreover, while the police did enter and reenter the home during the course of their investigation, the intermediate appellate court approved the entry and reentry based upon the initial implied consent of Witman and thereafter based upon the express consent of his mother and father. Likewise, while\n   <em>\n    Tyler\n   </em>\n   permits the reentry of premises after the emergency has dissipated (i.e., after the fire has been extinguished), it did so based upon a fire official's duty to determine the cause of a fire, and the urgency to do so quickly before the evidence dissipates, concluding that this justifies the lack of any requirement that they stop to obtain a warrant before doing so.\n   <em>\n    Tyler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490288\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/499/\">\n    436 U.S. at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490288\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/499/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Firefighters in such circumstances are not engaged in administrative housekeeping activities, but are instead performing their charged duty of determining the cause and origin of the fire to which they responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As such, these cases do not establish any constitutional basis for Trooper Smolleck to reenter the sorority house. We likewise reject the Commonwealth's attempt to justify Trooper Smolleck's reentry by way of analogy to an inventory search of an impounded vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 44. Inventory searches, the Commonwealth states, are performed to protect both the property owners from disappearances of personal property in the vehicle while it is impounded and the police from claims of lost or stolen property while the vehicle is in police possession.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490288\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/499/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 45 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lagenella\n   </em>\n   , 83 A.3d at 102-03 ). According to the Commonwealth,\n   <em>\n    Lagenella\n   </em>\n   \"recognizes the importance of police recordkeeping (a community caretaking action) for potential property claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We reject any suggestion that the need for accurate police recordkeeping in connection with potential property claims justifies the entry into a private residence. Warrantless inventory searches are permitted because a private citizen's property is temporarily in the possession of the police, a circumstance that generates legitimate concerns by both parties. No similar concerns arise in the present context, however, as the police did not seize the sorority house. Instead, the Troopers merely temporarily invaded the private dwelling to obviate an emergency situation, and the accuracy of police recordkeeping in this circumstance is of no constitutional moment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As our above analysis reflects, once the emergency that permitted the Troopers' initial entry ceased, their right of entry in the sorority house under the emergency aid exception also ceased.

The Majority foregoes the\n   <em>\n    Livingstone\n   </em>\n   evaluation of further police action under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and substitutes a requirement that \"once the emergency that permitted the Troopers' initial entry ceased, their right of entry ... under the emergency aid exception also ceased.\" Majority Op. at 575. Therefore, according to the Majority, the Troopers \"must\n   <strong>\n    leave the residence\n   </strong>\n   unless some other exception to the warrant requirement permits their continued presence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 572 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In so holding, the Majority has created a new requirement that the moment the emergency is abated, any police presence must independently satisfy a separate Fourth Amendment exception, or they must leave the premises. The Majority invokes this rule even where the police presence is a continuation of an entry pursuant to the emergency aid exception in\n   order to complete an incident report for property damage, and not for investigatory purposes. Because I cannot agree with the Majority's alteration of this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Livingstone\n   </em>\n   , I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the instant matter, the Troopers' exit from the sorority house to obtain their incident report form, and subsequent reentry to complete it, was deemed a lawful reentry by the trial court, and ultimately an unlawful reentry by the Majority. However, I agree with the Superior Court that these were not two separate warrantless entries, but rather it was one continuous episode under the emergency aid exception of the community caretaking doctrine. Critical to this conclusion is the fact that the officers were not entering for investigative purposes but only to conclude the lawful warrantless entry, which resulted in damaged property. The cases cited by the Majority to support the termination of a lawful police presence all hold that the end of the presence related to the emergency aid, and the start of a separate investigation into criminal activity, is the point at which the officers are no longer lawfully present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mincey v.

In each of the aforementioned cases relied on by the Majority, officers may have entered and exited the premises numerous times in order to complete their duty pursuant to the emergency aid exception, but the fact of the each ingress and egress from the property has never been the focus of the analysis. The focus and analysis in those cases concern when the officers cease providing emergency aid and shift to investigating a crime. Conversely, the Majority's analysis here does not focus on the troopers' conduct in attempting to complete an incident report related to their lawful entry, nor analyze whether this was the beginning of a separate investigation for criminal activity as is the required threshold question. Instead, the Majority's focus is limited to the two separate entries, but creates a rule that will apply to circumstances with only one entry followed by a continued police presence. The Majority opinion seems to suggest that had the Troopers' not left at the point in time that they determined the visibly intoxicated young man on the roof had fallen to the ground, any further presence in the sorority house would also have been unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. at 572, 575. This rule precludes any follow up related to the circumstances of the entry to aid in an emergency. As written, this rule allows police officers to lawfully break windows or doors in furtherance of emergency aid, but requires them to immediately leave once the emergency has ended without properly documenting the damage and ascertaining the owner of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Further, contrary to the Majority's assertion, I do not suggest that a \"gathering information to complete paperwork\" exception\n   to the Fourth Amendment exists. Majority Op. at 576, n. 16. Rather, I believe the troopers' presence to complete an incident report directly related to the property damage caused is encompassed in the entry pursuant to the emergency aid exception. To require an immediate exit preventing all matters of follow up oversimplifies real life factual scenarios. However, I recognize that if the troopers were reentering to engage in an investigation, they would be required to satisfy a separate Fourth Amendment exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Accordingly, I would affirm based on the well-reasoned analysis of the Superior Court. The Troopers were lawfully present pursuant to the emergency aid exception, and \"the police may seize any evidence that is in plain view during the course of their legitimate emergency activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Mincey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180644\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/385/\">\n    437 U.S. at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180644\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/385/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.
