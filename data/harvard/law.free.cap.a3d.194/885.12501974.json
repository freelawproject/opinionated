Palosz (decedent), which stems from the decedent's tragic suicide. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly concluded, as a matter of law, that it is not entitled to sovereign immunity from the plaintiffs' wrongful death claim, in which the plaintiffs allege, in part, that the defendant's employees failed to comply with the antibullying policy that the defendant developed and implemented pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 10-222d, as amended by Public Acts 2011, No. 11-232, \u00a7 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In count one of the operative amended complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (complaint), the plaintiffs allege the following relevant facts. The defendant serves as the agent of the town of Greenwich to maintain control of all of the public schools in Greenwich, which include Western Middle School and Greenwich High School. On August 27, 2013, after being subjected to unremitting bullying for several\n   years in the Greenwich public school system, the decedent died by suicide on the first day of his sophomore year at Greenwich High School. At the time of his death, the decedent was fifteen years old and had been a student enrolled in the Greenwich public school system for seven years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Throughout those years, the defendant was mandated by \u00a7 10-222d to develop and implement a safe school climate plan to address the existence of bullying in the Greenwich public school system. In compliance with this statutory mandate, the defendant adopted the \"Whole Student Development Policy\" (policy) in April, 2009, which later was strengthened in July,\n   2012. The policy requires that the defendant appoint administrators and specialists who are responsible for the development and implementation of the policy. The policy further mandates an employee who has knowledge of a bullying incident to notify, by an oral report, the specialist or another school administrator within one school day and to file a written report not later than two school days after such verbal notification. Upon receipt of a report, the policy requires the specialist to investigate, or to supervise the investigation of, the bullying incident. If the acts of bullying are verified, the policy requires the specialist or designee to develop a student safety plan to protect against further bullying, to notify the parents of the students involved not later than forty-eight hours following the completion of the investigation, and to invite the parents to a meeting to discuss the measures being taken to intervene. If there are repeated instances of bullying against a single individual, the policy requires the development of a specific written intervention plan. Moreover, the policy mandates that any students who engage in bullying behavior be subject to school discipline. In addition to the written policy provisions, the defendant has oral policies and\n   procedures that require school employees to intervene to protect students from being bullied repeatedly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the time in which the policy was effective, the decedent was subjected to severe and continual verbal and physical bullying by his fellow classmates. Greenwich school employees, including supervisory employees, were \"long aware\" that the decedent was being subjected to such bullying. Despite being aware of said bullying, the defendant's administrators, and supervisory personnel, and other school employees\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not comply with the mandatory provisions of the policy in that they failed to: report the repeated instances of bullying to the specialist or other school administrator orally and/or in writing within the required timeframes; investigate the repeated incidents of bullying; notify the parents of the findings of any such investigation; meet with the parents to communicate appropriate remedial measures being taken by the school to ensure the decedent's safety and to prevent further acts of bullying; develop a student safety support plan in response to all verified acts of bullying with safety measures to protect against further acts of bullying; develop a specific written intervention plan to address the repeated instances of bullying; direct appropriate discipline to the student or students who bullied the decedent; and properly oversee and implement the provisions of the policies and procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs further allege that the defendant and its administrators, supervisory personnel, and other school employees, in failing to comply with the policy requirements, engaged in \"gross, reckless, wilful or wanton misconduct,\" which was a substantial factor in causing the decedent's death by suicide. On the basis of the\n   foregoing, the plaintiffs allege that the defendant is liable, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the wrongful death of the decedent and for the related damages caused by the defendant and its\n   administrators, supervisory personnel, and other school employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 6, 2016, the defendant filed a motion to strike the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant argued, in relevant part, that it is entitled to sovereign immunity because it was acting as an agent of the state when it allegedly \"failed to carry out its state mandated duties under the antibullying statute ... \u00a7 10-222d et seq.\" Following a hearing, the court issued a memorandum of decision, dated March 21, 2017, denying the defendant's motion to strike. The court held that the defendant is not entitled to sovereign immunity because it was acting on behalf of the municipality, as opposed to the state, when it failed to comply with the policy. The court also held that there is no sovereign immunity protection for the defendant and its employees when their actions or omissions constitute gross, reckless, wilful, or wanton misconduct because the qualified immunity provided to them by General Statutes \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   specifically limits\n   sovereign immunity in that regard. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review and legal principles that govern our resolution of this appeal.

Thus, the defendant argues that it was acting as an agent of the state when it failed to comply with the policy adopted pursuant to \u00a7 10-222d.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant also contends that\n   the qualified statutory immunity\n   specifically provided by \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   does not waive sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 10-222d (b) provides in relevant part: \"Each local and regional board of education shall develop and implement a safe school climate plan to address the existence of bullying in its schools....\" Subsection (b) mandates that each plan \"shall\" contain certain particularized requirements, each of which is designated in subdivisions (1) through (17). These requirements, generally, enable the reporting of instances of\n   bullying, mandate school officials to forward and investigate these reports to a specialist, who would then notify the parents of the students, and direct the adoption of a comprehensive prevention and intervention strategy. Section 10-222d (c) provides in relevant part: \"[E]ach local and regional board of education shall approve the safe school climate plan developed pursuant to this section and submit such plan to the Department of Education....\" Section 10-222d (d) compels each board of education to require each school in the district to complete and submit an assessment of its policy to the\n   Department of Education pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-222h.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiffs do not dispute that a local board of education acts as an agent of the state when it develops and implements a policy, submits the policy to the Department of Education, or mandates that each school submit an assessment to the Department of Education, pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 10-222d. The plaintiffs do not claim that the defendant failed to comply with any of these requirements. In fact, the plaintiffs specifically allege that the defendant complied with the development and implementation mandates of \u00a7 10-222d.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the gravamen of the plaintiffs' complaint is their allegation that the wrongful death of the decedent was caused by the defendant because its employees failed to comply with\n   <em>\n    the terms of the policy\n   </em>\n   that it had developed and implemented pursuant to \u00a7 10-222d. The narrow issue presented, therefore, is whether the defendant was acting as an agent of the state when its employees allegedly failed to comply with the terms of the\n   policy that the defendant adopted in accordance with \u00a7 10-222d. We conclude that it was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The state action mandated by \u00a7 10-222d begins and ends with the development, implementation, submission, and assessment of the policy. Holding the defendant liable for its employees' alleged tortious conduct in failing to execute properly the terms of the policy it developed and implemented, however, does not operate to control or interfere with the activities of the state. Rather, the defendant acts as an agent of the municipality when it enforces and complies with the policy pursuant to its general powers of control over public schools, which is explicitly delegated to a local board of education through the municipality pursuant to \u00a7 10-240. Section 10-240 provides: \"Each town shall through its board of education maintain the control of all the public schools within its limits and for this purpose shall be a school district and shall have all the powers and duties of school districts, except so far as such powers and duties are inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.\" It is pursuant to this broad mandate of control, and not through \u00a7 10-222d, that a board of education polices the behavior of its students and, accordingly, enforces and complies with the policy. When the delegations of \u00a7\u00a7 10-222d and 10-240 are read together, it becomes apparent that the mandate of \u00a7 10-222d does not go so far as to encroach upon the general powers of control delegated to the towns by \u00a7 10-240. Therefore, we conclude that the defendant was acting as an agent of the municipality, and not the state, when its employees allegedly failed to comply with the policy it had adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Additionally, the defendant's position that it is entitled to sovereign immunity is undercut by the qualified statutory immunity specifically provided by \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   to a local board of education for actions taken in connection with a policy developed and implemented pursuant to \u00a7 10-222d. In particular, \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (c) provides in relevant part: \"No claim for damages shall be made against a local or regional board of education that implements the safe school climate plan, described in Section 10-222d, and reports, investigates and responds to bullying ... if such local or regional board of education was acting in good faith in the\n   discharge of its duties. The immunity provided in this subsection does not apply to acts or omissions constituting gross, reckless, wilful or wanton misconduct.\" Section 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   was adopted in 2011, nine years after \u00a7 10-222d was first enacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The qualified statutory immunity provided by \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   is irreconcilable with the complete protection from suit afforded by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and contradictory to the presumption of legislative uniformity. As outlined previously in this opinion, \"[t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity protects the state, not only from ultimate liability for alleged wrongs, but also from being required to litigate whether it is so liable.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20246\">\n    151 Conn.

Accordingly, we presume\n   that the legislature enacted \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   with the knowledge of the long-standing doctrine of sovereign immunity and of \u00a7 10-222d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that there would have been no need for the legislature to create a limited statutory immunity for local boards of education if those boards already were protected by sovereign immunity. This is particularly true given that \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   was adopted in 2011, nine years after \u00a7 10-222d was first enacted, and after a number of conflicting decisions had been rendered in the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had the legislature agreed with those cases that held that sovereign immunity barred claims like the one presented in this case, \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   would have been unnecessary. It makes more sense that the legislature concluded instead that \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   was necessary because local boards of education are not protected by sovereign immunity when their employees fail to comply with an antibullying policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Put another way, if, as the defendant contends, a board of education has sovereign immunity from suit predicated on its noncompliance with the policy mandated to be adopted by \u00a7 10-222d, then the provision of qualified statutory immunity, by virtue of \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   , for the same noncompliance, would be superfluous. Likewise, it would be illogical to conclude that a board of education is entitled to sovereign immunity from the claims posited in the present case when \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   makes it clear that a board of education may be subject to tortious liability in certain prescribed circumstances. Consequently, the defendant's claim that it is entitled to\n   sovereign immunity is untenable in light of the qualified statutory immunity provided by \u00a7 10-222\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, we conclude that the defendant is not entitled to sovereign immunity from the plaintiffs' wrongful death claim, in which the plaintiffs allege, in part, that the defendant's employees failed to comply with the antibullying policy.
