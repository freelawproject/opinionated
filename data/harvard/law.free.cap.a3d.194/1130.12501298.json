Moss raises seven issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the trial court complied with Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure No. (Rule) 206.7; (2) whether the Mahanoy State Correctional Institution Superintendent and the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (collectively, Board) admitted that Moss had served his complete sentence; (3) whether Moss' sentence is illegal and, thus, unenforceable; (4) whether Moss was given credit for all time served; (5) whether this Court should,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , correct Moss' allegedly illegal sentence; (6) whether the Supremacy Clause of the United States (U.S.) Constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Supremacy Clause) mandates that this Court decline to enforce Moss' allegedly illegal sentence; and (7) whether the trial court complied with the law. After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Moss is an inmate currently incarcerated at York County Prison. On March 5, 1997, Moss was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for arson (First Sentence). Moss' minimum sentence release date for his First Sentence was December 6, 2000 with a maximum sentence release date of March 5, 2017. On May 1, 2000, Moss received a 10-year maximum sentence for aggravated assault (Second Sentence) to commence upon the expiration of his First Sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, Moss' maximum sentence release date was recalculated to March 5, 2027. Moss was paroled on April 7, 2008. Moss remained at liberty on parole until January 15, 2017, when he was arrested in York County on new criminal charges. The Board lodged a detainer against Moss that prevented his release on bail pending disposition of the new charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Moss filed his Petition on October 5, 2017, while under the Board's detainer. Therein, Moss alleged that because his minimum sentence for the First Sentence was 42 months and his minimum sentence for the Second Sentence was 15 months, his aggregated minimum sentence was 57 months. Moss further contended that when he reached his First Sentence minimum date on December 6, 2000, his Second Sentence began to run simultaneously and was completed on December 6, 2010. Thus, Moss argued that the Board violated his constitutional rights by improperly detaining him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 11, 2017, the trial court issued a rule to the Board to show cause why Moss was not entitled to the relief requested. The trial court's order also directed the Board to \"file a response to the [P]etition within 20\n   <strong>\n    days of service upon the\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Board\n   </strong>\n   ]\" and advised the parties that \"[t]he [Petition] shall be decided under [Rule] 206.7[.]\" Trial Ct. Order, October 11, 2017. On October 31, 2017, the Board filed its response. Notably, the Board's response did not answer each numbered averment in the Petition, but instead summarized the factual background pertaining to Moss' incarceration, reiterated that Moss' maximum release date is March 5, 2027 and asserted that Moss' claim that he is being held after his First Sentence expired is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 3, 2017, the trial court \"decide[d] the [P]etition on the [P]etition and answer\" and found that Moss should remain in custody since he had not completed his full 30-year sentence. On November 21, 2017, Moss filed the instant appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the trial court's order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether the Trial Court Complied With Rule 206.7\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Moss first argues that the trial court abused its discretion because it did not\n   comply with Rule 206.7 when, absent his request, it disposed of the Petition, thereby depriving him of the right to conduct discovery, request oral argument or seek leave to amend his Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rule 206.7(b) states that \"[i]f an answer [to a petition] is filed raising no disputed issues of material fact, the court\n   <strong>\n    on request of the petitioner\n   </strong>\n   shall decide the petition on the petition and answer.\" Pa.R.C.P. No. 206.7(b) (emphasis added). Rule 206.7(c) specifies that if an answer raises disputed factual issues, discovery may be conducted as the trial court permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.C.P. No. 206.7(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   However, courts in this Commonwealth have construed Rule 206.7(b) to allow court decisions \"without the fact-finding process\" based on the petition and answer \"[i]f the answer does not raise disputed issues of fact[.]\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Spaces, Inc. v.

Accordingly, the trial court complied with Rule 206.7, and Moss' argument to the contrary is without support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the Board Admitted Moss' Averments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moss next contends that the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing his Petition when the Board admitted Moss' averments, including his contention that he completed his sentences. According to Moss, by failing to directly answer any of the Petition's numbered averments as required by Rules 206.7 and 1029, the Board admitted them all. Relatedly, Moss claims that since the Board failed to respond to his assertion that he should no longer be in custody, there were no disputed issues of material fact, and the trial court should have decided the Petition in his favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule 1029 provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (a) A responsive pleading shall admit or deny each averment of fact in the preceding pleading or any part thereof to which it is responsive. A party denying only a part of an averment shall specify so much of it as is admitted and shall deny the remainder. Admissions and denials in a responsive pleading shall refer specifically to the paragraph in which the averment admitted or denied is set forth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (b) Averments in a pleading\n   <strong>\n    to which a responsive pleading is required are admitted when not denied\n   </strong>\n   specifically or by necessary implication. A general denial or a demand for proof, ... shall have the effect of an admission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (d) Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required shall be deemed to be denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pa.R.C.P. No. 1029 (emphasis added). Further, Rule 206.7 states that where a court issues a rule to show cause, only unanswered factual averments not expressly denied are deemed admitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.C.P. No. 206.7. Importantly, \"[u]nder any rule of pleading, a conclusion of law is not an admission; only unanswered assertions of fact are considered so.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. $26,556.00 Seized from Polidoro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7349318\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/672/389/\">\n    672 A.2d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393 n.8 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, because the trial court issued an order to show cause on October 11, 2017, the Board was required to respond in accordance with Rule 206.7. On October 31, 2017, the Board filed an answer but did not \"admit or deny each averment of fact in the preceding pleading\" as required by Rule 1029(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the only factual allegations in Moss' Petition relate to his convictions and the sentences imposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining averments pertain to the legal effect of the time Moss served on the expiration of his sentences and are, thus, legal conclusions to which no responsive pleadings were required. Therefore, the legal conclusions regarding the completion of Moss' sentences were \"deemed to be denied.\" Pa.R.C.P. No. 1029(d). Accordingly, because the Board did not admit to Moss' legal conclusion that he completed his sentences, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Moss' Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Whether Moss' Aggregated Sentence is Enforceable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moss also claims that his sentence is illegal and, thus, unenforceable. Moss specifically asserts that the Board lacked authority to aggregate his sentences, and that he is being detained beyond his maximum sentence release date. Importantly, the parties agree that Moss received consecutive sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moss Reply Br. at 5; Board Br. in Opposition at 5-6. This Court has consistently held that \"once a sentencing court imposes a consecutive sentence, aggregation with other consecutive sentences is 'automatic and mandatory' under [S]ection 9757 of the Sentencing Code[,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9757 ].\"\n   <em>\n    Forbes v.

Further,\n   since an inmate receives a new minimum and maximum sentence release date based on \"the total of all offenses with respect to which sentence is imposed[,]\" the sentence order is irrelevant. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9757 ;\n   <em>\n    see also Forbes\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, because Moss' sentences were properly aggregated, his argument that his sentence is illegal and unenforceable fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Whether Moss Was Properly Credited For All Time Served\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Moss next argues that he has not been given credit for all time served while in custody. Moss first cites to\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation &amp; Parole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"16674\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/576/588/\">\n    576 Pa. 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9290632,16674\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/840/299/\">\n    840 A.2d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), for the proposition that \"when an offender is held on new criminal charges as well as a detainer lodged by the Board, ... the offender is confined for both offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9290632,16674\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/840/299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9290632,16674\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/840/299/\">\n    at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moss then maintains that because the Board placed a detainer on him from August 1999 until May 2000 for the charges resulting in the Second Sentence, he \"was entitled to nine (9) months of credit for both sentences ....\" Moss Br. at 7. The\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   Court held: \"[W]here an offender is incarcerated on both a Board detainer and new criminal charges, all time spent in confinement must be credited to\n   <strong>\n    either\n   </strong>\n   the new sentence\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   the original sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9290632,16674\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/840/299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9290632,16674\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/840/299/\">\n    at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus,\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   does not support Moss' assertion that he is entitled to credit on both sentences for the 9-month period he was held on detainer while incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, Moss claims that he was not properly credited with time served because he was either \"constructively paroled no [l]ater than January [ ]8, 2007\" or he \"was in custody on both offenses since August [ ]3[,] 1999 until April [ ]8, 2008[.]\" Moss Br. at 8. Moss contends that if he was not constructively paroled from his First Sentence to his Second Sentence, then he was in custody for both offenses and has since fully served his Second Sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moss Br. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"A prisoner in Pennsylvania does not have an automatic right to parole upon the expiration of his minimum term, rather the granting of parole is a matter of grace and administrative discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Bowman v.

Further, Moss was not granted constructive parole because he was not released on parole until April 7, 2008 and, at that time, he was released on parole outside prison walls, rather than remaining in custody to begin his Second Sentence.

Moss' argument is unclear at best. Moss appears to argue that the trial court failed to adhere to the Sentencing Code, and that this failure is unconstitutional under the Supremacy\n   Clause since the U.S. Supreme Court has held that where a statute limits an official's discretion using mandatory language, that statute creates a liberty interest that the statute will be followed. Thus, according to Moss, the trial court's failure to adhere to the mandatory requirement that the sentencing court set a minimum sentence under Section 9757 of the Sentencing Code violated the statute and thereby contravened Supreme Court precedent. Therefore, Moss posits, such action contravened the Supremacy Clause, rendering his sentence void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Section 9757 of the Sentencing Code states that courts \"shall indicate the minimum sentence to be served\" for all offenses imposed. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9757 (emphasis added).

Section 9757 [of the Sentencing Code] provides that where consecutive sentences are imposed, the sentencing court '\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   indicate the minimum sentence to be served for the\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   offenses.' The General Assembly's use of the terms 'shall,' 'total,' and 'all' as pertaining to the minimum term clearly state an intention that the prisoner serve the aggregate of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the minimum terms imposed under the various consecutive sentences. The term 'shall' rather than 'may' imports the mandatory, rather than discretionary, nature of the statute.

Moss is incorrect. As discussed,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , he was\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   constructively paroled when he reached his minimum sentence date.

To the extent Moss argues that the Board intruded upon judicial powers in recalculating his minimum and maximum sentence dates, and that denial of credit for time spent on parole also intrudes upon judicial powers, \"[t]he grant of parole is purely an administrative function which does not intervene on the power of the judiciary.\"\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.
