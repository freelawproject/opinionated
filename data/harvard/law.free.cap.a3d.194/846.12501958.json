Harper, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of one count of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree as an accessory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 (a), 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-134 (a) (2). On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction and (2) the court improperly declined to furnish a jury unanimity instruction requested by the defendant. We\n   disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant, Kevin Blackman, Marquis Winfrey, and Anthony Carmichael were smoking marijuana together\n   in Hamden on the evening of July 1, 2010. When they later discussed how to obtain more marijuana, the defendant proposed robbing the victim, John Belcher. The defendant assured the others that the victim had marijuana at his residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At that time, the four individuals were inside the defendant's vehicle. The defendant then placed a telephone call to the victim and confirmed that he was home. During that call, the defendant identified himself to the victim, who had never received a telephone call from the defendant. When that brief conversation concluded, the defendant drove his vehicle toward the victim's residence. Carmichael was seated in the front passenger seat, while Blackman and Winfrey were in the back of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant parked his vehicle on Fawn Ridge Drive in Hamden, a dead end street 986 feet from the victim's residence. He positioned his vehicle on a corner pointed in the direction of Woodin Street; to do so, the defendant had to turn around his vehicle on that dead end street. The defendant, at that time, informed the others that he \"just was the driver\" and would stay with the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While the defendant remained in the vehicle, Blackman, Winfrey, and Carmichael exited and walked to the victim's residence. Blackman and Winfrey wore black masks that concealed everything but their eyes. Blackman also wore what Winfrey testified was a \"White Sox hat\" and carried a firearm as he approached the residence. Kevin Russell, a friend of the victim, was exiting the residence as the men arrived. From his kitchen, the victim watched as a masked individual\n   approached and began \"tussling back and forth\" with Russell. The victim came outside and noticed that the assailant was holding a gun. As he looked for an object to strike him with, the victim saw \"a flash and [heard] a loud noise\" and then fell face down to the ground. The victim sustained a gunshot wound to the neck, which ultimately left him paralyzed from the chest down. At trial, Winfrey testified that he witnessed Blackman shoot the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The assailants immediately fled the scene. Carmichael returned to the defendant's waiting car and the defendant began to drive away. The defendant also picked Blackman up as he was leaving the area and drove him home. Winfrey, who lived nearby on Fawn Ridge Drive, ran home on foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During their criminal investigation, the police recovered a Chicago White Sox baseball cap from the scene of the crime. Subsequent testing at the state forensic laboratory confirmed the presence of DNA belonging to Blackman on the cap. Blackman thereafter was arrested and charged with various crimes stemming from his involvement in the attempted robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Winfrey also was arrested after the police learned of his alleged involvement in that incident. While in police custody, Winfrey provided a statement admitting his involvement therein. Winfrey, at that time, indicated that the defendant, Blackman, and Carmichael also were involved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the police interviewed the defendant, he initially denied having any involvement in the attempted\n   robbery and asked \"who made a statement against him, what was said in the statement, and what other evidence [the police] had to implicate his involvement.\" Approximately thirty-seven minutes into that interview, the defendant admitted that he had driven Blackman, Winfrey, and Carmichael to Fawn Ridge Drive, but maintained that he did so \"without knowledge of what was going to happen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134 (a) (2) and attempt to commit robbery in the first degree as an accessory in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 (a), 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-134 (a) (2). A jury trial followed. After the state rested its case-in-chief, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count, claiming that the evidence was insufficient because there was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, that the defendant had agreed or intended that his coconspirators would use a firearm during the robbery. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20451\">\n    315 Conn. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201083\">\n    108 A.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). In response, the state conceded that although a firearm was used in the attempted robbery of the victim, \"there wasn't any evidence that [the defendant] knew that there was a firearm present.\" The court agreed with the defendant, stating that because no such evidence was introduced at trial, the jury could not reasonably find \"that element of the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree\" proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the court rendered a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge. The defendant then rested without presenting any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After providing a detailed charge, the court submitted the remaining count of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree as an accessory to the jury. The jury found the defendant guilty and the court rendered judgment accordingly. The court thereafter sentenced the\n   defendant to a term of fifteen years incarceration, execution suspended after five years, followed by a three year term of probation. From that judgment, the defendant now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant first claims that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree as an accessory in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 (a), 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-134 (a) (2). He contends that a conviction of that offense requires proof that he knew or believed that one of his accomplices would be armed with a deadly weapon during the attempted robbery. Because it is undisputed that no such evidence was presented at trial, the defendant maintains that his conviction cannot stand. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably\n   drawn therefrom the [jury] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .... This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support [its] verdict.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%201\">\n    311 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20A.3d%20326\">\n    83 A.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). In applying that test, \"we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury's verdict of guilty.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stephen J.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20586\">\n    309 Conn. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20A.3d%20379\">\n    72 A.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As the defendant notes in his principal appellate brief, the crux of his claim concerns the proper interpretation\n   of the pertinent statutes underlying his conviction. Section 53a-8, which governs accessorial liability, provides in relevant part: \"(a) A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\" The criminal offense at issue in the present case is robbery in the first degree. Section 53a-134 (a) (2), which defines that offense, provides that \"[a] person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in [ General Statutes \u00a7] 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ... is armed with a deadly weapon ....\" Section 53a-133, in turn, defines robbery as \"when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of: (1) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lastly, \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) provides that \"[a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he ... intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\" On appeal, the defendant claims that the offense of attempt to commit robbery\n   in the first degree as an accessory in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 (a), 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-134 (a) (2) requires proof of an additional mental state-namely, that he believed that one of his accomplices would be armed with a deadly weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In considering that claim, we do not write on a clean slate. Our Supreme Court has addressed the statutes in question on multiple occasions. That precedent plainly indicates that the offense of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) does not require proof that a defendant intended to possess a deadly weapon. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527588\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/595/#p609\">\n    223 Conn. 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 609,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20731\">\n    613 A.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crosswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527622\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/243/\">\n    223 Conn. 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261 n.14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=612%20A.2d%201174\">\n    612 A.2d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McCalpine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"679065\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/190/822/#p833\">\n    190 Conn. 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 833,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%20545\">\n    463 A.2d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). Furthermore, as our Supreme Court has observed, \"the legislature\n   [has] expressly provided and clearly intended that the mens rea requirement for ... attempting to commit a crime shall be no different from the mens rea requirement for the commission of [the] crime by a principal.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pond\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20451\">\n    315 Conn. at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201083\">\n    108 A.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, \"[a]n accomplice to an actual or attempted robbery may be held criminally liable for his associate's display or threatened use of a purported weapon and thus convicted of the more serious crime of robbery in the second degree, even if he did not intend or even know that such a display would occur.... In defining the various degrees of the crime of robbery, the legislature has made a reasonable determination that, if an individual willingly participates in a robbery or attempted robbery, during which one of the perpetrators actually threatens the use of deadly force, that individual should be held criminally liable for the increased risk that injury or death will result, even if he did not specifically intend for the threat to be made.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted.)

In outlining the elements essential to that crime, the court explained: \"The state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused possessed the intent to commit the crime charged. The defendant here was charged with accessory to attempted robbery. The statutes governing that crime are [\u00a7\u00a7] 53a-8, 53a-49 (a) (2), and 53a-134 (a) (2). The accessory statute, \u00a7 53a-8, sets forth the element of intent as a twofold requirement: that the accessory have the intent to aid the principal and that in so aiding he intend to commit the offense with which he is charged.... The criminal attempt statute, \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2), also has as an element the intent to commit the crime attempted. Finally, \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), robbery in the first degree, requires as an element of the crime the intent of the defendant to deprive another of property or to appropriate it to himself or a third person.

In this regard, we are mindful that in 2015, our Supreme Court recognized that \"the legislature [has] expressly provided and clearly intended that the mens rea requirement for ... attempting to commit a crime shall be no different from the mens rea requirement for the commission of [the] crime by a principal.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pond\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20451\">\n    315 Conn. at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201083\">\n    108 A.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At trial, the defendant submitted a request to charge, in which he sought, inter alia, an instruction on jury unanimity with respect to reasonable\n   doubt. That proposed instruction stated: \"A further point of clarification is necessary on the concept of reasonable doubt. You will recall that I have instructed you at the outset of this case that the jury's verdict must be unanimous. You are instructed that it is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   necessary that jurors agree on the nature of or the source of the reasonable doubt. Moreover, it is not even necessary that the juror be able to explain or articulate what the reasonable doubt is. All that is required is that the jurors each agree that one (or more) reasonable doubt(s) exist(s) after a full review of the evidence or lack of evidence in the case. By way of example, each of the six jurors may have a different reason or reasons why he or she believes that the [s]tate has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. As long as the jurors unanimously agree on the general proposition that the [s]tate has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the unanimity is achieved. There need not be unanimity on the underlying causes for such a belief.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court held a charging conference on March 18, 2016, at which the defendant reiterated that request, arguing that \"the unanimity required for the conviction is one thing, but ... [the jurors] also have to be instructed that they don't need to be unanimous in their-what their doubt might be.... [T]hey need to be told they don't need to agree as to why they don't want to convict.\" The state objected to that request,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the court thereafter declined\n   to furnish the requested\n   instruction, stating: \"I just don't think it's necessary, the reason being [that] the only time I tell [the jurors that] they need to be unanimous is on their verdict of guilty or not guilty. I don't refer to their need to be unanimous with respect to any other issue. So there's no reason for them to believe that they need to be unanimous on the issue of reasonable doubt. So I just don't think it's necessary. So for that reason, I decline to give it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In its subsequent charge, the court instructed jurors that \"the defendant is presumed to be innocent of each crime with which he has been charged. This presumption of innocence was with this defendant when he was presented for trial in this case. It continues with him throughout this trial unless and until such time as you, in the course of your deliberations, unanimously conclude that the state has overcome that presumption by proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.... The state has the burden of proving that the defendant is guilty of the crime with which he is charged. The defendant has no burden in this case to prove he is not guilty or to present any evidence to disprove the charge against him. This means that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element necessary to constitute the crime charged. It is not enough for the state to prove only certain of those elements, because if proof of even one element is lacking, you must find the accused not guilty.\" The court then provided a comprehensive instruction on reasonable doubt, the propriety of which is not contested in this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following a series of instructions on the elements of the charged offense, the court then provided an instruction to jurors on the issue of unanimity, stating: \"I want to impress upon you that you are duty bound as jurors to apply the law as I outlined it, to determine the facts on the basis of the evidence as it has been presented, and then to render a verdict of guilty or not guilty as to the offense charged.\n   <em>\n    Your verdict must be unanimous.\n   </em>\n   There is no such thing as a majority vote of a jury in Connecticut. Rather,\n   <em>\n    you must all agree on the verdict.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) The court continued: \"When you are in the jury room, listen to each other and discuss the evidence and issues in the case among yourselves. Each of you has the duty to consult with one another and to deliberate in an effort to agree\n   <em>\n    unanimously on a verdict\n   </em>\n   if you can do so without violating your individual judgment and conscience. While each of you must decide the case for yourself and not merely acquiesce in the conclusion of your fellow\n   jurors, you should examine the issues and the evidence before you with candor and frankness and with proper regard for the opinions of each other.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The jury later returned a verdict in which it found the defendant guilty of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree as an accessory. In accepting that verdict, the court canvassed the jurors to confirm that \"each of you do say unanimously that the defendant is guilty\" of that criminal offense. All members of the jury responded affirmatively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly declined to provide his requested instruction on jury unanimity. Relying on\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"517898\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/201/174/#p178\">\n    201 Conn. 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%201183\">\n    513 A.2d 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986), he argues that the court was obligated to furnish that instruction because it \"was relevant to the issues of the case and was an accurate statement of the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Contrary to the contention of defendant, we conclude that the requested instruction does not contain an accurate statement of the law. It is well established that reasonable doubt \"must be based on reason ... and if [a juror] cannot attribute a reason for it then ... it is not a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"676360\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/189/364/#p366\">\n    189 Conn. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=456%20A.2d%20274\">\n    456 A.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) ; accord\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Coward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145013\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/296/#p317\">\n    292 Conn. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=972%20A.2d%20691\">\n    972 A.2d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (reasonable doubt is doubt for which juror conscientiously can provide reason). The instruction requested by the defendant contravenes that precept, as it incorrectly states that \"it is not even necessary that the juror be able to explain or articulate what the reasonable doubt is. All that is required is that the jurors each agree that one (or more) reasonable doubt(s) exist(s) after a full review of the evidence or lack of evidence in the case.\" As our Supreme Court has observed, \"[a] trial court is under no obligation to give a requested jury instruction that does not constitute an accurate statement of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69199\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/605/#p628\">\n    242 Conn. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 628,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=700%20A.2d%20633\">\n    700 A.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition, the proposition advanced by the defendant-that jurors must be instructed that unanimity is not required on \"the nature or the source of the reasonable doubt\"-is without legal support.

In light of the ambiguity in the court's instructions and the verdict form itself, the United States Supreme Court ultimately held that there was \"a substantial probability that reasonable jurors, upon receiving the judge's instructions in this case, and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed, well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all\n   [twelve] jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217594\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/367/#p369\">\n    Id. at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217594\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/367/#p369\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nor is this a case in which the court's instructions, considered as a whole, likely led jurors to believe that the basis for reasonable doubt on the part of an individual juror had to be shared by all members of the jury. To the contrary, the court's instructions repeatedly apprised jurors that their\n   <em>\n    verdict\n   </em>\n   must be unanimous, stating in unequivocal terms that \"you must all agree on the verdict\" and \"[y]our verdict must be unanimous.\" At the same time, the court in its instructions emphasized that each juror was obligated \"to deliberate in an effort to agree unanimously on a verdict if you can do so without violating\n   <em>\n    your individual judgment and conscience\n   </em>\n   ....\n   <em>\n    [E]ach of you must decide the case for yourself and not merely acquiesce in the conclusion of your fellow jurors\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.)

As the trial court noted during its charging conference, neither case has any relevance to the issue of unanimity among jurors, and the defendant on appeal has abandoned his reliance on those\n   decisions. Furthermore, the defendant has provided no authority indicating that any jurisdiction has adopted the proposition advanced by him-that jurors in a criminal trial must be instructed that unanimity is not required on \"the nature or the source of the reasonable doubt.\" For that reason, and in light of the court's observation that \"the only time I tell [the jurors that] they need to be unanimous is on their verdict of guilty [and] I don't refer to their need to be unanimous with respect to any other issue,\" the court concluded that the requested instruction was unnecessary.
