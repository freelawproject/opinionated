Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) decided that the petition should be dismissed on the ground that tribal sovereign immunity\n   applies to petitions for a bill of discovery, and (2) determined that the defendants are entitled to tribal sovereign immunity. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as gleaned from the plaintiff's petition for a bill of discovery and the court's memorandum of decision, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff owns property in East Lyme that is not part of or adjacent to the reservation of the tribe. AT &amp; T evaluated the plaintiff's property as a potential location for a new cellular communications tower. As part of the application process to the Connecticut Siting Council, the agency responsible for utility facilities' locations, AT &amp; T submitted an electronic message with the proposed site to the Federal Communications Commission, which notified the tribe of the proposal. The tribe responded on or about July 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The response, written by Thomas, indicated that a site walk conducted on June 10, 2015, identified \"substantial stone groupings\" on the property adjacent to the plaintiff's property. According to the response, the proposed tower would \"impact the view shed\" of these \"cultural stone features\" and could \"possibly cause impact to the overall integrity of the landscape.\" The response concluded that, in the opinion of the Mohegan Tribal Historic Preservation Office, the proposed tower would cause an adverse effect to \"properties of traditional religious and cultural significance to the [tribe].\" After receiving this response from the tribe, AT &amp; T stopped considering the plaintiff's property as a potential site for the tower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On multiple occasions, the plaintiff made requests for clarification from Thomas and Quinn about the stone groupings, seeking more information about their location, substance, and historical and cultural significance, but no representative of the tribe responded to any of his repeated requests. On September 23, 2015, the\n   plaintiff filed a petition for a bill of discovery, alleging that he may have a cause of action of intentional interference with a business relationship against the defendants. On October 5, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, citing the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity. The trial court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the bill of discovery. The plaintiff then filed\n   the present appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming that the court improperly found that sovereign immunity applied and that sovereign immunity bars a bill of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Well established principles of law govern our standard of review. \"[T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss.... In an appeal from the granting of a motion to dismiss on the ground of subject matter jurisdiction, this court's review is plenary. A determination regarding a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When ... the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.... The trial court's role in considering whether to grant a motion to dismiss is to take the facts to be those alleged ... including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3686823\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/97/146/#p148\">\n    97 Conn.

Probable cause is the knowledge of facts sufficient to justify a reasonable man in the belief that he has reasonable grounds for presenting an action.... Its existence or\n   nonexistence is determined by the court on the facts found.... Moreover, the plaintiff who seeks discovery in equity must demonstrate more than a mere suspicion; he\n   must also show that there is some describable sense of wrong....

We are unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff fails to provide legal authority or a persuasive logical argument supporting the proposition that a prelitigation tool such as a bill of discovery can be differentiated from the act of litigation itself when sovereign immunity is involved. We are unaware of any controlling authority on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judges of our Superior Court who have considered this issue have dismissed petitions for bills of discovery on the ground that the tribe's sovereign would be affected by the\n   enforcement of such petitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We find the reasoning of those judges to be persuasive. We agree, therefore, with the trial court's conclusion that \"there is no basis in logic, law, or equity\" for the plaintiff's claim that \"tribal sovereign immunity does not apply to a bill of discovery, even if it bars the lawsuit for which discovery is sought.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Tribal sovereign immunity predates the birth of the Republic....

The act of subjecting a sovereign to prelitigation discovery in order to uncover information necessary to establish facts that, ultimately, could support probable cause to sustain a cause of action against the sovereign would negate one purpose of sovereign immunity, which is to prevent the interference that litigation creates. We therefore conclude that the same overarching concern applies with equal force to a petition for a bill of discovery. Defendants cloaked with sovereign immunity are immune from suit and, therefore, immune from a bill of discovery to help establish facts necessary to commence a suit. Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiff's petition for a bill of discovery on the ground of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiff also claims that the court improperly determined that Thomas and Quinn were entitled to tribal sovereign immunity. Specifically, he argues that Thomas and Quinn were named, and also acted, in their individual capacities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the plaintiff, the bill of discovery alleges an exception to tribal sovereign immunity, namely, that Thomas and Quinn were not acting within the scope of tribal authority. We are unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[A]s a matter of federal law, an Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity ... and the tribe itself has consented to suit in a specific forum....
