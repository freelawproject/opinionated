The plaintiff commenced the present\n   action on September 9, 2010, seeking to foreclose a mortgage on certain real property in Norwalk that the defendant had executed in 2005 as security for a note in the principal amount of $200,000. The plaintiff alleged in its complaint that it was the holder of the note and mortgage and that the defendant was in default under the note and mortgage for failing to make payment as agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 24, 2011, the defendant filed an answer and three special defenses. The defendant alleged in the first two special defenses that the plaintiff's predecessor in interest had (1) misrepresented the terms and conditions of the loan and (2) fraudulently entered false information on the defendant's loan application and sold the defendant a loan that she could not possibly afford. As to her third special defense-the only one at issue in the present appeal-the defendant alleged that \"[t]he plaintiff did not properly account for payments made by the defendant.\" The plaintiff filed a reply denying the defendant's special defenses on December 2, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 23, 2015-prior to the scheduled trial date-the plaintiff unilaterally withdrew its action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-80,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and shortly thereafter the plaintiff commenced a foreclosure action against the same defendant in federal court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As of the date of the withdrawal,\n   the defendant had not effectively filed\n   a counterclaim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 30, 2015, the defendant filed a request for leave to amend her answer to assert a counterclaim, to which the plaintiff objected. At the conclusion of the December 22, 2015 oral argument on the objection, the court ruled from the bench that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the defendant's request because no counterclaim had been pending when the plaintiff withdrew its action. The court suggested, however, that it might have the ability to consider the request for leave to amend if the defendant first filed a motion to restore the case to the docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to the court's suggestion, on January 28, 2016, the defendant filed a motion and an accompanying memorandum of law to restore her special defenses and counterclaim to the docket or, alternatively, to restore the case to the docket (motion to restore).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her memorandum of law, the defendant argued, inter alia, that her third special defense\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   was more properly construed as a counterclaim and that, as such, it survived the withdrawal of the plaintiff's action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing oral argument\n   on the motion on February 8, 2016, the court issued an oral decision granting the motion to restore.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As set forth in its ruling and subsequent articulation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court, relying on\n   <em>\n    225 Associates\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Housing Finance Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"213776\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/65/112/#p121\">\n    65 Conn.

Consequently, the court concluded that the\n   plaintiff's withdrawal of its action did not affect the pendency of such counterclaim and that the defendant thus had a right to have the counterclaim adjudicated. The court therefore held that it \"had jurisdiction to restore the case to the docket, even though the plaintiff withdrew the case.\" Accordingly, the court ordered that \"the case [be] restored to the docket for the sole purpose of the trial on the counterclaim.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court acted in excess of its authority in restoring the defendant's third special defense to the docket. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the defendant's special defense could not properly be construed as a counterclaim because it failed to allege any facts that would entitle the defendant to seek judicial relief through an independent cause of action against the plaintiff. The plaintiff further\n   contends that, because the special defense did not constitute a counterclaim and thus did not survive the withdrawal of the plaintiff's action as provided in Practice Book \u00a7 10-55, the court had no \"continuing subject matter jurisdiction over the matter\" after the plaintiff withdrew its action. Therefore, the plaintiff claims that the court \"had no authority to restore [the] case for the purpose of a counterclaim when, in fact, no counterclaim existed\" prior to the withdrawal of the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We first set forth our standard of review. \"Any determination regarding the scope of a court's subject matter jurisdiction or its authority to act presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mastriani Realty, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416077\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/142/419/#p431\">\n    142 Conn.

If, however, the counterclaim\n   is not identified as such in the defendant's answer, it may be erased from the docket along with the plaintiff's action. In such circumstances, the court has the authority to grant a motion to restore the case to the docket to permit the defendant to prosecute the counterclaim because, where a defendant's counterclaim is wrongfully stricken from the docket following the withdrawal of the plaintiff's action, the defendant \"is\n   <em>\n    entitled\n   </em>\n   to have [the case] restored for the purpose [of pursuing the defendant's counterclaim].\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Boothe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"486978\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/76/530/#p533\">\n    76 Conn. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20A.%20173\">\n    57 A. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1904). The court's authority, however, necessarily depends on the existence of an effective counterclaim. Indeed, it would be anomalous to conclude that the court has the authority to restore a counterclaim to the docket where the defendant had not effectively pleaded a counterclaim. Consequently, whether the court in the present case had the authority to restore the defendant's third special defense to the docket depends on whether the special defense was, in effect, a counterclaim.\n   Although a counterclaim is similar to a special defense in that both are employed by a defendant to diminish or defeat a plaintiff's claim, they nonetheless are separate and distinct types of pleadings.

Thus, in determining whether a defendant's answer asserts a counterclaim as opposed to a special defense, the court must determine whether the defendant could have maintained the claim as an independent cause of action. Broadly defined, \"[a] cause of action, brought by means of a complaint or a counterclaim, is a means of seeking\n   <em>\n    redress\n   </em>\n   for having suffered harm. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) (defining 'cause of action' in part as '[t]he fact or facts which\n   give a person a right to judicial redress or relief against another....

Evaluating the defendant's answer against the correct standard, it is clear that the allegation in the defendant's third special defense cannot properly be construed as a counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant's third special defense consisted of a single allegation: \"The plaintiff did not properly account for payments made by the defendant.\" Nothing in this allegation can reasonably be interpreted as a claim of entitlement to affirmative relief.

Reading it broadly and realistically, the allegation that the plaintiff did not properly account for the defendant's payments merely challenges the amount of the debt owed to the plaintiff, which may be raised by way of special defense or by objecting to the plaintiff's attempted introduction of the affidavit of debt in court.\n   <em>\n    Bank of America, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chainani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490382\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/166/670/#p486\">\n    174 Conn.

In the absence of any suggestion that she made payments\n   <em>\n    in excess\n   </em>\n   of the amount of the debt, the defendant would not be entitled to any affirmative relief under this allegation. Consequently, the defendant's third special defense cannot reasonably be construed as stating an independent cause of action, and, therefore, the trial court erred in construing it as a counterclaim. Because there was no pending counterclaim as of the date of the withdrawal, the court lacked the authority to restore the case to the docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the motion to restore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    On October 17, 2013, subsequent to the commencement of the present action, the plaintiff changed its name to Santander Bank.

In the present case, the plaintiff's principal claim, which is dispositive of its appeal, concerns the authority of the trial court to restore the defendant's special defense to the docket.
