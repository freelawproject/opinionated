Thompson, appeals from the judgment of the habeas court denying his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly concluded that he failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his trial counsel rendered deficient performance because he failed to move for a mistrial or to seek any curative measures following prejudicial testimony from the complainant. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner was charged with accosting a woman that he had approached on a New Haven street, and luring her to a residence under the guise of joining a local church group. Following a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92, sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70, assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61, and threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62. Attorney Tejas Bhatt represented the petitioner at his criminal trial. Bhatt's assessment was that the outcome of the case hinged on the credibility of the complainant, whom the state called to testify at the criminal trial. During the direct examination of the complainant, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: What led him-what-what happened when he hit you? What led him to hit you?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"[The Complainant]: He told me to take my clothes off....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Did you-were you telling him no?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[The Complainant]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And what did you-what else did you say to him?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[The Complainant]: I asked him, why you doing this to me, and he said, I'm not the first person-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[Bhatt]: Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[The Complainant]: He done this-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The Court: Hold on.

This is an area we discussed previously.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury was excused and the state made an offer of proof, during which the complainant testified that the petitioner said that she was \"not the first person he ever did this to.\" Bhatt objected to the admission of this testimony, arguing that\n   \"[t]he only purpose for offering [the statement], is to show that the [petitioner] had a propensity to commit this crime.... [I]t's the [petitioner's] statement, sure, but I think there's still-the court still has to do [an analysis pursuant to \u00a7 4-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence ] of the [probative]\n   value being out-outweighed by-the prejudicial impact ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court sustained Bhatt's objection and found that the prejudicial impact of the statement outweighed its probative value.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before resuming testimony, the following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"The Court: Is there anything else on this point?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[Bhatt]: No, I believe that-I'm assuming the court would-I believe she started her response and-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The Court: Well, no, she got maybe two words out that-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[Bhatt]: Okay.

The petitioner, Bhatt, and Gary Mastronardi, a criminal trial expert, testified during the habeas trial. Bhatt testified that the trial court sustained his objection to the complainant's testimony because the statement was \"far too prejudicial to allow.\" Bhatt\n   explained that when he attempted to raise with the trial court the issue that the witness had uttered the prejudicial statement, the trial court \"cuts [him] off; and [the court] says, no. Nobody heard anything.... [The court] says, I've ruled. Nobody heard anything. There's nothing to strike.\" Bhatt was never questioned at the habeas trial regarding why he did not move for a mistrial or seek any curative measures in light of the court's finding that the testimony was more prejudicial than probative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mastronardi then offered his opinion that what Bhatt should have done following the prejudicial testimony \"depends on whether or not what was said was audible\" to the jury. He explained that, if the statement was audible to the jury, \"after the judge said that he did not think that it was audible, what [Bhatt] should have done was insist that the transcript be played so that-to give the trial judge another opportunity to listen.... Once it was played and if there was-if it was clear that-that the statement was, in fact, audible, trial counsel had to move for a mistrial, without a doubt, and should have pressed that motion strenuously,\" especially because the trial court found that the statement was more prejudicial than probative. Mastronardi testified that, in the alternative, \"if [Bhatt] was unsuccessful [in moving for a mistrial], then the second move, the fallback position, should have been a motion to strike and a request for some type of special instruction to the jury to ignore [the testimony].\" Mastronardi concluded that, in his opinion, \"under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard, any reasonable lawyer would have definitely moved for a mistrial in that type of situation, especially after the judge ... specifically said that it was too prejudicial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Following the habeas trial, the court denied the petitioner's amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. With respect to the claim that Bhatt rendered ineffective\n   assistance regarding his handling of the prejudicial testimony, the habeas court agreed with the trial court's finding that \"the offending testimony was incomprehensible because of the prompt intervention by Attorney Bhatt.\" The court continued that \"[a]pparently, the court monitor was, at some level, able to isolate the [complainant's] words from the other speaker's, but this court could not. Given the definitive tone of Judge Fischer's opinion on the matter, Attorney Bhatt cannot be faulted for accepting that determination without confronting the judicial authority further on that issue.\" The court concluded that \"the petitioner has failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, this allegation of defective representation.\" The petitioner then filed a timely petition for certification to appeal, which the court granted on November 21, 2016. This appeal followed.\n   On appeal, the petitioner challenges the habeas court's conclusion that he failed to prove that Bhatt rendered deficient performance by failing to move for a mistrial or to seek a curative measure following the complainant's prejudicial testimony. Specifically, the petitioner argues that any reasonable attorney would have moved for a mistrial in a similar situation, especially because the trial court found that the testimony was more prejudicial than probative. The petitioner further argues that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of Bhatt's deficient performance. We disagree with the petitioner's claim regarding deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Our standard of review of a habeas court's judgment on ineffective assistance of counsel claims is well settled. In a habeas appeal, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, but our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner's constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\" (Internal quotation\n   marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Stanley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"260652\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/67/357/#p359\">\n    67 Conn.

In light of that finding, Bhatt's evaluation of the attendant circumstances in not seeking any additional remedies during the trial was entirely reasonable. Therefore, this court's conclusion that Bhatt's acquiescence waived the\n   claim does not equate to a determination that counsel rendered ineffective assistance in his handling of the issue.

Accordingly, this court cannot conclude that counsel rendered ineffective assistance in not moving for a mistrial or requesting a curative instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, the petitioner argues that because the trial transcript reflects the complainant's testimony, we must assume that the jury heard it. This argument is not persuasive. The ability of the recording equipment to pick up the testimony, and of the court monitor to transcribe it, has no bearing on the assessment of whether the jury heard the testimony. The court monitor has the technical ability to replay a recording as many times as necessary and at different volumes. The jury, however, only heard the testimony in real time,\n   and the petitioner has presented no evidence to establish that the jury-in real time-was able to isolate the complainant's words from Bhatt's simultaneous objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The petitioner has not presented any evidence that suggests that we should second-guess the trial court's \"very confident\" finding to the contrary, and instead conclude that the jury did in fact hear the prejudicial statement. Nor is there a basis to rule that the habeas court erred in concluding that \"[g]iven the definitive tone of Judge Fischer's opinion on the matter, Attorney Bhatt cannot be faulted for accepting [the court's finding that the jury did not hear the offending testimony] without confronting the judicial authority further on that issue.\" Bhatt was attuned to the prejudicial testimony, as it was the subject of a motion in limine. The transcript, as quoted previously, makes clear that before the complainant could utter the entire sentence, Bhatt objected and triggered a response from the court at the same time that the complainant was speaking. Moreover, during the habeas trial, Bhatt was never questioned as to why he did not move for a mistrial or seek a curative measure following the court's finding that the statement was more prejudicial than probative. Perhaps given the trial court's finding that the jury did not hear the offending testimony, Bhatt opted not to request a curative measure in order to avoid bringing the issue to the jury's attention. Because the petitioner never asked Bhatt to explain his reasoning, however, we are left without a definitive answer. The petitioner has thus not presented any evidence beyond speculation or conjecture to rebut the presumption that Bhatt's performance fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.

Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court properly determined that the petitioner failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that trial counsel rendered deficient performance, and thus has not satisfied the\n   first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   His ineffective assistance of counsel claim therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    This court's opinion in the petitioner's direct appeal provides a full exposition of the facts that the jury reasonably could have found at the criminal trial.

Following oral argument on April 9, 2018, however, a portion of that exhibit containing the complainant's testimony was inadvertently damaged. Therefore, this court ordered, sua sponte, on April 23, 2018, that both parties' counsel and the habeas court rectify the record and take any steps necessary to provide a duplicate copy of that exhibit. The Tolland Judicial District thereafter provided another copy of court exhibit 1. By letter to this court dated May 10, 2018, counsel for the petitioner maintained that, in her opinion, the new copy of court exhibit 1 is of an inferior audio quality in terms of the complainant's testimony, as compared to the earlier version. Even if we assume, arguendo, that counsel is correct in her assessment of the recording, for the reasons set forth herein, and also as noted by the habeas court, the record is inadequate to overturn the trial court's determination that the jury never heard the statement at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    On August 22, 2016, the petitioner withdrew his claims regarding Bhatt's improper advisement of a plea offer and failure to preserve the petitioner's access to sentence review. Additionally, the petitioner's claims regarding Bhatt's inadequate preparation of a defense and examination of witnesses are not at issue in this appeal. Therefore, the remaining claims are ineffective assistance of counsel due to Bhatt's handling of prejudicial testimony, and that he failed to adequately prepare for the sentencing hearing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The petitioner's brief, however, is devoid of any mention of the claim that Bhatt inadequately prepared for sentencing. Instead, the petitioner focused his entire argument on Bhatt's handling of the prejudicial testimony. The petitioner's claim that Bhatt inadequately prepared for sentencing is thus deemed abandoned.
