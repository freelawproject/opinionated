Merritts, Jr. (Condemnee) appeals from the February 8, 2017 Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County (trial court), which, in relevant part, overruled Condemnee's preliminary objections (POs) to the June 1, 2016 Declaration of Taking (Declaration) filed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Commonwealth), Department of Transportation (Department), to acquire a drainage easement and temporary construction easement on Condemnee's Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, Condemnee argues the trial court erred in denying his POs because: (1) the trial court should have held an evidentiary hearing prior to holding oral arguments on the legal issues; (2) the Commonwealth lacks the legal authority to exercise eminent domain to condemn Condemnee's Property; (3) the condemnation is intended to benefit a private enterprise and is excessive; and (4) the condemnation violates the Storm Water Management Act (Storm Water Act).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts relevant to our review are as follows. Condemnee's Property consists of two parcels of land located in Frankstown Township (Township), Blair County, one that is 1.11 acres and one that is 0.43 acres, which run along State Route 0022 (Route 22). (Trial Ct. Op., Feb. 8, 2017, Finding of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 1.) The Property borders the Frankstown Branch of the Juniata River. Condemnee's \"[P]roperty was part of the original land warrant given to Daniel Lowery by the Penn family proprietorship in 1755 and subsequent patent [that was] given to Andrew Lowery in 1783[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 1, 2016, the Department, which is an agency of the Commonwealth, filed the Declaration seeking to acquire \"a one thousand one hundred fifty (1150) square foot drainage easement and two thousand eight hundred ninety-six (2896) square foot temporary construction easement\" on Condemnee's Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4.) The condemnation of a part of Condemnee's Property\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   was [part of] an intersection improvement project called the Canoe Creek Intersection Improvement Project [ (Project) ] to reroute and realign certain intersections along Route 22, add center turn lanes at certain intersections, and effect other safety improvements, including drainage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Condemnee filed nine POs to the Declaration\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting, relevant here, that: the Commonwealth did not have the authority to condemn his Property, (First PO \u00b6\u00b6 1-15, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 23-26); the taking was for a private enterprise in violation of the Eminent Domain Code (Code)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was excessive, (Second PO \u00b6\u00b6 1-11, R.R. at 26-28; Third PO \u00b6\u00b6 1-10, R.R. at 28-29; Eighth PO \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5-6, R.R. at 35-36); and the taking violates the Storm Water Act, (Eighth PO \u00b6\u00b6 6-12, R.R. at 35-37). The Department filed a Motion to Dismiss the POs (Motion to Dismiss) and a Motion for a Writ of Possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court heard argument on December 21, 2016, at which Condemnee presented his chain of title and the parties expressed their respective positions. Condemnee requested an evidentiary hearing on the POs. The trial court proceeded with oral argument, indicating it would schedule an evidentiary hearing if issues arose that required the taking of evidence. Subsequently concluding that evidence was required, the trial court reconvened the matter for an evidentiary hearing on the POs on January 11, 2017. The Department presented exhibits and the testimony of several witnesses, including the civil engineer who is supervising the Project (Engineer), who was accepted as an expert witness. Condemnee presented his own testimony and exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Department's evidence described the Project Plan, which includes: replacing an existing 15-inch drain pipe with an 18-inch drain pipe across the Property \"to upgrade drainage to existing standards;\" and replacing an existing 24-inch drain pipe that drains into a stream with a 42-inch drain pipe \"to help slow down pipe drainage and help stem the effects of erosion into the stream and the adjoining river.\" (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14, 16, 18.) Due to safety and efficiency concerns associated with the existing 15-inch pipe, the current location could no longer be used. The Department will own and maintain the drain pipes, and the 18-inch drain pipe will drain water away from Route 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As part of the overall Project, certain Township roads, including Flowing Spring Road, which runs along Condemnee's smaller parcel and along part of Condemnee's larger parcel, would be permanently removed by the Township. Township intended, subject to the requirements of The Second Class Township Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to vacate and \"dedicate Flowing Spring Road and the accompanying right-of-way to Rails to Trails of Central Pennsylvania (Rails to Trails).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 23.) This part of the Project \"is to connect a trail for non-motorized use to Canoe Creek State Park with the Lower Trail Station, controlled by Rails to Trails ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Part of Canoe Creek State Park is next to property owned by Rails to Trails, although the properties are separated by Route 22. The proposed trail will utilize \"the closed Flowing Spring Road and right-of-way to connect\" the two. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Rails to Trails will be responsible for maintaining the trail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Also as a part of the Project, the Department will construct a driveway for Condemnee to access Route 22 from the 0.43 acre parcel; however, current access\n   to Condemnee's 1.11 acre parcel requires him to cross over a neighbor's property because he cannot access that parcel from his smaller parcel due to its steep grade. The plans related to the proposed trail have no effect on the amount of Condemnee's Property the Department sought to condemn in the Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Trial Court's Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court issued an opinion addressing each of Condemnee's POs. Condemnee's first relevant PO asserted that the Commonwealth lacks \" 'standing, power, right, jurisdiction or authority for condemnation or to take land in this instant matter' \" because the title to the Property dates back to the land warrant issued to Daniel Lowery in 1755 from the William Penn proprietary, which subsequently deeded it to Alexander Lowery, \"who received a patent in 1783.\" (Trial Ct. Op. at 7.) Condemnee argued that, because the land patent provided a claim that was free from all restrictions and reservations, the only way the Commonwealth could condemn the land was if it had a connection or ownership interest in the land at the time it became a state. Because the Commonwealth never owned or claimed possession to his land, it \"does not have privity of title with the Condemnee, which, the Condemnee assert[ed], must be proven to take the easement in question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court rejected Condemnee's contention that, in order to exercise eminent domain over his Property, the Commonwealth had to have some connection or have privity of title to the Property. The trial court held that the Commonwealth's eminent domain power does not derive from it having privity with the original title holder or having a relationship at the time of the original conveyance but from its power as a sovereign, a power that cannot be extinguished. It concluded that, while the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions and legislative enactments could place limits on the Commonwealth's ability to use this power, such \"power is inherent in the Commonwealth's existence and is not reliant on constitutional and legislative enactment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Legislative Route 1018, Section 4, Lower Chichester Twp., Del. Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1901693\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/422/594/\">\n    422 Pa. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20906\">\n    222 A.2d 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 908 (1966) ).) The trial court pointed out that to accept Condemnee's argument would allow any landowner who can trace his or her deed back to the original colonial grant \"to circumvent over one hundred fifty (150) years of eminent domain law\" and would \"usurp the sovereignty of the Commonwealth by claiming a title in land superior to the sovereign power of eminent domain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court considered Condemnee's other arguments about why the Commonwealth lacked jurisdiction to take his Property and likewise concluded that they were without merit. In particular, the trial court held that the cases Condemnee cited were not applicable because they did not involve the use of eminent domain to acquire an easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Condemnee's next pertinent POs asserted that the Commonwealth exceeded its authority to condemn property because of the transfer of the right-of-way in Flowing Spring Road to Rails to Trails, a private entity, and that the condemnation was excessive because there was no need to change the size of the drain pipes. Condemnee asserted this transfer is a \"silent\" condemnation of lands across his property via an agreement between the Department, Township, and Rails to Trails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The trial court dismissed all of Condemnee's arguments related to the future transfer of Township's right-of-way to Rails to Trails because the Declaration at issue concerned only the Department's taking of the 1,150 square foot drainage\n   easement and the 2,896 square foot temporary construction easement. Therefore, the trial court concluded, the issue of Flowing Spring Road, which is controlled by Township, was collateral to the proceedings before it, and the POs against the Department related to Flowing Spring Road were not proper preliminary objections under the Code. Additionally, the trial court recognized that condemning these easements to install larger drain pipes was for a public purpose because the new pipes were part of the Project to improve the Route 22 corridor by addressing drainage, safety, and environmental concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Condemnee's last relevant PO averred that the taking violated the Storm Water Act by vesting maintenance of the drainage pipes being installed in Rails to Trails, a private entity. The trial court held that this objection also was collateral to the proceeding on this Declaration and not a proper basis for a preliminary objection under the Code. However, it stated that, even if the objection was not collateral, Condemnee's contention would fail because the Department's Engineer testified that the new drain pipes were a part of the Project and the Department would be responsible for maintaining the new pipes. Accordingly, the trial court overruled this PO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Condemnee appealed\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, at the direction of the trial court, filed a Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal (1925(b) Statement) pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therein, Condemnee raised the following: whether the trial court erred in denying all of his preliminary objections; whether the trial court \"erred by ruling that the Commonwealth had statutory or any authority to condemn the land in question\"; whether the trial court \"erred in finding eminent domain applies even though this is a taking for a private enterprise\"; and whether the trial court \"erred by finding that this condemnation would not violate the\" Storm Water Act. (Condemnee's 1925(b) Statement, Condemnee's Br., App. A3.) The trial court issued a responsive opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), providing further explanation for overruling Condemnee's POs. This matter is ready for disposition by this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    A. Whether the trial court erred by hearing oral argument before holding an evidentiary hearing on Condemnee's POs.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Condemnee first argues, based on\n   <em>\n    Department of Transportation v. Florek\n   </em>\n   , 71 Pa.Cmwlth. 615,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=455%20A.2d%201263\">\n    455 A.2d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983), and\n   <em>\n    Werts v. Luzerne Borough Authority\n   </em>\n   , 15 Pa.Cmwlth. 631,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=329%20A.2d%20335\">\n    329 A.2d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), that the trial court erred by hearing oral argument on the POs on December 21, 2016, prior to its holding an evidentiary hearing on January 11, 2017. He also asserts, citing Section 406(e) of the Eminent Domain Code of 1964,\n   <em>\n    formerly\n   </em>\n   26 P.S. \u00a7 1-406(e)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (providing that where issues of fact are raised in preliminary objections, the trial court is required to \"take evidence by depositions or otherwise\"), that an evidentiary hearing was required to be held first because issues of fact were raised. The Department responds that\n   <em>\n    Florek\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Werts\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable because, unlike in those cases, Condemnee did receive an evidentiary hearing prior to the trial court overruling his POs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We have carefully reviewed the record and precedent cited by Condemnee, and discern no error in the trial court's actions. In\n   <em>\n    Florek\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Werts\n   </em>\n   , the condemnees' preliminary objections were dismissed because they had not filed briefs in violation of local rules and they were never afforded an evidentiary hearing prior to the dismissal of their objections. Here, however, while the trial court initially heard oral argument, it held the evidentiary hearing on the merits of the POs based on the existence of issues of fact. At that evidentiary hearing, both Condemnee and the Department presented evidence to support their positions. Only after that evidentiary hearing did the trial court dismiss Condemnee's POs based on the evidence and argument presented by the Department and Condemnee, not because Condemnee violated a local procedural rule. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Florek\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Werts\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    B. Whether the Commonwealth has the legal authority to condemn Condemnee's property.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Condemnee reasserts the arguments he made before the trial court, namely \"that the original land warrant and subsequent patent given to Andrew Lowery[ ] [renders] the [P]roperty not subject to eminent domain[.]\" (Condemnee's Br. at 15.) Arguing that a patent is the highest evidence of title and provides full legal title in its holder, Condemnee asserts that the Commonwealth lacks the authority to file the Declaration or take any property from him because it has not proven some connection to or ownership of the Property at the time it became a state. Absent the reservation of some rights by the colony of Pennsylvania in the original patent, Condemnee argues the Commonwealth has not retained any reversionary interest or other right to exercise control over the Property after 1783, when the patent/warranty deed became final. Therefore, he maintains, the Commonwealth has no privity to the title of the Property and the assertion of such an interest would be barred by the doctrine of laches. Condemnee maintains that the United States Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Summa Corporation v. California ex rel. State Lands Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196299\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/198/\">\n    466 U.S. 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196299\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/198/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196299\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/198/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Condemnee asserts that the same principles should be applied in this matter and, if so applied, the result would be a determination that the Commonwealth lacks legal authority to condemn any part of Condemnee's Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Department replies that the Commonwealth's authority to exercise eminent domain derives from its power as a sovereign, limited only by the constitution and statute. According to the Department, it has been authorized by the General Assembly to use eminent domain \"for all transportation purposes\" pursuant to Section 2003(e)(1) of The Administrative Code of 1929,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   71 P.S. \u00a7 513(e)(1). While there are some limits to the exercise of eminent domain, the Department maintains that the General Assembly has not established a limit based on whether the land being condemned was first acquired by warrant or patent or when such warrant or patent was issued. Moreover, the Department argues the Commonwealth is not required to establish privity of title to condemn property for a public use, including for transportation purposes, because that right is retained by the Commonwealth as a sovereign and could not be conferred to a patent grantee.

According to Condemnee, because the Project's plot plans reference the Township's future intent to vacate Flowing Spring Road, a public road, and transfer the right-of-way to Rails to Trails, a private entity, for a recreational trail, the taking is for the benefit of a private enterprise. Condemnee argues it is well-settled \"that once a road loses its public character as a road, the adjoining landowners take possession to the center of the road.\" (Condemnee's Br. at 31 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ferko v.

Thus, Condemnee contends, the plan to transfer the right-of-way to Rails to Trails after the vacation of Flowing Spring Road not only is a taking of Condemnee's interest to the center of that vacated road for the benefit of a private interest but also impairs his ingress and egress to the lower 1.11 acres of the Property.

It further\n   argues that the taking of the drainage easement and the construction easement were for transportation purposes, a recognized public purpose, because the easements were necessary to improve drainage as a part of the overall safety improvements to Route 22. The Department points to the credited testimony of its expert, Engineer, regarding the need for the change in location and/or size of drain pipes to remedy safety and environmental issues associated with the current drainage facilities as part of the Project.

(Trial Ct. Op. at 14.) A review of the record confirms the trial court's conclusion. The Declaration attaches drawings authorizing the Department's acquisition of a right-of-way and \"[a] Schedule of Property Condemned\" (Schedule), which identifies Condemnee's Property as being condemned by the Department to obtain \"a drainage easement and a temporary construction easement\" for transportation purposes. (R.R. at 4-5.)

Third, in response to a question about replacing the 15-inch pipe with an 18-inch pipe, Engineer explained that while there was not \"a drainage issue per say [sic] with the capacity of the pipe[,]\" the Department's policy is that when it is installing a pipe that it is going to maintain, it does not \"go below 18 inches ... because anything below 18 inches [is] ... susceptible to blocking.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134-35.) He stated that because \"the inlet and outlet ends of the pipe were clearly substandard[,]\" the Department had to move the pipe and was replacing it with the 18-inch pipe in accordance with its policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135.) Similarly, Engineer explained that it was necessary to replace the existing 24-inch drain pipe with the new 42-inch drain pipe for a variety of environmental reasons, including to address water quality issues, decrease the velocity of water entering into the stream beneath the pipe, and to decrease sediment erosion into that stream. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127-28, 131-32.) Engineer opined, based on his years of experience constructing and maintaining these facilities, the topography involved in the Project, and the environmental and permit restrictions with which the Department must comply, that the Department was taking only the minimum amount necessary for the drainage easement and temporary construction easement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134.) The trial court credited Engineer's testimony. (Trial Ct. Op. at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As stated above, the purpose of this condemnation is to improve the safety along the Route 22 corridor by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , improving the drainage along that corridor, which qualifies it as a transportation purpose,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a public purpose, under Section 2003(e)(1) of The Administrative Code of 1929, 71 P.S. \u00a7 513(e)(1). The credited safety, drainage, and maintenance reasons identified by Engineer for moving the existing 15-inch pipe and replacing it with an 18-inch pipe, and for replacing the 24-inch pipe with the 42-inch pipe, along with his credited expert opinion that the drainage easement and temporary construction easement being condemned were the minimum necessary, support the trial court's conclusion that the condemnation here was for a public purpose and not an excessive taking. Thus, the trial court correctly overruled this PO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    D. Whether the condemnation is improper because it violates the Storm Water Act.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Condemnee last asserts the trial court erred in finding that the condemnation here will not violate the Storm Water Act. Condemnee argues that the Storm Water Act and accompanying regulations place the responsibility for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , maintaining storm water facilities and storm water management on those engaged in the alteration or development of the earth disturbance activity. He contends that these provisions are violated here because, although the Department is constructing the drainage pipes, the responsibility of maintaining those pipes is being transferred to Rails to Trails. The Department argues, in response, that this objection involves an issue collateral to the Declaration and, therefore, is not properly raised as a preliminary objection under the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The trial court overruled this PO because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , it is collateral to\n   the Declaration and, therefore, not properly raised as a preliminary objection to the taking. A challenge to a declaration of taking based on a taking's alleged violation of other statutes or regulations is collateral and not the proper subject of a preliminary objection in eminent domain proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Perry Twp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8316423\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/938/517/#p521\">\n    938 A.2d at 519, 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (claimed violation of the notice and publishing requirements for an ordinance under Section 1601 of The Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S. \u00a7 66601 );\n   <em>\n    Gaster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1385179\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/124/314/#p478\">\n    556 A.2d at 475, 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (taking alleged to violate state constitution and statutes and federal environmental statute and regulations);\n   <em>\n    In re Legislative Route 58018\n   </em>\n   , 31 Pa.Cmwlth. 275,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=375%20A.2d%201364\">\n    375 A.2d 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1367-68 (1977) (taking alleged to violate the environmental rights provision of the state constitution). Accordingly, the trial court correctly concluded that Condemnee's PO averring that the Declaration violates the Storm Water Act is a collateral issue not properly raised as a preliminary objection under the Eminent Domain Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because the Commonwealth has the sovereign authority to condemn private property for a public purpose, which includes the Department's power to condemn private property for transportation purposes, 71 P.S. \u00a7 513(e), and the taking identified in the Declaration is for a public purpose and is not excessive, the trial court correctly overruled those POs. Moreover, the trial court also correctly overruled those POs that involved objections that were collateral to this Declaration and, therefore, not the proper subjects of preliminary objections under the Code. Accordingly, the trial court's February 8, 2017 Order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    NOW\n   </strong>\n   , February 26, 2018, the February 8, 2017 Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County, entered in the above-captioned matter, is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The trial court also granted the Department's Motion for Writ of Possession and denied the Department's Motion to Dismiss Preliminary Objections to the taking as moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864,\n    <em>\n     as amended\n    </em>\n    , 32 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 680.1 -680.17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Pursuant to Section 306(a)(1), (3)(i), (iii) of the Eminent Domain Code, 26 Pa.
