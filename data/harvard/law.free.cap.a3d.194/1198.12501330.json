In the first action (support action), the Office of the Attorney General, on behalf of the Commissioner of Social Services (commissioner) and in the name of Shannon Doyle, filed a petition for support (support petition) against Shane Chaplen, the acknowledged father of Doyle's minor child. In the second action (custody action), Chaplen\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed an application for custody of the minor child, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56 and 46b-61. In the support action, Chaplen appeals from the judgment of nonpaternity rendered by the trial court following the granting of Doyle's motion to open the judgment of paternity by acknowledgement;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the custody action, Chaplen appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of Doyle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chaplen claims that the trial court erred in granting Doyle's motion to open the judgment of paternity in the support action for the purpose of declaring him not to be the father of the minor child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, he claims that the trial\n   court improperly (1) found\n   that Doyle signed the acknowledgment of paternity on the basis of a material mistake of fact, (2) concluded that opening the judgment was in the best interests of the minor child after making a clearly erroneous finding that there was no parent-like relationship between Chaplen and the minor child, and (3) applied the law regarding laches and equitable estoppel. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts and procedural history, as found by the trial court or as undisputed in the record, inform our resolution of Chaplen's appeal. On February 5, 2013, the Office of the Attorney General, on behalf of the commissioner and in the name of Doyle, filed a support petition against Chaplen, the acknowledged father of the minor child, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17b-745, formerly \u00a7 17-324, and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-215 and 46b-172. A copy of a fully executed acknowledgment of paternity, with the mother's affirmation of paternity, was attached to the support petition, which Chaplen and Doyle both had signed two days after the minor child was born.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"In the [support action], the [commissioner], in the name of ... Doyle, asserted in [the] ... support petition that [the minor child], born [in] [October, 2011],\n   was receiving Medicaid child support services. The petition asserted, further, that Chaplen is the acknowledged father of the minor child and that Chaplen had refused or neglected to support the minor child....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"On March 25, 2013, the court [rendered a judgment of support], order[ing] that Doyle and Chaplen were equally responsible for the minor child's health care costs. On August 20, 2014, Doyle filed her appearance in the [support action] and also filed a motion to open the judgment, asserting that she 'was not present at this case' and was seeking genetic testing to establish paternity.... By order dated December 8, 2014, the [f]amily [s]upport [m]agistrate ordered that the motion to open be addressed in the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"On May 29, 2014, Chaplen initiated the custody action, seeking sole legal custody of the minor child, primary residence with him, and child support payments from Doyle.... Thereafter, the parties agreed to the appointment of a guardian ad litem and also agreed to supervised visitation between Chaplen and the minor child who, as of the date of that first agreement, was two years of age.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Doyle, with the assistance of her mother, had a genetic test performed in or around September, 2014, which established that Chaplen is not the biological father of the child. The court found: \"On October 6, 2014, Doyle moved to modify the order of visitation .... Thereafter, the parties filed a series of motions regarding visitation and also reached a series of agreements allowing Chaplen visitation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 5, 2015, the court held a hearing on Doyle's motion to open, and Doyle was the only witness to testify. The parties agreed to bifurcate the proceedings, agreeing that the court first would address whether there had been a material\n   mistake of fact that would permit opening the judgment of paternity by\n   acknowledgment, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   before addressing whether equitable doctrines precluded opening the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the hearing, Doyle testified that she began to question whether Chaplen was the biological father when the minor child was approximately six months old. She claimed that when the child was approximately one year old, in October, 2012, the Department of Children and Families (DCF) became involved with her, and she expressed her doubts as to the paternity of the child at that time. Doyle testified that she had been asking for a genetic test \"since this all started,\" but Chaplen refused. She claimed that Chaplen had been aware of the possibility that he was not the child's father since the child was one year old because they had a meeting with DCF and discussed genetic testing at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Doyle further testified that, upon receiving advice from the guardian ad litem, she contacted Raymond Osterhoudt, the man whom she believed to be the child's biological father, and she brought the child and Osterhoudt to have a genetic test performed. The results of the genetic test confirmed that Osterhoudt is the biological father, and the results were admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court credited Doyle's testimony that she did not believe that Osterhoudt was the father when the child was born, finding that the basis for her \"belief that Chaplen, and not Osterhoudt, was the father of the minor child was that when Doyle was pregnant with the child, she had an ultrasound test that produced an indicator as to the number of weeks of the fetus' development. The technicians who performed the test explained to Doyle that the testing equipment measured the level of development of the fetus. Other technicians had given Doyle similar information with regard to one of Doyle's earlier pregnancies. Doyle took the information generated by the ultrasound equipment, counted [backward] on a calendar, and thereby concluded that she and Chaplen had had sexual relations at the time the child was conceived. Doyle had used this same method of determining the date of conception, on earlier occasions, with one or more of her other children.\" The court found that Doyle had established that there had been a material mistake of fact that warranted opening the judgment of paternity in the support action because Doyle \"received advice from medical technicians that she accepted and that she had no reason to doubt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following its finding that there had been a material mistake of fact, the court held three hearings, on June 25, September\n   24, and October 7, 2015, in order to address whether equitable principles barred opening the judgment, and whether opening the judgment was in the best interests of the minor child. At the June 25, 2015 hearing, Doyle called several witnesses, including Ashley Brady, Doyle's relative, Brianna Chase and Kaitlyn Vach, Doyle's sisters, and Osterhoudt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the hearing, Brady testified that Chaplen was not a consistent presence in the child's life prior to commencing the custody action. Chase testified that Doyle\n   and Chaplen had a hostile relationship, and that excluding Chaplen from the child's life would not be traumatic for the child because Chaplen had not been a consistent presence in the child's life. Chase also testified that, when the child was approximately one year old, she was present at the meeting with DCF when Doyle requested genetic testing. Vach testified that Chaplen did not have a parent-like relationship with the child; she explained that the relationship was more akin to a friendship. Osterhoudt testified that he knew he was the father of the child since the child was approximately one year old, because he and Doyle had purchased a genetic test at Walgreens and the results confirmed that he was the child's father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   He expressed his desire to support the child; although he acknowledged that he had not provided Doyle with child support when they initially discovered that he was the child's father; he testified that he wanted to support the child going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following Doyle's witnesses, \"the state introduced evidence that an employee of the Department of Social Services ( [department] ) [had] sent a notice, dated January 31, 2013, to Doyle advising her that there [would] be a hearing regarding child support ... on March 25, 2013. The [department] employee then relied on a brief internal notation [in the department's file] ... to conclude that she had spoken with Doyle by telephone on February 4, 2013, a call placed by Doyle that had been prompted by the January 31, 2013 notice. According to [the department's file], Doyle told the [department] employee that Doyle was receiving $100 per week [for]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   child support from Chaplen and that she was not seeking a support order. The [department] employee told Doyle that the state needed to obtain a support order and explained that to her. The [department's file] does not indicate whether the [department] employee told Doyle that the March hearing would be going forward, what role Doyle might play in such a hearing, or whether [the department] wanted or needed Doyle to appear at the hearing.\" (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Approximately three months after the June 25, 2015 hearing, on September 24, 2015, Chaplen presented his witnesses. The court heard testimony from the following witnesses: Chaplen, Cynthia Eastman, an employee at Litchfield Visitation Services; James Fournier, a department employee; Jessica LaMesa, Chaplen's former coworker; Patricia Chaplen, Chaplen's mother; JoAnn Maher, Chaplen's girlfriend; and Maureen Donahue, the guardian ad litem and attorney for the minor child. Chaplen testified that he had seen the child every week since the child was born, until May 22, 2014, when Doyle told him that he was not the father and that he\n   would never see the child again. Chaplen submitted several exhibits, including photocopies of money orders, which had been given to Doyle for child support, several photographs of the child, and a personalized calendar that contained photographs of the child for each month in the calendar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Chaplen also testified that he had claimed the child as a dependent on his 2013 tax return in order to obtain a larger refund. Chaplen explained that Doyle, because she had minimal taxable income in 2013, told him to claim the child as a dependent in order to maximize any tax refund. According to Chaplen, he gave Doyle half of his 2013 tax refund. The court, however, found that there was no evidence to support Chaplen's claim that Doyle told him to claim the child as a dependent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Chaplen then called Eastman, who had supervised the court-referred visitation between Chaplen and the child. Eastman testified that she \"observed a very close and affectionate relationship between\" Chaplen and the child. She recalled that, at the first meeting, the child hugged Chaplen and said that he missed Chaplen. Chaplen then called LaMesa, who testified that Doyle would come to the restaurant where Chaplen worked to pick up child support or food. Chaplen's mother testified that she had known the child since he was born, that she had developed a strong bond with him, and that he calls her \"grandma.\" Additionally, Chaplen called Maher, his girlfriend since September, 2012, who testified that she has a bedroom at her house for the child, and she many times babysits the child for Chaplen. Maher further testified that there is a parental bond between Chaplen and the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The last witness to testify was Donahue, whose testimony spanned two hearings, beginning on September 24, 2015, and concluding on October 7, 2015. Donahue testified that although Chaplen and Doyle disagreed as to whether Chaplen had an ongoing relationship with the child, after Chaplen provided her with photographs and videos of Chaplen and the child, she concluded that Chaplen had an ongoing relationship with the minor child until May, 2014. Donahue, however, also acknowledged that she knew \"nothing about [Chaplen's relationship with the child] from the time [the child] was born until [the fall of 2014] ... other than what [she] learned through pictures and conversations with [the] parties.\" Donahue further testified that it is in the child's best interests to preserve his relationship with Chaplen. Nevertheless, Donahue acknowledged that the child may require therapy in the future as a result of confusion regarding the identity of his father. Donahue also testified that if the court were to grant Doyle's motion to\n   open, then there would be no more controversy between Chaplen and Doyle affecting the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following the hearing on October 7, 2015, the court granted Doyle's motion to open, concluding that laches and equitable estoppel did not preclude the granting of the motion and that opening the judgment was in the best interests of the child. On November 30, 2015, on the basis of its findings in its November 25, 2015 memorandum of decision, the court rendered a judgment of nonpaternity in the support action. Thereafter, on December 3, 2015, Chaplen filed a motion to amend his custody application in order to seek the right of visitation in lieu of custody, which the court denied. The court stated that \"even if the request for leave to file the amended petition were not untimely, nonetheless, based on the evidence introduced, I still made the finding ... that [Chaplen] does not have a parent-like relationship\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   [with\n   the child].\" (Footnote added.) Accordingly, the court rendered judgment in favor of Doyle in the custody action. Chaplen filed a motion to reargue on December 15, 2015, which the court denied on December 16, 2015, and Donahue, on behalf of the minor child, filed a motion to reargue, which the court denied on December 17, 2015. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Chaplen claims that the court erred in granting Doyle's motion to open the judgment of paternity. Specifically, he claims that the court improperly: (1) found that Doyle signed the acknowledgment of paternity on the basis of a material mistake of fact; (2) concluded\n   that opening the judgment was in the best interests of the child after making a clearly erroneous finding that there was no parent-like relationship between Chaplen and the child; and (3) applied the law regarding laches and equitable estoppel. We address each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We begin by setting forth our standard of review and general legal principles relevant to Chaplen's claims. \"Whether proceeding under the common law or a statute, the action of a trial court in granting or refusing an application to open a judgment is, generally, within the judicial discretion of such court, and its action will not be disturbed on appeal unless it clearly appears that the trial court has abused its discretion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weiss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490794\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/617/#p98\">\n    176 Conn.

An acknowledgment ... may be challenged in court ... after the rescission period only on the basis of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact which may include evidence that he is not the father, with the burden of proof upon the challenger....\" Doyle and Chaplen signed the acknowledgment of paternity in October, 2011, and Doyle filed her motion to open on August 20, 2014, which was well beyond the sixty day rescission period. Accordingly, Doyle first needed to establish one of the three statutory grounds for challenging the acknowledgment in order for the court to have the authority to open the judgment of\n   paternity. Consequently, the court was required \"to make a factual determination before it [could] exercise its discretion to grant or deny the motion ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cornfield Associates Ltd.

The court credited Doyle's testimony that on the basis of several ultrasounds, which indicated the development of the fetus in weeks by measuring the size and growth of the fetus, she had calculated the date of conception and determined that she had only had relations with Chaplen during the time of conception. The court reasoned that Doyle had \"received advice from medical technicians that she accepted and that she had no reason to doubt.\" Therefore, the court found that Doyle, believing Chaplen was the father of the child, had signed the acknowledgment of paternity on the basis of a material mistake of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Chaplen argues that the court's findings do not support its conclusion that Doyle signed the acknowledgment of paternity on the basis of a material mistake of fact. Specifically, Chaplen argues that the court credited Doyle's testimony \"that she lived with Chaplen prior to the birth of the minor child, but that she had been seeing Osterhoudt around the time of the minor child's conception. She is the mother of five children. She knew, at the time the minor child was born, that it was\n   possible that Osterhoudt was the child's father, but she didn't think Osterhoudt was the father when the child was born [in] [October, 2011].\" According to Chaplen, because Doyle knew that it was\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   that Chaplen was not the father, she cannot claim that she signed the acknowledgment\n   on the basis of a material mistake of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In support of this claim, Chaplen relies on a Superior Court decision,\n   <em>\n    Colonghi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arcarese\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Middlesex, Docket No. FA-13-4016846-S (Jan. 10, 2014) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20444\">\n    57 Conn.

In\n   <em>\n    Colonghi\n   </em>\n   , the defendant, the mother of the minor child, sought to open the judgment of paternity by acknowledgment after the rescission period on the basis of either a material mistake of fact or duress. Id., at 444-45. The defendant had been involved with two men during the period of conception and the court found that \"[o]nly [the defendant] was in a position to credibly assess the possibility and questions of paternity ....\" Id., at 446. The court reasoned that \"[w]ishful thinking is not a material mistake of fact which can later be used to avoid an unpleasant obligation.\" Id. Relying on contract principles, the court concluded that the defendant bore the risk of the mistake, and that \"it would be unconscionable ... to permit her to take advantage of a situation she herself [had] brought about.\" Id., at 447. Thus, the court denied the defendant's motion to open the judgment of paternity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the present case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Colonghi\n   </em>\n   , the court found that Doyle's belief that Chaplen was the father of the child was reasonable because she relied on the ultrasounds and the advice she received from medical technicians. The court did not conclude that Doyle had signed the acknowledgment of paternity on the basis of \"wishful thinking,\" but rather that Doyle, relying on information that she had \"no reason to doubt,\" believed\n   Chaplen was the father of the minor child. Thus, Chaplen's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Colonghi\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We conclude that Doyle's testimony, which the trial court credited, supports the court's finding that she signed the acknowledgment on the basis of a material mistake of fact. Accordingly, the trial court's finding was not clearly erroneous.

He is more of a friend or infrequent caretaker than a father.... [The guardian ad litem] agreed that if the judgment in the support [action] is opened, the controversy among Doyle, Chaplen, and [the child] will finally end. She agreed that [the child], an affectionate child, could establish with anyone the same type of relationship that he has with Chaplen.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Chaplen claims that \"[t]he weight of the evidence presented must result in a finding that the [t]rial [c]ourt's finding was clearly erroneous and requires reversal. The totality of the testimony should have resulted in the [c]ourt's finding that ... Doyle and\n   much of the testimony she elicited from her witnesses was not credible.\" Chaplen argues that \"[t]he [guardian ad litem's] findings and the testimony of ... Eastman of Litchfield Visitation Services were clear that a significant relationship existed between the minor child and ... Chaplen prior to the reestablishment of visits through ... [c]ourt order.... Doyle and each of her witnesses painted a picture completely at odds with what the professionals concluded from their investigation.\" He further argues that opening the judgment of paternity \"is clearly not in the best interest[s] of the minor child ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Similarly, Donahue, on behalf of the minor child, argues that the court \"gave no credit to the testimony of the ... court appointed [g]uardian ad [l]item\n   .... The [c]ourt did not acknowledge the testimony that the child had a significant relationship with Chaplen prior to the court's involvement-with the blessing of the mother.... And that that relationship continued unaltered by absences caused by Doyle ... wherein the witness as well as others testified that the child was clearly attached to Chaplen.\" (Citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On the basis of the record before us, we conclude that the trial court's finding that Chaplen does not have a parent-like relationship with the minor child is not clearly erroneous because there is ample evidence to support it. Brady, Doyle's relative, testified that Chaplen was not a consistent presence in the minor child's life prior to his filing the custody action. Doyle's sister, Vach, testified that Chaplen did not have a parent-like relationship with the minor child, that their relationship is more like \"a friend type deal.\" To be sure, there is evidence that could have supported a finding that Chaplen did have a parent-like relationship with the minor child, including Donahue's testimony. Nevertheless, \"it is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to weigh the conflicting evidence, determine the credibility of witnesses and determine whether to accept some, all or none of a witness' testimony.\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Palkimas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Conn.%20App.%20129\">\n    159 Conn.

Essentially, Chaplen argues that he suffered\n   financial and emotional detriment, and, by allowing Doyle to open\n   the judgment of paternity, he will continue to suffer emotional detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court found that Chaplen had failed to establish either element of equitable estoppel. First, the court found that there was no evidence demonstrating that Doyle had engaged in any misleading conduct because \"[b]oth Doyle and Chaplen mistakenly believed that [Chaplen] was [the minor child's] father, and they both had a basis for that mistaken belief.\" Doyle, whose testimony the court credited, testified that she did not begin to question that belief until the child was approximately six months old. Moreover, she claimed that Chaplen had been aware of the possibility that he was not the father of the minor child since the child was approximately one year old. Doyle also testified that Chaplen was present at the meeting with DCF when Doyle expressed her doubts about the child's paternity, which occurred when the child was approximately one year old. Thus, the court's finding that Doyle did not mislead Chaplen is supported by evidence in the record that Doyle told Chaplen that he may not be the father of the minor child within months of when she first had doubts as to the child's paternity, and before the state filed the support action against Chaplen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, the court concluded that \"[t]o the extent that Chaplen has been prejudiced ... that prejudice is limited to minimal payments of child support ....\" The court further concluded that those payments were off-set by the income tax refund that Chaplen received for 2013 when he claimed the child as a dependent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court found that Chaplen had failed to meet his burden to prove that he suffered prejudice\n   as a result of his reliance on Doyle's alleged misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court also considered whether the child would suffer emotional and financial detriment as a result of opening the judgment of paternity. The court found that if Chaplen were to be removed from the minor child's life, the child would not suffer \"significant-if any-adverse emotional effects ... as he matures.\" As to potential financial detriment to the child, the court reasoned that Osterhoudt, the child's biological father, was \"available as a source of financial support for the minor child.\" Specifically, the court found that Osterhoudt \"wants to meet his obligations as [the minor child's] father\" and that he \"has the potential to be a presence in [the minor child's] life and to provide the child with financial and emotional support.\" The court further found \"that the current situation is profoundly confusing to the child and, if not corrected, will lead to further confusion going forward.\" Those factual findings are supported by the record, and therefore they are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court's factual findings and legal conclusions are sufficiently supported by the record. We therefore conclude that the court properly determined that Doyle was not equitably estopped from opening the judgment of paternity after finding that Chaplen failed to meet his burden of establishing each element of equitable estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the court had the authority to open the judgment of paternity under \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (2) because the court found that Doyle signed the\n   acknowledgment on the basis of a material mistake of fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also conclude that court's findings are not clearly erroneous, and that the court's legal conclusions regarding equitable estoppel and laches are consistent with those findings and are legally and logically correct.
