We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In his complaint, the plaintiff alleges the following: He is a commercial fisherman, and the defendant is a\n   seasonal shell fisherman. On December 14, 2011, the defendant stated to Jeffrey Samorajczyk and Todd Aaron Chemacki, enforcement officers with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (department), whom the plaintiff also brought an action against in their individual capacities; see footnote 1 of this opinion; that the plaintiff was trespassing on the defendant's clam beds and stealing his clams. The defendant knew that the plaintiff \"was innocent,\" however. As a result of the defendant's statements to the enforcement officers, the plaintiff was arrested on charges for which he later was found not guilty. The plaintiff suffered economic losses by having to defend himself, and he suffered anxiety and humiliation. The defendant also told a reporter for the Hartford Courant (reporter), following the plaintiff's arrest: \"I nailed him, and I nailed him good.\" On the basis of these facts, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was liable for slander for his statements to the enforcement officers and for his statement to the reporter, and he was liable for malicious prosecution\n   for reporting the plaintiff's alleged conduct to the enforcement officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In response to the plaintiff's complaint, the defendant filed an answer and two special defenses. In his first special defense, which addressed both the slander count and the malicious prosecution count, the defendant claimed that his statements to the enforcement officers and the reporter were privileged because they \"were made in good faith, without malice, in an honest belief in the truth of the statement, and in discharge of a public or private duty.\" Specifically, as to the allegation that he had slandered the plaintiff by his comment to the reporter, the defendant claimed that this statement also was privileged because it was his opinion, which was based on a true fact. In his second special defense, which specifically addressed the malicious prosecution count, the defendant claimed that he had\n   acted lawfully and with probable cause under the circumstances, and that he acted without malice, merely intending to bring the plaintiff to justice using the proper legal channels to report his information. The plaintiff pleaded a general denial in response to these defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 7, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Specifically, as to count one, slander, the defendant argued that his statements to the enforcement officers were \"subject to qualified immunity and [were] not made with malice ....\" As to his statement to the reporter, he argued that this statement was \"privileged and does not qualify as defamation since ... [it] was an opinion and statements\n   of opinion are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   considered slanderous.\" (Emphasis in original.) As to count two, malicious prosecution, the defendant argued that \"he did not initiate or procure the institution of criminal proceedings against the plaintiff, he acted with probable cause, and there was no malice.\" In support of his motion for summary judgment, the defendant submitted: his own affidavit; the plaintiff's December 24, 2014 responses to interrogatories and requests for production; affidavits of Samorajczyk and Chemacki; deposition excerpts of the plaintiff's workers, Hector Avila,\n   Santos Bertrand, and Sandoval Maynor; and an excerpt from the plaintiff's deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff filed an opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, arguing that there were issues of material fact as to both remaining counts of his complaint. He attached, in support of his opposition: excerpts of testimony from his criminal trial; the affidavits of Samorajczyk and Chemacki; portions of the plaintiff's deposition; the misdemeanor summons issued to him; the transcript of the department's emergency dispatch call from the defendant and its dispatch call to enforcement officers;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the reporter's article, which had been published in the Hartford Courant. Oral argument on the motion and the objection thereto was heard on September 12, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 27, 2016, the trial court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. As to the cause of action sounding in slander for the defendant's statements to the enforcement officers, the court concluded that the statements were entitled to a qualified privilege because they were made to law enforcement, in good faith and without malice, after the defendant saw the plaintiff, through binoculars, on his shellfishing\n   lot. As to the defendant's statement to the reporter, which was made after the plaintiff had been arrested, the court concluded, in relevant part, that this statement was entitled to the \"fair comment\" privilege as a statement of opinion on a matter of public concern namely, the plaintiff's arrest, and that the statement amounted to the defendant's opinion of what had occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, as to the plaintiff's count for malicious prosecution, the court concluded that, on the basis of the sworn affidavits of the arresting enforcement officers, attesting that there was probable cause to support the arrest of the plaintiff, and the absence of any evidence from the plaintiff that was contrary to those attestations, the defendant did not initiate or procure the criminal proceedings against the plaintiff, and that the arrest and prosecution were based on independent findings of probable cause by the enforcement officers. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The standard of review of a trial court's decision granting summary judgment is well established. Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of\n   any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled\n   to judgment as a matter of law.... Our review of the trial court's decision to grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment is plenary....

He argues that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the\n   defendant had acted with malice when he (1) reported to the enforcement officers that the plaintiff was trespassing on his clam beds and stealing his clams, and (2) when he provided a statement to the reporter.

The plaintiff concedes that the statements to the enforcement officers were entitled to protection by a qualified privilege. He contends, however, that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the privilege could be defeated because the defendant's statements were made with malice. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to produce any evidence to substantiate his malice assertion while, in contrast, the defendant produced various affidavits and other evidence that demonstrate that he had a reasonable and good faith belief that the plaintiff was trespassing and stealing when he spoke with the enforcement officers. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Among the evidence submitted by the defendant in support of his motion for summary judgment was his own affidavit in which he averred, in relevant part, that: he leased shellfishing lot 562 in the Long Island Sound, he has used that lot for several years, and he is very familiar with its location from the coast; he watches boats from the shoreline, through his binoculars, and he has viewed boat activity crossing his leased lot; on December 14, 2011, he was looking at Long Island Sound through his binoculars when he saw the plaintiff's boat, operated by the plaintiff, harvesting clams on lot 562, and he observed this activity for more than thirty minutes; on the basis of these observations, he called the department and reported what he had witnessed; and enforcement officers later arrived at the boat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant also submitted the affidavit of Chemacki, which provided in relevant part: he has been an enforcement officer with the department since 1999; he enforces shellfishing laws on Long Island Sound; on December 14, 2011, he and Samorajczyk responded, in uniform and by police boat, to a complaint that had been made to the department dispatch regarding commercial shellfishing activity; he saw a boat, actively harvesting shellfish with its dredge in water, pulling up clams on\n   a conveyer belt, with workers engaged in activity in the sorting area; the boat was being operated by the plaintiff; he recorded GPS navigation coordinates, which showed the boat to be on lot 562, which was leased by the defendant; the plaintiff could not produce his shellfishing license, which he was required to keep on board the boat while engaged in harvesting shellfish; and he concluded that there was probable cause that the plaintiff had engaged in activity that violated the law, including harvesting shellfish while on lot 562.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant also submitted the affidavit of Samorajczyk, which provided in relevant part: he has been employed as an enforcement officer for the department since 1999 and he enforces the shellfishing laws along Long Island Sound; on December 14, 2011, he responded to a complaint that had been received by dispatch regarding commercial shellfishing; he contacted the defendant by telephone; the defendant told him that the plaintiff was actively harvesting clams on the defendant's lot; he saw the plaintiff's boat actively harvesting shellfish with its dredge in water, pulling up clams on a conveyer belt, with workers sorting the clams; the plaintiff was operating the boat; he asked the plaintiff where he was harvesting, and the plaintiff responded that he was harvesting on lot 44 but that he was off lot by a couple hundred feet; the plaintiff did not have a shellfishing license onboard; and he concluded that there was probable cause to arrest the\n   plaintiff for, among other things, illegally harvesting clams on lot 562.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendant also attached the deposition testimony of some of the plaintiff's workers, including Avila. In his deposition, Avila stated in relevant part that they had been actively harvesting clams up until when the enforcement officers approached the boat. He further testified that the conveyor belt that brought the clams from the ocean floor onto the deck of the boat was\n   running until the enforcement officers boarded the boat, known as the Mighty Maxx. Bertrand and Maynor testified similarly in their respective depositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff submitted, among other things, a portion of the defendant's testimony from the plaintiff's criminal trial, which provided in relevant part: the defendant, while standing on the shoreline with binoculars, saw the plaintiff's boat from approximately 500 yards away; he could see the plaintiff operating the boat; he saw that both dredges were on the bottom and that the workers were culling clams; the boat was moving; the size of the defendant's lot is twenty acres; the boat was moving in and out of the entire twenty acres; he watched the boat for approximately one hour; and he called the department and reported what he saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The plaintiff also submitted a portion of his own testimony from his criminal trial, which provided in relevant part: he was off his lot on the day in question because he was turning around his boat; while he was turning around his boat, the dredge was up, off the bottom; there is a lot of speculation about the operation of his boat because it has new technology that is unfamiliar to most fishermen; and he was not clamming off his lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiff also submitted a portion of his own deposition testimony, which provided in relevant part: he was not harvesting clams or using the dredge when the enforcement officers approached the boat, but there were residual clams still making their way to the belt, which is twenty-seven feet long; he was not on the defendant's lot; and the defendant falsely and maliciously told enforcement officers that the plaintiff was trespassing on his clam beds and stealing his clams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiff also submitted the Hartford Courant article on his arrest and prosecution, and he submitted\n   an unauthenticated transcript of the dispatch report from the department, which the court declined to consider. See footnote 3 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we conclude that the plaintiff submitted no evidence in response to that submitted by the defendant to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant abused his privilege by acting with malice when he reported to the enforcement officers that the plaintiff was trespassing on his shellfishing lot and stealing his clams. The defendant submitted an affidavit in which he attested that he saw the plaintiff, through binoculars, operating his boat on the defendant's shellfishing lot and that he saw that clams were being harvested on the boat. The defendant then reported what he saw to the department and to enforcement officers, who responded by going to the plaintiff's boat. The officers attested that the plaintiff, in fact, was on the defendant's lot and that he was shellfishing on that lot. The enforcement officers also determined that there was probable cause to support an arrest of the plaintiff for, among other things, shellfishing on the defendant's lot. The plaintiff's workers also testified at their depositions that they had been harvesting\n   clams right up until when the enforcement officers approached the boat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the plaintiff submitted evidence that could demonstrate that he was not actively shellfishing on the defendant's lot at the time of the defendant's complaint to the department, that evidence did nothing to demonstrate that the defendant did not have a reasonable and good faith belief that the plaintiff, in fact, was shellfishing on lot 562. The plaintiff principally relies on three pieces of evidence from which he claims a reasonable jury could draw an inference of malice. First, he argues that the defendant had no basis for his statement that the Mighty Maxx' dredges were on the ocean\n   floor because it was impossible for the defendant to see the ocean floor from where he was standing on the shore. Although this is true, the plaintiff ignores his own testimony that his boat had such advanced technology that other fishermen did not understand it. In fact, in his appellate brief, the plaintiff explains that \"the Mighty Maxx was unlike any conventional clamming boat. It looked like something out of another universe. Most fishermen were not familiar with how it operated.\" Without some evidence that the defendant knew of the Mighty Maxx' advanced technology, there would be no basis for a jury to conclude that the defendant acted with reckless disregard of the truth when he opined, on the basis of his observations, through binoculars, that the dredges of the plaintiff's boat were on the ocean floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, the plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant's statement that he saw the conveyor belt moving demonstrates malice because it was impossible for the defendant to see the conveyor belt from the shore due to the physical characteristics of the Mighty Maxx. The plaintiff's contention is without merit because the defendant never made such a statement. At the plaintiff's criminal trial, the defendant testified to seeing the plaintiff's workers \"culling clams on the table.\" When asked what that meant, the defendant testified that it meant \"sorting them out on a table as they came up ... in the dredge or in the suction dredge on the conveyor.\" Consequently, the defendant's statement was based on his observations of the workers, not on any observation of the workings of the boat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Third, the plaintiff relies on the defendant's statement to the reporter that he \"nailed [the plaintiff and] nailed him good\" as evidence of the defendant's malice. We are not persuaded. To the extent that statement was based on the plaintiff's reasonable conclusion from his observations as discussed previously, the statement is not evidence of actual malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the reasonableness of the defendant's conclusion from his observations was confirmed by the enforcement officers, who, after going onto the boat, observing harvesting taking place, confirming the position of the plaintiff's boat on the defendant's lot, and interviewing the plaintiff's workers, who said they were actively harvesting until the officers arrived, found probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for shellfishing on lot 562. Accordingly, we\n   agree with the trial court that there was no evidence that the defendant abused his privilege by acting with malice when he reported to the enforcement officers that the plaintiff was trespassing on his shellfishing lot and stealing his clams. Summary judgment on this claim was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Defendant's Statement to the Reporter\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The plaintiff also claims that the court improperly rendered summary judgment on his slander claim based on the defendant's statement to the reporter, after concluding that the statement was an opinion on a matter of public concern, protected by the fair comment privilege. The plaintiff asserts that this was an error in law because the statement was one of fact, rather than opinion. He contends that, when making this statement, the defendant was stating, as a matter of fact, that the plaintiff was a poacher. The defendant argues that his\n   statement to the reporter is privileged and that it does not qualify as defamation because it expresses his opinion on a matter of public importance, namely, the plaintiff's arrest and criminal trial, and, therefore, that the court properly determined that it was protected as fair comment.

He states: \"In this context, to 'nail' means 'to catch, trap ... to detect and expose.' \" Accepting the definition provided by the plaintiff, it appears clear to us that the defendant was telling the reporter that he was the person responsible for alerting the authorities to the plaintiff's activities; he detected those activities and exposed them to the enforcement officers, which is exactly what the parties agree happened in this case. Consequently, the defendant was stating a fact of what had happened, as opposed to an opinion of what might happen at the plaintiff's criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We already have concluded that the plaintiff provided no evidence of malice in the defendant's report to the enforcement officers, and that the facts demonstrate that, after the enforcement officers conducted their own investigation, those officers found probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. See part I A of this opinion. Although the plaintiff after a criminal trial was found not guilty by a jury, that finding does not have any effect on the fact that the defendant, in good faith, reported the plaintiff's actions to the enforcement officers, even if it ultimately turned out that the state could not prove the resultant criminal charges against the plaintiff, and, further, even if the defendant had misconstrued the situation he reported, perhaps because of the advanced technology in the plaintiff's boat. By virtue of the uncontested facts of this case, as well as our analysis in part I A of this opinion, there is nothing false in the defendant's statement to the reporter; the defendant did alert the authorities to what he had seen, which, then, after investigation, prompted the plaintiff's arrest, which was based on probable cause. Accordingly, because the uncontested facts establish the truth of the defendant's statement of fact, the plaintiff's slander claim is barred. See\n   <em>\n    Goodrich\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury Republican-American, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"674292\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/188/107/#p114\">\n    188 Conn. at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20A.2d%201317\">\n    448 A.2d 1317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]e need not inquire further, however, since the plaintiff conceded ... that these statements were true, and this concession creates an absolute bar to his claim of libel as to these statements\").

The defendant also argues that the plaintiff produced no evidence that he pressured the enforcement officers or that his report was based on anything other than a reasonable and good faith belief that the\n   plaintiff was trespassing and illegally harvesting the defendant's clams. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"An action for malicious prosecution against a private person requires a plaintiff to prove that: (1) the defendant initiated or procured the institution of criminal proceedings against the plaintiff; (2) the criminal proceedings have terminated in favor of the plaintiff; (3) the defendant acted without probable cause; and (4) the defendant acted with malice, primarily for a purpose other than that of bringing an offender to justice.... The law governing malicious prosecution seeks to accommodate two competing and ultimately irreconcilable interests. It acknowledges that a person wrongly charged with criminal conduct has an important stake in his bodily freedom and his reputation, but that the community as a whole has an even more important stake in encouraging private citizens to assist public officers in the enforcement of the criminal law.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bhatia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Debek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733973\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/397/#p404\">\n    287 Conn. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404-405,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=948%20A.2d%201009\">\n    948 A.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Having concluded in part I A of this opinion that the defendant produced evidence that he had acted with probable cause and without malice in reporting the plaintiff's activities to the enforcement officers, and that the plaintiff produced no counterevidence, we conclude that the plaintiff, as a matter of law, cannot establish\n   that the court improperly rendered summary judgment on this count of his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In this opinion ELGO, J., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   I concur in the result, but write separately to express my disagreement with one aspect of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The majority concludes that the statement made by the defendant Christopher Andrew Walston\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to a reporter-\"I nailed him, and I nailed him good\"-is a statement of fact, as claimed by the plaintiff, Nicholas Crismale, not a statement of opinion, as asserted by the defendant, but is not defamatory. The majority opinion states that \"it appears clear to us that the defendant was telling the reporter that he was the person responsible for alerting the authorities to the plaintiff's activities; he detected those activities and exposed them to the enforcement officers, which is exactly what the parties agree happened in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   I do not agree. In my view, the statement could be viewed as a statement of fact or a statement of opinion or an amalgam of both. It could be viewed as a statement of fact if interpreted to mean: \"I am responsible for his arrest.\" However, to conclude that it is\n   <em>\n    merely\n   </em>\n   a statement of fact, the majority engages in some creative interpretation of the statement. The statement can be viewed as, in part, expressing an opinion because stating that you have \"nailed\" someone \"good\" does not seem to be merely a statement of objectively verifiable fact; rather, it also carries the broader implication that\n   a bad person is getting his or her just desserts by being harshly and deservedly punished. It is factual insofar as it states that the defendant's actions caused the plaintiff to be arrested; but it carries an implication of opinion insofar as it expresses the speaker's\n   view that someone who\n   <em>\n    ought\n   </em>\n   to be punished\n   <em>\n    is being\n   </em>\n   punished. It is, in other words, not a mere factual assertion, but also a gleeful proclamation that justice has been done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In determining whether a statement is fact or opinion, which is a question of law; see\n   <em>\n    Goodrich\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury Republican-American, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"674292\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/188/107/#p114\">\n    188 Conn. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20A.2d%201317\">\n    448 A.2d 1317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) ; context is critical. \"To determine whether a statement constitutes protected opinion or actionable fact, courts consider the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as: (1) the specific language used; (2) whether the statement is verifiable; (3) the general context of the statement; and (4) the broader context in which the statement appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"The emphasis in the test for determining the actionability of an allegedly defamatory statement of opinion is whether the statement contains an objectively verifiable assertion.
