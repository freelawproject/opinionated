Thomas (\"Husband\"), appeals from the order entered in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, which found Husband in civil contempt of the court's September 16, 2016 order and imposed sanctions in the form of counsel fees in favor of Appellee, Victoria C. Thomas (\"Wife\"). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court opinion sets forth the relevant facts and procedural history of this case as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties were formally married. They have two (2) minor children. The parties were divorced pursuant to a Divorce Decree dated January 11, 2016. The Divorce Decree incorporated a settlement agreement (\"PSA\") that was placed on the record before Equitable Distribution Master Bruce Goldenberg on December 17, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to the PSA, [Husband] agreed to transfer assets totaling $575,000 to [Wife]. The $575,000 was to be distributed to [Wife] as follows: (1) $50,000 in accounts or assets that [Wife] had received as of the date of the PSA on December 17, 2015; (2) one-half of [Husband's] TD IRA account in the amount of $101,000; (3) one-half of [Husband's] TIAA-CREF account in the amount of $35,000; (4) three-fourths of the parties' joint TD stock account in the amount of $270,000; and (5) remaining $119,000 payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 21, 2016, [Wife] filed an Emergency Petition for Contempt of Court and to Enforce Property Settlement Agreement (\"Petition\"). In this Petition, [Wife] alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that [Husband] had failed to effectuate transfer of the amounts due to her pursuant to the terms of the PSA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 13, 2016, [Husband] filed an Answer to [Wife's] Petition as well as a Counterclaim. [Husband] contended that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , he had made all the transfers that were required pursuant to the PSA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 15, 2016, [the court] conducted a hearing regarding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the following: (1) [Wife's] Emergency Petition for Contempt of Court and to Enforce Property Settlement Agreement and (2) [Husband's] Answer and Counterclaim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   From the evidence presented on September 15, 2016, [the court] determined that of the $575,000 that [Husband] was required to pay [Wife] pursuant to the PSA, [Wife] had received the following: (1) $100,000.00 cash, (2) $101,000.00 which represents one-half of [Husband's] TD IRA account, and (3) $273,422.57, which represents 100% of the value of the parties' joint TD stock account.\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   The total amount received by [Wife] from these three (3) sources is $474,422.57.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T., 9/15/16, Exhibit XW-3. The parties stipulated that [Wife] received this amount from the parties' joint TD stock account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   At the time of the hearing on September 15, 2016, the parties had yet to finalize a QDRO with respect to [Husband's] TIAA-CREF account. It is anticipated that one-half of this account will be approximately $35,000 to $37,000. (N.T., 9/15/16, pp. 38, 81).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   We issued an Order dated September 16, 2016,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   that directed [Husband] to pay to [Wife] cash in the amount of $62,000 within 30 days of the date of the Order. That would leave a balance of $38,577.43 to be paid to [Wife] from [Husband's] TIAA-CREF account via a QDRO. If one-half of the TIAA-CREF account is more than $38,577.43, then we directed [Wife] to pay the balance to [Husband] within 30 days. Conversely, if one-half of the TIAA-CREF account is less than $38,577.43, then we directed [Husband] to pay the difference to [Wife] within 30 days so that [Wife] is paid a total of $575,000 as stated in the PSA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 19, 2016, [Husband] filed an appeal from our Order dated September 16, 2016.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [No.] 3320 EDA 2016. Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), we issued our Opinion (dated December 14, 2016) in support of our Order dated September 16, 2016. By Order filed on April 28, 2017, the Superior Court dismissed that appeal because [Husband] had failed to file an appellate brief by April 19, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Meanwhile, on] November 23, 2016, [Wife] filed an Emergency Petition for Contempt and to Enforce the PSA. In this Emergency Petition, [Wife] alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that [Husband] was in contempt of the Order dated September 16, 2016, because he failed to pay her the $62,000 cash payment that was set forth in that Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 2, 2016, [Wife] filed a Petition for Special Relief in which she requested the [c]ourt to permit each party to claim one child as a tax exemption on their respective tax returns.\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   During the hearing on February 23, 2017, the parties stipulated that each party would claim one child as a tax exemption. (N.T., 2/23/17, p. 112).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 13, 2017, [Husband] filed an Answer and Counterclaim. On January 23, 2017, [Husband] filed an Addendum\n   to the Counterclaim he had filed on January 13, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 23, 2017, we conducted a hearing regarding: (1) [the] 11/23/16 Emergency Petition for Contempt and to Enforce the PSA filed by [Wife], (2) [the] 12/2/16 Petition for Special Relief filed by [Wife], (3) [the] 1/13/17 Answer and Counterclaim filed by [Husband], and (4) [the] 1/23/17 Addendum to the Counterclaim filed by [Husband].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing on February 23, 2017, we found [Husband] in contempt of the Order dated September 16, 2016 because he had failed to pay\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of the $62,000 he was required to pay to [Wife] pursuant to the terms of that Order. We issued an Order dated March 2, 2017 that directed [Husband] to pay $62,000 to [Wife's] counsel, by certified check, bank check, or money order no later than noon on Friday, March 3, 2017. Furthermore, the Order directed [Husband] to pay [Wife's] counsel fees in the amount of $10,000 no later than March 31, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   We received correspondence from [Wife's] counsel, dated March 7, 2017 stating that he had received a cashier's check from [Husband] in the amount of $62,000.00 on the afternoon of March 2, 2017....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 10, 2017, [Husband] filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated March 2, 2017. By Order dated March 27, 2017, we denied the Motion for Reconsideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 31, 2017, [Husband] filed the instant appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Trial Court Opinion, dated May 25, 2017, at 1-5). Procedurally, we add that the trial court did not order Husband to file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), and Husband filed none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On appeal, Husband raises the following issues for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE [TRIAL] COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO ALLOW EX-HUSBAND TO DEFEND THE CONTEMPT PETITION FOR UNPAID MONIES DUE EX-WIFE UNDER THEIR PROPERTY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, GIVEN THAT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   -EX-WIFE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ESTOPPED FROM SEEKING EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR \"UNCLEAN HANDS\" BECAUSE SHE FALSELY TESTIFIED TO THE COURT AT AN EARLIER HEARING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF MONIES SHE HAD ALREADY RECEIVED FROM EX-HUSBAND, RESULTING IN AN OVERPAYMENT OF OVER $25,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   -THE COURT WAS TAINTED AGAINST EX-HUSBAND BY FORMER COUNSEL'S IMPERMISSIBLE USE OF A PRIVILEGED E-MAIL GIVING THE IMPRESSION EX-HUSBAND WAS AT FAULT FOR THE DELAY IN ORIGINALLY PAYING EX-WIFE;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   -THE COURT PERMITTED FORMER COUNSEL TO UNILATERALLY STIPULATE TO AN INCORRECT AMOUNT EX-HUSBAND HAD PAID EX-WIFE, REFUSING TO ALLOW EX-HUSBAND TO OBJECT TO THE STIPULATION AND BINDING HIM TO THE STIPULATION WITHOUT HIS CONSENT; AND\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   -THE COURT'S RULING THAT THE AGREEMENT BY EX-HUSBAND'S THEN-COUNSEL TO ACCEPT A STOCK TRANSFER VALUE-EVEN IF INCORRECT-ABSOLVED EX-WIFE OF ANY \"UNCLEAN HANDS\" ALLOWS EX-WIFE TO PROFIT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   FROM HER DECEIT AND OFFENDS THE PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE [TRIAL] COURT [ERRED] IN ASSESSING A $10,000 CONTEMPT SANCTION AGAINST EX-HUSBAND, GIVEN THAT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   -THE SANCTION GIVES EX-WIFE A WINDFALL REWARD FOR GIVING FALSE TESTIMONY AND DECEIVING THE COURT; AND\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   -THE SANCTION IS GROSSLY EXCESSIVE AND PUNITIVE FOR A SIMPLE \"FAILURE TO PAY\" CONTEMPT SANCTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Husband's Brief at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In his issues combined, Husband first argues Wife falsely testified at the September 2016 hearing and knowingly provided an incorrect value of the parties' joint TD stock account. Husband contends Wife obtained a windfall in the amount of $25,000.00 as a result of her inaccurate testimony. Husband avers Wife's \"unclean hands\" served as a valid defense to her contempt petition. Husband submits the trial court erred in refusing to consider Wife's misrepresentations at both the September 2016 hearing and the February 2017 contempt hearing. Husband claims Wife's deceitful conduct during the September 2016 hearing should have precluded her second petition for contempt, this time to enforce the September 2016 order, plus sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Next, Husband asserts that at the September 2016 hearing, his counsel unilaterally stipulated to Wife's incorrect valuation of the joint TD stock account, and duped the court into accepting that value. Husband contends his counsel's unauthorized stipulation at the September 2016 hearing should not defeat his claim of Wife's \"unclean hands,\" absolve Wife of her \"unclean hands,\" or allow her to profit from her deceit, which offends the proper administration of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Husband also complains the court's award of counsel fees was excessive and unwarranted. Specifically, Husband avers the drafting and modification of a contempt petition is not a complex legal matter, and the sanction of $10,000.00 for counsel fees was inappropriate. Husband relies on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sutch v. Roxborough Memorial Hospital\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784588,12486206\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/38/\">\n    142 A.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Super. 2016),\n   <em>\n    appeal denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20Pa.%20378\">\n    640 Pa. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317658,12317651,12317670\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/399/\">\n    163 A.3d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), to support his contention that the amount of attorney's fees awarded was arbitrary, gratuitous, and punitive under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Further, Husband insists the trial court's dislike for and bias against him played a substantial role in the amount of harsh sanctions imposed. For these reasons, Husband concludes this Court should vacate the trial court's contempt order and remand the matter for a new contempt hearing, where he can present evidence of Wife's \"unclean hands.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On appeal from an order holding a party in contempt of court, our scope of review is very narrow, and we place great reliance on the court's discretion.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Garr v.

The record supports the court's decision to hold Husband in contempt of the court's September 2016 order.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mrozek,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9482879\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/780/670/#p673\">\n      supra.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   With respect to Husband's arguments related to the September 15, 2016 hearing,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , his argument regarding Wife's testimony at the September 2016 hearing, counsel's alleged unauthorized stipulation at that hearing on the value of the joint TD stock account, and the court's purported bias against Husband, as allegedly illustrated by the court's preclusion of evidence at that hearing, these claims are not properly before us now. Husband filed an appeal from the September 2016 order, but he did not pursue the appeal with diligence, which caused this Court to dismiss his appeal for his failure to file an appellate brief. As a result, Husband squandered his right to obtain appellate review of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Further, in the contempt proceedings of February 23, 2017, Wife established (1) Husband had notice of the September 15, 2016 order that Husband disobeyed and the order was specific and directed Husband to pay Wife $62,000.00 by a date certain, which Husband did not do; (2) Husband had the ability to pay and chose not to pay; and (3) Husband deliberately and willfully disobeyed the court's order, so as to deny Wife any of the additional funds.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MacDougall,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20890\">\n      supra.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Thus, Wife's evidence was more than just a \"mere showing of noncompliance.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Habjan,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7306707\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/73/630/#p637\">\n      supra.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Therefore, we reject Husband's current efforts to resurrect his lost claims as \"defenses\" and \"counterclaims\" to Wife's contempt petition, because they are invalid justifications in the current proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Regarding Husband's distress over the amount of counsel fees awarded to Wife as a sanction for Husband's contempt of the September 15, 2016 order, Husband's reliance on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sutch\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is misplaced. In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sutch\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the sanction imposed totaled over one million dollars in attorney's fees allegedly incurred in a standard medical malpractice contingency fee case. On appeal, we reversed the award of counsel fees because the record showed the difficulties inherent in the underlying medical malpractice case, and the hourly fees associated with the high number of lawyers who allegedly touched the file, were embellished without record basis, in a case that carried no novel question of law or fact to support the extensive charges.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sutch,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784588,12486206\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/38/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784588,12486206\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/38/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784588,12486206\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/38/\">\n    at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Here, however, the court reviewed Wife's certification of counsel fees sustained as a result of Husband's contempt of the court's September 2016 order. Based on the detailed accounting offered, the court awarded Wife's counsel about ninety percent of the fees associated with\n   prosecuting her contempt petition, which was a reasonable reflection of counsel's related tasks and hourly billing rate. The record reveals that, as respondent in the contempt proceedings, Husband incurred comparable fees, given his counsel's related tasks and hourly billing rate. The record shows no abuse of discretion in the amount of counsel fees awarded to Wife. Thus, Husband's sanctions claim merits no relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, we address Husband's complaint about the parties' September 2016 stipulation for the removal of Husband's personal and patient-related data from Wife's laptop computer and their daughter's cell phone. The stipulation was based on Husband's bald allegation that Wife had transferred his personal/patient files from their joint laptop to a second laptop she had purchased after the divorce proceedings. Specifically, the parties' stipulation provided Wife would deliver her laptop computer and her daughter's cell phone to Springboard Media (\"Springboard\"), who would then wipe Husband's information from these devices. Per the September 2016 stipulation, Springboard would separate Wife's personal data from Husband's personal/patient-related data, and return a drive to Husband that contained his information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Wife testified at the February 2017 hearing that, while she was unsure whether Husband's information was actually on her personal laptop and cell phone, she complied with the stipulation and turned over the devices to Springboard for service. At the February 2017 contempt hearing, however, Springboard owner Everett Katzen testified that his company was digitally incapable of performing this task and took no further steps to service Wife's computer as contemplated in the September 2016 stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, Husband did not identify his computer-records claim separately on appeal. In just one sentence in the conclusion paragraph of Husband's appellate brief, he states: \"[Given] that the computer stipulation [Wife's] counsel formulated and [Husband] was forced to sign upon threat of losing his HIPPA protected data has not and cannot be implemented, [Wife] herself remains in contempt of the original divorce decree for not returning the computer and other electronic data as she was required to return, including the additional copies of the data she improperly made.\" (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Appellant's Brief at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   That sentence is the sum and substance of Husband's particular claim. Absent more, we cannot intuit if Husband is complaining about the content of the stipulation or about Wife's alleged failure to comply with the stipulation or about Springboard's inability to provide the service intended in the stipulation. To the extent Husband is complaining about the content of the stipulation, this issue is waived because he failed to pursue that claim on his appeal from the September 2016 order. To the extent Husband is complaining about Wife's failure to comply with the stipulation, the record makes clear that she did comply by bringing the laptop and cell phone to Springboard for service. Finally, to the extent Husband is complaining about Springboard's inability to provide the service as stipulated, Husband is the party who insisted on using Springboard and failed to offer any workable alternatives. Therefore, as presented, Husband's computer data claim did not serve as a valid defense to Wife's contempt petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, we decline to grant Husband any specific relief in this regard at this time because he did not properly preserve the claim for appellate review.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Butler v.
