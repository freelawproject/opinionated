Brown (Brown), an inmate at the State Correctional Institution at Greene (SCI-Greene), appeals\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   from the August 22, 2017 order of the Court of Common Pleas of Greene County (Trial Court) dismissing his complaint dated April 3, 2017. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2017, Brown filed the complaint\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   against Kevin R. Bradford, an attorney with the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General (Defendant Bradford), various guards, officers and employees of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC) (collectively, DOC Defendants), various judges and employees of the First Judicial District (FJD) in Philadelphia (FJD Defendants), and the Philadelphia law firm of Dugan, Brinkmann, Maginnis, and Pace (Law Firm Defendant).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his complaint, Brown alleges,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that DOC Defendants engaged in a conspiracy with FJD Defendants to sabotage a malpractice suit he filed in the\n   FJD against Law Firm Defendant. The malpractice action filed in the FJD resulted in a judgment\n   <em>\n    non pros\n   </em>\n   that was affirmed by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Dugan, Brinkmann, Maginnis and Pace, and John D. Brinkmann\n   </em>\n   , No. 37 C.D. 2017,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206390385\">\n    2017 WL 6390385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth., December 15, 2017). That lawsuit had alleged that Brown's attorneys at Law Firm Defendant committed malpractice in the federal courts in their handling of a civil rights lawsuit he filed in 2007 relating to medical conditions caused by an inadequate ventilation system and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) within DOC. Brown asserts that he filed the complaint at issue here in Greene County because \"the cause of action (sabotaging of trial on 10/19/16,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ) arose at SCI-Greene (Main), the majority of the transactions or occurrences averred in the complaint took place there, and the majority of the Appellees are located in Greene County...\" and further asserts that his attempts to file the complaint in Philadelphia County have twice been rejected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Brown's Rely Brief at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Additionally, embedded in the complaint is the malpractice action Brown brought previously against Law Firm Defendant in the FJD, including a recounting of the history of Law Firm Defendant's representation in his prison conditions lawsuit, its alleged failure to properly investigate that lawsuit, and its rationale for recommending that he withdraw the suit as not viable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brown sets forth in detail the evidence, allegedly ignored and/or suppressed by Law Firm Defendant, that he asserts support his ETS claims. He incorporates by reference proceedings and documents pertaining to his prison conditions litigation. According to Brown, as a direct result of Law Firm Defendant's malpractice and subsequent sabotage of his attempt to prosecute the case, his chronic medical conditions caused by the prison environment have been aggravated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Brown asserts that the named parties conspired to sabotage the malpractice lawsuit he filed in FJD. Brown states that Law Firm Defendant used its \"wealth, superior knowledge, court contacts and [DOC Defendants] to sabotage his malpractice prosecution,\" and that its acts were motivated by its \"[r]ight wing ideology, [its] desire to please the conservative Republican Judges who controlled the District Court at the time, and support the Attorney General's Office in Philadelphia.\" (Record (R.) Item 20, Complaint \u00b6 51.) With no facts whatsoever, Brown alleges that Defendant Bradford was the \"middle man\" between Law Firm Defendant and DOC Defendants and persuaded Law Firm Defendant to sabotage his prison conditions case. He asserts that a practice exists in FJD of allowing its unscrupulous support staff to supplement its income by catering to wealthy attorneys in a scheme to disadvantage\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoners. He alleges FJD Defendants delayed and rejected pleadings in his malpractice lawsuit, denied motions, interfered with a case management conference, breached their duty to train and supervise FJD staff, and erroneously entered the judgment of\n   <em>\n    non pros.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brown alleges that DOC Defendants denied him access to material he needed to prosecute the malpractice lawsuit and falsely claimed that he refused to attend his trial. Their motive in preventing prosecution of the malpractice case, according to Brown, was prevention of any litigation of\n   the merits of his prison conditions lawsuit. In addition to the civil conspiracy to sabotage his malpractice case, he alleges the denial of his access to courts and of due process, as well as retaliation, by both DOC Defendants and FJD Defendants. Brown seeks an injunction preventing the sabotage of any matters he may bring in FJD in the future, including sabotage by DOC Defendants, as well as a declaratory judgment that the acts of the collective defendants violated his constitutional rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By its June 15, 2017 Decision and Order, the Trial Court deemed the issues set forth in the complaint to be related to prison conditions and found Brown to be an abusive litigator,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   therefore denying him\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   (IFP) status and granting him thirty days within which to pay the requisite filing fees. (R. Item 20, 6/15/17 Trial Court Opinion and Order.) The Trial Court further found no credible allegation that Brown was in imminent danger of bodily harm and in need of injunctive relief and that he therefore failed to meet the exception contemplated by Section 6602(f) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6602(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Brown failed to pay the filing fee, and on August 22, 2017, the Trial Court dismissed the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its opinion, the Trial Court explained that the various allegations made in Brown's complaint relating to malpractice in the handling of his \"prison conditions\" civil rights litigation were in fact issues related to prison conditions. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206390385\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Trial Court noted its right under Section 6602(e)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the PLRA to dismiss prison conditions litigation at any time upon a determination that the prison conditions litigation is frivolous or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or the defendant is entitled to assert a valid affirmative defense that would preclude the relief. The Trial Court concluded that in addition to being an abusive litigator, Brown had also failed to state a claim with regard to alleged malpractice by his court-appointed attorneys in the civil litigation in federal court. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206390385\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Trial Court was persuaded by Law Firm Defendant's rationale for determining that Brown's prison conditions lawsuit was not viable, as set forth by Brown in paragraph 32 of his complaint. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206390385\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Brown unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the Trial Court's order denying IFP status, and further requested recusal\n   and a hearing on his request. (R. Items 18-19, Motion for Reconsideration of June 15, 2017 Order, Motion for Recusal.) Brown argued that the numerous claims he has made in the past against various judges of the Trial Court make the issuance of a fair determination impossible. The Trial Court found no basis for its recusal nor for a hearing on the matter and denied Brown's motions. (R. Item 17, July 12, 2017 Order.) In response to Brown's appeal, the Trial Court filed an opinion pursuant to Rule 1925(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure. (R. Item 6, Statement Pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 1925.) Quoting its language in an October 2, 2017 order issued in an unrelated case involving Brown, the Trial Court explained that it had no personal recollection of assertions made by Brown regarding past instances where Brown was before the Trial Court, nor did it believe there was any reason to recuse itself. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206390385\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Before this Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brown argues that the Trial Court erred (i) in failing to recuse, and (ii) in its application of the \"three strikes rule.\" Neither of his arguments has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Our Supreme Court has established that unfavorable rulings do not form the basis for a claim of bias and prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"356250\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/553/485/\">\n    553 Pa. 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11796393,356250\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/720/79/\">\n    720 A.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90 (1998) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Boyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1776076\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/498/486/\">\n    498 Pa. 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1776076\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/498/486/\">\n    447 A.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 (1982). A recusal is required only where the party requesting recusal establishes that there is a substantial doubt as to the jurist's ability to preside impartially.\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1776076\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/498/486/\">\n    447 A.2d at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Brown has utterly failed to establish such substantial doubt. There is nothing in the record to establish any basis for the Trial Court's recusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Regarding Brown's second argument that the Trial Court erred in applying the \"three strikes rule\" to deny him IFP status, we do not accept Brown's contention that his claims do not involve prison conditions, but rather involve \"judicial proceedings,\" and that the application of the \"three strikes rule\" was improper because Law Firm Defendant is not \"a government party.\" \"Prison conditions litigation\" is defined in the PLRA as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [a] civil proceeding arising in whole or in part under Federal or State law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions of a government party on the life of an individual confined in prison. The term includes an appeal. The term does not include criminal proceedings challenging the fact or duration of confinement in prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6601. Brown overlooks the disjunctive \"or\" in Section 6601, which provides two separate ways in which a civil proceeding can be considered prison conditions litigation. Thus, an action that arises in part out of conditions of confinement constitutes prison conditions litigation regardless of whether the defendants are all government parties. His claims allege that Law Firm Defendant's malpractice caused aggravation of his prison-related medical condition. Moreover, Brown's allegations of malpractice reiterate and attempt to re-litigate the issue of those conditions and their effect on his well-being. This action therefore falls squarely within the statutory definition of \"prison conditions litigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, we note that a substantial portion of Brown's allegations of conspiracy involve the DOC employees' attempts to \"set the stage that would allow them to falsely claim that [Brown] refused to attend the 10/19/16 trial, involving [Defendant\n   Bradford] via his unknown contacts, [various DOC Defendants], [Law Firm Defendant]'s unknown courthouse contact and saboteur, [other DOC Defendants], and those unknown parties working in concert with them.\" (R. Item 20, Complaint \u00b6 70(xvii).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clearly, these actions are those of government parties affecting Brown's life while confined in prison and as such, fall within the definition of prison conditions litigation.\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Levy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081283\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/621/1/\">\n    621 Pa. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081283,7306422\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/73/514/\">\n    73 A.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518 (2013) (\"Appellee argues his action merely concerns the fact that the prothonotary denied him access to court, and has no effect on his life in prison ...[W]e agree with the prothonotary that a petition for writ of mandamus against the prothonotary may constitute prison conditions litigation and may be subject to the three strikes rule.\"). It is undisputed that Brown qualifies as an abusive litigator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition, Brown's claims against FJD Defendants are barred by immunity. 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8501 - 8550. Indeed, beyond immunity, we note that there are other independent grounds under Pa. R. C. P. No. 240(j)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the denial of his IFP status, and for the dismissal of his complaint upon failure to pay the required fees. Brown describes as the gravamen of his claims the intentional sabotage of his attempts to prosecute the malpractice case; he asserts that the unspecified actions and inactions of both DOC Defendants and FJD Defendants, bolstered by Law Firm Defendant, resulted in the judgment of\n   <em>\n    non pros\n   </em>\n   . (Brown's brief at 7.) As previously noted, this Court has ruled that the trial court in FJD did not err when it entered a judgment of\n   <em>\n    non pros\n   </em>\n   as to Brown's malpractice claim, and Brown is collaterally estopped from doing so here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Accordingly, having determined that the Trial Court did not err in dismissing Brown's complaint and denying him IFP status, we affirm the Trial Court's August 22, 2017 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Judge Fizzano Cannon did not participate in the decision of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   AND NOW, this 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of September, 2018, the August 22, 2017 order of the Court of Common Pleas of Greene County dismissing Appellant Alton D.
