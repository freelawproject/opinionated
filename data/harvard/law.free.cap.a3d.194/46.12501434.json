The Supreme Court has explained a union's responsibility as follows: \"the exclusive agent's statutory authority to represent all members of a designated unit includes a statutory obligation to serve the interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward any, to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l v.

To meet his burden and demonstrate that the Union's conduct was arbitrary, Trask had to prove that, \"in light of the factual and legal landscape at the time of the union's actions, the union's behavior [wa]s so far outside a wide range of reasonableness ... as to be irrational.\"\n   <em>\n    Langley v.

In the context of the severe municipal budget crisis experienced by the Town of Madison, both the Town and the Union were making decisions and negotiating in uncharted territory.
