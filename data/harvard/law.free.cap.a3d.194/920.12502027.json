In that case, Mr. Wilson testified that he did not have possession of his vehicle, an asset the plaintiff in that matter, Guyler Hill, sought to seize. In this appeal, Mr. Wilson argues that (1) the trial court plainly erred in permitting the government to constructively amend the perjury charge in the indictment, and (2) the government's evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, both as to the constructively amended perjury charge and the obstruction charge. We need not address Mr. Wilson's claim of plain error because we agree that the evidence is legally insufficient as to both charges and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this court examines the\n   evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether the evidence was such that no reasonable factfinder could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Wade v.

Thus we assess the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a perjury conviction based on the theory the government pursued at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The government argues that a reasonable juror could have determined that Mr. Wilson falsely testified at the April 9, 2013, hearing that he did not possess his car based on (1) the primary testimony of Mr. Hill, who the government represents saw the car outside Mr. Wilson's home on that day, and (2) the corroborating testimony of a representative of the Howard University Employees Federal Credit Union, Mr. Michael Hines, who explained that (contrary to Mr. Wilson's purported understanding), his entity had not yet repossessed Mr. Wilson's car on April 9, 2013, and did not succeed in doing so until December 2014. For the following reasons, we disagree that this evidence is sufficient to support Mr. Wilson's perjury conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Hill never unequivocally testified that he saw Mr. Wilson's car outside Mr. Wilson's home on April 9, 2013. When he was initially asked on direct examination if he saw the vehicle on Mr. Wilson's street at any time in April 2013, he testified, \"I cannot be sure.\" When he was specifically asked about April 9, 2013, the day he and Mr. Wilson had been in court, he repeatedly\n   qualified his testimony with \"I think\" or \"I believe.\" Mr. Hill's continued \"I believe\" answers on cross-examination prompted defense counsel to clarify that he was not \"asking what you believe.\" Defense counsel then asked Mr. Hill point blank if it was his \"testimony that you saw [Mr. Wilson] in possession of the car\" on April 9, 2013. Mr. Hill could only say that he was \"pretty sure,\" and declined defense counsel's invitation to say that he was \"certain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As noted above, we maintain strict standards for proving perjury in the District of Columbia. At a minimum, the government must produce one witness who can \"in positive terms, contradict the statement of the person indicted for perjury.\"\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

Mr. Hines's testimony is insufficient as it is unrelated to Mr. Hill's testimony. Mr. Hines testified only that, although the Credit Union had put a skip trace\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on Mr. Wilson's car in February 2013, it did not succeed in seizing Mr. Wilson's car until December 2014. This testimony does not make it more likely that Mr. Hill saw Mr. Wilson's car on April 9, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Gaffney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297309\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/980/1190/#p1193\">\n    980 A.2d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"[w]hat must be corroborated is the part of the primary witness's testimony that falsifies the defendant's statement\"). It does not even contradict Mr. Wilson's trial testimony that, after his car was impounded for expired plates in late March 2013, he sought to have it towed to a Chevy dealership, but it never reached its destination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It merely establishes that the credit union was not\n   responsible for the alleged disappearance of Mr. Wilson's car before the April 9, 2013, hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297309\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/980/1190/#p1193\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (determining that the proffered corroboration was inadequate where it \"neither confirmed the critical part of [the primary witness's] testimony nor furnished independent evidence proving the falsity of appellant's ... statements\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Turning to the obstruction of justice conviction, we note that the government acknowledges that this conviction was \"based on the same conduct\" as the perjury conviction. We conclude that the two counts rise and fall together. Because the trial evidence did not permit a reasonable juror to conclude that Mr. Wilson perjured himself when he represented under oath that he did not have possession of his car in court on April 9, 2013, it likewise does not permit a reasonable juror to conclude that he obstructed justice by perjuring himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Cook\n    </em>\n    , the central issue was whether the defendant had lied about his location on the evening of a specific date.
