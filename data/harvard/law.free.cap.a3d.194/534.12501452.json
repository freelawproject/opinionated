We granted defendant Ricky Brown's motion for leave to appeal from a January 31, 2018 trial court order, denying his motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of a strip search following his arrest for indictable drug offenses. After reviewing the record in light of the contentions advanced on appeal, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We derive the salient facts from the evidence adduced at the motion hearing. On April 5, 2017, Atlantic City Vice Detective Darrin Lorady conducted surveillance of defendant's residence based on \"detailed information\" Lorady had \"fairly recently\" received from a confidential informant (CI). According to the CI, defendant would drive from his house in Little Egg Harbor to the Fox Manor Hotel in Atlantic City, which Lorady described as \"a very busy place for vice detectives.\" The CI claimed defendant would distribute narcotics to a particular individual at the hotel. The CI provided Lorady with defendant's address in Little Egg Harbor and a description of defendant's vehicle, including the license plate number. The CI also stated defendant \"always has a gun.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At approximately 10:30 a.m., defendant left his house and drove to a Walmart in town. Aided in his surveillance by Detective Brian Hambrecht, Lorady followed defendant and observed him engage in a \"hand-to-hand transaction\" in the Walmart parking lot with the driver of another vehicle. The detectives then followed defendant into Atlantic City, heading toward the Fox Manor Hotel. As defendant approached the hotel, he began circling the block, which Lorady explained was a common maneuver \"to lose a tail or ... to see if people are following you.\" Defendant, who Lorady believed had noticed the surveillance, then drove out of the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on their observations of the hand-to-hand transaction, the accuracy of the CI's information, and a tinted window infraction, detectives stopped defendant's vehicle on Route 40, described by Lorady as \"a major highway.\" Lorady asked defendant, who \"was visibly shaking\" and \"seemed very upset[,]\" to exit his vehicle. By\n   that time, other officers had arrived, including a K-9 partner, who positively alerted for the presence of narcotics in defendant's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the K-9 sniff, defendant \"became more nervous as time progressed\" and continued reaching for a \"distinct bulge\" in his groin, \"adjust[ing] it slightly.\" Believing defendant \"possibly was adjusting a weapon,\" Lorady attempted to perform \"a protective pat down for [his] safety.\" Defendant \"pulled away\" stating, \"you can't touch me there.\" Lorady \"couldn't successfully complete the pat down[,] but [he] was able to feel that there was something ... hard\" in defendant's groin, in an area that commonly is utilized to conceal weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The officers then handcuffed defendant and transported him to the police station where Lorady obtained permission from his supervisor to conduct a warrantless strip search of defendant. The strip search was conducted at noon, in a private interview room, and resulted in the seizure of five bricks of heroin from defendant's groin \"right where [Lorady] had felt [it].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following his arrest, defendant was charged in an Atlantic County indictment with third-degree possession of heroin, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-10(a)(1) (count one), and second-degree possession of heroin with the intent to distribute, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-5(b)(2) (count two). Defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized from his person as a violation of the Statute. The trial judge denied the motion, finding the Statute did not apply because defendant was under arrest for a crime at the time of the search. Further, the judge determined the warrantless search was valid because the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant, and exigent circumstances existed because the officers believed defendant had a weapon concealed in his groin area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion because the Attorney General Guidelines (Guidelines),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   issued pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:161A-8, extend the protections of the Statute to individuals detained or arrested for crimes, and the police violated the Guidelines. The State counters the search was justified by probable cause and reasonable exigent circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the course of the briefing on appeal, we invited and received amicus curiae briefs from the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General, and the Office of\n   the Public Defender. We also granted a motion of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU) to appear as amicus curiae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although not contending the Statute applies to crimes, the Public Defender and ACLU claim the Guidelines delineate the objectively reasonable circumstances that justify a strip search. They contend here that defendant's constitutional rights were violated because there was no exigency justifying the warrantless strip search. The Attorney General claims the Guidelines were neither intended to nor did they extend the Statute to defendants detained upon reasonable suspicion or arrested on probable cause of committing a crime, but even if the Guidelines apply, the search passed constitutional muster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our review of a trial judge's decision on a motion to suppress is limited.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, following the K-9 dog's detection of narcotics in defendant's vehicle, his nervous demeanor and evasive actions while Lorady attempted to perform a protective pat down,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   heightened the officer's\n   suspicions that defendant \"possibly was adjusting a weapon\" in his groin area. Although defendant prevented Lorady from completing the pat down at the side of a busy highway, Lorady felt a hard object and was cognizant of the CI's information that defendant was \"known to be armed during the course of these narcotics investigations and the fact that so far the information that was provided to [Lorady] all added up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, having lawfully arrested defendant, Lorady had \"the right and duty to search him for weapons and contraband before placing him in a patrol car.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056419\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/218/277/#p299\">\n    218 N.J. 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056419\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/218/277/#p299\">\n    95 A.3d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). \"It also follows that the police have the authority to ensure, at headquarters, that a person under arrest is not armed with a weapon.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056419\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/218/277/#p299\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nonetheless, defendant argues there was no exigency here to justify the strip search because he could have remained handcuffed and under police surveillance while the officers applied for a warrant to strip search him. That position fails to appreciate the potential danger to the officer charged with guarding defendant in some area of the police station, or to other prisoners or members of the public at large. Rather, as the Office of the Attorney General noted in its amicus brief, had the officers applied for a warrant, defendant \"most likely [would] have [been] placed in a holding cell at the police station, thereby triggering ... the detention provision of the ... [S]tatute.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:161A-1(c). We agree that under those circumstances, it was untenable to delay the search to obtain a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, defendant's actions in resisting the pat-down search created exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless strip search, and it was not reasonable to expect the officers to apply for a search warrant. Because Lorady believed defendant was concealing a weapon, the officer reasonably removed defendant from the side of a busy highway to the police station, and obtained his supervisor's permission to conduct a strip search in accordance with accepted procedures.
