We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim was born on December 22, 2000, in Buffalo, New York. The victim's biological mother and biological father ended their relationship when she was two years old and the victim's mother began a relationship with the defendant shortly thereafter. During their near decadelong relationship, the defendant moved in with the victim and her mother, and the defendant and the victim's mother had two daughters together, one born in 2006 and one in 2009. Between approximately 2009 and 2012, the defendant sexually assaulted the victim in different residences that the defendant shared with the victim, the victim's mother, and the victim's two younger siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2009, when the assaults first began, the family was living in a two bedroom apartment in Rocky Hill. Around this time, on a few different occasions, the defendant asked the victim to play the \"ah game\" with him when her mother was at work and her younger siblings were napping. On the first occasion, the victim thought the defendant was asking her to play a board game with him. Instead, the defendant led the victim to his bedroom, proceeded to pull down his pants, and lay with her on the bed. He instructed her \"to open up [her] mouth and say ah and put [her]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   mouth on his penis,\" and then told her \"that all boys and girls ... played the game ....\" The victim followed the defendant's demands and stopped a couple minutes later\n   when she no longer wanted to do it. The defendant made the victim do this on multiple occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September, 2010, the family moved into another two bedroom apartment in Rocky Hill. At this new apartment, the defendant routinely climbed into the victim's bed with her in the morning and proceeded to inappropriately touch her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He would lie behind the victim with her back to his chest and would touch her breasts and vagina under her clothes with his hand. During this time, the victim could feel the defendant's erect penis against her back as he lay behind her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On a different occasion, while the victim's mother was in the shower and the victim was eating lunch in the kitchen of the apartment, the defendant threw the victim over his shoulder and carried her into his bedroom. Against her will, he \"pinned [her] onto the bed,\" pulled down her pants, and proceeded to lick her vagina. The victim tried to use her hands to push him away, but she was not strong enough to do so. After a couple of minutes, the defendant stopped holding her down; the victim pulled her pants up and yelled at the defendant. The defendant threatened the victim by telling her that she was \"going to go out there and act happy or else he was going to drown [her] and [her] mom in a river.\" The victim did not report this incident to anyone at the time because she was \"scared that he would hurt [her] and [her] mom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant and the victim's mother eventually ended their relationship. The victim, her mother, and her two siblings moved into an apartment in Hartford\n   without the defendant, and in June, 2014, the then thirteen year old victim disclosed to her mother some of the things that the defendant had done to her beginning when she was eight or nine years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, on June 27, 2014, the victim's mother brought her to the Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. The victim spoke with the doctors and told them about the defendant's sexual interactions with her. At the conclusion of that consultation, the emergency room doctor referred her to the Greater Hartford Children's Advocacy Center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 9, 2014, the victim was interviewed at the Greater Hartford Children's Advocacy Center by Lyndsey Craft, a clinical child interview specialist. This interview was recorded on video and was observed by a doctor, two medical residents, a Department of Children and Families (department) worker, and a detective from the Rocky Hill Police Department, who all observed from behind a one-way mirror.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The victim spoke with Craft and described her physical encounters with the defendant. On the basis of the victim's disclosures during her interview, Detective Frank Dannahey of the Rocky Hill Police Department prepared an arrest warrant for the defendant, and he was arrested. At trial, the victim testified about the assaults the defendant subjected her to. In addition, the jury heard testimony from Craft about her work with the Greater Hartford\n   Children's Advocacy Center and about her interview with the victim. The video of the interview was also played for the jury. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts. The trial court sentenced him to a total effective sentence of twenty-five years incarceration, followed by ten years of special parole. This timely appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court erred by admitting into evidence, pursuant to the medical diagnosis or treatment exception to the hearsay rule, the video recording of the forensic interview between Craft and the victim. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. On March 11, 2016, the defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude the video recording of the victim's forensic interview with Craft from being admitted into evidence, arguing that the video recording contains hearsay, and that \"no hearsay exception applies, including the medical treatment exception.\" A motion hearing was held on three separate days in April, 2016, prior to the commencement of the trial, and the court heard testimonial evidence from Craft and Nancy Eiswirth, the defendant's expert witness, who opined about the purposes of Craft's interview with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the hearing, Craft testified about her educational background in social work and her job as a clinical child interview specialist for the Greater Hartford Children's Advocacy Center. She testified that when the victim and her mother first arrived at the center, the victim's mother was required to sign Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d et seq., compliant release forms because the interview was going to be made part of the victim's\n   medical record. After these administrative tasks were completed, Craft indicated that she met with the victim alone in one of the adolescent interview rooms to speak with her. Craft testified that these types of interviews are recorded to \"minimize the amount of times a child needs to speak about the same event.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Furthermore, when asked what Craft thought the \"most important or primary purpose\" of the interviews she conducted was, Craft responded that it was to \"formulate the treatment ... which the child is going to receive, whether it be ... medical treatment or therapeutic treatment, counseling, [or] therapy.\" Craft went on to testify about her interview with the victim and indicated that she conducted it in a neutral and nonleading way. Based on the victim's statements to Craft about the assaults, Craft recommended that the victim have a thorough medical examination with\n   one of the medical professionals at the Greater Hartford Children's Advocacy Center and recommended that the victim begin therapy. Craft testified that the victim did receive an examination by Nina Livingston, a medical doctor, following the interview with her. Craft testified that Livingston serves as the medical director at the Greater Hartford Children's Advocacy Center, and is also the medical director of the Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect program at Connecticut Children's Medical Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the parties' arguments on the motion, defense counsel argued, inter alia, that the responses elicited from the victim were \"not obtained for medical purposes [because] there was no diagnosis obtained\" and that \"Craft's interview itself [was] not medically coded and that she did not provide any reasons going forward\n   that there was a medically needed reason for a diagnosis.\" The state responded by arguing that the victim's statements to Craft \"were reasonabl[y] pertinent to obtain medical diagnosis or treatment and that ... Craft sufficiently occupied a position within the chain of medical care to bring [the victim's] statement within the scope\" of the exception. The state highlighted the fact that \"after the interview was done, [Livingston] based her medical treatment or her medical exam around the questions and answers that [the victim] provided to ... Craft.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 25, 2016, the court denied the motion to preclude the video recording of the forensic interview and later provided a written articulation of its decision. The court stated, in relevant part, that \"[i]t should be noted that the definition of medical health provider in the stream of medical treatment has been expanded by our case law to include a social worker,\" citing to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"831934\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/1/#p10\">\n    260 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20823\">\n    792 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). After considering everything before it, the court found that the victim's \"purpose was to obtain medical diagnosis and treatment and that the examiner was competent in achieving that result.\" The court then considered whether the \"presence of the Rocky Hill police, a representative of [the department], and medical personnel alter [the victim's] purpose?\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court found that the \"presence of these individuals does not supplant [the victim's] purpose. The examiner's goal was to obtain appropriate medical treatment for [the victim]. [Craft] did not consult with [the department] or the police prior to the interview and received no requests for clarification of [the victim's] answers.... Dr. Livingston followed the interview with an examination, and the [victim] was involved in therapy. Medical assistance and mental health therapy sometimes is necessary, even if there are no visible wounds. Testimonial evidence at the hearing was that\n   the [victim] had spoken to the Rocky Hill police prior to the interview. The criminal investigation had already begun prior to the interview.\" As such, the court reemphasized that the \"credible evidence presented at the hearing was that the information was presented from [the victim] for medical diagnosis and treatment,\" and that the court considered it \"trustworthy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 24, 2016, the defendant filed an amended motion in limine requesting that in the event the court permitted the jury to view the video recording, that it preclude certain statements from being played to the jury. On the second day of trial, the court addressed the motion, determining that some of the statements in question were not relevant for the purposes of diagnosis or medical treatment. Thus, the court granted the motion in part, and denied it in part. Consistent with the court's ruling, the video was redacted to\n   omit certain statements that the court determined were not relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the third day of trial, the state offered the video recording redacted in accord with the court's ruling. The court acknowledged the defendant's previous objection, made note of its ruling, and admitted the video recording into evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state proceeded to play the video for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin our analysis by setting forth our well established standard of review for evidentiary claims. \"To the extent [that] a trial court's admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review.... We review the trial court's decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the\n   law, however, for an abuse of discretion.... In other words, only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is subject to a hearsay exception, is it vested with the discretion to admit or to bar the evidence based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds related to the rule of evidence under which admission is being sought.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Griswold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20528\">\n    160 Conn.

He concedes, as he must, that such a challenge cannot be made because the victim, who was interviewed in the video recording, testified at trial. As our case law has made manifest, when a victim appears at trial and is subject to cross-examination by the defendant,\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), and its progeny do not apply.

The defendant claims that because the declarant was available to testify at trial in\n   <em>\n    Arroyo\n   </em>\n   , and because our Supreme Court \"still conducted an analysis of whether the statements were testimonial under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\" the primary purpose standard\n   is applicable here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We find this\n   argument unpersuasive.

Subsequent to those cases, this court decided in\n   <em>\n    Griswold\n   </em>\n   that, if statements made during a forensic interview of the child are offered solely under the medical diagnosis and treatment exception, and the child is subject to cross-examination at trial, then such statements need only be reasonably pertinent to medical diagnosis and treatment to be admissible....

To begin, after the victim first visited Connecticut Children's Medical Center, an emergency room doctor referred her to the Greater Hartford Children's Advocacy Center. After arriving at the Greater Hartford Children's Advocacy Center, located on the premises of Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, for the forensic interview, the victim met with Craft in one of the adolescent interview rooms to speak about what had happened to her. At the beginning of their conversation, Craft informed the victim that their conversation would be video recorded in case Craft or the doctor had any questions later on. Craft informed the victim\n   that this was done so that they did not have to keep asking the victim questions \"over and over and over again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Furthermore, during the motion in limine hearing, Craft testified that the victim was reporting \"significant contact that could indeed pass along [sexually transmitted diseases ], as well as other sexually transmitted infections.\" Craft also testified that although the victim had no physical complaints at the time, she seemed to exhibit some symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Based on Craft's interview with the victim, she recommended the victim have a thorough medical exam with one of the medical professionals at the Greater Hartford Children's Advocacy Center, and also that she begin therapy. The video recording of the victim's interview with Craft, in addition to a report Craft prepared at the conclusion of the interview, were made part of the victim's medical record. Following the interview, Craft spoke with Livingston to ensure that Livingston understood everything that Craft obtained from the interview, and based on Craft's recommendation, the victim did in fact obtain a medical evaluation by Livingston. The circumstances leading up to the victim's interview, the location where the interview took place, Craft's statements to the victim during the interview, and the fact that the victim did obtain a medical examination and was referred for therapy, could lead an objective observer to reasonably infer that the victim's statements were given in order to obtain medical treatment and diagnosis.

He argues, in part, that the presence of a police officer behind the one-way mirror during the interview demonstrates that the purpose of the interview was not for medical treatment or diagnosis. Additionally, he argues that the victim was well aware that there was police involvement and that her words were going to be used against the defendant. Even so, the mere presence of a police officer behind a one-way mirror or even the victim's knowledge that a police officer was observing the interview does not preclude a statement from falling within the medical diagnosis and treatment exception.

Craft testified that she did not discuss anything with the police officer prior to her interview with the victim, and even when Craft consulted with the people standing behind the mirror during a brief break, the police officer did not ask Craft to ask any additional questions. Although many of Craft's questions did focus on determining what had\n   happened to the victim in her encounters with the defendant, we find the record sufficient to conclude that the victim's statements made during the forensic interview with Craft were reasonably pertinent to her receiving medical treatment and diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly determined that the victim's statements made during the forensic interview fell within the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule.

On day three of the trial, the prosecutor asked Craft if it was normal for a child that is sexually abused to \"tell someone what happened right after the incident.\" After Craft responded, \"No,\" defense counsel objected to the question itself and to the line of questioning in general. Outside the jury's presence, defense counsel questioned whether Craft was \"qualified to be able to give ... verified scientific information as to what children do if they are abused.\" After being given the opportunity to voir dire the witness, defense counsel agreed that the witness \"can talk about the issue of delayed disclosure ....\" Defense counsel argued, however, that testimony concerning delayed disclosure\n   was permissible, \"[s]o long as the limitation is ... that the fact that there was a delayed disclosure is not corroborative or any proof that anything occurred.\" After hearing the prosecutor's assurances that this type of question would not be asked, the court responded to defense counsel's concerns by noting: \"I don't think that question is going to be asked. If that question is asked, I know how to answer that-I know how to rule on that.\" The court asked defense counsel if it addressed his concerns and if the issue had been resolved. Defense counsel responded that \"the court's ruled, and we'll move forward.\" The court responded: \"Okay. I just-whether or not you agree with my ruling is fine. I just want to make sure I covered what you raised.\" Defense counsel responded, \"You have.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Shortly after the jury reentered the courtroom and the prosecutor continued his questioning, defense counsel objected to a question asked by the prosecutor. The prosecutor asked Craft: \"[W]hen a child is sexually abused, do they normally tell someone what happened right after the incident happens?\" Defense counsel argued that the \"question assumes an abuse has occurred.\" In response, the court asked the prosecutor to rephrase the question, and the prosecutor did so. Soon thereafter, defense counsel objected to one\n   of Craft's responses to a question. This time, he argued that the testimony impermissibly related to the facts of the case. In response, the court sustained the objection and issued a sua sponte curative instruction stating that \"Craft is testifying as based on her experience. You are to determine whether it applies in this case or not.\" After the next question was asked, defense counsel objected on the same ground but immediately withdrew the objection before the court could inquire further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thereafter, the prosecutor asked Craft: \"What factors, based on the job that you do, affect when a child ultimately discloses sexual abuse? Are there certain\n   factors?\" Craft provided an answer that is the subject of the present claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant argues that the testimony was inadmissible because it indirectly related the facts of this case to her testimony. The defendant, however, did not object to the question or the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendant asserts on appeal that he was not required to make any further objections after the statements he now challenges on appeal were made. The defendant claims that because trial counsel raised the issue of Craft's \"testimony being construed as vouching for the credibility of the victim outside of the presence of the jury and because the court ruled upon that motion,\" Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 requires no further objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We disagree with the defendant's reliance on Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Contrary to the defendant's argument, trial counsel's initial objection in the absence of the jury did not sufficiently, or at all, raise the issue that Craft's testimony was indirectly vouching for the credibility of the victim. Instead, defense counsel simply emphasized to the court that he wanted it to \"be made clear that in no way [does] the fact that the disclosure is delayed in any way corroborate that abuse actually occurred.\" At no point during the court's colloquy with defense counsel did he invoke\n   <em>\n    Favoccia\n   </em>\n   as his authority for his objection or specifically apprise the court that Craft's use of hypotheticals impermissibly suggested that she was indirectly vouching for the victim's credibility. Because defense counsel's initial objection did not adequately apprise the court of the ground on which the defendant now relies, the defendant was not relieved of his duty to make further objections if he thought Craft impermissibly related her testimony to the facts of the case. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As reflected in our discussion of this claim, shortly after the jury came back into the courtroom following defense counsel's initial objection, defense counsel objected to one of the prosecutor's questions on the ground that the \"question assumes an abuse has occurred.\" As the court indicated it would do, it \"responded accordingly\" by asking the prosecutor to rephrase the question. The prosecutor complied. After a few additional questions were asked, defense counsel objected once again. This time, however, the objection was not on the ground that the question assumed an abuse occurred; rather, it was the first time defense counsel objected to testimony on the ground that Craft was relating her testimony to the facts of the case. The court addressed the objection by providing a curative\n   instruction. Shortly thereafter, defense counsel objected once again to an answer given by Craft but immediately withdrew his objection. Although other objections were made, they were made in response to statements not challenged in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As the state points out, the failure to object to the three statements the defendant now challenges on appeal presumably shows that defense counsel did not believe that Craft's statements were improper, or that he was satisfied with the curative instruction the court previously gave. There is no obligation for the court, which is not an advocate for either party but a neutral arbiter over the trial, to raise objections on the defendant's behalf. Because the defendant failed to put the court on notice of the potential error \"while there [was] still time for the court to act,\" we conclude that the defendant failed to preserve his claim.

The line of cases that the defendant challenges have concluded that forensic interview statements are admissible under the medical diagnosis or treatment exception when the purpose of the interview was, at least in part, to determine whether the victim was in need of medical treatment, and that the statements were reasonably pertinent to achieving those ends.

So it's either an accidental disclosure or a purposeful disclosure. An accidental disclosure is a child tells their friend, and then their friend goes and tells the school social worker, and that school social worker then calls down the child. The child didn't intend to disclose. She was looking or she was talking with a friend about it.\n    <em>\n     A purposeful disclosure is when the child's ready. They go and they talk to their mom. They go and talk to the doctor.\n    </em>\n    They make that actual disclosure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    \"When a child is ready to disclose their alleged abuse certain factors come into play, such as ... they don't want the abuse to continue. They found the power within themselves to try to stop it. They are afraid that\n    <em>\n     the abuse may happen to their younger siblings\n    </em>\n    or to somebody else they love and care about. Sometimes ... if the person's in a caretaking role and they try to discipline the child, the child will then say, really, you're going to discipline me when you've been doing x, y and z. So it all depends on what ... is going on for them at the time. A lot of times children disclose\n    <em>\n     when they've been removed from the perpetrator for a while\n    </em>\n    so they know that they feel safe. It's really dependent on, on what's going on for the child at the time.\" (Emphasis added.)
