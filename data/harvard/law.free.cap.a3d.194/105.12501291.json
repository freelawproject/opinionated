Plaintiffs allege that L.E. suffered psychological injury as a result. They appeal from the summary judgment dismissal of their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude defendants owed L.E. a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising her and fellow students during the school day; and plaintiffs' expert provided sufficient evidence for a jury to reasonably conclude that defendants failed to fulfill that duty. The court erred in determining that two provisions of the Tort Claims Act (TCA or Act) - N.J.S.A. 59:5-4, governing the failure to provide police protection services, and N.J.S.A. 59:3-5, governing the failure to enforce laws - shield defendants from liability for the negligent supervision of the students preceding the assault. However, we agree with the trial court that plaintiffs failed to establish a reasonable standard of care governing the appropriate response to L.E.'s report of the assault, or that she suffered any harm from the alleged shortcomings in the post-assault investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Therefore, we reverse in part, and affirm in part, the trial court's order granting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Brill v.

June 23, 2011, was the last day of L.E.'s high school freshman year. She was on the playground for a scheduled gym class, but most students had \"skipped\" that day. The boys' and girls' gym classes were combined, but there was no real instruction. L.E. testified, \"We didn't really have a class. Nobody came. We're just, it was like a free day.\" She said no teachers or security guards were present on the playground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Two male students, A.D. and R.B., approached her on the playground. She knew them from her classes. She once had a crush on A.D., but recently he had been bullying her. He offered to reconcile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While the class was technically still in session, L.E. left the playground and entered the school building on the way to the bathroom. The boys left too, and the three entered the school building. None of them had hall passes, notwithstanding that the school required them when students used the hallways during class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   L.E. reached the girls' bathroom, which was across the hallway from the boys' bathroom. R.B. asked L.E. to enter the boys' bathroom and she consented. L.E. alleged that once inside the boys' bathroom, an unwanted sexual encounter took place with both boys, which escalated with one of them, as the other watched. When another student entered the boys' bathroom, L.E. ran out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December the following school year, L.E. reported the incident to a guidance counselor and a basketball coach. She did so after she overheard R.B. boasting about the incident to fellow classmates. L.E. also told her mother. The principal and school superintendent were soon involved, as were local police and the Division of Youth and Family Services, as it was known at the time. No criminal charges were brought. Shortly after her report, L.E. left school and was hospitalized for extended periods due to\n   mental illness. Plaintiff contends the assault triggered and exacerbated her condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs retained an expert in school security and safety. The expert visited the school in 2016. He noted that the school maintained a closed circuit television (CCTV) system of sixteen cameras that could be monitored from the school's front desk, including one camera with a view of the boys' bathroom where the expert believed the assault occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The school also maintained locks restricting access to the school building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Citing both the school's own policy and \"school security best practices,\" the expert opined that \"students should be supervised at all times during regular school hours\" and hall passes should be required for students traveling within a building during class sessions. He also opined that controlling access to school buildings \"is critical to providing a safe and secur[e] school environment.\" The expert opined that defendants failed to implement a hall-pass system, failed to control access to the building, and failed to supervise L.E., A.D. and R.B. on the date of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After discovery, the trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. In an oral opinion, the trial court found defendants were immune under the TCA. The court invoked N.J.S.A. 59:5-4, which provides public entities and employees immunity for \"failure to provide police protection services,\" and \"failure to provide sufficient police protection service.\" The court also relied on N.J.S.A. 59:3-5, which provides immunity to public employees for injuries \"caused ... by his [or her] failure to enforce any law.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 59:2-4 (extending similar immunity to public entities). The court rejected plaintiffs' negligent supervision claim, which it found unsupported by the expert's opinion. The judge stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   So plaintiffs argue that the defendants did not reasonably supervise the students. They point to the parts of the expert report noting the various failures that are alleged ...: failure to supervise, failure to have hall passes, not having somebody on the playground. But basically it boils down to a lack of security or a lack of supervision. And if it's a lack of security ... the Tort Claims Act provides a defense. And if it's a lack of\n   supervision, there's no expert for that. The policeman\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   is not an expert on what is appropriate supervision for 15-year-olds in a high school.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court also questioned whether plaintiffs could prove causation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   And I guess what's alleged here is that they did not act to ... give hall passes, have one police person on campus or have somebody everywhere at every point in time to make sure that girls are not entering the boys bathroom.... And there's a lot of assumptions to be made that if somebody was there, ... that person would have stopped her. It's really left a lot to speculation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   However, the court ultimately concluded that plaintiffs' negligent supervision claim was, at bottom, a claim of inadequate security. \"Plaintiffs here have not raised any facts outside of lack of security at school which would subject defendants to liability.\" The court found that statutory immunity shielded defendants. \"Mainly, the plaintiff is alleging ... that defendants negligently supervised the three students, despite the fact that even if this were true, it would be irrelevant in light of the applicability of the police protection and the failure to enforce immunities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court also dismissed plaintiffs' claim that defendants failed to conduct an appropriate investigation of L.E.'s allegation. After reviewing the various steps that the individual defendants took, the court relied on plaintiffs' failure to present any evidence or expert opinion to establish a standard of care for the appropriate response to L.E.'s report. The court concluded that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate how any shortcomings in the individual defendants' response caused L.E. injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs contend the trial court misapplied the TCA. They argue that their claim pertains to negligent supervision, not inadequate police protection or failure to enforce laws. They also contend the trial judge inappropriately relied on facts pertaining to L.E. and P.T., which the judge learned while presiding over a Family Part matter involving them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Exercising de novo review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

The Act establishes the general principal of sovereign immunity, which is subject to exceptions, and specific grants of immunity. The Act provides, \"Except as otherwise provided by this act, a public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.\" N.J.S.A. 59:2-1. But, the Act states generally that \"[a] public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of a public employee within the scope of his employment in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" N.J.S.A. 59:2-2(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Margolis and Novack,\n   <em>\n    Claims Against Public Entities\n   </em>\n   , 1972 Task Force Comment to N.J.S.A. 59:2-2 (2018) (stating the subsection is \"[t]he primary source of public entity liability\"). Similarly, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by this act, a public employee is\n   liable for injury caused by his [or her] act or omission to the same extent as a private person.\" N.J.S.A. 59:3-1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Notwithstanding these general provisions, defendants seek protection under the specific immunities granted by N.J.S.A. 59:5-4 and N.J.S.A. 59:3-5.

Although a finding of proximate causation is far from certain, a jury could reasonably find that defendants' negligent supervision was a proximate cause of the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although we reverse the trial court's dismissal of plaintiffs' negligent supervision claim, we agree with the trial court's assessment of their claim that defendants inadequately responded to L.E.'s report of the assault. Plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence on the standard of care or in establishing that any shortcoming in defendants' response caused or exacerbated L.E.'s injury. Any further discussion on that point is not warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, we need not address in any detail the issue of the trial judge's reference to facts of which she became aware in a separate Family Part proceeding but which were not of record on the summary judgment motion. The facts had no discernible impact on the court's decision, nor do they affect the disposition we reach here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Reversed in part; affirmed in part; and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Based on the date of his visit to the school, the expert acknowledged that he did not know whether the system was in place or operational when the assault occurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The court referred thereby to plaintiffs' expert, who was a former police detective and municipal police commissioner. After his policing career, the expert served lengthy stints as the security chief for two hospitals and a New Jersey university. He also reported experience managing the day-to-day security operations of educational programs serving K-12 students.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The parties have not cited to us, nor have we found, any State regulations or Department of Education guidelines or standards addressing the level of supervision that a high school should maintain over its students.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    We conclude the court mistakenly rejected the qualifications of plaintiffs' expert to opine about \"what is appropriate supervision for 15-year-olds in a high school.\" Our courts \"take a liberal approach when assessing a person's qualifications.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
