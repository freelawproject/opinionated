Specifically, we must decide whether the trial court improperly concluded that the search and seizure statutes satisfy the requirements set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which exempts documents\n   from disclosure under the act that are \"\n   <em>\n    otherwise\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    provided by any federal law or state statute\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) We conclude that the search and seizure statutes do not meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7 1-210 (a) and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court, and procedural history are relevant to the present appeal. In January, 2014, the plaintiffs, the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection and the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   received a request under the act from the defendant The Hartford Courant Company (Courant), and its reporter, the defendant David Altimari. In this request, the Courant and Altimari sought copies of certain documents referred to in the report prepared by the Connecticut State Police on the shooting that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. More specifically, the trial court's memorandum of decision notes that this request sought, inter alia, the following documents from the department: a spiral bound book written by the shooter, Adam Lanza, entitled \"The Big Book of Granny,\" \"a photo of the class of 2002-2003 at Sandy Hook Elementary School,\" and a \"spreadsheet ranking mass murders by name, number killed, number injured, types of weapons used, and disposition.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The department did not file a timely response to this request. As a result, the Courant and Altimari filed a complaint with the named defendant, the Freedom of Information Commission (commission). After they filed\n   that complaint, the department responded to the initial request by letter. In that letter, the supervisor of the department's legal affairs unit, Christine Plourde, stated that \"there are no documents responsive to your ... request\" because the request sought \"access to or copies of ... items of evidence that were seized or otherwise collected as part of the criminal investigation of the incident. Evidence collected as part of a criminal investigation does not constitute a public record under the [act].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Notwithstanding this response, the commission held a hearing on the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties in that administrative proceeding presented testimony, exhibits, and argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the department asserted that the documents were not subject to disclosure because they were not public records\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   under the act insofar as\n   they (1) do not relate \"to the conduct of the public's business,\" (2) \"are evidence under the control of the [J]udicial [B]ranch pursuant to the statutory scheme governing search warrants\n   and seized property,\" (3) are the private property of Adam Lanza or his mother, Nancy Lanza, and \"disclosure would constitute an invasion of [their] personal privacy,\" and (4) are not included in the department's public records retention schedule because they are documents seized pursuant to a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The commission rejected the department's claims and concluded that the documents were public records under the act. Specifically, the commission rejected the department's claim that the documents did not relate \"to the conduct of the public's business\" for purposes of \u00a7 1-200 (5). Instead, the commission determined that \"in the aftermath of the shootings, there was heightened public interest in the shootings, in determining how and why such shootings occurred, and in preventing such a horrific crime from happening again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The commission also found that, \"[a]lthough the [department was] provided the opportunity to offer evidence that the requested documents are exempt from disclosure, [it] declined to do so. Instead, [the department] offered an affidavit from Plourde [averring] that, although she had not looked at the requested documents, she believed that some of the documents might be exempt from disclosure under [\u00a7] 1-210 (b) [ (2), (10), (11) and (17) ].\" Consequently, the commission found that the department \"failed to prove that any of the requested documents are exempt from disclosure pursuant to any exemption.\" Accordingly, the commission ordered the department to provide a copy of the documents to the Courant and Altimari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, the department filed an appeal from the commission's decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA). The department also filed an application to stay enforcement of the final decision of the commission pending appeal, which was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Division of Criminal Justice then filed a motion to intervene in the present case as a party plaintiff, which was granted by the trial court. See footnote 2 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court ultimately agreed with the commission that the documents were public records, concluding that \"documents seized pursuant to a search warrant '[relate] to the conduct of the public's business' and, therefore, constitute public records under the act.\" Unlike the commission, however, the trial court then concluded that the documents were exempt from disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 1-210 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the trial court concluded the search and seizure statutes \"act as a shield from public disclosure of all seized property not used in a criminal prosecution.\" These appeals followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal to this court, the defendants assert that the trial court improperly concluded\n   that the documents were exempt from disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 1-210 (a). Specifically, the defendants assert that the trial court improperly failed to follow this court's existing precedent interpreting \u00a7 1-210 (a), which requires that the express terms of federal law or state statute must address confidentiality or otherwise limit the copying or disclosing of the documents at issue. The defendants further assert that the trial court improperly failed to construe the exemption in \u00a7 1-210 (a) narrowly, as required by the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, the department asserts that the trial court properly concluded that property seized pursuant to a search warrant is exempt from disclosure under\n   the act. More particularly, the department claims that this court's existing precedent establishes that state statutes that conflict or create conflicting obligations with public disclosure fall within the exemption from disclosure under \u00a7 1-210 (a). The department further asserts, as an alternative ground for affirmance, that the documents are not public records under the act. We agree with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We begin with the relevant legal principles and standard of review. \"This court reviews the trial court's judgment pursuant to the ... UAPA .... Under the UAPA, it is [not] the function ... of this court to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency.... Even for conclusions of law, [t]he court's ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion.... [Thus] [c]onclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.... [Similarly], this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute's purposes.... Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ... involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.... Furthermore, when a state agency's determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny ... the agency is not entitled to special deference.... We have determined, therefore, that the traditional deference accorded to an agency's interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute ... has not previously been subjected to judicial\n   scrutiny [or to] a governmental agency's time-tested interpretation ....\n   <em>\n    Chairperson, Connecticut Medical Examining Board v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Freedom of Information Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20276\">\n    310 Conn. 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 281-82,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%20121\">\n    77 A.3d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).

For the reasons that follow, we agree with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the present case, the trial court examined the obligations created by the search and seizure statutes. The trial court explained that \"[t]hese provisions establish that, after property is seized pursuant to a warrant, the [agency] seizing it maintains custody of it until ordered to dispose of it by a court. The disposition provisions ... make it mandatory that the court return seized property, other than contraband and the like, to an aggrieved criminal defendant in the event of an unlawful seizure or to any owner by the time of the final disposition of the criminal case.\" The trial court concluded, therefore, that \"[t]he act conflicts with these provisions by providing for public disclosure of documents that were private property before seizure by the police and that a court would ordinarily order returned to the rightful owner by the end of a criminal case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although the trial court acknowledged that the state will often disclose seized items during the criminal process and that those items will likely become part of the public domain, that disclosure comes from the state's obligations to prosecute all crimes under General Statutes \u00a7 51-277 (b) and to disclose certain evidence to criminal defendants pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bradyv.Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). The trial court explained that the conflict between the act and the search and seizure statutes occurs in situations in which seized items have not been disclosed in the course of a prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court explained that courts \"ultimately [have] a mandatory, statutory duty to return the seized property, unless it is contraband or otherwise unlawful to possess, to the owner before anyone from the public will have an opportunity to see it. In these situations, the seizure statutes act as a shield from public disclosure.\" The trial court further explained that \"[d]isclosure to the public under the act in such cases is in direct conflict with the ownership rights protected by the seizure statutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court further explained that release of seized items under the act would render meaningless the court's obligation under the search and seizure statutes to return the items to their owner. The trial court cited to the basic tenet of statutory construction that a statute \"must be construed, if possible, such that no clause,\n   sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Podiatric Medical Assn.v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Health Net of Connecticut, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12170558\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/302/464/#p474\">\n    302 Conn. 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20A.3d%20958\">\n    28 A.3d 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the act could not be interpreted in a manner that would allow for public disclosure of the documents. Instead, the trial court concluded that the search and seizure statutes \"act as a shield from public disclosure of all seized property not used in a criminal prosecution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Even assuming that the trial court's interpretation of the court's obligations under the search and seizure statutes is correct-namely, to return seized items to the lawful owner-we must determine whether those obligations render the documents exempt from the act because they are \"otherwise provided by ... state statute ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (a). As we explained previously herein, this question of statutory construction is subject to plenary review.

To the extent\n   that this footnote implies that exceptions pursuant to \u00a7 1-210 (a) do not require narrow construction, we clarify that today. We reiterate that all exceptions from the act must be construed narrowly to effectuate the purpose of the act, which favors disclosure. Accordingly, we conclude that we must narrowly construe the \"otherwise provided\" language of \u00a7 1-210 (a), otherwise any statute governing an agency's general treatment of records becomes a possible restriction on disclosure-e.g., statutes that govern how state records are archived, or the retention of records by governmental agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In the present case, the trial court pointed to nothing in the express terms of the search and seizure statutes that creates confidentiality in the documents or otherwise limits the disclosure, copying, or distribution of the documents. Indeed, the search and seizure statutes are silent on the issues of confidentiality, copying, or disclosure to the public. Therefore, the trial court's conclusion that the search and seizure statutes form the basis for an exemption under \u00a7 1-210 (a) is inconsistent with our case law interpreting this exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, the basis for the trial court's holding was that \"[d]isclosure to the public under the act in such cases is in direct conflict with the ownership rights protected by the seizure statutes.\" Even if we agree with the trial court that the search and seizure statutes protect the ownership rights of the people whose property has been seized, we cannot conclude that a statutory scheme requiring that property be returned to its owners creates a duty of confidentiality for those items or otherwise limits public disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Indeed, we are not blind to the fact that limiting the disclosure of seized documents in order to protect the privacy of those whose property is seized, particularly if a criminal proceeding does not result, may be a good or even preferable way in which to deal with documents\n   seized in this manner. The department, however, does not, and cannot, point to express language in the search and seizure statutes providing for such confidentiality, and our task is to \"construe [the] statute as written.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Marcianov\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488690\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/1280/#p77\">\n    324 Conn. 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488690\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/1280/#p77\">\n    151 A.3d 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

Therefore, if we were to conclude that the search and seizure statutes serve as the basis for an exemption for all items governed by the search and seizure statutes, \u00a7 1-215 (b) (3) would be superfluous because any items seized during a person's arrest would be exempt from disclosure under the act.

Therefore, the failure of the legislature to include lawfully seized items in the exemptions for records of law enforcement agencies contained within \u00a7 1-210 (b) (3) supports our conclusion that records governed by the search and seizure statutes are not exempt from disclosure under the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We take this opportunity to point out that we reach the conclusion that the documents in the present case are subject to disclosure on the basis of the unique procedural posture of this case. The department had the opportunity to present evidence at the hearing before the commission establishing that these documents fell within another exception to the act, but it declined to do so. As we have explained previously herein, \"the burden of proving the applicability of an exemption rests upon the agency claiming it.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilsonv\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Freedom of Information Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952713\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/181/324/#p328\">\n    181 Conn. at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20A.2d%20353\">\n    435 A.2d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nevertheless, the department only made legal argument and presented testimony of, and an affidavit from,\n   witnesses who had never seen the documents at issue. Therefore, the commission concluded that the department had failed to produce any evidence that the documents were exempt from disclosure under any statute. Although we do not decide today whether the documents at issue in the present appeal would be exempt from disclosure under another section of the act or another state or federal law, the department's failure to produce sufficient evidence at the hearing before the commission would necessarily be fatal to such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As this court has explained, \"[t]he agency representative may testify concerning the content and use of the documents, or supply affidavits to the commission relating to their content and use.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Section 1-200 (5) defines \" '[p]ublic records or files' \" for purposes of the act as \"any recorded data or information relating to the conduct of the public's business prepared, owned, used, received or retained by a public agency, or to which a public agency is entitled to receive a copy by law or contract under section 1-218,\n   whether such data or information be handwritten, typed, tape-recorded, printed, photostated, photographed or recorded by any other method.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The department asserts that the documents do not relate \"to the conduct of the public's business\" as that term is used in \u00a7 1-200 (5) because they were created by a private individual and not the department. The commission found that the documents related to the public's business for the following reasons: (1) \"there was heightened public interest generally in the shootings and, specifically, in knowing how and why the shootings occurred\"; (2) \"the requested documents informed the investigation\"; (3) \"significant public resources were expended in conducting a massive, [yearlong] investigation, and in examining gun control measures and mental health issues arising out of the shootings\"; and (4) \"there will be no criminal prosecution through which the public otherwise would have any access to the requested documents ....\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The trial court disagreed with this analysis, rejecting the notion that the question of whether a document was a public record for purposes of the act would depend on the public's interest in a particular criminal investigation. Instead, the trial court concluded that, \"although documents may be privately created and perhaps do not '[relate] to [the conduct of] the public's business' at the time of their creation, the fact that they were\n   lawfully seized by the police means that there was probable cause to believe that, at a minimum, they constitute 'evidence of an offense, or ... evidence that a particular person participated in the commission of an offense ....' [ General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a (b) (3) ]. At that point, they do relate to the public's business. For these reasons, the court concludes that documents seized pursuant to a search warrant '[relate] to the conduct of the public's business' and therefore constitute public records under the act.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In determining whether document seized during the investigation of a crime are public records under the act, we are mindful that the purpose of the act is \"to balance the public's right to know what its agencies are doing, with the governmental and private needs for confidentiality.... [I]t is this balance of the governmental and private needs for confidentiality with the public right to know that must govern the interpretation and application of the [act].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Public Safetyv\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Freedom of Information Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344380\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/703/#p726\">\n    298 Conn. at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20A.3d%20763\">\n    6 A.3d 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With this in mind, we agree with the trial court that documents that are not created by an agency, but come into its possession because there was probable cause to believe that they constitute \"evidence of an offense, or ... evidence that a particular person participated in the commission of an offense,\" relate to the conduct of the public's business. General Statutes \u00a7 54a-33a (b) (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, our interpretation that documents seized by the police are public records under the act is consistent with other provisions of the act. For instance, as discussed previously in this opinion, \u00a7 1-215 (b) provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny personal possessions or effects found on a person at the time of such person's arrest shall not be disclosed unless such possessions or effects are relevant to the crime for which such person was arrested.\" See footnote 8 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   If we were to accept the department's claim that items, more specifically documents, seized by the police in the investigation of a crime do not constitute a public record, this provision exempting some seized items from the act would be meaningless. As we have explained, we must interpret statutes so as\n   not to render any term meaningless.

Accordingly, we reject the department's claim that documents seized by law enforcement in the present case are not public records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In support of its claim, the department relies on testimony that the documents are not public records because they are not the department's property and they are owned by someone else. Specifically, the department relies on testimony from the Chief State's Attorney, Kevin Kane, who testified before the commission that the seized property did not belong to the department. Kane conceded, however, that the written report describing the items was a public record. In any event, whether the documents constitute a public record for purposes of the act presents a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Chairperson, Connecticut Medical Examining Boardv.Freedom of Information Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20276\">\n    310 Conn. at 281-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%20121\">\n    77 A.3d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
