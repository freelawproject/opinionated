He asserted that BAC - the alleged servicer of loans made in 2007 when plaintiff purchased his Williamstown residence - neglected to include the name and address of the lender, defendant Bank of America, N.A. (the bank).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although no foreclosure action followed on the heels of these notices, plaintiff claims these FFA violations - not actionable on their own - may form the basis of a claim under the New Jersey Truth-in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act (TCCWNA), N.J.S.A. 56:12-14 to -18. Consequently, he argues that the trial judge erred in dismissing the complaint by applying the litigation privilege and by holding that the alleged FFA violation cannot support a TCCWNA claim. We reject the application of the litigation privilege but because the legal grounds upon which the latter determination was based have shifted since the trial judge's decision and the perfection of this appeal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spade v.

Our Supreme Court has held - albeit after the alleged faulty notices were served on plaintiff - that the FFA's command that the lender's identity and address must be provided, N.J.S.A. 2A:50-56(c)(11), is not satisfied when only the name and address of the lender's servicing agent is provided.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v.

As mentioned, plaintiff claims BAC violated the FFA when, in 2010, it served notices that appeared to lack the lender's information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n.1, above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Even though there is no suggestion that the content of the notices was false or misleading - only that a legal requirement was omitted - we assume this type of FFA violation may support a TCCWNA claim because, in enacting\n   TCCWNA, the Legislature \"chose expansive language to describe the consumers and potential consumers whom the statute was enacted to protect.\"\n   <em>\n    Spade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n    232 N.J. at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n    181 A.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   TCCWNA may be triggered by a departure from any \"clearly established legal right\" or \"responsibility.\" N.J.S.A. 56:12-15. Such a departure occurs when a consumer protection statute or regulation prohibited \"the contractual provision\n   <em>\n    or other practice\n   </em>\n   \" that is the basis of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Dugan v. TGI Fridays, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    231 N.J. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    171 A.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (emphasis added). We agree that the required analysis not only encompasses the content of or omission of provisions from a loan agreement - the breach of which generated a lender's right to foreclose - but also FFA violations revealed by a lender's pre-suit notice of intention to foreclose. The statutorily-required notice of intention\n   to foreclose is part of the foreclosure \"practice\" and, thus, a critical element that would fall within TCCWNA's scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That conclusion does not end our analysis. Although viewing expansively what it means to be a \"consumer\" when the Legislature declared what a lender may not do when engaging a \"consumer\" or \"prospective consumer\" in N.J.S.A. 56:12-15,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Spade\n   </em>\n   Court viewed less expansively what was meant by an \"\n   <em>\n    aggrieved\n   </em>\n   consumer\" when the Legislature fixed the scope of \"civil liability\" in N.J.S.A. 56:12-17 (emphasis added) for such a violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Spade\n   </em>\n   Court explained that, in enacting N.J.S.A. 56:12-17, the Legislature \"chose a more precise term: 'aggrieved consumer,' \" and \"clearly intended to differentiate between 'consumers and prospective consumers' - the broad category of people whom the Legislature seeks to shield from offending provisions - and 'aggrieved consumers' entitled to a remedy under the TCCWNA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n    232 N.J. at 521-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n    181 A.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In ascertaining the meaning of these provisions, the Court held that \"an 'aggrieved consumer' is a consumer who has been harmed by a violation of N.J.S.A. 56:12-15.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n    at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n    181 A.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court held that if\n   the consumer would have sought a refund but was deterred by the prohibited no-refund language, \"that consumer may be an 'aggrieved consumer' entitled to a civil penalty under N.J.S.A. 56:12-17.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same consumer would be aggrieved if the untimely delivery and the forbidden language left the consumer \"without furniture needed for a family gathering.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n    at 523-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/\">\n    181 A.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The complaint expressly demands only an award of the statutory $100 penalty for each alleged TCCWNA violation, so it may be that plaintiff recognizes his inability to show an injury compensable by monetary damages. But, because the case was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, the factual record is more than a little barren as to how the alleged injury may have impacted plaintiff. It may be that under\n   <em>\n    Spade\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of\n   TCCWNA, plaintiff may not even be an aggrieved consumer entitled to a statutory penalty. Because the matter was dismissed before the parties and the trial court had the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Spade\n   </em>\n   , the best course calls for a remand to allow plaintiff to file an amended complaint that would identify the alleged harm he believes was caused by the pre-suit notices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greenbriar Oceanaire Cmty.

Without that need for protection and without the benefit derived from protecting a speaker from suit, the litigation privilege should have no application.
