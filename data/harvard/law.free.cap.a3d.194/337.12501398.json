On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court (1) abused its discretion in\n   making its financial orders because, in their entirety, they favored the defendant; (2) erred in applying the present division method of valuation to the distribution of the parties' defined benefit plans; and (3) erred in its treatment of the plaintiff's pay-status pension and the defendant's nonpay-status pension. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff and the defendant were married on October 20, 1978. The plaintiff brought the underlying action for dissolution of marriage by complaint dated March 8, 2016. Following a five day trial, on May 24, 2017, the court dissolved the parties' marriage on the ground of irretrievable breakdown,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and entered various\n   financial and property division orders. The court ordered, in relevant part, that the defendant pay to the plaintiff $125 per week for a period of eighteen months as rehabilitative alimony,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the plaintiff pay to the defendant $1 per week as alimony for a period of eighteen months because the defendant's employment future was uncertain. The court also ordered that \"[t]he defendant shall transfer $48,750 to the plaintiff from her Fidelity 401 (k) plan .... This distribution takes into account the disparity in the parties' defined benefit plans.... The parties\n   shall retain, free and clear of any claim by the other, their defined benefit plans.... The defendant shall retain ... any interest she has in [her] Computershare MetLife policy. The plaintiff shall retain the Minnesota Life Insurance Policy, and its cash value ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Footnote omitted.) This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We begin by setting forth our general standard of review in family matters. \"The standard of review in family matters is well settled. An appellate court will not disturb a trial court's orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented.... It is within the province of the trial court to find facts and draw proper inferences from the evidence presented.... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action.... [T]o conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, we must find that the court either incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably conclude as it did.... Appellate review of a trial court's findings of fact is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review.... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Powell-Ferri\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ferri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490232\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/165/1124/#p464\">\n    326 Conn. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490232\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/165/1124/#p464\">\n    165 A.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff first claims that the court abused its discretion because its \"financial orders ... are inequitably favorable to the defendant [because the] orders assign to the defendant the large majority of the marital assets and income.\" Specifically, the plaintiff challenges the court's orders regarding the alimony award, the division of the parties' pensions and retirement funds, unknown future debt, the requirement that the parties pay their own health insurance, the defendant's MetLife account, and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"In dissolution proceedings, the court must fashion its financial orders in accordance with the criteria set forth in [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-81 (division of\n   marital property) and [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-82 (alimony).\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Rozsa\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rozsa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067102\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/117/1/#p9\">\n    117 Conn.

Our thorough review of the record leads us to conclude that the court properly considered the appropriate statutory factors, and that its orders were both supported by its findings and within its broad discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff next claims that the court applied the incorrect valuation standard\n   for the distribution of the parties' defined benefit plans because it should have applied the present value method instead of the present division method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"There are three widely approved methods of valuing and distributing pension benefits\"-the present value method, the present division method, and the reserved jurisdiction method.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Krafick\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krafick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"770570\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/234/783/#p800\">\n    234 Conn. 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20A.2d%20365\">\n    663 A.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). \"[I]t is within the trial court's discretion ... to choose, on a case-by-case basis ...

In the present case, the plaintiff claims that, \"[b]ecause [his] pension was already in pay status, the present value method was likely the preferable valuation and distribution method,\" and not the present division method. The plaintiff, however, has failed to demonstrate that the\n   court abused its broad discretion in applying the present division method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff claims that the court erred in its treatment of his pay-status pension and the defendant's nonpay-status pension. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the court's order constituted impermissible \"double dipping\" because the court considered his income from his pension in making the alimony award and also in dividing the parties' assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trial courts are vested with broad discretion to award alimony, and, when a court determines whether to award alimony and the amount of any such award, \u00a7 46b-82 expressly authorizes the court to consider the marital assets distributed to each party in connection with the dissolution proceeding.

[and] only to the extent that any portion of the pension assigned to the nonemployee spouse was counted in\n   determining the employee\n   spouse's resources for purposes of alimony\"). In the present case, in ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff rehabilitative alimony, the court considered the plaintiff's income from his pension, rather than the value of the pension asset, and his other income, to determine how much additional support he would need from the defendant for rehabilitative alimony.
