Here, the questions presented are whether a right to pursue a defamation action is subordinate to the right to complain through appropriate administrative channels and whether state employees may be sued for damages for failing to investigate such complaints. The defendants, Ruthe Bubar, Robert Carini and Lora A. Castronova, appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for summary judgment. The defendants claim that the court improperly denied their motion for summary judgment, which claimed (1) that Bubar was entitled to absolute immunity and (2) that Carini and Castronova were entitled to qualified immunity. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The following facts were presented to the court by way of the pleadings and documents accompanying the motion for summary judgment. They are not in dispute for the purpose of our resolution of the defendants\u2019 appeal. At relevant times, the plaintiff, Susan Morgan, and the defendants were employees of the department of correction and were assigned to the York Correctional Institution in Niantic. The plaintiff instituted this action against the defendants by way of a four count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>complaint. Counts one and two of the amended complaint alleged claims sounding in defamation against Bubar. Both of the allegedly defamatory statements in this case involve accusations by Bubar that the plaintiff choked her at some point in early 1999. Count one alleged defamation arising out of statements by Bubar during a meeting on August 10, 2000, attended by an affirmative action officer, the plaintiff and several coworkers. Count two alleged defamation arising out of a memorandum dated August 8, 2000, written by Bubar to Castronova, in which Bubar reiterated an earlier statement that she had made to Castronova regarding the alleged choking incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Counts three and four of the amended complaint alleged deprivations of the plaintiffs rights to due process and equal protection under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and were brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. They were brought against Carini and Castronova, respectively. These two counts alleged that Carini\u2019s and Castronova\u2019s failure to investigate Bubar\u2019s choking allegations, as required by a state executive order on workplace violence and various department of correction directives, deprived the plaintiff of her due process and equal protection rights because an investigation would have refuted the allegations and \u201ccleared the plaintiffs name . . . .\u201d Counts three and four also alleged that the failure to investigate resulted in employment actions that were adverse to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that, inter alia, Bubar\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements are entitled to absolute immunity because they were made in the course of an administrative affirmative action complaint and that Carini and Castronova are entitled to qualified immunity as public officials because they allegedly violated no clearly defined constitutionally protected rights of the plaintiff. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>denied the defendants\u2019 motion, and the defendants moved for an articulation of the court\u2019s ruling. In its articulation, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 absolute immunity argument on the ground that \u201c[t]he evidence submitted by the defendants . . . does not meet their burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the August 10, 2000 meeting was part of an affirmative action investigation or complaint.\u201d The court also rejected the defendants\u2019 qualified immunity argument on the ground that \u201cgenuine issues of material fact exist as to the reasonableness of [Castronova\u2019s and Carini\u2019s] conduct.\u201d Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . The scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. . . . When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schilberg Integrated Metals Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>263 Conn. 245, 251-52, 819 A.2d 773 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The determination of whether an affirmative action investigation constitutes a quasi-judicial proceeding is a question of law over which our review is plenary. Whether particular conduct is by its nature part of or in furtherance of a quasi-judicial proceeding for the purposes of triggering absolute immunity, however, depends on the particular facts and circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>each case. See <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>271 Conn. 78, 83-84, 856 A.2d 372 (2004). \u201cWhether an official is entitled to qualified immunity presents a question of law that must be resolved de novo on appeal.\u201d <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>284 Conn. 502, 518, 935 A.2d 126 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">As a preliminary matter, we must address the issue of whether the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is a final judgment from which they immediately may appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the court\u2019s rulings on the portions of the defendants\u2019 appeal that pertain to their claims of absolute immunity and qualified immunity may be addressed by this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cAs a general rule, an interlocutory ruling may not be appealed pending the final disposition of a case.\u201d <em>Chadha </em>v. <em>Charlotte Hungerford Hospital, </em>272 Conn. 776, 784, 865 A.2d 1163 (2005). A denial of a motion for summary judgment, however, \u201cwhich had been filed on the basis of a colorable claim of absolute immunity, constitutes an appealable final judgment.\u201d Id., 787. Like sovereign immunity, the doctrine of absolute immunity \u201cprotects against suit as well as liability\u2014in effect, against having to litigate at all.\u201d Id., 786. In the present case, the defendants\u2019 claim of absolute immunity is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>least colorable because, most apparently, our case law consistently has recognized such immunity in similar factual settings. See, e.g., <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 88-96; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>221 Conn. 549, 606 A.2d 693 (1992); <em>Petyan </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>200 Conn. 243, 510 A.2d 1337 (1986). The defendants\u2019 claim that Bubar is entitled to absolute immunity is properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We next address whether the court\u2019s ruling with respect to the defendants\u2019 qualified immunity claims constitutes a reviewable final judgment. In counts three and four of the amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged that Carini and Castronova violated her constitutional rights and thereby violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Although state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims brought under \u00a7 1983, state courts must apply federal law in determining whether a defendant is immune from prosecution. See <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 284 n.8, 100 S. Ct. 553, 62 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1980); <em>Sullins </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>281 Conn. 128, 136, 913 A.2d 415 (2007); <em>Schnabel </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>230 Conn. 735, 742-43, 646 A.2d 152 (1994) (\u201c[A] claim for qualified immunity from liability for damages under \u00a7 1983 raises a question of federal law . . . and not state law. Therefore, in reviewing these claims of qualified immunity we are bound by federal precedent, and may not expand or contract the contours of the immunity available to government officials.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). In considering whether a District Court\u2019s denial of a claim of qualified immunity was an appeal-able final decision under federal law, the United States Supreme Court directly addressed the question of whether a finding of qualified immunity in the context of a \u00a7 1983 action compels immunity from suit as well as from liability. In <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985), the court stated that \u201c[t]he entitlement is an immunity from suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>rather than a mere defense to liability; and like an absolute immunity, it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\u201d In this state, consistent with federal law, an otherwise interlocutory judgment may immediately be appealable \u201cwhere the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27,31,463 A.2d 566 (1983). The defendants\u2019 claim that the court improperly denied the motion for summary judgment as to whether Carini and Castronova are entitled to qualified immunity is properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We turn now to Bubar\u2019s absolute immunity claim. The dispositive issues are whether the setting in which her statements were made was a quasi-judicial proceeding and, if so, whether the alleged defamatory statements were made in the course of the proceeding and related to the subject matter of that proceeding. Count one concerns allegedly defamatory statements made by Bubar in a meeting on August 10, 2000. Count two concerns statements made by Bubar in a memorandum to Castronova that was dated August 8,2000. The memorandum requested an affirmative action proceeding, and the August 10 meeting was, according to Bubar, part of the affirmative action process. Bubar argues that the court improperly denied summary judgment as to these counts because Bubar\u2019s statements at issue were made during the course of a quasi-judicial proceeding, thereby entitling them to absolute immunity. The plaintiff argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was a quasi-judicial proceeding. We agree with Bubar and conclude that her statements are entitled to absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendants\u2019 claim and are not in dispute. At some point in early 1999, Bubar reported to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Carini, the supervisor of both the plaintiff and Bubar, that approximately one week earlier the plaintiff had approached Bubar in the workplace, grabbed her by her lapels, shook her and said something to the effect of, \u201c[s]ometimes I get so frustrated with you.\u201d On August 8, 2000, Bubar wrote the memorandum to Castronova, the supervisor of the plaintiff, Bubar and Carini. Bubar wrote in this memorandum that she meant to \u201creiterate and clarify\u201d the concerns she stated in a meeting she had with Castronova and Carini on August 4, 2000. Bubar made the following statement in the memorandum: \u201c[The plaintiffs] anger and her unprofessional behavior directed towards me continues in an unresolved pattern. ... I find [the plaintiffs] more recent verbal accusations and written documentation extremely threatening to me, especially due to the fact that [her] past history of anger resulted in her physically assaulting me in the work place. Based on these factors, I am acutely aware that [the plaintiff] has demonstrated a true capacity to harm, not only my professional character and reputation, but also, [she] presents a very real threat of physical danger to me. I still do not feel safe.\u201d Bubar concluded the memorandum with the following: \u201cI am requesting York Correction Institution\u2019s administration to refer this matter to Affirmative Action for resolution.\u201d This statement, which the plaintiff alleges to be defamatory in nature, forms the basis for count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">On August 10, 2000, a meeting was held among the plaintiff, Bubar and Charlene Burton, an affirmative action officer with the department of correction. Also present were Nancy Chartier, a coworker at York, and Charles Ward, a union representative. The plaintiff alleged in count one that Bubar made the following defamatory statement at the meeting: \u201c \u2018[The plaintiff] put her hands on my neck and choked me so hard I could not feel my feet.\u2019 \u201d This meeting was described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>as an \u201caffirmative action meeting\u201d by the plaintiff, Bubar and Ward in separate department incident reports filed in early 2001. In another incident report completed by Chartier, she stated that the purpose of the meeting was to attempt to resolve \u201can issue between staff . . . .\u201d The statement made in this meeting forms the basis for count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">A second meeting was held the following month. Present at this meeting were the plaintiff, Bubar, Burton, Ward and Carini. In his incident report, Ward stated that this meeting \u201cwas in regards to Bubar\u2019s accusation that [the plaintiff] allegedly choked her.\u201d In an incident report prepared by Bubar, she stated that at that second meeting, \u201cBurton stated that since there was no initial incident report written regarding this matter . . . she would not formally pursue any part of it, equating it to a \u2018moot point\u2019.\u201d Also, according to Bubar\u2019s account of the second meeting, \u201cBurton stated that nothing further would ever be done with this incident: there would be no report, nothing written, or nothing placed into our [department of correction] personnel files regarding this matter.\u201d In her incident report, the plaintiff claims that Burton contacted her on November 9, 2000, and informed her that \u201can investigation was never conducted because the choking incident was not an affirmative [action] matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The defendants moved for summary judgment as to counts one and two on the ground that Bubar was entitled to absolute immunity because the statements were made during the course of an affirmative action investigation. Because of Burton\u2019s statements that the incident was \u201cnot an affirmative [action] matter\u201d and that she would not formally pursue it, the court concluded that a genuine issue existed as to whether an affirmative action investigation had ever been instituted. The court denied the defendants\u2019 motion, and they appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cA defamatory statement is defined as a communication that tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him .... To establish a prima facie case of defamation, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) the defendant published a defamatory statement; (2) the defamatory statement identified the plaintiff to a third person; (3) the defamatory statement was published to a third person; and (4) the plaintiffs reputation suffered injury as a result of the statement.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cweklinsky </em>v. <em>Mobil Chemical Co., </em>267 Conn. 210, 217, 837 A.2d 759 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">\u201cThe effect of an absolute privilege in a defamation action [however] is that damages cannot be recovered for a defamatory statement even if it is published falsely and maliciously. . . . [L]ike the privilege which is generally applied to pertinent statements made in formal judicial proceedings, an absolute privilege also attaches to relevant statements made during administrative proceedings which are quasijudicial in nature. . . . Once it is determined that a proceeding is quasijudicial in nature, the absolute privilege that is granted to statements made in furtherance of it extends to every step of the proceeding until final disposition.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\u201cThe judicial proceeding to which [absolute] immunity attaches has not been defined very exactly. It includes any hearing before a tribunal which performs a judicial function, ex parte or otherwise, and whether the hearing is public or not. It includes, for example, lunacy, bankruptcy, or naturalization proceedings, and an election contest. It extends also to the proceedings of many administrative officers, such as boards and commissions, so far as they have powers of discretion in applying the law to the facts which are regarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>judicial or quasi-judicial, in character.\u201d <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 84-85. In <em>Kelley, </em>our Supreme Court delineated several factors that assist in determining whether a proceeding is quasi-judicial in nature. These factors include \u201cwhether the body has the power to: (1) exercise judgment and discretion; (2) hear and determine or to ascertain facts and decide; (3) make binding orders and judgments; (4) affect the personal or property rights of private persons; (5) examine witnesses and hear the litigation of the issues on a hearing; and (6) enforce decisions or impose penalties.\u201d <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 567. \u201cFurther, it is important to consider whether there is a sound public policy reason for permitting the complete freedom of expression that a grant of absolute immunity provides.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In <em>Kelley, </em>our Supreme Court held that statements made by persons requesting the state board of education to investigate a local teacher were absolutely privileged. Id., 571. Similar to the memorandum at issue in the present case, the source of the allegedly defamatory statements in <em>Kelley </em>was a letter written by members of a local school board requesting an investigation into acts of alleged wrongdoing by a teacher in the local board\u2019s district. Id., 554-55. In reaching its conclusion that the statements in the letter were absolutely privileged, the court considered the factors enumerated previously and concluded that the state board of education was a quasi-judicial body. Id., 571. The court noted the state board\u2019s ability to revoke a teaching certificate and the requirement that a request for revocation be submitted under oath. Id., 567-69. The state board was required to conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine whether probable cause existed. Id., 569. If it were to find that probable cause existed, the holder of the certificate would be notified, and a public hearing would be held at the request of the holder. Id., 569-70. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>At the hearing, the holder was entitled to counsel, to be heard, to call and to cross-examine witnesses and to present oral argument. Id., 570. Finally, the state board was required to state in writing the reasons for its decision. Id. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he detailed procedures . . . and the compelling public policy concern for the protection of school age children persuade us that the decertification proceedings before the state board of education were quasijudicial in nature, and that any steps made as a requisite step in those proceedings were absolutely privileged.\u201d Id., 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 88, our Supreme Court applied the factors articulated in <em>Kelley </em>and concluded that an investigation conducted by the internal affairs division of the Hartford police department was a quasi-judicial proceeding. The allegedly defamatory statement in <em>Craig </em>was a citizen complaint to the department. Id., 81. It accused an officer of using a racial slur while on the job. Id. In support of its conclusion that the investigation by the department constituted a quasi-judicial proceeding, the court noted that the internal affairs investigation process required complaints to be put into written form and to be sent to the internal affairs division where a determination would be made as to whether the charges would be investigated by the officer\u2019s immediate supervisor or an internal affairs investigator. Id., 87. If, as in <em>Craig, </em>an internal affairs investigator is assigned, the investigator acts as a fact finder by interviewing witnesses, who give sworn statements under penalty of criminal liability. Id. The investigator then prepares a report that is presented to the commander of the internal affairs division, who reviews the report and then forwards it to a bureau commander. Id. The bureau commander then reviews the report and determines whether the department should further investigate the claims. Id. If the department determines there should be further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>investigation, the chief of police may pursue one of several options, including ordering command discipline, issuing an oral reprimand, issuing a written reprimand, ordering an expedited hearing or ordering a formal hearing. Id. At a formal hearing, the accused has the right to counsel, witnesses testify under oath, the accused has the right to cross-examine, and a city attorney is present to rule on questions of evidence. Id., 88. The formal hearing carries a potential penalty of suspension or termination, and the officer has the right to appeal from the decision. Id., 87-88. After outlining this process, the court determined that the internal affairs procedure met most of the six factors articulated in <em>Kelley </em>and determined that it was a quasi-judicial proceeding. Id., 88-90. On the basis of this determination, the court concluded that the statements made during the course of the internal affairs investigation were entitled to the protection of absolute immunity. Id., 93. Similar to the present case, the allegedly defamatory statements in <em>Craig </em>were made during the preliminary stages of the investigation, before any formal action was taken. Id., 81. These statements were entitled to absolute immunity because immunity \u201cextends to every step of the [proceeding] until final disposition.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 93, quoting <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In the context of the present case, the department of correction\u2019s affirmative action investigation procedure is governed by the department\u2019s administrative directive 2.1 entitled \u201cEqual Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action.\u201d Paragraph ten of the directive, entitled \u201cGrievance Procedure,\u201d outlines the steps to be taken to resolve a grievance brought to the affirmative action unit. It requires a grievance to be filed with the affirmative action unit within sixty days of the alleged discriminatory act. The affirmative action unit is directed first to attempt to resolve the grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201cthrough an informal process\u201d to \u201creconcile the matter at the lowest possible level.\u201d The affirmative action unit first conducts an investigation to determine whether an employment discrimination violation may have occurred. If it concludes that the grievance is not valid or that no discriminatory act occurred, the grievance may be dismissed. This decision is appealable to the commissioner of correction. If, however, it concludes that a violation may have occurred, it is directed to \u201cinitiate attempts to cause reconciliation of the parties.\u201d If the parties to the grievance agree to a resolution, the terms of the resolution are set forth in a written agreement that is signed by both parties. The commissioner of correction has the power to enforce the terms of the resolution agreement. The grievance procedure also permits the filing of complaints with the commission on human rights and opportunities or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but requires that the informal grievance process, once initiated, be exhausted before these alternate routes are pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">With this background in mind, we conclude that the department of correction\u2019s affirmative action investigation process constitutes a quasi-judicial proceeding and, accordingly, statements made within the context of that investigation are appropriately afforded absolute privilege. We consider the factors articulated in <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 567. With regard to the first factor, affirmative action unit officers exercise judgment and discretion during the informal investigation process when they determine whether a grievance is valid and whether a discriminatory act has occurred. If they determine that the grievance is not valid or no discriminatory act has occurred, the grievance may be dismissed, subject to review by the commissioner of correction. If they determine that the grievance is valid and a discriminatory act has occurred, they initiate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>attempts to reach a reconciliation agreement between the parties. The act of attempting to reconcile the grievance between the parties is analogous to the procedures of other bodies that we have concluded are quasi-judicial in nature. See <em>Preston </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke, </em>74 Conn. App. 301, 312, 811 A.2d 753 (2002) (concluding that arbitration process was quasi-judicial proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">As to the second factor, affirmative action officers hear and ascertain facts during the informal investigation. Officers must decide, on the basis of the facts gathered during the informal investigation phase of the procedure, whether a discriminatory act has occurred and whether to proceed with attempts to reconcile the grievance between the parties. The directive\u2019s requirement that officers \u201cattempt to reconcile the matter at the lowest possible level\u201d necessarily requires that they hear and determine facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The third factor is whether the body has the power to make binding orders and judgments. Apparently, such power is indirect, though not entirely lacking: the agreements reached are enforceable in that the commissioner of correction is empowered to make binding orders of compliance if a party fails to meet the obligations set forth in the resolution agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">As to the fourth factor, the investigation may have some effect on personal or property rights: Administrative directive 2.6,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> entitled \u201cEmployee Discipline,\u201d grants the commissioner of correction responsibility \u201cfor approving all dismissals, demotions or suspensions . . . .\u201d Disciplinary action may result from the violation of agreements, and the affirmative action process must be exhausted before other administrative remedies may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>be pursued. See <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 90 (potential suspension or dismissal of officer being investigated affects personal or property rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">With regard to the fifth factor, examining witnesses and hearing litigation, the administrative directive governing the affirmative action unit states that its responsibilities include conducting and overseeing \u201cthe investigation and resolution of discrimination complaints . . . made under the Department\u2019s Affirmative Action Grievance Procedure.\u201d Questioning witnesses and hearing the issues, though quite informally, fall under the affirmative action officers\u2019 responsibility to investigate grievances and resolve them \u201cat the lowest possible level.\u201d Furthermore, paragraph twelve of administrative directive 2.1 prohibits adverse action against an individual for \u201cfiling a complaint, testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an investigation proceeding or hearing.\u201d This section signals that the grievance procedure contemplates the calling of witnesses and hearing of testimony as part of the affirmative action investigation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Finally, the sixth factor addresses the body\u2019s ability to enforce decisions or to impose penalties. The commissioner of correction has the power to enforce the terms of any resolution agreement, and the administrative directive on employee discipline permits the commissioner to impose penalties for failure to follow orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The contemplated procedures are informal and allow for a degree of flexibility in resolving workplace conflict. Some of the <em>Kelley </em>factors are more clearly satisfied than others. See <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 94-95 (quasi-judicial body need not possess all six powers). On balance, however, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>believe that the process has sufficient indicia of regularity to qualify as a quasi-judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Additionally, there are strong public policy justifications for affording absolute immunity. \u201cThe policy underlying the privilege is that in certain situations the public interest in having people speak freely outweighs the risk that individuals will occasionally abuse the privilege by making false and malicious statements.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Petyan </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 246. It \u201creflects the unspoken reality that, if there were no absolute immunity, good faith criticism of governmental misconduct might be deterred by concerns about unwarranted litigation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 95. In <em>Craig, </em>our Supreme Court recognized the \u201cdebilitating\u201d effect that a false allegation of racial discrimination can have on a police officer but concluded that the policy of encouraging citizen complaints outweighed the need to protect the reputation of the officer against whom a complaint is made. Id., 95-96. The same reasoning applies in the present case. A false allegation of discrimination to the affirmative action unit at the department of correction may have a debilitating effect on the employee against whom the complaint is made. We conclude, however, that the policy of encouraging candid disclosure of discriminatory occurrences outweighs the risk that statements made in the context of an affirmative action investigation may be false or malicious.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Having concluded that the department of correction\u2019s affirmative action investigation constitutes a quasi-judicial proceeding, we must next determine whether the alleged defamatory statements were made in the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>of the proceeding and whether they related to the subject matter of that proceeding. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 566 (absolute privilege attaches to relevant statements made in furtherance of quasi-judicial proceeding). Because the alleged defamatory statements clearly related to the subject matter of the proceeding, that being the alleged choking incident, we must determine only whether the statements at issue were made in the course of the proceeding. \u201cOnce it is determined that a proceeding is quasijudicial in nature, the absolute privilege that is granted to statements made in furtherance of it extends to <em>every step of the proceeding </em>until final disposition.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201c[AJllegations contained within a complaint in a quasijudicial proceeding are absolutely privileged.\u201d Id., 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Bubar\u2019s two statements at issue were made in an effort to initiate an affirmative action investigation. The memorandum containing the statement forming the basis of count two of the plaintiffs amended complaint concluded with a specific request that the matter be referred to the affirmative action unit. The memorandum is functionally identical to the request for the investigation in <em>Kelley. </em>See id., 554-55. The statement at issue in the first count was made during a meeting with the affirmative action officer in response to Bubar\u2019s earlier request that the matter be referred to the affirmative action unit. Like the statements at issue in <em>Craig, </em>which were made in the preliminary stage of responding to a citizen complaint, the allegedly defamatory statements in the present case were made during the initial fact gathering phase of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The plaintiff, however, argues that the statements were not made in the context of an affirmative action investigation because affirmative action officer Burton concluded that the alleged choking incident was \u201cnot an affirmative [action] matter.\u201d The plaintiff argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>\u201c[b]ecause [Burton] concluded that the matter was not in her jurisdiction, she never attempted to resolve the matter at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Contrary to the plaintiffs assertions, the fact that Burton decided against taking further action does not mean that Bubar\u2019s statements were not made in the context of a quasi-judicial proceeding. If, for example, a plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court that was later dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the plaintiff would still be entitled to absolute immunity against defamation claims arising from statements made in that complaint despite the fact that the action was dismissed. See <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 263, 597 A.2d 807 (1991) (\u201c[t]he common law protects allegations in a complaint with an \u2018absolute privilege\u2019 \u201d). In <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>282 Conn. 821, 925 A.2d 1030 (2007), our Supreme Court faced the issue of whether a police officer\u2019s actions pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-503 (a), which permits an officer to \u201cexecute a written request for [an] emergency examination\u201d of an individual \u201cin need of immediate care and treatment,\u201d were sufficiently connected to a commitment proceeding to warrant absolute immunity. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>supra, 837; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-503 (a). In its analysis of this issue, the court stated: \u201cIt would, in our view, make no sense to make the police officer\u2019s immunity dependent on the outcome of that evaluation and whether the psychiatrist determines that commitment is appropriate.\u201d <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>supra, 837. Similarly, in <em>Kelley, </em>the court concluded that a request for an investigation to be held was entitled to absolute privilege regardless of the ultimate outcome of that investigation. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 571. By analogy, it would make no sense in the present case to make a complainant\u2019s immunity dependent on the affirmative action officer\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>should be noted that at least two meetings were held between the plaintiff, Bubar, the affirmative action officer and others before the affirmative action unit\u2019s involvement in the matter was terminated. We conclude that Bubar\u2019s statements were made in the course of the proceeding and are therefore entitled to absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly denied their motion for summary judgment as to counts three and four of the amended complaint. The defendants argue that Carini and Castronova are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not violate a clearly established constitutional right. The plaintiff argues that the court correctly denied summary judgment as to counts three and four because there was at least a genuine issue of fact as to whether Carini and Castro-nova violated her constitutional rights to due process and equal protection under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In counts three and four of her amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged that Carini and Castronova were required to initiate and to conduct an investigation into Bubar\u2019s allegation of \u201cworkplace violence\u201d as required by Executive Order No. 16, \u201cViolence in the Workplace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Prevention Policy\u201d (August 4,1999) (executive order).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In count three, the plaintiff specifically alleged that Carini\u2019s \u201cfailure, refusal and neglect to investigate and act upon the reported assault was an abuse of his authority, and constituted a deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs rights to equal protection and due process guaranteed to her by the [fourteenth] [a]mendment to the United States [constitution and protected by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d In count four, the plaintiff alleged that Castronova\u2019s \u201cfailure to investigate constituted a deliberate indifference and/or denial of the plaintiffs rights to equal protection and due process of law guaranteed to her by the [fourteenth] [a]mendment to the United States [c]onstitution and protected by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The defendants sought summary judgment as to counts three and four on the ground that Carini and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Castronova were entitled to qualified immunity. In its denial of the defendants\u2019 motion, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 qualified immunity argument. In its articulation, the court concluded that \u201cthere is clearly an established right at stake\u201d and stated that \u201cthere are genuine issues of material fact as to the objective reasonableness of [Carini\u2019s and Castronova\u2019s] conduct in not immediately instituting an investigation after receiving allegations of a physical assault . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">\u201c[A] claim for qualified immunity from liability for damages under \u00a7 1983 raises a question of federal law . . . and not state law. Therefore, in reviewing these claims of qualified immunity we are bound by federal precedent, and may not expand or contract the contours of the immunity available to government officials. . . . Furthermore, in applying federal law in those instances where the United States Supreme Court has not spoken, we generally give special consideration to decisions of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schnabel </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 742-43. \u201cQualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tuchman </em>v. <em>State, </em>89 Conn. App. 745, 762,878 A.2d 384, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 920, 883 A.2d 1252 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\u201cWhen [a motion for summary judgment] is based on assertion of qualified immunity, the first issue is whether a clearly established right is at stake. ...

Blue </em>v. <em>Koren, </em>72 F.3d 1075, 1084 (2d Cir. 1995), citing <em>Siegert </em>v. <em>Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 232, 111 S. Ct. 1789, 114 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1991). \u201cA necessary concomitant to the determination of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the constitutional right asserted by a plaintiff is \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time the defendant acted is the determination of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all.\u201d <em>Siegert </em>v. <em>Gilley, </em>supra, 232. Recently, the United States Supreme Court held that courts considering a claim of qualified immunity may \u201cexercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.\u201d <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 236, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009). Thus, we may first decide whether the facts alleged state a violation of a constitutional right or whether the right at issue was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">We begin our analysis with the issue of whether the facts alleged in the amended complaint state a violation of a constitutional right. The plaintiffs allegations against Carini in count three and Castronova in count four are very similar and are, for the purposes of the following analysis, functionally identical. In count three, the plaintiff alleged that Carini received notice of Bubar\u2019s alleged defamatory statement made during the August 10,2000 meeting on that same date. In count four, the plaintiff alleged that Bubar prepared and delivered the August 8, 2000 memorandum that contained the defamatory statements to Castronova on that date. The plaintiff alleged that Bubar\u2019s accusations against her in the meeting and the memorandum constituted reports of violence in the workplace, and, therefore, Carini and Castronova were required by the executive order to \u201cinitiate and conduct an investigation into the reported violence pursuant to\u201d administrative directives, department of correction policies and the executive order.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>In count three, the plaintiff further alleged that Carini\u2019s failure to conduct the investigation, \u201cwhich would have refuted . . . Bubar\u2019s allegations and cleared the plaintiffs name,\u201d left the \u201callegations unrefuted, created a false appearance that the plaintiff was guilty of . . . Bubar\u2019s allegations against her [and] resulted in employment actions that were adverse to the plaintiff,\u201d including, inter alia, being reassigned to lesser positions, being denied opportunities for training, promotion and transfer, receiving lower employee evaluation marks and being assigned to \u201cenvironments which were known to contain hazards and which were harmful to her . . . .\u201d In count four, the plaintiff alleged that \u201c[o]n or about January 9, 2001, in an effort to clear her name and prevent further adverse employment actions against her, the plaintiff . . . submitted a written incident report to . . . Castronova and requested that an investigation be initiated and conducted into the false allegations which had been brought against her by . . . Bubar on August 8 and 10, 2000,\u201d but Castronova failed to do so, resulting in the adverse employment actions listed in count three.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">In both counts three and four, the plaintiff alleged that reports of workplace violence within the department of correction involving employees other than the plaintiff are \u201cproperly investigated and acted upon\u201d even though the allegations concerning the plaintiff were not. Counts three and four both alleged that the plaintiff has \u201cconstitutionally protected significant property interests in her reputation, employment and promotions that would affect her benefits and pension.\u201d Count three alleged that Carini\u2019s \u201cfailure, refusal and neglect to investigate and act upon the reported assault was an abuse of his authority, and constituted a deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs rights to equal protection and due process guaranteed to her by the [fourteenth] [a]mendment to the United States [constitution and protected by 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d Count four alleged that Castronova\u2019s \u201cfailure to investigate constituted a deliberate indifference and/or denial of the plaintiffs rights to the equal protection and due process of law guaranteed to her by the [fourteenth] [a]mendment to the United States [c]onstitution and protected by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In sum, the plaintiff essentially alleged that an investigation into Bubar\u2019s accusations against her would have cleared her name and that Carini\u2019s and Castronova\u2019s failure to conduct such an investigation, as required by the executive order and as is normally conducted regarding other similarly situated employees, resulted in damage to her reputation, which, in turn, resulted in adverse employment actions being taken against her. The plaintiff alleged that the failures to conduct investigations constituted violations of her equal protection and due process rights. To determine whether Carini and Castronova are entitled to qualified immunity, we must determine whether the facts alleged do in fact state clear and cognizable violations of the rights to due process and to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We turn first to the question of whether the facts presented make out a due process violation. \u201cThe procedural component of the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause does not protect everything that might be described as a benefit: To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire and more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. . . . Such entitlements are, of course, . . . not created by the [constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Town of Castle Rock </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>545 U.S. 748, 756, 125 S. Ct. 2796, 162 L. Ed. 2d 658 (2005). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>issue, therefore, is whether the plaintiff had a constitutionally cognizable property interest in an investigation being conducted into the allegations against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">In <em>Town of Castle Rock, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered the issue of whether an individual who has obtained a restraining order has a constitutionally protected interest in its enforcement by police. In its analysis of the issue, the court concluded that the relevant language of the state statute that set forth the duties of the police with regard to restraining orders did not make the enforcement of the orders mandatory. Id., 759-60. The court further stated that \u201c[e]ven if the statute could be said to have made enforcement of restraining orders \u2018mandatory\u2019 . . . that would not necessarily mean that state law gave ... an entitlement to enforcement of the mandate.\u201d Id., 764-65. This is because \u201c[m]aking the actions of government employees obligatory can serve various legitimate ends other than the conferral of a benefit on a specific class of people.\u201d Id., 765. The state statute at issue in <em>Town of Castle Rock </em>did not mention an entitlement to enforcement to the protected persons. Id. The court also stated that \u201cit is by no means clear that an individual entitlement to enforcement of a restraining order,\u201d were one to exist, \u201ccould constitute a \u2018property\u2019 interest for purposes of the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause\u201d because \u201c[s]uch a right would not . . . resemble any traditional conception of property.\u201d Id., 766. On the basis of these conclusions, the court held that \u201cthe benefit that a third party may receive from having someone else arrested for a crime generally does not trigger protections under the [d]ue [p]rocess [cjlause, neither in its procedural nor in its \u2018substantive\u2019 manifestations.\u201d Id., 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Town of Castle Rock </em>guides our analysis. Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the executive order made the investigation of complaints of workplace violence by supervisors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>such as Carini and Castronova mandatory, we are not to conclude that the executive order granted to an accused employee, for the purpose of constitutional analysis, an entitlement to an investigation, or that such an entitlement, were it to exist, constituted a \u201cproperty\u201d interest for purposes of the due process clause. See id., 764-66. The executive order does not mention any entitlement to an individual, such as the plaintiff, who is accused of an act of workplace violence, to an investigation to clear her name. It prohibits acts of workplace violence, directs individuals who believe they have been victims of workplace violence or a threat of violence to report them and directs supervisors to initiate investigations of the complaints. It does not directly speak of individuals who are accused of acts of workplace violence, let alone grant them an entitlement to an investigation to clear their name. We certainly cannot draw something as significant as a constitutional right from such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Moreover, we do not find a property interest in an entitlement to an investigation, were such an entitlement to exist, because an entitlement to process cannot constitute a property interest within the meaning of the due process clause. In <em>Town of Castle Rock </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>supra, 545 U.S. 748, the dissent argued that the state statute governing police officers\u2019 responsibilities with regard to restraining orders made mandatory the obligation either to make an arrest or to seek an arrest warrant. Id., 785 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The majority responded to this argument by stating that \u201cthe seeking of an arrest warrant would be an entitlement to nothing but procedure\u2014which we have held inadequate even to support standing . . . much less can it be the basis for a property interest.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 764. In his concurrence, Justice Souter expanded upon this point. He stated: \u201cThe [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause extends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>procedural protection to guard against unfair deprivation by state officials of substantive state-law property rights or entitlements; the federal process protects the property created by state law. But [the respondent] claims a property interest in a state-mandated process in and of itself. This argument is at odds with the rule that [p]rocess is not an end in itself. Its constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement. ... In putting to rest the notion that the scope of an otherwise discernible property interest could be limited by related state-law procedures, this [c]ourt observed that [t]he categories of substance and procedure are distinct. . . . Property cannot be defined by the procedures provided for its deprivation. . . . Just as a [s]tate cannot diminish a property right, once conferred, by attaching less than generous procedure to its deprivation . . . neither does a [s]tate create a property right merely by ordaining beneficial procedure unconnected to some articulable substantive guarantee.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 771 (Souter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In the present case, the plaintiffs claim that Carini\u2019s and Castronova\u2019s failure to conduct an investigation constituted a deprivation of her due process rights is necessarily premised on her having a property right to an investigation into the allegations made against her. To assert a right to an investigation is to assert a right to process, as in <em>Town of Castle Rock. </em>See id., 764. The plaintiff does not have a property right to such an investigation, according to the <em>Town of Castle Rock </em>majority, because an investigation is process. We conclude that the facts alleged do not state a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We turn next to the issue of whether the facts alleged state an equal protection violation. Counts three and four allege equal protection violations by Carini and Castronova for their failure to conduct an investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>into the allegations of workplace violence against the plaintiff when allegations against other similarly situated employees were investigated. The plaintiff does not assert that her different treatment was caused by her membership in a particular class. As such, the plaintiffs equal protection claim may be considered a \u201cclass-of-one\u201d claim. See <em>Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, </em>553 U.S. 591, 594, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975 (2008) (describing \u201cclass-of-one\u201d theory of equal protection as claim by public employee alleging arbitrarily different treatment from other similarly situated employees with no assertion that different treatment was based on employee\u2019s membership in particular class).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In <em>Engquist, </em>the United States Supreme Court similarly considered a \u201cclass-of-one\u201d claim. Id. The petitioner in that case was a public employee who claimed that \u201cshe was fired not because she was a member of an identified class (unlike her race, sex, and national origin claims), but simply for \u2018arbitrary, vindictive, and malicious reasons.\u2019 \u201d Id., 595. She argued that the equal protection clause \u201cforbids public employers from irrationally treating one employee differently from others similarly situated, regardless of whether the different treatment is based on the employee\u2019s membership in a particular class.\u201d Id., 597. The court rejected this argument and held that the class-of-one theory of equal protection does not apply in the public employment context. It concluded that \u201cratifying a class-of-one theory of equal protection in the context of public employment would impermissibly constitutionalize the employee grievance. . . . The federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decisions that are made daily by public agencies. . . . Public employees typically have a variety of protections from just the sort of personnel actions about which [the petitioner] complains, but the [e]qual [protection [c]lause is not one of them. (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Like the petitioner\u2019s claim discussed by the court in Engquist, the plaintiffs equal protection claim in the present case is premised on the class-of-one theory because it is based not on membership in a particular class but, rather, on her allegedly receiving arbitrarily different treatment from similarly situated individuals. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Engquist, </em>we conclude that the facts alleged do not state an equal protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Because there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether a constitutionally protected property interest or a constitutionally cognizable equal protection right has been clearly violated, we conclude that Carini and Castronova are entitled to qualified immunity. We note that the absence of relief in the form of damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 does not mean that aperson in the plaintiffs position is without remedy. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that constitutional remedies are simply not substitutes for traditional state court remedies. See, e.g., <em>Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, </em>supra, 553 U.S. 591; <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 75 L. Ed. 2d 708 (1983); <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 96 S. Ct. 2074, 48 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to all counts of the plaintiffs amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\"> The standard of review applies to parts II and III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\"> On December 18, 2008, we notified the parties via letter to be prepared to address at oral argument \u201cany questions that the court may have as to whether the portions of the defendants\u2019 appeal that do not pertain to the doctrine of absolute immunity should be dismissed for lack of a final judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> The defendants also claim that the plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claims were not viable because the plaintiffs equal protection and due process rights were not violated.
