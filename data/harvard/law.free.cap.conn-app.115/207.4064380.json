We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. The defendant was charged in the first count of a two count substitute information with intentional assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and in the second count with reckless assault in the first degree in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). The case was tried to the court over three days in September, 2006. On September 11, 2006, the final day of trial, the defendant requested that the court consider the lesser included offense of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3). The state consequently requested that the court consider the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">On September 12, 2006, the court issued a memorandum of decision with the following findings of fact. On July 28, 2005, the defendant resided at 73 Whitney Avenue, New Haven, apartment 10. Also residing at that address were William Blakeslee and Robert Esposito. The three men shared the rent. The handle of the door to their apartment was broken, and the men often needed to use a knife to manipulate the mechanism to open the door from the inside. All three men were present in the apartment on July 28, 2005. During the course of the evening, an argument developed between the defendant and Blakeslee, the victim, concerning the victim\u2019s payment of rent to the defendant. Dining the argument, the defendant was holding the knife, intending to use it to open the apartment door. The argument intensified to the point that the victim struck the defendant twice. During the course of the argument, the defendant \u201cwielded the knife in such a manner that he stabbed [the victim] in the area of the right side of [his] heart, causing a piercing wound three to five inches deep . . . .\u201d The wound was life threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The court found that the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the intent to cause serious physical injury to the victim by means of a dangerous instrument, as alleged in the first count of the information, and rendered judgment of acquittal. The state did, however, prove beyond a reasonable doubt the charge of reckless assault in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), as alleged in the second count of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">As to the second count, the court found the following facts. There is no question that the victim suffered a serious physical injury. There is no question that the injury was suffered at the hands of the defendant. The evidence discloses that the victim was stabbed in the right side of his heart, so that the defendant must have been holding the knife pointed toward the victim and at the victim\u2019s chest. The defendant is shorter than the victim, which means that the defendant was holding the knife higher than his own chest level. The defendant also held the knife with a degree of firmness that caused it to pierce three to five inches into the victim\u2019s chest, nearly the length of the blade. The court concluded that the defendant, under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, recklessly engaged in conduct that created a risk of death to the victim and thereby caused serious physical injury to him. Accordingly, the court found the defendant guilty of reckless assault in the first degree. The court also granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to count one of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">On October <em>4, </em>2006, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the second count, claiming insufficient evidence and requesting that the court vacate its finding of guilt on the charge of reckless assault in the first degree and render judgment as to any lesser included offense that was supported by the evidence. On November 28, 2006, the court rendered judgment of acquittal as to the second count of the information because it found insufficient evidence that the circumstances evinced an extreme indifference to human life and instead found the defendant guilty of reckless assault in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3), a lesser included offense of the first count of intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>assault in the first degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1). The defendant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">First, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient for his conviction of reckless assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims that the court improperly found that he acted recklessly in causing the victim\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Detective Mark Harkins of the New Haven police department testified that he responded to the defendant\u2019s apartment on July 28, 2005, to document the scene and to identify and to collect evidence. Harkins stated that he observed what appeared to be blood in the area of the doorway leading toward the couch along the wall. Harkins also testified that he observed apparent blood on the couch itself, on the rug in front of the couch and on a wool blanket next to the couch. Harkins testified that the largest concentrations of apparent blood in the apartment were along the door, along the front of the couch and on the blanket on the couch. In addition, Harkins testified that he discovered a knife approximately midway underneath the couch and that the knife had what appeared to be blood on the blade. Harkins also stated that he observed that the inside of the door leading out of the apartment was missing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>doorknob and that he discovered a doorknob on the floor of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Officer Jason Minardi of the New Haven police department testified that when he arrived at the defendant\u2019s apartment on July 28, 2005, the defendant kept saying: \u201cI did it. I did it, but it wasn\u2019t on purpose.\u201d Minardi also testified that after he secured the scene, he heard the defendant say that the defendant had used a knife to open the door and that when the defendant turned, the victim lunged at him and the defendant stabbed the victim. Minardi further testified that the defendant told police officers that the knife was in the room but that the defendant did not know the exact location.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Detective Donald Harrison testified that he interviewed the defendant at the New Haven police department following the incident. Harrison testified that the defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and gave a statement, recorded on an audiotape, concerning the stabbing of the victim. Harrison testified that the defendant appeared nervous but that \u201ceverybody normally that comes up [to be interviewed] is nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The defendant made his statement concerning his altercation with the victim between 9:20 and 9:32 p.m. on July 28,2005. The defendant\u2019s statement was entered into evidence. In his statement, the defendant admitted that he had ingested a \u201cbag\u201d of heroin at 2 p.m. that day but that he understood everything that was happening and that his mind was clear.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant stated that he rented apartment 10 at 73 Whitney Avenue in New Haven and that the victim and Esposito also lived in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>In his statement, the defendant first recounted the following story. On July 28, 2005, he was standing at the door of his apartment with the knife in his hand, trying to unlock the door from the inside with the knife. The defendant turned to the victim and said, \u201clet me have your key.\u201d The victim was reluctant to turn over the key, and the defendant turned toward the victim. The victim lunged toward the defendant, then retreated. The defendant and the victim continued talking, until \u201call of a sudden [the victim] noticed the blood, [the defendant] noticed the blood and [the victim] said to [the defendant], \u2018call an ambulance.\u2019 \u201d The victim became faint and the defendant helped him lie down on the floor. The victim called out to Esposito for something to help stop the bleeding. The defendant applied a towel to the victim\u2019s knife wound and applied pressure while talking to the victim and reassuring him that an ambulance was on the way. The defendant stated that when the victim lunged at him, the knife entered the victim\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Upon further questioning, the defendant stated that when he arrived home at approximately 7 p.m., he had an argument with the victim. The defendant was attempting to collect money for rent, and the victim said that he was \u201cdoing [his] best\u201d to pay the rent. The argument lasted for less than one minute. After \u201cten minutes, maybe,\u201d the defendant used a knife to try to open the door to leave<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the doorknob was broken and sometimes a knife<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was needed to release the lock mechanism from the inside. After the defendant had opened the door, he was standing there holding the knife and the victim lunged at him. The defendant stated that he \u201cflinched and that\u2019s when it happened, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>that\u2019s when it happened.\u201d The defendant stated again that neither he nor the victim realized that the victim had been stabbed until minutes later when the victim noticed that he was bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">After additional questioning, the defendant stated that he was holding the knife \u201clike a drumstick\u201d* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> up by his chest. The defendant stated that he moved back because the victim lunged and that\u2019s when \u201cthe knife\u2014 you know was\u2014he got stabbed.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He repeated that they did not know that the victim was stabbed but that the defendant then dropped his hand because he \u201cthought [the victim] was, you know, going to hit [the defendant] and when [the victim] didn\u2019t, [the defendant] just relaxed then . . . .\u201d The defendant stated that he was going to leave through the door, but then the victim noticed that he was bleeding. The defendant again stated that he had Esposito hand him a towel and that he put pressure on the victim\u2019s chest and told the victim to relax and that an ambulance was on the way. The defendant also stated that the victim did not have any weapons on his person and that he did not mean to stab the victim, he was very sorry that it happened and that it was \u201ctotally an accident.\u201d Finally, the defendant stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t even feel anything, you know, I didn\u2019t feel him, you know, on\u2014on the knife or any\u2014I didn\u2019t feel no pressure, anything you know what I mean.\u201d The defendant admitted, however, that he was the only one holding the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Peter Barrett, a physician and an assistant professor of surgery and the director of the adult cardiothoracic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>intensive care unit of Yale University School of Medicine and Yale-New Haven Hospital, testified that he treated the victim on July 28, 2005. On that date, the trauma service requested that Barrett assist in the victim\u2019s care. Barrett testified that the victim had suffered a laceration to his heart\u2019s right ventricle that was bleeding profusely and that the trauma service was having difficulty controlling the bleeding. Barrett testified that the puncture wound actually penetrated the thin wall of the right ventricle but did not appear to cause any damage to the internal structures of the heart. Additionally, Barrett testified that the medical team had to close the gap in the heart and perform multiple transfusions, both during and after the operation. Barrett testified that the knife had to enter into the victim\u2019s chest \u201con the order of three to four, maybe five inches\u201d in order to penetrate the ventricle wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The victim testified that as of July 28, 2005, he had been sharing the apartment with the defendant for approximately two months.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The victim testified that the defendant slept in a bed, the victim slept on a couch he owned, and Esposito slept on the floor on some blankets and sleeping bags. The victim testified that he was approximately six feet tall and that the defendant was approximately five inches shorter. He also testified that the doorknob used to leave the apartment was loose, so that it would occasionally come off and the men would have to use a \u201cfilet knife\u201d to release the mechanism. To do so, the men had to crouch down to the mechanism, which was approximately waist high, look into the mechanism <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and guide the knife to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>right spot. The whole process usually took between fifteen and forty-five seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The victim testified that he did not remember all of the events of July 28, 2005, because of his heart injury and the resulting coma, which he was in for eight to ten days after the injury. The victim testified that he and Esposito entered the apartment together and that he was preparing to go to sleep but that the defendant was asking both men for money for rent. The victim further testified that neither he nor Esposito would give the defendant money. The victim testified that he thought he had paid his share of the rent and that the defendant was asking him for money that he did not owe. The victim also testified that the defendant had to use heroin daily or he would be sick.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Furthermore, the victim testified that the defendant badgered him for more money, becoming increasingly loud as the argument continued. The victim testified that he was concerned that if the police were called by neighbors, he would be arrested, along with the defendant and Esposito, because of the drug paraphernalia in plain sight in the apartment. The victim testified that the defendant was getting louder, he moved within one foot of the victim and was yelling that he would search the victim\u2019s pockets for money and keep anything that he found because the victim owed him money. The victim testified that he tried to calm the defendant by talking to him. The victim also admitted that after approximately five to ten minutes of the defendant\u2019s yelling, the victim slapped the defendant\u2019s head with an open palm. The victim testified that the defendant fell but stood back up and continued screaming and yelling and that the victim slapped the defendant\u2019s head again with his hand.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The victim testified that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>dant became even more upset, yelling that \u201che couldn\u2019t believe I hit him, nobody hits me, nobody hits me and gets away with it. You are going to learn the hard way, nobody can hit me, nobody can get away with it. Who do you think you are?\u201d The victim added that the defendant was \u201c[b]asically just threatening [him], threatening, threatening, threatening. At [that] point, he was just threatening over and over and over again.\u201d The victim further testified that he went to lie down on his couch to attempt to get some sleep, while the defendant continued to yell threats at him. Finally, the victim testified that the last thing he remembered was thinking, \u201cwhat are you going to do, keep me awake all night?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The defendant essentially asks us to retry the evidence before the court. We cannot do so. The standard of review employed in a claim of insufficient evidence is well settled. \u201c[W]e apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the [evidence] so construed . . . the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u201c[T]he inquiry into whether the record evidence would support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not require [an appellate] court to ask itself whether it believes that the evidence . . . established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barretta, </em>82 Conn. App. 684, 687-88, 846 A.2d 946, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 905, 853 A.2d 522 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">We note that \u201cthe [finder of fact] must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. ... If it is reasonable and logical for the [fact finder] to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the [fact finder] is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u201cMoreover, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. . . . It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. ... In evaluating evidence, the [finder] of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The [finder of fact] may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u201cFinally, [a]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [finder of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal. . . . On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [finder of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>104 Conn. App. 599,611-12,935 A.2d 212 (2007), cert. denied, 286 Conn. 901, 943 A.2d 1103, cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>555 U.S. 851, 129 S. Ct. 109, 172 L. Ed. 2d 87 (2008), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 542-43, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Our analysis begins with the statute. To prove reckless assault in the second degree, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201crecklessly cause[d] serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3). \u201cA person acts \u2018recklessly\u2019 with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregarding it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). \u201cThus, the [fact finder] [has] to consider objectively the nature and degree of the risk and the [defendant\u2019s] subjective awareness of that risk. Subjective realization of a risk may be inferred from a person\u2019s words and conduct when viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jeremy M., </em>100 Conn. App. 436, 448, 918 A.2d 944, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 927, 926 A.2d 666 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u201cRecklessness involves a subjective realization of that risk and a conscious decision to ignore it. . . . It does not involve intentional conduct because one who acts recklessly does not have a conscious objective to cause a particular result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>289 Conn. 742, 756, 961 A.2d 322 (2008). \u201cRecognizing the difficulty in proving by direct evidence that an accused subjectively realized and chose to ignore a substantial risk . . . [our Supreme Court has] long held that the state of mind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>amounting to recklessness . . . may be inferred from conduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. McMahon, </em>257 Conn. 544, 568-69, 778 A.2d 847 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1130, 122 S. Ct. 1069, 151 L. Ed. 2d 972 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence against him is limited to the proof of his mental state, i.e., whether he acted recklessly. Considering all of the evidence admitted and the reasonable inferences that could be drawn therefrom, there was sufficient evidence that the defendant acted recklessly in causing the victim\u2019s injuries. There was evidence that the defendant firmly held a knife that was pointed toward the victim and level with the victim\u2019s heart as they engaged in a verbal and physical argument. Although the defendant argues that there is no direct evidence to that effect because he denied holding the knife like that <em>during the argument, </em>the court was free to credit (1) the victim\u2019s testimony about an ongoing physical and verbal confrontation, including the defendant\u2019s continuing threats of violence, (2) Barrett\u2019s testimony about the placement and severity of the injury, including his testimony that the knife entered the victim\u2019s chest between three and five inches deep, piercing the victim\u2019s heart, (3) the defendant\u2019s admissions about how he was holding the knife when it entered the victim\u2019s body, (4) the defendant\u2019s admission that he was holding the knife as the victim moved toward him and that at that time, he \u201cthought [the victim] was, you know, going to hit [the defendant],\u201d and (5) the defendant\u2019s admission that when the victim moved toward him, the defendant \u201cflinched and that\u2019s when it happened, that\u2019s when it happened.\u201d The court, as the trier of fact and sole arbiter of credibility, had the responsibility of reconciling the conflicting evidence and reasonably could infer that the defendant held the knife in such a manner during the altercation despite his realization of the risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>that it entailed and that the defendant made a conscious decision to ignore that risk. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 289 Conn. 756. Despite the defendant\u2019s presentation of evidence that could support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, we cannot conclude that no reasonable view of the evidence exists that supports the court\u2019s findings. Accordingly, in the present case, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the court\u2019s finding of guilt, we conclude that the court properly found the defendant guilty of reckless assault in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The defendant also claims that his conviction on the charge of reckless assault in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3), following his acquittal on the charge of intentional assault in the first degree \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), violated his right against double jeopardy under the fifth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On October 4, 2006, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> on the second count on the ground of insufficient evidence and requested that the court \u201cvacate its finding of guilt on the assault first charge and . . . enter any new judgment as to any lesser included offense that is supported by the evidence.\u201d On October 31, 2006, the court heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>argument on the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence that he evinced an extreme indifference to human life. Additionally, the defendant argued that although \u201cthere [was] probably enough evidence to find that [the defendant] in fact may have acted recklessly . . . [i]t was more negligence than reckless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Following argument, the court stated: \u201cCounsel, I have to tell you that I\u2019ve been troubled by this case since I decided it. . . . [A]nd what is troubling me the most is ... I came to the conclusion that there was an altercation between these two individuals, and during the course of that altercation, [the victim] suffered this stab wound. What I don\u2019t know . . . was what were the mechanisms of this injury. . . . What were these two people doing with respect to each other that resulted in that knife finding its way into [the victim\u2019s] body? There was no evidence of that. I feel comfortable with the finding that there was recklessness involved. I do not feel comfortable with my finding that [the defendant] exhibited extreme indifference to human life because I just don\u2019t know the mechanisms of what happened; there was [a] dearth of evidence in that regard. . . . So, at this point, I think that I have come to the conclusion, after giving this much thought, that there was not enough evidence that there was extreme indifference to human life.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The court then inquired as to the appropriate lesser included offenses. The court asked the parties whether reckless assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) is a lesser included offense of reckless assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). The state responded that it might not be a lesser included offense because \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) requires the use of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument. The state suggested, however, that in the original information, the defendant also was charged with \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), of which \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) is a lesser included offense. Defense counsel argued that \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) was not a lesser included offense of either \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) or (3) but that she believed that \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) was a lesser included offense of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). The court reminded counsel that \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) also requires the use of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument but suggested that reckless assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2) was clearly a lesser included offense of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). At that point, defense counsel requested that the court consider \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2) as a lesser included offense. The court again inquired as to whether \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) could be a lesser included offense of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and asked counsel to prepare a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing on October 31, 2006, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. So, what I have now before me is the defendant agreeing with what I have said as far as lessers included, the state disagreeing, but the defense requesting that the motion for a judgment of acquittal be granted with respect to count two of the information, and that the conviction be entered on count\u2014on the lesser included of assault in the third degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201cThe Court: Which is recklessly causes serious physical injuiy to another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Well, I\u2019m not quite sure that is what happened here. Counsel in her motion said that she requested the court to vacate its finding of guilty of assault in the first degree and enter any new judgment that is supported by the evidence, however that plays out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m just stating what the defendant is requesting at this point. Because, clearly, if assault in the second degree [\u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3)] is a lesser, given what I have just said, as far as what I find proven and what I find not proven, that would be the appropriate lesser included charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">\u201cThe Court: But if it\u2019s not a lesser included, then the appropriate lesser included would be assault in the third degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">\u201cThe Court: So, we have to answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-14\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Defense counsel raised no objection to the court\u2019s inquiry or its characterization of her argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">On November 28, 2006, the court again heard argument on the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. The state argued that \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) is a lesser included offense of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), the first count of the information. The state did not request consideration of any lesser included offense with respect to the second count of the information. The defendant argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) is a lesser included offense of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) but that \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) would be more appropriate given the facts of the case. <em>The defendant requested that the court consider \u00a7 53a-61 </em>(a) (3) as a <em>lesser included offense under the first count. </em>Additionally, defense counsel stated that she was not requesting any lesser included offenses under the second count.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The court rendered judgment of acquittal as to the second count of the information because of insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>evidence. The court also found the defendant guilty of reckless assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3), a lesser included offense of the first count of intentional assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The defendant timely appealed, raising only the issue of insufficient evidence considered in part I. Following oral argument, the court ordered the parties to file simultaneous supplemental briefs addressing the following questions: \u201c(1) When a defendant is acquitted on a particular count, can the trial court open the judgment of acquittal and find the defendant guilty of a lesser offense included within that charge? (2) Is the answer to the previous question the same if the defendant acquiesces to this procedure?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The double jeopardy clause embodies two related protections. It serves as protection \u201cagainst \u2018being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense,\u2019 <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187, 78 S. Ct. 221, 223, 2 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1957), and protection \u2018against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 342-43, 95 S. Ct. 1013, 1021, 43 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1975) (quoting <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 [1969]); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 128-29, 101 S. Ct. 426, 432-33, 66 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1980).\u201d <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>698 F.2d 589, 591 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 835, 104 S. Ct. 120, 78 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">First, we consider whether the court\u2019s actions in this case violated the defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy. Under the circumstances of this case, we must ask whether a court may properly render a judgment of guilty as to assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3), a lesser included offense of assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), after granting a defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) in conjunction with a finding of guilt as to the alternative charge of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">First, we note that the court\u2019s characterization of its disposition of the first count as an acquittal is not dispositive. An appellate court \u201cmust make its own inquiry into the trial court\u2019s disposition to determine, for double jeopardy purposes, whether the court \u2018acquitted\u2019 the defendant . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Paolella, </em>210 Conn. 110, 122, 554 A.2d 702 (1989), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 96, 98 S. Ct. 2187, 57 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1978). Accordingly, we must look to the context in which the motion for a judgment of acquittal was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We find instructive the section of the rules of practice concerning general principles of motions for a judgment of acquittal. Practice Book \u00a7 42-40 provides in relevant part: \u201cAfter the close of the prosecution\u2019s case in chief or at the close of all the evidence, upon motion of the defendant or upon its own motion, the judicial authority shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal as to any principal offense charged and as to any lesser included offense for which the evidence would not reasonably permit a finding of guilty. <em>Such judgment of acquittal shall not apply to any lesser included offense for which the evidence would reasonably permit a finding of </em>guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We also find the \u201cacquittal first\u201d rule helpful to our analysis. Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[o]nly after it has confronted and unanimously completed the difficult task of deciding the guilt or innocence of the accused as to the charged offense should the [fact finder] consider lesser included offenses. Anything less dilutes the right of the state and the defendant to have the [trier of fact] give its undivided attention and most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>serious deliberations to the offense with which the defendant is charged and flies in the face of the unanimity requirement of <em>[State </em>v. <em>Aparo, </em>223 Conn. 384, 614 A.2d 401 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 972, 113 S. Ct. 1414, 1415, 122 L. Ed. 2d 785 (1993)] and <em>[State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 542 A.2d 306 (1988)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 583, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993). Thus, after the court, as the fact finder, found the defendant guilty of the greater offense, it would not have reached the lesser included offenses. In this case, the court acquitted the defendant of the first count of assault in the first degree but found him guilty of the second, <em>alternative, </em>count of assault in the first degree. Accordingly, the court could not have reached the lesser included offenses of either count. We are not certain that under these limited circumstances, the court\u2019s subsequent consideration of the lesser included offenses under either count violates the constitution\u2019s prohibition of double jeopardy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">We need not resolve this question, however, because we conclude that the defendant has not preserved the issue and is not entitled to prevail on review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A. 2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>201 Conn. 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>20, 513 A.2d 660 (1986) (\u201cbasic judicial duty to avoid deciding a constitutional issue if a nonconstitutional ground exists that will dispose of the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">As an initial matter, we note that there are two lines of cases involving principles of double jeopardy and the applicability and availability of <em>Golding </em>review. The first involves double jeopardy claims arising in the course of a single trial and allows for <em>Golding </em>review. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>88 Conn. App. 204, 214-17, 868 A.2d 778, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 933, 873 A.2d 1001 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>32 Conn. App. 224, 235, 630 A.2d 74 (1993), aff'd, 231 Conn. 545,651 A.2d 1264 (1995). The second line of cases involves double jeopardy claims arising out of the trial of a defendant who has a double jeopardy claim that arises from a prior proceeding and generally prevents a determination of an unpreserved claim on the merits. See, e.g., <em>State v.Almeda, </em>211 Conn. 441, 448, 560 A.2d 389 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>208 Conn. 387, 390-92, 544 A.2d 184 (1988); see also <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>237 F.2d 274, 277 (8th Cir. 1956) (\u201c[e]ven if the plea of double jeopardy might have been successfully pleaded in this case it is a personal defense and may be waived by the accused\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We believe that this case is more analogous to the latter and that the defendant forfeited his double jeopardy claim by the failure to timely assert his rights at any time prior to the court\u2019s judgment on November 28, 2006. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>supra, 390 (implied waiver of double jeopardy claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>when defendant \u201cproceeded to trial, verdict and judgment without raising [a double jeopardy] claim\u201d arising from dismissal of unsworn jury and delay of trial [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Even if we assume arguendo that the defendant did not implicitly waive his double jeopardy claim simply by participating in the challenged proceeding and proceeding to appeal without raising a double jeopardy claim, we conclude that he expressly waived it, and, thus, his claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Under <em>Golding, </em>a defendant \u201ccan prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>283 Conn. 352, 358, 927 A.2d 825 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The defendant has met the first two prongs of <em>Golding-, </em>he has provided complete transcripts of the trial proceedings and has claimed a violation of his right against double jeopardy. His claim, however, fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because he waived his right against double jeopardy so that no violation of his constitutional rights clearly exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u201cThe most basic rights of criminal defendants are . . . subject to waiver. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>[470 U.S. 522, 528-29, 105 S. Ct. 1482, 84 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1985)] (absence of objection constitutes waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>of right to be present at all stages of criminal trial); <em>Levine </em>v. <em>United </em>States, [362 U.S. 610, 619, 80 S. Ct. 1038, 4 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1960)] (failure to object to closing of courtroom is waiver of right to public trial); <em>Segurola </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[275 U.S. 106, 111, 48 S. Ct. 77, 72 L. Ed. 186 (1927)] (failure to object constitutes waiver of fourth amendment right against unlawful search and seizure); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>818 F.2d 1020,1025 [1st Cir. 1987] (failure to object results in forfeiture of claim of unlawful postarrest delay); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bascaro, </em>742 F.2d 1335, 1365 [11th Cir. 1984] (absence of objection is waiver of double jeopardy defense), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[472 U.S. 1017, 105 S.

Ct. 171, 78 L. Ed. 2d 154 (1983)]. See generally <em>Yakus </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[321 U.S. 414, 444, 64 S. Ct. 660, 88 L. Ed. 834 (1944)] ([n]o procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 325, 692 A.2d 713 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The defendant maintains that he \u201cremained focused on lesser included offenses of count two, not count one.\u201d In addition, the defendant argues that it was \u201c[o]nly at the last moment [that he withdrew] reckless [assault in the third degree] as a lesser included offense and acquiesce[d] to the court\u2019s finding [him] guilty of second degree reckless assault as a lesser included offense of count one.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendant requests that we exercise our discretion and decline to conclude that the defendant waived his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>During the October 31, 2006 hearing on his postverdict motion for a judgment of acquittal, the defendant expressly requested that the court consider the lesser included offense of reckless assault in the third degree under the first count. The court conducted a detailed discussion of proper lesser included offenses on October 31, 2006, and afforded the parties time to research the issues and return for further proceedings. Subsequently, on November 28, 2006, the defendant agreed that reckless assault in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) was a proper lesser included offense of the first count but requested that the court consider a different lesser included offense under count one, criminally negligent assault in the third degree under \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3). Although he was successful only in having his conviction of assault in the first degree reduced to the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree, we must conclude that to allow the defendant to seek reversal now that his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error and then to ambush the state with that claim on appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 480-81, 915 A.2d 872 (2007). Under these facts, we simply cannot conclude that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> The defendant was charged by substitute information with intentional assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and, in the alternative, reckless assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). Section 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument ... or (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of death to another person, and thereby causes serious physical injury to another person . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The trial court also considered, at various stages of the proceedings, lesser included offenses of assault in the second degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) and assault in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of assault in the second degree when ...

He is entitled to such review because any defendant found guilty on the basis of insufficient evidence has been deprived of a constitutional right and would therefore necessarily meet the four prongs of <em>Golding. </em>See id., 239-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-10\"> The defendant makes several arguments regarding how the court must have drawn certain inferences, the overall deficiencies in the evidence and the speculative nature of inferences that the court <em>may </em>have drawn.

The state need only prove that the defendant <em>recklessly </em>caused serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument. In light of (1) the court\u2019s continued confidence in its finding of recklessness, (2) the defendant\u2019s challenge to only the element of recklessness, (3) our conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s finding of recklessness and (4) the court\u2019s reversal of its earlier finding of extreme indifference to human life, we need not further consider the court\u2019s statement.

Although I don\u2019t think the cases are directly on point with the issue that we have presented, I think the decisions that the court has come down with indicate that this is, in fact, a lesser included offense. I will note, Your Honor, that I also asked at the time of argument that Your Honor consider the negligence section, assault in the third degree, which also would be a lesser offense included within assault in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">\u201cThe Court: Under the first count?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Under the first count, Your Honor, which is what I requested, I believe, during argument at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">\u201cThe Court: But, of course, [counsel], if assault in the second degree under the reckless (a) (3) [subjection is a lesser included on the first count of the information, we wouldn\u2019t get to assault in the third degree, would we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Only if Your Honor found that it wasn\u2019t reckless conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">\u201cThe Court: Only if he was found not guilty of that lesser included?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Not guilty of that, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">\u201cThe Court: And I have already found reckless conduct in the memorandum of decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-16\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-17\">\u201cThe Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-18\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-19\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-20\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: So, I believe the state of the law is correct, as [the prosecutor] stated, that it is, in fact, a lesser of assault in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-21\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Is the defendant requesting any lesser included charges with respect to the second count of the information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-22\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-23\">\u201cThe Court: And to the extent that those have been requested in the past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-24\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: We will be withdrawing that.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b251-5\"> We note that the court\u2019s initial finding of guilt as to count two precluded the court from proceeding to consider the lesser included offenses under both counts. The <em>defendant\u2019s </em>successful motion for a judgment of acquittal as to reckless assault in the first degree assault charged in count two may-have then required the court to proceed to the lesser included offenses of each count as it would have had to do when making its initial determination.
