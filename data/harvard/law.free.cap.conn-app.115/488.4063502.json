Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The plaintiff, Carol B. Dionne,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the defendant, Jason J. Dionne, were married on September 25, 1998, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>and have two children, bom in 1997 and 2002. Following an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, the court rendered judgment of dissolution on March 1,2006. The court incorporated by reference an agreement of the parties that the defendant pay the plaintiff $138 each week as child support and 20 percent of child care costs. On May 9, 2006, the plaintiff filed a motion for contempt, alleging that the defendant had not paid child support or child care expenses, and that he was in arrears in the amount of $552 in child support and $174 in child care expenses. On numerous dates between June 13,2006, and July 17,2007, the defendant appeared in court for review of his compliance with the court orders. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 17,2007, the court found that the defendant owed the plaintiff an arrearage of $90 and set a compliance date of August 14, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">On August 14, 2007, the defendant\u2019s attorney and the pro se plaintiff appeared before the court, <em>Pinkus, J., </em>and represented that the defendant had made all of the payments due on or before August 3, 2007. The defendant\u2019s attorney also represented that the defendant had mailed a money order to the plaintiff on August 13, 2007, for his child support payment due on August 10, 2007. The defendant\u2019s attorney and the plaintiff discussed, on the record, a photocopy of the postal money order and a certified mail receipt received by facsimile by the defendant\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>stated that she had yet to receive the money order, that she received only the payments for the arrearage on August 11, 2007, and that the defendant\u2019s noncompliance with the court-ordered child support payments was an ongoing problem. The plaintiff also stated that the defendant had \u201ctold [the court] many times that he was going to be in compliance, and every time we come he\u2019s not in compliance.\u201d The court suggested that the case be continued to either Monday, August 27, 2007, or Monday, September 24,2007, for compliance because the defendant was scheduled to visit the children on the weekends preceding those dates. The defendant\u2019s attorney objected to any continuance, arguing that the court could not continue the matter because the defendant was in full compliance. The court disagreed, finding that the plaintiff had yet to receive the latest payment, and it continued the matter to September 24, 2007.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>On September 24, 2007, both parties appeared before the court, <em>Prestley, J. </em>The defendant\u2019s attorney again raised the issue of whether the court had jurisdiction to hear the issue of contempt. He argued that the contempt hearing should not have been continued because the defendant \u201c[essentially paid the order in full as of the last court date.\u201d Judge Prestley reviewed the August 14, 2007 transcript and determined that Judge Pinkus had found that the representation that a money order had been mailed was not sufficient to conclude that the defendant was current on his child support.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties stipulated to a new arrearage of $961.20 owed by the defendant, which had accrued between August 14 and September 24, 2007.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found the defendant in contempt of the child support court order, set a purge amount of $500 and stayed the order until 5 p.m. to allow the defendant to avoid incarceration by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>paying the purge amount. The defendant returned to court with only $300 and was ordered incarcerated with an amended purge amount of $200. The defendant paid the $200 later that evening and was released from incarceration. The defendant timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The defendant claims that the court improperly continued the hearing on the motion for contempt when he \u201chad fully complied with the court\u2019s orders to pay child support.\u201d Specifically, the defendant claims that the court (1) \u201cexceeded its authority, and thereby abused its discretion, in continuing the contempt citation and the threat of incarceration thereunder, when the defendant had fully complied with the court\u2019s orders to pay child support\u201d and (2) continued the \u201ccontempt citation and the threat of incarceration thereunder, when the defendant had fully complied with the court\u2019s orders to pay child support [in violation of] his due process rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article [first, \u00a7 9] of the Connecticut constitution because he did not hold the \u2018key to his release\u2019 in that he was prevented from purging himself of a past contempt until he met all future obligations.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">To begin, we briefly address the defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s finding on August 14, 2007, that he was not in compliance with the court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant argues that there was sufficient evidence in the record to make a finding that he was in compliance with the court\u2019s orders. The defendant was seeking to defend the motion for contempt with the representations of counsel. \u201cThis court, as well as our Supreme Court, repeatedly has stated that representations of counsel are not evidence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 404, 631 A.2d 238 (1993), overruled in part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>on other grounds by <em>Label Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Aghamohammadi, </em>270 Conn. 291, 309, 852 A.2d 703 (2004); <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>197 Conn. 141, 154, 496 A.2d 476 (1985); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>95 Conn. App. 826, 832, 898 A.2d 253 (2006); <em>Irizarry </em>v. <em>Irizarry, </em>90 Conn. App. 340, 345, 876 A.2d 593 (2005); <em>Prial </em>v. <em>Prial, </em>67 Conn. App. 7, 14, 787 A.2d 50 (2001); <em>Tevolini </em>v. <em>Tevolini, </em>66 Conn. App. 16, 26, 783 A.2d 1157 (2001); <em>Constantine </em>v. <em>Schneider, </em>49 Conn. App. 378, 397, 715 A.2d 772 (1998); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank, </em>46 Conn. App. 559, 562-63, 699 A.2d 305 (1997).\u201d <em>Aley </em>v. <em>Aley, </em>101 Conn. App. 220, 229, 922 A.2d 184 (2007). In addition, the defendant relied on documents, namely, the facsimile copies of a money order and a certified mail receipt, for which counsel never laid a foundation, never supported with testimony and never asked to have admitted as exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Furthermore, even if we assume that there was evidence <em>sufficient </em>for such a finding, that is not the standard by which we review a court\u2019s refusal to make such a finding. We review the court\u2019s factual findings in the context of a motion for contempt to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous when it is not supported by any evidence in the record or when there is evidence to support it, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Auerbach </em>v. <em>Auerbach, </em>113 Conn. App. 318, 327, 966 A.2d 292, cert. denied, 292 Conn. 901, 971 A.2d 40 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In the present case, we are called on to determine whether the court\u2019s finding that the defendant was not in compliance with the court\u2019s orders was clearly erroneous. The defendant would have us conclude that when there is a prior noncompliance by an obligor with court orders and an obligee asserts that she has not received the payment of child support, a court <em>must </em>dismiss a motion for contempt if counsel for an alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>contemnor presents the court with a photocopy of a money order and a receipt for certified mail addressed to the obligee, and the obligor\u2019s counsel makes the representation that the obligor purchased and mailed the money order to the obligee. We cannot so hold. Therefore, the court\u2019s refusal to credit, as conclusive, the representations of the defendant\u2019s counsel and documents not placed in evidence was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The defendant argues that we should review de novo the court\u2019s decision to continue the plaintiffs motion to September 24, 2007, and thereby maintain jurisdiction. It is well settled that a reviewing court \u201cwill only find error in the grant or denial of a motion for a continuance if a clear abuse of the trial court's discretion is shown. <em>Rusch </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>130 Conn. 26, 32, 31 A.2d 457 (1943); <em>State </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>126 Conn. 257, 260,10 A.2d 758 [1939]; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>81 Conn. 474, 477, 71 A. 367 [1908], <em>State </em>v. <em>Best, </em>171 Conn. 487, 492, 370 A.2d 1035 (1976). Every reasonable presumption in favor of the proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion will be made. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeustiniano, </em>172 Conn. 275, 285, 374 A.2d 209 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 121, 291 A.2d 750 (1971).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ridgeway </em>v. <em>Ridgeway, </em>180 Conn. 533, 538, 429 A.2d 801 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The defendant also argues that this appeal raises an issue of first impression for the appellate courts of this state, namely, whether a court has jurisdiction over a motion for contempt after a once delinquent obligor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>comes into compliance before a hearing. We note, however, that this court addressed a strikingly similar argument in <em>Rocque </em>v. <em>Design Land Developers of Milford, Inc., </em>82 Conn. App. 361,844 A.2d 882 (2004).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>In Rocque, </em>the defendant had argued that \u201cthe court had no jurisdiction to consider the motion [for contempt] because the defendant, at the time [of the hearing], was in compliance. In its memorandum of decision, the [trial] court \u2018emphatically\u2019 disagreed, stating that \u2018[t]he court has continuing jurisdiction to enforce its orders and judgments. When a defendant has violated a court judgment or order, its subsequently coming into compliance before the hearing does not deprive the court of jurisdiction of the matter. Otherwise a defendant could violate a court order or judgment and then comply with it without the court having power to reach him.\u2019 \u201d Id., 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">This court held that the trial court \u201cproperly stated the rule of law in Connecticut. [T]he trial court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction is not separate from, but, rather, <em>derives </em>from, its equitable authority to vindicate judgments. Moreover, we [held] that such equitable authority does not derive from the trial court\u2019s contempt power, but, rather, from its inherent powers. See <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>[191 Conn. 555, 563, 468 A.2d 1230 (1983)] (recognizing trial court\u2019s power to fashion a remedy appropriate to the vindication of a prior consent judgment); <em>Papa </em>v. <em>New Haven Federation of Teachers, </em>186 Conn. 725, 737, 444 A.2d 196 (1982) (recognizing the inherent power of the court to coerce compliance with its orders). Although the trial court found the noncompliant party to be in contempt in both <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Inc., </em>and <em>Papa, </em>nothing in those cases suggests that the court\u2019s authority to fashion a remedy appropriate to the vindication of a prior consent judgment <em>derived </em>from the finding of contempt. <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>supra, 563. Rather, the language in <em>Papa </em>suggests the converse: that the contempt power arises from the court\u2019s inherent power to vindicate prior judgments. See <em>Papa </em>v. <em>New Haven Federation of Teachers, </em>supra, 737 ([t]he penalties which may be imposed [in a contempt proceeding] . . . arise from the inherent power of the court to coerce compliance with its orders). . . . <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>260 Conn. 232, 241, 796 A.2d 1164 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u201cThe interests of orderly government demand that respect and compliance be given to orders issued by courts possessed of jurisdiction of persons and subject matter. One who defies the public authority and willfully refuses his obedience, does so at his peril. <em>United States </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 303, 67 S. Ct. 677, 91 L. Ed. 884 (1947). [A]n order issued by a court with jurisdiction over the subject matter and person must be obeyed by the parties until it is reversed by orderly and proper proceedings. Id., 293; see also <em>W. R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union 759, International Union of United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of America, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S. Ct. 2177, 76 L. Ed. 2d 298 (1983); <em>DeMartino </em>v. <em>Monroe Little League, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 271, 276-77, 471 A.2d 638 (1984).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rocque </em>v. <em>Design Land Developers of Milford, Inc., </em>supra, 82 Conn. App. 365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Moreover, like the defendant in the present case, the defendant in <em>Rocque </em>argued that \u201ccivil contempt is designed to coerce the contemnor to achieve compliance, thus requiring that the contemnor be out of compliance, and to compensate the opposing legal party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>for losses sustained because of such noncompliance. . . . The defendant further argue[d] that if there is no opportunity for the court to coerce the defendant to rectify existing noncompliance because . . . there is compliance, any sanction imposed ceases to be remedial and coercive, but rather becomes wholly punitive, i.e., criminal, in nature. According to the defendant, the court\u2019s purely punitive finding of contempt [was] contrary to law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">This court then looked to our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Jeffrey C., </em>261 Conn. 189, 802 A.2d 772 (2002), for guidance. In that case, our Supreme Court rejected that argument, holding: \u201c[Although it is true that, in civil contempt proceedings, the contemnor must be afforded the opportunity to purge himself of the contempt, this is only a consideration when punishment, such as imprisonment or a noncompensatory fine, has been imposed in accordance with the finding of contempt. ... In <em>[In re Jeffrey C.], </em>the trial court did not impose a noncompensatory fine or other punishment. Rather, the trial court ordered that the respondent father pay attorney\u2019s fees ... to compensate the commissioner [of children and families] for expenses incurred in enforcing compliance with the orders of the trial court. . . . Thus, the fact that the respondent father was not offered the opportunity to purge himself of his contemptuous behavior does not, under the circumstances of this case, in any way undermine the trial court\u2019s finding of contempt.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 198. Accordingly, this court in <em>Rocque </em>held that because \u201cthe parties entered into a judgment that required future action on a defined schedule . . . there existed an actual and ongoing controversy between the parties. The parties\u2019 interests were adverse, and the court was empowered to adjudicate the controversy until there was compliance with the judgment.\u201d <em>Rocque </em>v. <em>Design </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>Land, Developers of Milford, Inc., </em>supra, 82 Conn. App. 368-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In the present case, the court never <em>punished </em>the defendant with imprisonment or noncompensatory fines in accordance with a finding of contempt. In fact, the defendant was not found in contempt on August 14, 2007.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The case simply was continued to another date, September 24, 2007, to ascertain compliance because the court was unable to determine satisfactorily the defendant\u2019s compliance with its orders. Aside from the defendant\u2019s allegation that the court abused its discretion, he has provided no factual support or legal analysis for that position. Upon our review of the record, including the defendant\u2019s numerous failures to pay child support and the court\u2019s proper finding that the defendant had not shown compliance, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion by granting a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">On September 24, 2007, when the defendant was found in contempt, he had failed to pay child support for approximately six weeks and owed the plaintiff $961.20. The court found him in wilful contempt <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of a prior court order. The court, however, stayed the contempt finding until the end of that court day and ordered the defendant incarcerated only if he could not purge the contempt finding by providing a partial payment of $500 to the plaintiff. The court\u2019s orders were <em>coercive </em>and, therefore, were properly imposed in accordance with the finding of civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-12\"> The plaintiff did not file a brief in this court or appear at oral argument, and she failed to comply with our order pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 67-3, requiring her to file a brief by January 28, 2009. We therefore considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>this case on the record, the defendant\u2019s brief and oral argument only. See <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Jodoin, </em>283 Conn. 187, 191 n.4, 925 A.2d 1086 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> During this period, the defendant was found to be in arrears on several occasions, including arrearages of approximately $1312 on July 17, 2006; $1555 on September 18, 2006; $118 on December 8, 2006; $671 on January 20, 2007; $1513 on March 26, 2007; and $260 on June 5, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\"> The defendant\u2019s attorney, however, did not ask the court to admit the documents as evidence and did not provide anything other than his representations as support for his argument that the defendant actually had placed the money order in the mail to the plaintiff.

Accordingly, we cannot say that he was not in violation of a court order even if the money order was in fact in the mail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> As discussed previously in this opinion, the court properly found that the defendant had not satisfactorily shown compliance at the hearing on August 14, 2007. Nevertheless, we find instructive this court\u2019s analysis in <em>Rocque </em>of the continuing jurisdiction of the court over a <em>defendant in full compliance </em>with court orders at the time of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\"> Nothing in this opinion should be construed to hold that the court could not have found the defendant in contempt when the payment due August 10, 2007, had <em>not been </em>received by the plaintiff as of August, 14, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\"> The defendant has not challenged the factual basis of this finding of contempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
