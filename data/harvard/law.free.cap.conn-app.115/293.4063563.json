On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that it was without subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal due to the plaintiffs failure to file his complaint with the Superior Court within thirty days of the mailing of the Probate Court\u2019s memorandum of decision, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">After examining the record on appeal and considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. Because the court\u2019s memorandum of decision resolves properly the issue raised in this appeal, we adopt the court\u2019s concise and well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on the issue. See <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>51 Conn. Sup. 148, 975 A.2d 147 (2008). Any further discussion by this court would serve no useful purpose. See, e.g., <em>Socha </em>v. <em>Bordeau, </em>289 Conn. 358, 362, 956 A.2d 1174 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
