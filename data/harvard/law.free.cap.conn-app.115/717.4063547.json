After a thorough review of the record, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the 1990s, Kriemhilde Byxbee lived in Stamford with her husband. They had no children. During that time, Heidi Hemingway and Beverly Cogswell cleaned Byxbee\u2019s home. In 1997, Hemingway and Cogswell each made approximately $20 every time they cleaned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Byxbee\u2019s home. Before his death in November, 1997, Byxbee\u2019s husband asked Hemingway and Cogswell to take care of his wife after he died. Byxbee was eighty-two years old at the time of her husband\u2019s death. Following the death of Byxbee\u2019s husband, Hemingway\u2019s and Cogswell\u2019s duties changed to include grocery shopping, preparing Byxbee\u2019s meals and doing the laundry. Byxbee, who had suffered a stroke, had difficultly walking and did not drive. As Byxbee\u2019s health declined, she became unable to cook or clean for herself, had difficulty maintaining personal hygiene and appeared to have increased difficulty in understanding what was going on around her. Cogswell began helping Byxbee pay her bills, which Cogswell had noticed were going unpaid. In general, Byxbee was financially conservative. She was sparing with her money, with the exception of the holiday season, when she would give Cogswell and Hemingway $200 each. She became increasingly protective of her money as she got older.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Following a brief hospitalization of Byxbee in 1999, a social worker advised Byxbee to \u201cget her affairs in order.\u201d Byxbee expressed a desire to stay in her home until her death. Although Byxbee initially rejected the idea, Hemingway eventually was able to persuade Byxbee to execute a living will. Hemingway contacted the defendant, an attorney, who previously had represented members of Hemingway\u2019s family. In April, 1999, the defendant met with Byxbee at her home for approximately forty-five minutes and subsequently prepared a living will, which Byxbee signed. This was the only time that the defendant met Byxbee.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">After meeting with Byxbee, the defendant spoke with Hemingway and inquired of Byxbee\u2019s assets. When Hemingway stated that Byxbee owned a number of properties and did not have any children, the defendant advised Hemingway that Byxbee should execute a will so that Hemingway could \u201cget something out of . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Byxbee for . . . services rendered.\u201d The defendant told Hemingway and Cogswell that in the absence of a will, all of Byxbee\u2019s property would go to the state when she died. Hemingway and Cogswell eventually persuaded Byxbee to execute a new will. The defendant then arranged for attorney Kevin O\u2019Grady to come to Byxbee\u2019s home and to draft a new will, which Byxbee executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Hemingway and Cogswell learned that they were the beneficiaries of the new will and were each entitled to half of Byxbee\u2019s estate. The defendant advised Hemingway and Cogswell that Byxbee should begin liquidating her assets to avoid high estate taxes. The defendant explained that gifting the money in $10,000 increments annually would lower the applicable taxes. She instructed Cogswell and Hemingway to have Byxbee write checks to people they could trust for $10,000 each and then have these individuals cash the checks and give the money to Hemingway or Cogswell. Specifically, the defendant told Hemingway, who then told Cogswell, to cover the top portion of the check and to have Byxbee sign it. The defendant also told Hemingway to give Byxbee an alcoholic drink before asking her to sign the blank checks. The defendant instructed Hemingway and Cogswell to tell Byxbee that they needed to finish paying her bills or that they needed money to buy groceries. Hemingway and Cogswell would then fill in the top portion of a check with the name of a family member or a specific person at the direction of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">At the defendant\u2019s instruction, Byxbee\u2019s money market account was closed without Byxbee\u2019s knowledge, and approximately $200,000 was deposited into Byxbee\u2019s checking account. The proceeds were then distributed to Hemingway, Cogswell and the defendant by check. Hemingway and Cogswell hid Byxbee\u2019s monthly bank statements from her. Hemingway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>received approximately $300,000 as a result of the gift-giving plan. Cogswell and Hemingway employed the same method to have Byxbee sign legal documents prepared by the defendant. Specifically, Cogswell would cover up a portion of the document, tell Byxbee that the document related to her late husband\u2019s estate or encourage Byxbee to have a drink before asking her to sign the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The defendant also arranged for Byxbee to purchase a life insurance policy from Mutual of Omaha. Warren Seper, the defendant\u2019s husband, procured the policy for Byxbee. Because Byxbee refused to purchase the policy during her meeting with Seper, the defendant instructed Hemingway to impersonate Byxbee when a representative from the insurance company called Byxbee to ask questions about her health. The defendant instructed Hemingway to tell Byxbee that her physician wanted her to have a physical examination to ensure her compliance with the examination required by the insurance company. The defendant established the Kriemhilde Byxbee life insurance trust (Byxbee trust), with herself as trustee, to receive the proceeds of the $400,000 life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In the last year of her life, Byxbee owned three different houses in the Stamford area. The defendant facilitated the sale of the properties as part of the plan to liquidate Byxbee\u2019s assets to avoid estate taxes. Byxbee purportedly signed an authorization, witnessed by Hemingway and Cogswell, instructing the defendant to prepare a power of attorney for Hemingway to act on Byxbee\u2019s behalf. Hemingway attended the closings, signed various documents related to the sale of the properties and collected the proceeds of the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">After the sale of the first house, Hemingway gave the defendant approximately $60,000 to $70,000 of the proceeds and deposited the remainder into Byxbee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>bank account. Through checks to their family members, Cogswell and Hemingway each received approximately $80,000 from the sale of the first house. The proceeds from the sale of the second house went into the trust account rather than the bank account because that account had been emptied from the numerous checks written as gifts in the preceding months. On September 19,2000, without Byxbee\u2019s knowledge, Hemingway sold the house on Dann Drive in which Byxbee lived before she was moved into a nursing home. Cogswell and Hemingway held a tag sale to sell Byxbee\u2019s furniture and belongings. Byxbee was also unaware that the proceeds from the sale were distributed to the defendant\u2019s family members as well as to Hemingway and Cogswell.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">David Rabin, a physician, saw Byxbee on April 3, 2000, to perform an evaluation of her memory. He diagnosed Byxbee with chronic progressive dementia with significant cognitive impairment. He testified at trial that \u201c[g]iven the degree of her dementia, it was likely that there was some degree of impairment going on back a minimum of three to five years.\u201d He also determined that Byxbee had suffered a small stroke within the previous thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">On July 29, 2000, Byxbee was admitted to Stamford Hospital where she was diagnosed with an infection. She also underwent surgery for the removal of a benign mass the size of a tennis ball in her right breast. Rabin testified that a woman without dementia would have noticed the mass. Byxbee suffered another stroke during her stay at the hospital. Rabin testified that Byxbee was disoriented and would not have been able to comprehend the extent of her assets or to evaluate her future financial needs. Barry Spevak, a geriatric specialist, evaluated Byxbee over several days of her hospitalization and concluded that Byxbee suffered from chronic progressive dementia, could no longer care for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>herself at home and should be moved to a nursing facility for long-term care.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">On August 11, 2000, Byxbee moved into Mediplex, an assisted living facility in Westport. Martin Perlin, who treated Byxbee at Mediplex, testified that Byxbee was disoriented, often fixated on her cats and that her \u201cinformed decision making process was severely impaired because of her underlying illness.\u201d Byxbee died on September 27, 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In October, 2000, the defendant informed Cogswell that on the basis of her ten years of experience with insurance companies, she anticipated that Mutual of Omaha would resist paying out the $400,000 policy on Byxbee\u2019s life. Specifically, the defendant advised Cogs-well that Cogswell and Hemingway were more likely to receive the full amount of the policy if they hired an attorney to deal with the insurance company. Cogswell and Hemingway then agreed that the defendant would represent them and attempt to secure the full payment from the insurance company. Byxbee purportedly had signed an \u201cAuthorization to Act As Counsel\u201d on August 26, 1999. The document authorized the defendant to represent the Byxbee trust \u201c[i]f, for any reason whatsoever, regardless of fault or blame, the insurance company does not send the proceeds to the [Byxbee trust] within [thirty] days after [Byxbee\u2019s] death\u201d and specified that the defendant would receive a 25 percent contingency fee for recovery of the proceeds of the insurance policy. Anna Lucia Hall worked at the defendant\u2019s law film. Although Hall did not meet Byxbee or witness her signature, Hall\u2019s signature appears as that of a witness to Byxbee\u2019s on the authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">On October 10, 2000, Hemingway and Cogswell signed a contract with the defendant, agreeing to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>terms of the defendant\u2019s 1999 contract with Byxbee and agreeing that the defendant would receive 25 percent of the proceeds recovered from the insurance policy. Specifically, the authorization stated: \u201cI authorize [the defendant] to represent the Trust and obtain the policy proceeds, I have read [the defendant\u2019s] 1999 contract with Mrs. Byxbee, I agree to its terms and we agree that [the defendant] will receive 25 [percent] of the proceeds which she recovers ... as a contingency fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In April, 2001, Mutual of Omaha made a $408,372.60 payment on the life insurance policy. The defendant deposited the amount into the Byxbee trust account. Mutual of Omaha also, in response to a request from the defendant\u2019s office, refunded a percentage of the premium paid on the policy, which totaled $47,556.67.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">In April and May, 2001, the defendant wrote three checks from the Byxbee trust as the trustee. The checks were payable to M&amp;T Bank, which held the mortgage on the defendant\u2019s home. The first check, dated April 25, 2001, was $20,000 and represented the legal fees charged by the defendant. The second check, dated April 26, 2001, was for $102,093.15 and represented a 25 percent contingency fee for recovery of the insurance policy proceeds. The third check, dated May 7, 2001, was for $11,889.17 and represented a 25 percent contingency fee for recovery of the insurance policy premium. All of the checks were applied to satisfy the mortgage on the defendant\u2019s home. In April, 2001, Hemingway and Cogswell signed a document authorizing the defendant to make disbursements from the Byxbee trust. The authorization included payment to the defendant of $102,093.15 and $11,889.17 as contingency fees for recovery of the policy proceeds and premium, respectively, and payment of $20,000 for \u201c[e]state [l]egal [f]ees and [t]rust fee retainer.\u201d On May 24, 2001, Hemingway and Cogswell also signed a trust accounting, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>authorized three disbursements to the defendant relating to her representation of the Byxbee trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Subsequently, Hemingway learned from the defendant that the Byxbee trust account had been nearly depleted. In August, 2001, Hemingway and Cogswell hired an attorney, Neal Rogan, to investigate what had happened to the funds in the Byxbee trust account. Rogan discovered that only $39,042.46 remained in the Byxbee trust. Shortly thereafter, Hemingway and Cogs-well commenced litigation against the defendant to recover the funds she had taken from the Byxbee trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">While the civil action was pending, the defendant was arrested in 2004 and charged in a twelve count amended information. After the jury found the defendant guilty of perjury, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, forgery in the second degree, larceny in the second degree and five counts of larceny in the first degree, the court sentenced her to twelve years incarceration, with five years special parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The defendant first claims that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support her conviction on \u201cmany of the charges\u201d against her. We address her claim as to those counts for which she has provided an analysis of the evidence, namely, counts four, five, six, seven, eight, ten and twelve.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree with the defendant as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>counts four, five, eight, ten and twelve; we agree with the defendant as to counts six and seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We begin by setting forth the familiar standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence claim. \u201c[W]e apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . We note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. ... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>283 Conn. 280, 329-30, 929 A.2d 278 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Additionally, as our Supreme Court has often stated, \u201cit does not dimmish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. ... In evaluating evidence, the [finder] of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The [finder of fact] may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>logical.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted). <em>State </em>v. <em>Na\u2019im B., </em>288 Conn. 290, 296, 952 A.2d 755 (2008). \u201cIndeed, direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. . . . Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom. . . . This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . because [our Supreme Court] has held that a jury\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 239-40, 745 A.2d 800 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Finally, we note that \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [finder of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [finder of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Na\u2019im B., </em>supra, 288 Conn. 297. Cognizant of our standard of review, we address the evidence in support of each count in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to sustain her conviction on count four, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, and count five, forgery in the second degree. Both of these counts focus on a March, 2001 letter purportedly from Mutual of Omaha and introduced by the defendant in a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>proceeding. In count four, the state alleged that the defendant committed the crime of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence in violation of \u00a7 53a-155 (a) (2). Specifically, the state alleged that between September 27, 2000, and December 10, 2002, the defendant presented a letter dated March 15, 2001, purportedly from Kathy Douglas of Mutual of Omaha, knowing the document to be false and with the purpose of misleading a public servant, Judge Frank D\u2019Andrea, who was engaged in a hearing on an application for a prejudgment remedy. In count five, the state alleged that the defendant committed the crime of forgery in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-139 (a) (1) when, between September 27, 2000, and December 10, 2002, the defendant, with intent to defraud or to deceive, falsely made a letter dated March 15,2001, purportedly from Douglas, of Mutual of Omaha, which expressed an intention to rescind the life insurance policy on Byxbee.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that to prove that she intended to mislead a public servant in producing the letter under \u00a7 53a-155 (a) (2) and that she intended to defraud or to deceive in forging the letter under \u00a7 53a-139, the state was required to offer evidence explaining to the jury the nature of the proceedings and legal issues before the court at the hearing. The defendant reasons that without this evidence \u201cthe jury had no evidence to connect what it reasonably could have found [the defendant\u2019s] conduct to have been with the intent motivating that conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Section 53a-155 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence if, believing that an official proceeding is pending, or about to be instituted, he . . . (2) makes, presents or uses any record, document or thing knowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>it to be false and with purpose to mislead a public servant who is or may be engaged in such official proceeding.\u201d A person is guilty of forgery in the second degree \u201cwhen, with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another, he falsely makes, completes or alters a written instrument or issues or possesses any written instrument which he knows to be forged, which is or purports to be, or which is calculated to become or represent if completed: (1) A deed, will, codicil, contract, assignment, commercial instrument or other instrument which does or may evidence, create, transfer, terminate or otherwise affect a legal right, interest, obligation or status . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-139 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. After learning that the Byxbee trust nearly had been depleted, Hemingway and Cogswell hired Rogan to initiate a civil action against the defendant to recover the funds that the defendant improperly procured from Byxbee and her estate. In the resulting proceedings, the defendant testified regarding her efforts on behalf of Hemingway and Cogswell to collect the $400,000 insurance policy taken out on Byxbee\u2019s life. On July 15, 2002, the defendant testified that she had not received any written communication from Mutual of Omaha but that she had received verbal communication that Mutual of Omaha was not going to pay the life insurance policy. On September 24, 2002, the defendant testified that she had not received anything on Mutual of Omaha letterhead rescinding the policy. Then, on December 4, 2002, at a hearing in Stamford, the defendant submitted a fabricated letter from Mutual of Omaha. The letter, dated March 15,2001, and purportedly signed by Douglas, read: \u201cDue to the fact that Mrs. Byxbee did not fully disclose various material medical conditions on her insurance application, we will rescind the policy and return the premiums paid. If you have any questions about the policy or the claims process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>please do not hesitate to contact us.\u201d The defendant testified that the document was the original. On December 10, 2002, during a civil proceeding before Judge D Andrea, the defendant testified falsely that her office had received the March 15, 2001 letter. At a subsequent hearing on March 4, 2003, the defendant testified that after her office had received the March 15, 2001 letter, her office received a telephone message from someone at the insurance company saying that the letter was sent prematurely but that the company\u2019s position had not changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">On July 1, 2003, the defendant offered two additional versions of the March 15, 2001 letter, each of which included portions of Companion Life Insurance Company\u2019s<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> address and telephone number as well as portions of a series of numbers. The defendant explained that the difference between the second and third versions of the letter were attributable to the photocopying process. The second and third versions of the letter were substantially different from the first version offered at the December 4, 2002 hearing, which does not contain any information at the bottom of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Douglas did not write the letter, and it does not conform to the format or procedures used by Mutual of Omaha in contacting clients or rescinding policies. Specifically, the letter does not contain a document number or the company name and does not contain a reference to the underwriting or legal department, as required by Mutual of Omaha policy. Investigators were unable to locate a copy of the letter in Mutual of Omaha\u2019s files or computers. None of the correspondence between Mutual of Omaha and the defendant\u2019s office, including correspondence after March 15,2001, refers to the letter or the alleged telephone call from Mutual of Omaha regarding rescission of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>The defendant directs our attention to <em>State </em>v. <em>Widlak, </em>85 Conn. App. 84, 856 A.2d 446 (2004), in support of her proposition that the state was required to explain to the jury the nature of the proceeding and legal issues before Judge D\u2019Andrea so that the jury would have sufficient evidence to return a verdict of guilty on counts four and five. We disagree that <em>Widlak </em>supports the defendant\u2019s position. In <em>Widlak, </em>the defendant had been charged previously with a violation of probation. Id., 86. At the initial hearing on the violation of probation, the state indicated that it would seek an increase in bond unless the defendant could provide a new address. Id. Following that proceeding, the defendant convinced an acquaintance to provide him with a lease to a building that the acquaintance did not yet own. Id. At a later hearing on the violation of probation, the defendant submitted that lease as proof of his new address. Id., 87. When subsequent investigation proved the lease to be fraudulent, the defendant was charged with fabricating physical evidence and forgery. Id., 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">On appeal, this court in <em>Widlak </em>concluded that the state had presented sufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction on both charges. Id., 91-93. Although the court noted that the jury heard evidence regarding the initial probation proceeding and the fact that the state indicated that it would move for an increase in bond if the defendant did not provide the court with a new address, this court did not suggest that the jury must understand the nature of the proceeding in which the defendant submitted the fabricated document to find that the state had proven each element of the alleged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 90-93. Rather, this court, noting that \u201c[o]rdinarily. knowledge and intent can be proven only by circumstantial evidence\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted.) id., 90; concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>that the defendant possessed the lease knowing it to be false and presented it with the purpose of misleading the state. Id., 90-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In the present case, the jury heard evidence that Hemingway and Cogswell had initiated proceedings against the defendant to recover moneys that the defendant had obtained from Byxbee and Byxbee\u2019s estate and that the defendant had testified before Judge D\u2019Andrea during an official proceeding. The jury also heard evidence that the defendant testified initially that she did not receive any written communication from Mutual of Omaha indicating an intent to rescind the policy but later presented the March 15, 2001 letter. The defendant then submitted multiple versions of the March 15, 2001 letter and testified as to why information was missing from the bottom of the version of the letter she submitted originally. The jury also heard testimony from Douglas that she had not written the letter. In sum, the jury had before it more than sufficient evidence that the defendant had fabricated the March 15, 2001 letter and that she had testified falsely regarding the letter during an official proceeding before Judge D\u2019Andrea, a public servant, on December 10, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">\u201cWhile jurors may not speculate to reach a verdict, they may draw reasonable, logical inferences from the facts proven to reach a verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Clay, 51 Conn. App. 694, 698, 724 A.2d 1134, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 901, 734 A.2d 984 (1999). \u201cIntent is a question of fact, the determination of which should stand unless the conclusion drawn by the trier is an unreasonable one.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>110 Conn. App. 70, 79, 954 A.2d 202, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 954, 961 A.2d 422 (2008). As this court has often noted, \u201c[b]ecause direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available . . . intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom. . . . [I]t does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>108 Conn. App. 772, 778, 949 A.2d 544, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 915, 957 A.2d 880 (2008). Thus, as to count four, the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to conclude that the defendant had fabricated the letter and that she had submitted it with the purpose of misleading Judge D\u2019Andrea into believing that the letter was authentic. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-155 (a) (2). Similarly, as to count five, the evidence reasonably permitted a finding that the defendant forged the March 15, 2001 letter \u201cwith intent to defraud [or] deceive . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-139 (a). Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict against the defendant for tampering or fabricating physical evidence and for forgery in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The defendant also argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty as to counts six and seven. In count six, the state alleged that the defendant committed the crime of larceny by false pretenses as defined by \u00a7 53a-119 (2), in violation of \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>alleged that the defendant had wrongfully obtained Byxbee\u2019s property, specifically two lamps and a jewelry box, by false pretenses, namely, that the defendant induced Byxbee to give her the items as gifts. In count seven, the state alleged that the defendant wrongfully obtained checks written from Byxbee\u2019s checking account by false pretenses, as defined by \u00a7 53a-119 (2), in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2) and 53a-121 (b). Specifically, the state alleged that the defendant obtained the checks by false pretenses, namely, that the checks were gifts made pursuant to a plan to minimize Byxbee\u2019s estate taxes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant argues that the state failed to present evidence that she communicated a false pretense to Byxbee that induced her to deliver possession of her property to the defendant. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The state presented the following evidence in support of its allegations in counts six and seven. At some point, Cogswell was added as a signer on Byxbee\u2019s checking account because Byxbee\u2019s handwriting was nearly illegible. Cogswell would use the debit card connected to the checking account to purchase groceries for herself and for Byxbee. In August, 2001, the defendant picked out a jewelry box and two Waterford crystal lamps as purported gifts to her from Byxbee. She instructed Hemingway to have Byxbee sign a check to pay for the jewelry box and instructed Cogswell to pay for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>lamps with the debit card for Byxbee\u2019s checking account. Hemingway later picked up the jewelry box and lamps and delivered them to the defendant\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">As explained previously, the defendant instructed Hemingway and Cogswell to have Byxbee sign blank checks as part of the gift giving plan. In this manner, the defendant or members of her family received checks from Byxbee in the amount of approximately $120,500. Although Hemingway initially wrote the checks out to the defendant\u2019s relatives in the amount of $10,000, two of the checks had been altered such that the amount was $20,000. Hemingway testified that Byxbee did not authorize the gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Section 53a-119 provides in relevant part: \u201cA person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner. ... (2) ... A person obtains property by false pretenses when, by any false token, pretense or device, he obtains from another any property, with intent to defraud him or any other person.\u201d We find <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrah, </em>161 Conn. 43, 282 A.2d 879 (1971), instructive. In <em>Farrah, </em>our Supreme Court applied General Statutes \u00a7 53-360, the predecessor to \u00a7 53a-119 (2), which read, \u201c[a]ny person who, by false token, pretense or device, obtains from another any valuable thing . . . with intent to defraud him or any other person . . . shall be fined . . . or imprisoned.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrah, </em>supra, 46-47. The court thereafter enumerated the elements necessary for a conviction of the crime of larceny by false pretenses: \u201c(1) That a false representation or statement of a past or existing fact was made by the accused; (2) that in making the representation he knew of its falsity; (3) that the accused intended to defraud or deceive; (4) that the party to whom the representation was made was in fact induced thereby to act to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>injury; and (5) that the false representation or statement was the effective cause of the accused receiving something of value without compensation.\u201d Id., 47; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rochette, </em>25 Conn. App. 298, 306, 594 A.2d 1006 (\u201c[t]o be found guilty of this crime, a person, therefore, must knowingly make a false representation with the intent to defraud, and that false representation must induce action that effectively causes the accused to receive something of value without compensation\u201d), cert. denied, 220 Conn. 912, 597 A.2d 337 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1045, 112 S.

Jur. 2d, False Pretenses \u00a7 44 (2007) (\u201c[t]o establish the crime of obtaining money or property by false pretenses, it must be shown that the defrauded party relied upon the misrepresentation made by the defendant\u201d); W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law (2003) \u00a7 19.7, p. 114 (larceny by false pretenses occurs when defendant makes false representation of fact that causes victim to pass title of property to defendant); 3 F. Wharton, Criminal Law (15th Ed. 1995) \u00a7 414, p. 530 (false representation must cause victim to turn over her property).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Although it is conceivable that a defendant may commit larceny by false pretenses through the use of an accomplice or coconspirator; see id., \u00a7 415; in the present case, the jury was not presented with evidence that the defendant made a false representation that caused Byxbee to purchase the jewelry box or the lamps for the defendant. Rather, as to count six, the jury heard evidence that the jewelry box was paid for by a check that Byxbee had signed and Hemingway later filled in. The jury also heard evidence that the lamps were paid for using a debit card connected to Byxbee\u2019s account, to which Cogswell had been added as a signer when Byxbee\u2019s handwriting became difficult to read. The jury did not hear evidence, however, that Byxbee had knowledge of these gifts or that she agreed to purchase the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>gifts on the basis of any representation made by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Similarly, the jury was not presented with evidence that the defendant made a false representation that induced Byxbee to sign the checks comprising the larceny alleged in count seven. Instead, the jury heard evidence that Byxbee had no knowledge that she was signing checks to the defendant or the defendant\u2019s family members. Indeed, the jury was presented with substantial evidence that Byxbee was unaware of the gifting plan supposedly aimed at reducing estate taxes and that Byxbee lacked the capacity to agree to such a plan. Put another way, the jury heard no evidence that the defendant made a false statement that was communicated to Byxbee either by the defendant or a third party that induced Byxbee to relinquish her property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict as to counts six and seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The defendant further claims that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction on count eight. Specifically, she argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of embezzlement, as defined by \u00a7 53a-119 (1). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Count eight of the amended information charged the defendant with larceny in the first degree by embezzlement in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-121 (b) and 53a-122 (a) (2).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state alleged that the defendant had committed the crime of larceny by embezzlement when she wrongfully obtained $30,000 of Byxbee\u2019s assets. Specifically, the state alleged that the defendant issued two checks to herself and Seper from the proceeds of the sale of Byxbee\u2019s house on Dann Drive, which the defendant was holding in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The defendant issued a series of checks from her Interest on Lawyers Trust Account <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (attorney\u2019s account) disbursing the proceeds of the sale of Byxbee\u2019s house on Dann Drive to Hemingway, Cogswell and herself. Directing our attention to Hemingway\u2019s testimony that she did not pick up the checks made out to her and to members of her family until the day of Byxbee\u2019s memorial service, the defendant argues that because the checks were not issued until after Byxbee\u2019s death, Hemingway and Cogswell were, as the beneficiaries of Byxbee\u2019s estate, the owners of the embezzled property. The defendant further argues that the state failed to prove that Hemingway and Cogswell did not consent to the issuance of the two checks made out to the defendant and her husband. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Section 53a-119 (1) provides that a person commits larceny by embezzlement when \u201cwith intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner. ... (1) A person commits embezzlement when he wrongfully appropriates to himself or to another property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>another in his care or custody.\u201d Put another way, \u201c[t]he crime of embezzlement is consummated where . . . the defendant, by virtue of his agency or other confidential relationship, has been entrusted with the property of another and wrongfully converts it to his own use. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizzi, </em>199 Conn. 462, 467, 508 A.2d 16 (1986).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Pezzuti, 70 Conn. App. 840, 847, 800 A.2d 644, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 931, 806 A.2d 1069 (2002); see 29A C.J.S., Embezzlement \u00a7 29 (2007) (\u201c[a]n act of embezzlement is complete the moment the fiduciary converts to his or her own use money belonging to the estate or trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have made the following findings. The proceeds of the sale of Byxbee\u2019s house on Dann Drive were held by the defendant in trust in her attorney\u2019s account. The defendant issued a series of checks from this account, distributing the funds to Hemingway and Cogswell. The defendant also issued two checks, for $15,000 each, to herself and Seper, respectively. The checks were dated September 19, 2000, and signed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The jury heard testimony that at the time of the sale of her house, Byxbee was living at Mediplex and suffering from severe dementia. The defendant introduced into evidence a document, purportedly signed by Byxbee on September 19, 2000, authorizing the distribution of moneys from the sale of her house on Dann Drive. The jury then heard testimony from Cogswell that the signature on the document looked like Byxbee\u2019s but that she did not remember if it was one of the documents she took to Byxbee at Mediplex. The jury also heard evidence that Byxbee was unaware of the sale of the house in which she lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the evidence, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>defendant issued the checks on the day on which the checks were dated, September 19, 2000. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (11) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person \u2018issues\u2019 a check when, as a drawer or representative drawer thereof, he delivers it or causes it to be delivered to a person who thereby acquires a right against the drawer with respect to such check. . . .\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-105 (a) (defining \u201cissue\u201d as \u201cthe first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer, whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person\u201d). The jury also reasonably could have inferred that the defendant delivered to Seper the check written out to him on that same date. Thus, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant and Seper wrongfully acquired a right to Byxbee\u2019s assets on September 19, 2000, prior to Byxbee\u2019s death on September 27, 2000. Moreover, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Byxbee did not authorize the distribution of the funds to the defendant and Seper. Thus, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant, as trustee of the proceeds of the sale of Byxbee\u2019s home, wrongfully appropriated $30,000 to herself and Seper without Byxbee\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies to each and every element comprising the offense charged. But this burden of proof does not operate upon each of the many subsidiary, evidentiary, incidental or subordinate facts . . . upon which the prosecution may collectively rely to establish a particular element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Where the prosecution must rely upon circumstantial evidence, either in part or in whole, each link in the chain of circumstantial evidence need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>111 Conn. App. 575, 586 n.5, 960 A.2d 573 (2008), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>denied, 290 Conn. 907,964 A.2d 543 (2009). Accordingly, the evidence reasonably permitted a finding that the defendant embezzled the funds prior to Byxbee\u2019s death and without her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The defendant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to her conviction on counts ten and twelve alleging larceny in the first degree by embezzlement, as defined by \u00a7 53a-119 (1), in violation of \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In count ten, the state alleged that the defendant wrongfully appropriated $11,899.17 from the Byxbee trust by embezzlement. Similarly, in count twelve, the state alleged that the defendant wrongfully appropriated $20,000 from the Byxbee trust by embezzlement. The defendant argues that the state failed to prove that the defendant lacked consent to withdraw the funds from the Byxbee trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">As explained in part C, the crime of embezzlement occurs when (1) the defendant is in lawful possession of the property of another and (2) wrongfully appropriates that property for her use with the intent to permanently deprive the rightful owner. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 (1); 3 F. Wharton, supra, \u00a7 383, p. 463. \u201cIt is significant that the embezzlement results from the application of the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct to the property of another that came into his possession lawfully but on which he now has acted wrongfully.\u201d <em>State v. Radzvilowicz, </em>47 Conn. App. 1, 21, 703 A.2d 767, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 955, 704 A.2d 806 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The jury heard evidence that in August, 1999, Byxbee purportedly had signed an \u201cAuthorization to Act As Counsel,\u201d which authorized the defendant to represent the Byxbee trust \u201c[i]f, for any reason whatsoever, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>regardless of fault or blame, the insurance company does not send the proceeds to the [Byxbee trust] within [thirty] days after [Byxbee\u2019s] death\u201d and provided that the defendant would receive a 25 percent contingency fee for recovery of the proceeds of the insurance policy. The jury heard evidence that Anna Lucia Hall, the woman whose name appeared as a witness to Byxbee\u2019s signature on the 1999 contract, had never met Byxbee or witnessed her signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The jury also heard evidence that subsequent to Byxbee\u2019s death, Hemingway and Cogswell signed a contract with the defendant, agreeing to the terms of the defendant\u2019s 1999 contract with Byxbee, including the provision that the defendant would receive 25 percent of the proceeds recovered from the insurance policy. In April, 2001, Mutual of Omaha sent payment to the defendant as trustee of the Byxbee trust for the life insurance policy proceeds and for refund of the policy premium. Thereafter, the defendant wrote a check for $20,000 from the Byxbee trust for the legal fees charged by the defendant and a check for $11,889.17 as a 25 percent contingency fee for recovery of the insurance policy premium. Hemingway and Cogswell signed a document authorizing the defendant to make disbursements from the Byxbee trust. The authorization included payment to the defendant of $11,889.17 as a contingency fee for recovery of the policy premium and payment of $20,000 for \u201c[ejstate [l]egal [flees and [flrust fee retainer.\u201d Hemingway and Cogswell also signed a trust accounting, which authorized the disbursements to the defendant relating to her representation of the Byxbee trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Significantly, the jury heard evidence that in 1999 and 2000, Byxbee\u2019s health and mental well-being began to decline substantially. She became increasingly confused, would put garbage in the refrigerator and would forget to turn off the burner on the stove. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>jury heard testimony that in 2000 Byxbee was diagnosed with severe, progressive dementia. Her physician testified that she had experienced cognitive impairment for at least the previous three to five years. The jury also heard testimony that Byxbee did not want to purchase the life insurance policy, and, to convince her to undergo a physical examination required by the insurance company, she was told that it had been ordered by her physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\u201cOur task is to view the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict before determining if the jury reasonably could have concluded that such evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . We assume that the jury credited the evidence that supports the conviction if it could reasonably have done so.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>110 Conn. App. 708, 726, 955 A.2d 1222, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 952, 961 A.2d 418 (2008). On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have concluded that Byxbee did not have the mental capacity to enter into the 1999 contract with the defendant. Thus, the jury reasonably could have concluded that Hemingway\u2019s and Cogswell\u2019s subsequent ratification of the 1999 contract was void, and, as a result, the defendant wrongfully embezzled the funds.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilty as to counts ten and twelve.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly directed the jury to find that the state had proven the element of materiality in count two, which charged the defendant with perjury. In her opening brief, the defendant concedes that she did not file a request to charge on the issue of materiality and did not object to the court\u2019s instruction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The state, while agreeing that the instruction was improper, contends that the defendant either induced the impropriety or waived the claim. In response, the defendant argues that it was the state that caused the error. We conclude that the defendant has waived the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Count two of the state\u2019s substitute information charged the defendant with the crime of perjury in violation of \u00a7 53a-156 (a), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of perjury if, in any official proceeding, he intentionally, under oath, makes a false statement, swears, affirms ortestifi.es falsely, to a material statement which he does not believe to be true.\u201d Specifically, the state alleged that during an official proceeding on or about December 10, 2002, the defendant knowingly testified falsely about the March 15, 2001 letter from Mutual of Omaha purporting to rescind the insurance policy on Byxbee\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The issue of materiality first arose during Rogan\u2019s testimony regarding a deposition he took of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s responses in the deposition formed the allegations in count one of the state\u2019s information.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At trial, defense counsel objected to Rogan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>testifying as to whether the defendant\u2019s statements were material to the deposition. During argument to the court outside of the presence of the jury, defense counsel stated that \u201cmateriality is a legal issue which the judge can charge on and so forth. On the other hand, the issue is whether it\u2019s material to the process and not whether it was material to the lawyer and what he was doing. . . . It just seems to me that I don\u2019t think you can prove materiality by asking him why he was doing what he was doing.\u201d Later, the prosecutor responded: \u201cIn order to charge [the defendant with perjury], I have to show the jury how the statement was material. I can[not] get up and just argue it because that\u2019s not evidence.\u201d Defense counsel subsequently argued: \u201cTo have him define materiality, which is a legal issue, by saying what he was trying to prove ... I just think if you let a lawyer, who has a financial interest in this thing, testify as to what he thought was material and what is material legally ... it really gets us in serious problems.\u201d The court then asked for case law on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The next day, the prosecutor provided the court with <em>State </em>v. Greenberg, 92 Conn. 657, 103 A. 897 (1918).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When Rogan began to testify regarding his purpose in taking the defendant\u2019s deposition, defense counsel objected, arguing that <em>Greenberg </em>indicates that materiality is a legal issue for the court. The court overruled the objection. The prosecutor asked Rogan how his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>questions to the defendant during the deposition related to the object of the deposition. Defense counsel again objected, arguing that Rogan could not give an opinion as to materiality because it is a legal issue for the court. The state responded that the object of the deposition related to materiality, which is an issue for the jury to decide. The court sustained the objection and instructed the prosecutor to rephrase the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">On March 6, 2006, the defendant submitted preliminary requests to charge. The requests to charge included an instruction that with regard to the crime of perjury, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s statement was material to the proceedings in that it was capable of influencing or had the potential to influence the fact finder in deciding the issues. During the charging conference on March 8, 2006, the state requested the court to instruct the jury that the defendant\u2019s statements were material to the proceedings as a matter of law and that the element of materiality is not an element for its consideration. Defense counsel objected, stating that \u201cif in fact there are sufficient facts before the court, I would agree with <em>Greenberg, </em>it\u2019s strictly a matter of law. I just don\u2019t think the record here is sufficient for the court to make that determination as a matter of law.\u201d On March 9, 2008, the following colloquy between the court and defense counsel took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: ... I\u2019d like to know whether the court is going to charge the jury as a matter of law that\u2014on count two, that the alleged perjury was material to that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">\u201cThe Court: The answer to that is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">\u201cThe Court: I will tell them that pursuant to the definition of materiality, that the [defendant\u2019s] testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>indeed material and that it was capable of influencing the issue before the court at the time.\u201d Defense counsel did not object. The court then instructed the jury that as a matter of law, the defendant\u2019s testimony was material.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cWaiver is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. ... It involves the idea of assent, and assent is an act of understanding. . . . The rule is applicable that no one shall be permitted to deny that he intended the natural consequences of his acts and conduct. ... In order to waive a claim of law it is not necessary . . . that a party be certain of the correctness of the claim and its legal efficacy. It is enough if he knows of the existence of the claim and of its reasonably possible efficacy. . . . Connecticut courts have consistently held that when a party fails to raise in the trial court the constitutional claim presented on appeal and affirmatively acquiesces to the trial court\u2019s order, that party waives any such claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>104 Conn. App. 627, 633, 934 A.2d 847 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 912, 943 A.2d 471 (2008).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201cIt is . . . constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged. . . . The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment [to the United States constitution] protects an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 413-14, 473 A.2d 300 (1984) [citing <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970)]. Consequently, the failure to instruct a jury on an element of a crime deprives a defendant of the right to have the jury told what crimes he is actually being tried for and what the essential elements of those crimes are. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>[235 Conn. 477, 483-84, 668 A.2d 682 (1995)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>288 Conn. 116, 124-25, 951 A.2d 531 (2008). It is well established, however, that a criminal defendant may waive one or more of her fundamental rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>38 Conn. App. 661, 669, 664 A.2d 773, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 908, 665 A.2d 903 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1214, 116 S. Ct. 1837, 134 L. Ed. 2d 940 (1996). More specifically, \u201cwaiver of the right to require the state to prove each element of a crime may be made by counsel and may be inferred from the absence of an objection.\u201d Id., 670. Thus, a defendant may explicitly or implicitly waive the right to have the jury instructed on each element of the crime charged. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>96 Conn. App. 533, 560, 901 A.2d 687 (claim of improper jury instruction waived when defendant expressed satisfaction with instruction and failed to object), cert. denied, 280 Conn. 912, 908 A.2d 540 (2006).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Here, the defendant not only failed to object to the instruction on the ground on which she now appeals but also expressed her agreement with the proposition that materiality is a question of law for the court and should not be submitted to the jury. When the state requested that the court instruct the jury that the defendant\u2019s testimony was material as a matter of law and that the element of materiality is not for its consideration, the defendant objected only on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the facts were insufficient for the court to make a determination as to materiality. Defense counsel stated that <em>\u201cif in fact there are sufficient facts before the court, </em>I <em>would agree with Greenberg, it\u2019s strictly a matter of law. </em>I just don\u2019t think the record here is sufficient for the court to make that determination as a matter of law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, when defense counsel inquired the next day as to whether the court would give the proposed materiality instruction, and the court responded in the affirmative, defense counsel stated: \u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201d He did not object to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Although, as the defendant argues, the state requested that the court instruct the jury that the element of materiality was not for its consideration, this fact does not diminish defense counsel\u2019s assent to the improper instruction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We note that in her requests to charge, the defendant submitted an instruction in which the jury was charged that it must determine materiality. In subsequent discussions with the court, however, defense counsel indicated a belief that materiality was an issue of law for the court to determine. By stating that <em>Greenberg </em>required the court to determine materiality as a matter of law and by later agreeing to the court\u2019s instruction that the defendant\u2019s testimony at the deposition was material to the issue before the court, the defendant explicitly reversed her position as to the proper instruction. It would be inconsistent with the principles behind our jurisprudence regarding waiver to allow a defendant to put forth one argument in her requests to charge, subsequently to make a contrary argument before the court and then, when the court has adopted the defendant\u2019s second position, to claim error on appeal. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant has waived any challenge to the court\u2019s instruction on materiality. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>260 Conn. 610, 633, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002) (defendant waived right to challenge jury instruction when defendant objected to original instruction, later agreed to amended instruction and failed to object to charge given); <em>Stuart </em>v. Stuttig, 63 Conn. App. 222, 227, 772 A.2d 778 (2001) (defendant waived right to challenge instruction when defendant filed request to charge on issue of apportionment but later abandoned request).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The defendant also requests review under <em>Golding. </em>Because we conclude that the defendant waived her claim, we decline to afford <em>Golding </em>review. See <em>Mozell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>291 Conn. 62, 73, 967 A.2d 41 (2009) (noting that unpreserved, waived claims fail under third prong of <em>Golding </em>and declining to afford review under <em>Golding </em>to petitioner who waived claim); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>113 Conn. App. 347, 359, 966 A.2d 743 (defendant\u2019s waived claim of improper jury instruction fails under third prong of Golding), cert. denied, 291 Conn. 917, 970 A.2d 729 (2009); <em>State </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>supra, 96 Conn. App. 560 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The judgment is reversed only with respect to the conviction on count six, larceny in the second degree, and count seven, larceny in the first degree, and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty of those crimes.

The defendant was also charged with two additional counts of perjury in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-156 (a) (counts one and three).

In charging the defendant with larceny in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (5) by false pretenses as defined by \u00a7 53a-119 (2), the state assumed the burden of proving each element of the alleged offense.
