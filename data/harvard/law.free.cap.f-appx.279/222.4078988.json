A district court\u2019s imposition of special conditions of supervised release is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dotson, </em>324 F.3d 256, 259 (4th Cir.2003). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the decision to modify the terms of Liptak\u2019s release was a proper exercise of discretion. Accordingly, we grant the motion for leave to file a supplemental brief and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Liptak, </em>No. 7:07-cr-00009-gec, 2007 WL 1795748 (W.D. Va. June 20, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
