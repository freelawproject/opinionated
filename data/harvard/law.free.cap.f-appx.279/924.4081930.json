On appeal, Belidor argues that the district court erred by sentencing him as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e) because: (a) his prior convictions for resisting arrest with violence did not meet the statutory definition of \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d as required by the statute, and (b) the government did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>plead and prove to a jury the specific circumstances of his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">We are precluded from reviewing an alleged defect, even for plain error, when a party has invited the error. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>443 F.3d 822, 823-24 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe doctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Because Belidor stated at his sentencing hearing that he agreed with his classification as an armed career criminal, he invited the error of which he now complains, and, thus, we are precluded from reviewing the alleged error. Therefore, we conclude Belidor is entitled to no relief and we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
