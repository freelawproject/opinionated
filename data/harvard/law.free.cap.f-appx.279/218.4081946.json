He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court recently issued an order adopting in part and vacating in part the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation on Loveridge\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and remanding for further consideration. Because the district court has recently acted on the motion, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
