Counsel for Salazar-Moreno has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that he has found no meritorious issues for appeal. Counsel acknowledges that the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 at the plea hearing and did not err in refusing to reduce Salazar-Moreno\u2019s Guidelines range by three for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.1 (2007). Salazar-Moreno has filed a pro se supplemental brief claiming that the district court should have reduced his Guidelines range pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3B1.1 because he was never charged with or found guilty of the post-plea conduct of which he was accused. The Government has declined to file a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for review. After a thorough Rule 11 hearing at which Salazar-Moreno admitted his guilt and the voluntariness of his plea, the district court adopted the findings contained in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors, and sentenced Salazar-Moreno to the low end of a properly calculated Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Salazar-Moreno\u2019s assertions to the contrary, we find that the district court did not clearly err when it accepted unrefuted information in the PSR establishing that after Salazar-Moreno entered his guilty plea, he engaged in similar conduct toward another prison guard. Accordingly, it was not error for the district court to refuse to apply a three-point reduction to Salazar-Moreno\u2019s Guidelines range; the Guidelines\u2019 commentary explicitly provides that a district court may consider whether the defendant withdrew from criminal conduct when determining whether to apply the three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 1 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Salazar-Moreno in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Salazar-Moreno requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may motion this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Salazar-Moreno. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
