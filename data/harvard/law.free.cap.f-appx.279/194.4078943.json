Prior to sentencing, Meyers filed a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial based on his claims that the government failed to provide exculpatory and impeachment materials. The district court denied the motion, finding that it was not filed within seven days after the guilty verdict, Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c), 33(b)(2), and that Meyers\u2019 motion was not based on newly discovered evidence. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). The district court then imposed a sentence of twelve months plus one day on each count, to run concurrent with each other. Meyers appeals, contending that the district court erred in denying his motion to set aside the verdict or for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-19\">We have reviewed the record included on appeal and the parties\u2019 briefs and have found no reversible error. <em>See Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 420, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996) (holding that deadlines for filing post-judgment motions are strictly construed). We therefore affirm the denial of the motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial for the reasons stated by the district court. Accordingly, Meyers\u2019 conviction is also affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
