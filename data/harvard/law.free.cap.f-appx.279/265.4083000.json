Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Cartagena asserts that his sentence was procedurally erroneous because the district court failed to explain the reasons for the sentence imposed on the record and did not give reasons for overruling his objections to a sixteen-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(1)(A)(i) (2006), for having a prior felony conviction, and denying his proposed sentence. However, there is no such procedural requirement. The district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence imposed should provide some indication that it considered the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) factors and the potentially meritorious arguments raised by the parties at sentencing. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Here, the district court clearly considered both the statutory factors and the arguments of the parties. The court did not overrule the objection without comment. Further, the court stated that it considered the arguments of counsel, the advisory guidelines range, and the relevant statutory factors and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning the sentence. The suggestion of a specific sentence by the defendant does not place any further requirements on the district court. Accordingly, there was no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Next, Cartagena contends that the district court\u2019s sentence was greater than necessary to comply with the statutory sentencing goals set forth in \u00a7 3553. Specifically, Cartagena asserts that the aggravated felony relied on to impose the sixteen-level enhancement was a relatively minor offense committed fifteen years pri- or to sentencing and there was no violence or international drug trade involved. Cartagena also argues that he will suffer a significant non-criminal penalty \u2014 deportation \u2014 in addition to the 46-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">This court will affirm a sentence so long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Reasonableness review focuses on whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). When sentencing a defendant, the district court must (1) properly calculate the guideline range, (2) determine whether a sentence within that range serves the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of the arguments presented by the parties; (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) explain its reasons for selecting a sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Even if the reviewing court would have reached a different sentencing result on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>own, this fact alone is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Here, the district court properly calculated the guideline range and determined that a sentence at the bottom of that range would serve the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court considered the 1992 drug conviction and was aware of the issue of deportation. Based on the record as a whole, the district court properly considered all the factors and arguments in arriving at its sentence. Thus, there was simply no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
