After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">A district court must have at least one of three types of subject matter jurisdiction to entertain an action: (1) jurisdiction pursuant to a statutory grant; (2) federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; or (3) diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). <em>Baltin v. Alaron Trading Corp., </em>128 F.3d 1466, 1469 (11th Cir.1997). The district court \u201cshould inquire into whether it has subject matter jurisdiction at the earliest possible stage in the proceedings\u201d and is obligated to do so <em>\u201csua sponte </em>whenever [subject matter jurisdiction] may be lacking.\u201d <em>Univ. of S. Ala. v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>168 F.3d 405, 410 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If a district court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it \u201cis powerless to continue\u201d and must dismiss the complaint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Nalls\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint alleges common law claims of breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty under Florida law. As Nalls concedes, there is no diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332(a) because Nalls and the defendants are all citizens of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Furthermore, because Nalls\u2019s complaint alleges only state law claims, there is no federal question jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331. Nalls\u2019s contention that federal question jurisdiction exists pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, the Supremacy Clause and Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution is without merit. None of these constitutional provisions confers subject matter jurisdiction in and of themselves and Nalls\u2019s complaint does not allege a violation of any of these constitutional provisions. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Nalls\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Hall v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, </em>85 F.3d 532, 533 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-14\">. We lack appellate jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Nalls\u2019s motion for reconsideration because Nalls failed to include that ruling in his notice of appeal or in an amended notice of appeal. <em>See Osterneck v.
