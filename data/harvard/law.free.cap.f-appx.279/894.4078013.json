Venta presents two arguments. First, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the \u00a7 922(g) offense for which he was convicted constituted a Grade A violation, rather than a Grade B violation, because the offense did not involve controlled substances, a firearm of the type described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5846(a), and was not a crime of violence as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Second, he argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a grossly excessive and unreasonable sentence given the facts and circumstances of this case, and by failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legality of a sentence imposed pursuant to revocation of a term of supervised release. <em>United States v. Pla, </em>345 F.3d 1312, 1313 (11th Cir.2003). The advisory guideline sentence range for a sentence to be imposed on the revocation of supervised release is determined by the grade classification of the violation for which supervised release was revoked, as determined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l)-(3), and the criminal history category that was \u201capplicable at the time the defendant originally was sentenced to a term of supervision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Section 7Bl.l(a) provides for three grades of supervised release violations. A Grade A violation is conduct that constitutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-14\">(A) a federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that (i) is a crime of violence, (ii) is a controlled substance offense, or (iii) involves possession of a firearm or destructive device of a type described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a); or (B) any other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding twenty years[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l). A Grade B violation is \u201cconduct constituting any other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\u201d \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2). Grade C violations are those federal, state, or local offenses \u201cpunishable by a term of imprisonment of one year or less.\u201d \u00a7 7B1.1(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">The commentary to \u00a7 7B1.1 provides that the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is found in \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7B1.1, comment. (n. 2). Under \u00a7 4B1.2, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a federal or state offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and that \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>\u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), (2). \u201c \u2018Crime of violence\u2019 does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, unless the possession was of a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a).\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">\u201cAlthough possession of a firearm by a felon, like drunk driving, may in some cases involve <em>conduct </em>that creates a heightened risk of injury or violence, it cannot be said that the <em>offense </em>of simple possession of a firearm naturally involves a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>399 F.3d 1297, 1302 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted) (interpreting \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3156(a)(4)(B), which definition is identical to that provided in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), (2)). \u201cThus, felon in possession of a firearm under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is simply not the sort of violent, active crime that may be properly characterized, categorically, as a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>United States v. McGill, </em>450 F.3d 1276, 1280 (11th Cir.2006), we noted that the definition of conduct that presents a serious potential <em>risk </em>of physical injury to another is broadly interpreted \u201cto include crimes that do not fit neatly into a category of hostile, aggressive acts.\u201d We also noted that \u201cthe specific language of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) concerns the potential risk of physical injury rather than the actual <em>use </em>of force against another ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">A firearm or destructive device of a type described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a), for Grade A violation and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d purposes, includes a shotgun or a weapon made from a shotgun; a rifle or a weapon made from a rifle; or \u201ca machine gun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain large bore weapons.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1, comment. (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">The district court applied the wrong grade classification to Venta\u2019s violation because his felon-in-possession conviction was not a crime of violence and did not involve a controlled substance or a firearm or destructive device as enumerated in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a). The court accordingly erred by arriving at and considering the wrong advisory guideline range under Chapter 7 of the Guidelines. Having reached this conclusion, we turn to Venta\u2019s second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">We review a final sentence for substantive reasonableness only if there were no procedural errors in its imposition. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. at \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). An improperly calculated guideline range is considered a procedural error. <em>Id. </em>However, where the district court states that it would impose the same sentence irrespective of any sentencing calculation errors or enhancements, we may review the reasonableness of the sentence while assuming that the court erred in its guideline calculation. <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349-50 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Dean, </em>517 F.3d 1224, 1232 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">Because the district court applied the wrong grade classification to Venta\u2019s violation and thus procedurally erred by incorrectly calculating Venta\u2019s sentence range under Chapter 7, and the court did not state that it would have imposed the same sentence via a variance, we will not consider the substantive reasonableness of Venta\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">For the foregoing reasons, Venta\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
