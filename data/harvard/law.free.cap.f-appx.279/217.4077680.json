To hospitalize an inmate due for release but suffering from mental disease or defect, \u201cthe court must find both: 1) that he is suffering from a mental disease or defect, and 2) that as a result of his mental disease, his release would create a substantial risk of harm to another or the property of another.\u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>964 F.2d 1431, 1433 (4th Cir.1992). The medical professionals who evaluated Newsome unanimously concluded he suffers from schizophrenia and a cognitive disorder. Newsome engaged in a pattern of increasingly aggressive behavior, including an unprovoked assault of an elderly inmate and threatening to harm or kill medical staff and inmates. Based on our review of the record, the district court did not clearly err in its determination. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
