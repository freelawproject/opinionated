An Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied his application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 208(a), 241(b)(3), and under Article 3 of the U.N. Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and ordered his removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) thereafter affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Metayer, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>now seeks review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">In his brief, Metayer advances four arguments:</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">First, he satisfied his burden of proof for political asylum by showing (1) an imputed political opinion due to his uncle\u2019s membership in the Organization for the People in Trouble (\u201cOPL\u201d); (2) he was a member of the \u201cReassembling of the Young Friends of Jean Rabel\u201d (\u201cRJAJ\u201d), a group that actively denounced support of the Lavalas; and (3) he made anti-Lavalas statements on the radio and partook in a demonstration protesting the incarceration of RJAJ supporters. He asserts that the Lavalas made constant threats against him which, taken in the aggregate, rose to the level of persecution and established his well-founded fear of future persecution. He contends that the Lavalas has the capability of punishing him if returned to Haiti, and future persecution is therefore likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">Second, he satisfied his burden of proof for withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT, as he will more likely than not be persecuted upon return to Haiti based on the Lavalas\u2019s pattern of persecuting individuals with whom Metayer is similarly situated, that is, those who are affiliated with well-known and outspoken journalists.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">Third, the IJ erred in relying on Metayer\u2019s asylum interview as part of her basis for finding Metayer not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-20\">Fourth, he was tortured, as defined under the CAT, when he was beaten on more than one occasion, and that he cannot safely relocate within his own country.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-21\">Absent a cognizable exception, we lack jurisdiction to consider arguments presented in a petition for review that were not presented to the BIA on appeal. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that petitioner failed to exhaust his administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>tive remedies where he did not raise argument in notice of appeal or brief before the BIA). The record before us reveals that Metayer failed to present to the BIA his arguments that the IJ erred (1) in denying him withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT, (2) in relying on his asylum interview in making her credibility determination, and (3) in rejecting his testimony that he will more likely than not be persecuted if returned to Haiti because of the Lavalas\u2019 \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecuting individuals with whom he is similarly situated. We therefore dismiss Metayer\u2019s petition as to these claims. What remains is Metayer\u2019s claim that he should have been granted asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final agency determination unless the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. In that case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007) (internal citations omitted). Here, because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination, without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">\u201cA factual determination by the [I J] that an alien is statutorily ineligible for asylum or withholding is reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201cThis means we must affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[t]o conclude the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 765 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the definition of \u201crefugee,\u201d as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality, or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status, and thereby establishing asylum eligibility. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">\u201cTo establish asylum [eligibility] based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that [he] was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal and quotation marks omitted). A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">\u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotations omitted). Cumulative escalating physical assaults and verbal threats, however, may qualify as persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>tion. <em>See Mejia v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Delgado v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861-62 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">An IJ\u2019s credibility determination is also reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). An adverse credibility determination does not however relieve the IJ of her duty to consider other evidence presented by the asylum applicant. <em>Id. </em>If the applicant \u201cproduces other evidence of persecution ... the IJ must consider that <em>evidence____\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Substantial evidence supports the findings of the IJ, affirmed by the BIA, that Metayer was not credible and failed to meet his burden of proof to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion. Because the record does not compel a contrary finding, the BIA\u2019s decision denying Metayer asylum is due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">PETITION DISMISSED, in part, DENIED, in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
