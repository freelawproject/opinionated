Although Julio Magana agreed, when pleading guilty, to waive the right to appeal his sentence under certain circumstances, the government has indicated that it does not seek to enforce this provision as to Count Two, so we will consider Julio Magana\u2019s claim, in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-23\">Pursuant to the Guidelines, a district court is required at the time of sentencing to state, in open court, the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\u201cthe specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described,\u201d if any. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">We have previously vacated a defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing where the district court\u2019s lack of findings, either explicit or implicit, precluded meaningful appellate review. <em>See United States v. Reid, </em>139 F.3d 1367, 1368 (11th Cir.1998) (safety-valve relief). We have also done this where we were unable to tell from the record whether the district court imposed an upward departure or variance, and \u201cthe record was insufficient to permit the affirmance of the sentence\u201d under either scenario. <em>See United States v. Valdes, </em>500 F.3d 1291, 1292 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Recently, in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the Supreme Court noted that a district court, in imposing sentence, \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at \u2014, 128 S.Ct. at 597 (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we vacate Managa\u2019s sentence on Count Two and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">On this record, we are precluded from conducting meaningful appellate review of the sentence imposed on Count Two. First, it is unclear from the record whether the district court even intended to deviate upward from Julio Magana\u2019s sentencing range on that count. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b), the guideline sentence for the count was the statutory mandatory minimum of 84-months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the district judge, in imposing the 120-month sentence on the count, asserted that \u201csentence[s] within the guideline range [are] sufficient to punish the defendant, protect the public, and [are] a deterrent to crime. And as the Supreme Court ruled this morning, [they are] sentenced] within the guidelines; therefore, presumptively reasonable.\u201d Thus, the sentence imposed on Count Two appears to be inconsistent with the district court\u2019s expressed intentions as to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-17\">The government attorney attempted to resolve the lack of clarity between the sentence imposed on Count Two and the court\u2019s subsequent statements by asking the court whether it was \u201cdeparting upward ... [under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553[a] factor[s],\u201d but the district court further added to the uncertainty surrounding its actions when it merely stated \u2018Yes\u201d without any additional comment or explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-18\">Second, to the extent that the district court intended to deviate upward, it is unclear whether the deviation was intended to be an upward variance or departure. Finally, the district court did not provide any findings \u2014 either explicit or implicit\u2014 to justify the upward deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-19\">Thus, because we cannot conduct meaningful appellate review, we vacate Julio Magana\u2019s sentence on Count Two and remand for further proceedings with instructions to identify whether the difference between the applicable sentencing range and the sentence imposed resulted from an upward departure or a variance, and to explain the reasoning behind that decision, consistent with Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-20\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-14\">. We do not review the court's sentences on Counts One and Three because no challenge was raised to them on appeal and because of the appeal waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
