We dismiss the appeal of his Rule 60(b) motion for lack of jurisdiction because his notice of appeal was not timely filed. With respect to Williamson\u2019s appeal of his motion requesting court records, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Williamson, </em>Nos. 3:06-cv-02363-HMH; CR-76-19 (D.S.C. Aug. 8, 2007; Feb. 5, 2008). Williamson\u2019s motion for certificate of appealability is denied as unnecessary. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
