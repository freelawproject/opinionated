No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">Given that Plaintiffs allegations are difficult to discern, we accept the district court\u2019s charitable characterization of her amended complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Proceeding <em>informa pauperis, </em>Plaintiff, an African-American citizen, alleged that Glen Franklin, Louise Trawick, and Debbie Mauldin (\u201cDefendants\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> employees of the housing authority in Dothan, Alabama, discriminated against her on the basis of race. Plaintiff claimed that Defendants wrongfully attempted to evict her from her apartment without also attempting to evict a white tenant who had allegedly assaulted her. Plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $1 million from each Defendant for violations of the Fair Housing Act and the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">Adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs case with prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on grounds that her claims were frivolous and lacked jurisdictional substance. According to the district court, Plaintiffs amended complaint could not be construed reasonably to implicate a right or privilege secured by federal law or the Constitution. Furthermore, the district court concluded that nothing in the complaint even remotely supported Plaintiffs claim to $1 million in damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>We review cases that are dismissed as frivolous under Section 1915(e) for abuse of discretion. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cA claim is frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally speaking, factual allegations are frivolous when they are \u201cclearly baseless\u201d; and legal theories are frivolous when they are \u201cindisputably meritless.\u201d <em>Battle v. Cent. State Hosp., </em>898 F.2d 126, 129 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">We agree that Plaintiffs suit is frivolous and should be dismissed with prejudice. As the district court noted, Plaintiff filed five other lawsuits when she filed the present suit. The court also noted that, since early 2006, Plaintiff had filed 22 separate suits pursuant to Section 1915. To this history of abusing the judicial process, we add that Plaintiffs allegations are just inadequate for stating a claim of discrimination. In addition, Plaintiffs due process claim is similarly meritless absent some factual allegation that she has actually been deprived adequate process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is also apparent from our review of the record that Plaintiffs multiple filings \u2014 from her original complaint to her most recent objections \u2014 each present different allegations, the effect of which is to cast considerable doubt on the reliability of her factual assertions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Bilal, </em>251 F.3d at 1349 (\u201c[Sjection 1915, unlike Rule 12(b)(6), \u2018accords judges not only the authority to dismiss a claim based on an indisputably meritless legal theory, but also the unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions are clearly baseless.\u2019 \u201d). Given Plaintiffs abuse of the judicial process, coupled with the inadequacy and unreliability of her allegations, we conclude that Plaintiffs factual allegations are \u201cclearly baseless\u201d and that her theory of discrimination is \u201cindisputably meritless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">It is well-established: \u201c[Bjecause district judges remain more familiar with and are more experienced to recognize potentially frivolous claims, ... [a] determination of frivolity is best left to the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we see no reason to second-guess the district court\u2019s decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-9\">. The magistrate judge allowed Plaintiff to file an amended complaint because her original complaint suffered from procedural and jurisdictional deficiencies that otherwise warranted its dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-10\">. In her original complaint, Plaintiff made allegations against these three defendants; but, in her amended complaint, Plaintiff only uses the singular \"defendant\u201d and never specifies to whom she is referring. At best, Plaintiff's original complaint appears to be grounded on Defendants\u2019 refusal to intervene in Plaintiff\u2019s disputes with other tenants in Plaintiff\u2019s apartment complex.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Aq1U\">. Section 1915(e)(2)(B) provides in part: \u201d[T]he court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... the action or appeal \u2014 (i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ACJ\">. In her objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, Plaintiff alleged that the Dothan Housing Authority violated her Fifth Amendment rights by allowing her to \"succumb to harassment and mental torture at the hands of [management].\u201d Plaintiff also alleged for the first time that the apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>management assisted a white tenant in reading the apartment lease but refused to help her do the same, which she claimed amounted to unlawful discrimination. The district court overruled Plaintiff's objections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. According to her original complaint, Plaintiff filed a grievance with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\u201d) that was then under investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b927-8\">. For instance, Plaintiff grounded her original complaint on Defendants' refusal to intervene in her problems with other tenants in the apartment complex. Then, in her amended complaint, Plaintiff alleged that Defendants sought to evict her without also seeking to evict a white tenant with whom Plaintiff had an earlier altercation. Finally, in her objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, Plaintiff introduced new allegations against the Dothan Housing Authority for subjecting her to harassment and mental torture and for refusing to assist her in reading the apartment lease despite assisting a white tenant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
