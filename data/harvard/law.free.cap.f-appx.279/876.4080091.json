After the district court dismissed his initial complaint without prejudice, a decision that Smith did not appeal within the time set forth by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B), Smith re-filed a complaint in the same case. The district court struck the re-filed complaint and noted that if Smith wished to pursue his claims he should file a complaint in the proper venue, the Northern District of Florida. Smith contends that the district court abused its discretion by striking his re-filed complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Whether construed as a denial of leave to file an amended complaint, or as the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion, we review the district court\u2019s decision to strike Smith\u2019s re-filed complaint only for an abuse of discretion. See <em>Fla. Evergreen Foliage v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., </em>470 F.3d 1036, 1040 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by striking the re-filed complaint. It was not the proper vehicle for attacking a final judgment which was entered almost four months earlier. Moreover, even if the district court had construed Smith\u2019s filing as a Rule 60(b) motion, that motion would have been due to be denied as Smith\u2019s claim was still barred. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\">. We cannot consider the arguments Smith raises regarding venue because he did not file a timely appeal from the district court's dismissal of his initial complaint. Fed.
