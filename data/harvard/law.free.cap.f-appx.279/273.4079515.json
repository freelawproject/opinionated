On appeal, Searcy\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the claim that Searcy received ineffective assistance of counsel. Although informed of his right to do so, Searcy has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. After reviewing the entire record for any meritorious claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance generally should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). We find that the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Searcy\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
