Pursuant to Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which decreases by two levels the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, the district court reduced Pabellon\u2019s previous offense level from 32 to 30. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2D1.1 (2007) (Amendment 706); USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (Mar. 3, 2008); <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367, 373 (4th Cir.2008). In light of her criminal history category of I, Pabell\u00f3n claims that she faced a potential sentencing range of 97 to 121 months under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Pabell\u00f3n notes that her previously imposed sentence of 121 months was at the bottom of the guideline range and therefore contends that the district court should have reduced her sentence to the bottom of the revised range, or to 97 months. We find this argument to be without merit. As set forth in the district court\u2019s order, Pabellon\u2019s amended guideline range was actually 120 to 121 months in light of the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence applicable to her offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2007). Despite Pabellon\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the district court lacked authority to sentence her below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence as she requested. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>450 F.3d 565, 568-69 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order and the resulting 120-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
