Petitioners also seek review of the BIA\u2019s denial of their motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Petitioners argue that the IJ and BIA erred in denying their applications. The government responds that we have no jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision or the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ because petitioners filed their petition for review more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">We review issues of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). A petitioner has 30 days from the date of the final order of removal to seek review in this Court. INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1); <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). The deadline is not tolled by the filing of a motion to reconsider. <em>See Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2005) (observing that the filing of a motion to reconsider does not affect the finality of the underlying order or toll the 30-day period for petitioning for review of such order).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Because petitioners filed their petition for review more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal and the statutory time limit is not tolled by a motion to reconsider, we have no jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision or the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">As for the motion to reconsider, in their counseled brief on appeal, the petitioners mention the motion, but the bulk of the brief challenges the decisions concerning their underlying application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The government argues that petitioners have abandoned the issue of whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying their motion to reconsider because petitioners fail to sufficiently raise the issue and in any event the petitioners can show no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">When a petitioner fails to offer argument on an issue, we consider that issue abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cPassing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal, and such issues are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Otherwise, we review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). The BIA\u2019s discretion in granting or denying such a motion is \u201cvery broad.\u201d <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">After the BIA has affirmed an IJ\u2019s order of removal, the alien may seek reconsideration on the ground that the BIA has made a legal or factual error. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). A motion for reconsideration must specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and be supported by pertinent authority. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments that the BIA previously rejected provides no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>See Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted) (noting that \u201cmerely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law\u2019 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1))).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Although a close call, it appears that petitioners, in their counseled brief, have insufficiently raised a challenge to the denial of the motion to reconsider because they have not discussed the standard of review nor the relevant law; thus, they have abandoned claims related to that motion. Even if not abandoned, the petitioners\u2019 statement that the BIA made no probative findings or legal analysis is not borne out by the record. The BIA\u2019s decision, although short, contained an explicit finding that the petitioners had raised in their motion for reconsideration the same arguments already considered in the earlier appeal, and moreover the BIA\u2019s decision cites authority covering the legal effect of that finding. The petitioners do not argue why the BIA should have revisited those same arguments. Finally, to the extent the petitioners in their motion to reconsider reiterated the arguments from the earlier appeal, they failed to specify \u201cerrors of fact or law\u201d as required for a successful motion to reconsider. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we dismiss petitioners\u2019 petition in part, and deny their petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
