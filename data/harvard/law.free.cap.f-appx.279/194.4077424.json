Crum appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2000). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Crum, </em>No. 1:94-cr-00384-BEL (D.Md. May 2, 2007). This decision is without prejudice to Crum\u2019s right to seek resentencing pursuant to Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which lowered the base offense level for drug offenses involving crack cocaine. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2D1.1 (2007); USSG App. C. Amend. 706. We have recently held that it is for the district court to first assess whether and to what extent a criminal defendant\u2019s sentence may be affected by Amendment 706, either sua sponte or by motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367 (4th Cir.2008). We deny Crum\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
