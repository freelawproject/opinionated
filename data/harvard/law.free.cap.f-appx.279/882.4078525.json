While Xu\u2019s original asylum application relied on his alleged persecution in China based on his association with Falon Gong, he now claims in his motion to reopen that he would be persecuted if removed to China because he has recently become a Christian. The IJ ruled that Xu\u2019s motion to reopen, which Xu filed more than 90 days after his order of removal, was not time-barred under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) because he alleged changed circumstances that materially affected his eligibility for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Nevertheless, the IJ denied Xu\u2019s motion to reopen, finding that Xu did not demonstrate that he was eligible for asylum because he failed to show <em>inter alia </em>that \u201call Christians are persecuted in China.\u201d Xu argues that, in light of the significant amount of evidence he submitted in support of his motion, the IJ abused his discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-19\">When, as here, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) \u201csummarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final removal order subject to review.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (addressing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>reopen under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2). This review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">An alien may file a motion to reopen his removal order with the IJ. Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 240(c)(7), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). Motions to reopen may be granted if there is new evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the removal hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) and 1003.23(b)(3); <em>see also Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). A motion to reopen is, however, disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). The movant has the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of presenting evidence which would likely change the result in the case. <em>Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 813. A motion to reopen \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B); <em>Verano-Velasco v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 1372, 1376 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The IJ may deny a motion to reopen if the movant has not established a <em>prima facie </em>case for the underlying substantive relief sought. <em>I.N.S. v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 912, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (addressing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that if returned to his country, the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). To be entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture, an applicant must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">The IJ abused his discretion in this case when he denied Xu\u2019s motion to reopen his removal proceedings. In particular, by stating that, \u201c[t]o grant [Xu\u2019s] motion the Court would have to accept the fact that all Christians are persecuted in China,\u201d the IJ abused his discretion by imposing a higher standard than Xu needed to meet to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case that he was entitled to relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Accordingly, we grant the petition for review, vacate the IJ\u2019s denial of Xu\u2019s motion to reopen, and remand the case for the IJ to consider Xu\u2019s motion to reopen under the correct legal standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">PETITION GRANTED AND CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-9\">. In addition, the IJ may re-examine whether Xu\u2019s motion to reopen was time-barred in light of <em>In re C-W-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 346, 350-51 (BIA 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
