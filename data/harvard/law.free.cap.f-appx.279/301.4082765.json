This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Freeman v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>369 F.3d 854, 859 (5th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is proper under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56 \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>law.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Leggett argues that the magistrate judge erred when he granted summary judgment for the defendants on his claim that prison conditions violated the Eighth Amendment. Leggett does not address the district court\u2019s finding that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e precluded recovery of money damages. He has, therefore, abandoned that issue. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Leggett argues correctly, however, that qualified immunity is not a defense to claims for declaratory and injunctive relief and that the defendants are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>See Chrissy F. by Medley v. Mississippi Dep\u2019t of Public Welfare, </em>925 F.2d 844, 849 (5th Cir.1991). Notwithstanding the lack of these defenses, Leggett has not created a genuine issue of material fact regarding his entitlement to injunctive relief because the summary judgment evidence establishes that the defendants did not unreasonably disregard an objectively intolerable risk of harm. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 846, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Leggett\u2019s argument that the magistrate judge abused his discretion when he denied Leggett a preliminary injunction is unavailing. Leggett failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his Eighth Amendment claim or extraordinary circumstances. <em>See Women\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Bell, </em>248 F.3d 411, 419 n. 15 (5th Cir.2001); <em>White v. Carlucci, </em>862 F.2d 1209, 1211 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Leggett argues that he stated a retaliation claim based on his assertion that prison conditions about which he complained were in retaliation for the exercise of his First Amendment right to complain about the officials, but that the magistrate judge failed to address it. Leggett cites to his response to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Leggett\u2019s amended complaint, however, did not allege retaliation. Even if, Leggett had properly alleged retaliation, the defendants would be entitled to summary judgment. Leggett fails to show that he would not have been confined in Unit 7 of the Robertson Unit but for his letter writing, given the inmate affidavits he submitted to show that numerous inmates suffered the same conditions as did Leggett.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Leggett argues that the magistrate judge erred when he granted the defendants summary judgment on his equal protection claim. Leggett argues that the defendants identified him as a \u201cwrit writer\u201d and assigned him a classification that resulted in his being placed in a more dangerous area of the Robertson Unit. As with his retaliation claim, Leggett\u2019s assertion that numerous other inmates were housed with him in Unit 7 and experienced the problems that he did belies his claim that he was singled out or that he suffered \u201cpurposeful discrimination resulting in a discriminatory effect among persons similarly situated.\u201d <em>Freeman v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>369 F.3d 854, 862 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Leggett also argues that the magistrate judge erred when he granted the defendants summary judgment on his conspiracy claim. Leggett\u2019s conspiracy claim is conclusional and fails to show an actual violation of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Hale v. Townley, </em>45 F.3d 914, 920 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Hale v. Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
