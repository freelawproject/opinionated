Casto appeals the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and granting summary judgment in favor of his former employer on his employment discrimination action brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (2000). This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Livingston v. Wyeth, Inc., </em>520 F.3d 344, 350 (4th Cir.2008). Summary judgment may only be granted when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Casto v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>No. 1:06-cv-00933-GBL-BRP (E.D. Va. Dec. 28, 2007). We deny Casto\u2019s pending motions to expedite and to exclude appendix. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
