His sole contention on appeal is that a 16-level increase in his advisory guidelines offense level (producing a 70-87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>month advisory imprisonment range) was unlawful because his prior North Carolina conviction for possession with intent to sell and deliver marijuana was not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as defined by the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201cappellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cRegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. This court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-03 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The Guidelines define drug trafficking to include \u201cpossession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) &amp; cmt. (n.1(B)(iv)). The district court was permitted to consider and did properly consider (in open court and without objection) Barron-Villafan\u2019s indictment and judgment to determine whether his crime fit within the guidelines definition of drug trafficking. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480-81 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). The documents show that Barron-Villafan was convicted of (and sentenced to a three year term of imprisonment for) \u201cpossession with intent to sell and deliver\u201d marijuana, a controlled substance, in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95(a)(l). There is no significant, inherent distinction between</p>\n<p id=\"AkW\">possession with intent to \u201cdeliver\u201d and possession with intent to \u201cdistribute.\u201d <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 715 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Apr. 16, 2008) (No. 07-10458). <em>See also United States v. Palacios-Quinonez, </em>431 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2005). Authorities applying a statutory definition of delivery that includes an \u201coffer to sell\u201d are not controlling because the relevant North Carolina statute does not criminalize an offer to sell (or offer to deliver).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Barron-Villafan was previously convicted of a drug-trafficking offense as defined by the Guidelines as possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) &amp; cmt. (n.l(B)(iv)); \u00a7 90-95(a)(l). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
