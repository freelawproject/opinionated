The district court sentenced him to 121 months in prison. Cortez timely appealed. Cortez\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning the reasonableness of Cortez\u2019s sentence on the ground that the district court failed to adequately consider the factors of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">We review the sentence imposed by the district court for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). In reviewing the sentence, the appellate court must first determine whether the district court committed \u201csignificant\u201d procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If the sentence \u201cis proeedurally sound,\u201d the appellate court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">Cortez contends that the district court failed to adequately consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining his sentence. A district court must explain the sentence it imposes sufficiently for the appellate court to effectively review its reasonableness, but need not mechanically discuss all the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006). The court\u2019s explanation should indicate that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the arguments raised by the parties. <em>Id. </em>We do not evaluate the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation \u201cin a vacuum,\u201d but also consider \u201c[t]he context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">In this case, although the district court did not discuss individual \u00a7 3553(a) factors at sentencing, the court indicated that it considered the guidelines advisory, heard argument regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and found that the circumstances of the case did not distinguish Cortez from other \u201cdefendants who face a 121 month guideline minimum.\u201d We find that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in stating its reasons for Cortez\u2019s sentence and that the district court did not otherwise abuse its discretion in determining Cortez\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we conclude that the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>We therefore affirm Cortez\u2019s conviction and sentence. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is denied. This court requires that counsel inform Cortez, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Cortez requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Cortez. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\"> We have reviewed the issues raised in Cortez's pro se supplemental brief and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
