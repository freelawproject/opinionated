On appeal, Carlton argues that the district court gave no weight to his arguments that he is different from the typical criminal history category VI offender, level VI over-represented his criminal history, and the government unreasonably waited over two years before prosecuting him. Therefore, he argues he would be better classified as a level V offender and should have received a smaller sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-23\">We review a final sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1229 (11th Cir.2007). The reasonableness of a final sentence is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Specifically, the district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-26\">The Supreme Court has explained that a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the guideline imprisonment range, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its reasoning. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. It has suggested that review for substantive reasonableness under this standard involves an inquiry into whether the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>Id. </em>at 600. We do not presume reasonable a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2007). Nonetheless, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we must consider the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2006). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to the victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">While the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the sentence, it is not required to discuss each factor. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>Where the court imposes a within-guidelines sentence, the district court need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Further, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Here, the district court imposed a procedurally reasonable sentence because it correctly calculated the guideline range, it considered the statutory factors, and it noted that it had considered the arguments of the parties. It also sufficiently explained its reasoning, noting that several of Carlton\u2019s offenses involved violence and that he began committing crimes at a young age.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">The court also imposed a substantively reasonable sentence. It cited Carlton\u2019s criminal history as the major reason it felt a high-end guideline range sentence was appropriate, and the weight the court attributed to Carlton\u2019s criminal history was at its discretion. Because the district court considered the appropriate factors and appropriately exercised its discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>it imposed a reasonable sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
