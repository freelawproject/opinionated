Gunawan asserts the BIA erred in finding his testimony was not credible because: (1) the IJ improperly relied on the fact his application was found in the home of a man who had been charged with filing a fraudulent application for asylum; (2) the discrepancy between the mailing address listed on Gunawan\u2019s asylum application and his testimony at the hearing that he did not reside at that address was insufficient to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding; (3) the fact he did not apply for asylum before arriving in the United States had no bearing on his credibility; (4) his failure to submit corroborating medical evidence that he was attacked by a group of Muslim Indonesians did not show his testimony lacked credibility; (5) the IJ failed to address specifically Gunawan\u2019s \u201ccountenance, modulation or pace of speech and other nonverbal factors\u201d in determining his demean- or showed a lack of credibility; and (6) the determination was improperly based on Gunawan\u2019s failure to produce letters or affidavits from family members in Indonesia corroborating his claims. Gunawan also contends he was not required to prove he would be singled out for persecution because he demonstrated a pattern and practice of persecution of similarly situated persons based on religion. He asserts he established he suffered persecution, such persecution was sanctioned by the Indonesian government, and he would not avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA in this case issued its own opinion and did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s findings below, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>As an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>initial matter, because we review only the BIA\u2019s decision, we need not address Gunawan\u2019s arguments that (1) the IJ improperly relied on the discrepancy between the mailing address listed on his asylum application, (2) the IJ improperly relied on the fact his application was found in the residence, or (8) the IJ erred in finding that he failed to establish that he would be \u201csingled-out\u201d and tortured by the government if removed to Indonesia. These findings were not made by the BIA in its decision denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Findings of fact are reviewed under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). Our review therefore is \u201climited to whether the BIA\u2019s decision was supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted). When reviewing the denial of withholding of removal, the BIA\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are conclusive unless the record demonstrates that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">An applicant may establish eligibility for withholding of removal by establishing either that he was subject to past persecution in his country based on a protected ground, or \u201cthat it is more likely than not that [he] would be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion upon removal to that country.\u201d <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. The burden of proof is upon the alien to show his eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA. <em>Id. </em>If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an ... application.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test and \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). Like any finding of fact, a credibility determination \u201cmay not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (quotations omitted). Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show the credibility determination was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Indications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments. <em>See In re B-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 66, 70 (BIA 1995). While an applicant\u2019s uncorroborated but credible testimony may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof, we have observed \u201c[t]he weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Gunawan failed to meet his burden of estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>lishing eligibility for withholding of removal, based primarily on its finding that Gunawan\u2019s testimony was not credible, was supported by substantial evidence. The record reflects that Gunawan\u2019s testimony with regard to the alleged persecution he suffered in September 2000 was materially inconsistent with statements he made in his asylum application and declaration. In his declaration, he stated two men attacked him and his cousin, and he was driving the car when the attackers forcibly entered the vehicle and ordered him, at knife-point, to drive to a deserted location. At the hearing, however, Gunawan testified that at least four individuals hijacked the car, and his cousin had been driving. The BIA also specifically noted Gunawan was unable to recall how long he had been hospitalized following the alleged attack, and provided no explanation as to why he did not have any medical documentation of his injuries or hospitalization, or any documentation corroborating the attack. Further, in light of the inconsistencies between Gunawan\u2019s asylum application and testimony, it was not, contrary to Gunawan\u2019s assertion, improper for the BIA to consider Gunawan\u2019s failure to provide corroborating evidence of the alleged attack. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. Additionally, the fact Gunawan suffered no persecution in the two-week period between his leaving the hospital and departing for the United States, and that his family continued to live safely in Indonesia, undermined the credibility of his claims, and provided substantial evidence for the BIA\u2019s finding that Gunawan was not eligible for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In sum, given the inconsistencies in the record and the lack of documentary evidence corroborating Gunawan\u2019s allegations of persecution, the record does not support, let alone compel, reversal of the BIA\u2019s finding that Gunawan did not testify credibly. <em>See Fahim, </em>278 F.3d at 1218. Because the BIA\u2019s credibility determination alone was sufficient to support denial of withholding of removal, we deny Gunawan\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819 (stating in light of inconsistencies supported by the record, the IJ\u2019s judgment with respect to its credibility findings would not be disturbed).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">To establish eligibility for CAT relief, the applicant bears the burden of proving it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to his country. <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cTorture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering ... is intentionally inflicted on a person for ... any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). This Court has held a government does not \u201cacquiesce\u201d to torture by failing to apprehend those responsible for the harm suffered. <em>See Reyes-Sanchez, </em>369 F.3d at 1242-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The BIA\u2019s finding that Gunawan failed to meet his burden of establishing eligibility for CAT relief likewise was supported by substantial evidence because the record does not compel a finding that Gunawan would be tortured if he were returned to Indonesia. The record reveals Gunawan did not report the 2000 attack to Indonesian authorities, and therefore, he could not show the Indonesian government even knew about the attack, let alone \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the harm inflicted upon him. Although the country reports note that police had made little if any progress in quelling the violence or prosecuting those responsible, Gunawan presented no evidence from which to infer the harm he allegedly suffered was by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquies<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>cence of Indonesian government authorities. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the BIA\u2019s finding that Gunawan failed to establish a likelihood he would be tortured by or with the consent of a public official if returned to Indonesia was supported by substantial evidence, and his claim for CAT relief fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-15\">. Because we lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) to review the BIA's determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>tion that Gunawan\u2019s application was untimely or failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances that would excuse the delay, we address only the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
