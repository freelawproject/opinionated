Anderson pled guilty to distributing a quantity of cocaine base (crack), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000), and was sentenced to a term of 108 months imprisonment. Anderson appealed his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by seeking to impose a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence rather than a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.CA. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), and failed to consider adequately the effect of the 100:1 sentencing ratio for cocaine and crack offenses in his case. He also claimed that his sentence was greater than necessary to further the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). We affirmed his sentence; however, the Supreme Court subsequently vacated the judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>241 Fed.Appx. 912 (4th Cir.2007), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 913, 169 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-27\">In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary1 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Kimbrough </em>has thus abrogated <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that sentencing court may not vary from guideline range solely because of 100:1 ratio for crack/cocaine offenses), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008). The district court did not have the benefit of <em>Kimbrough </em>when it determined Anderson\u2019s sentence. To give the district court the opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough, </em>we conclude that resentencing is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-17\"> On remand, Anderson will be resentenced under the revised guidelines for crack offenses that took effect on November 1, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
