He first argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to instruct the jury regarding the defense of duress. He contends that, when he illegally reentered the United States in 2007, he was \u201cfleeing for his life\u201d from a gang in Honduras who, in 2004, had murdered his business partner, severely beaten him, and had continued to threaten him. However, an objective review of the evidence, including the testimony of Flores-Vasquez, does not establish that he was under a \u201cpresent, imminent, and impending\u201d threat of death or serious bodily injury when he illegally reentered the United States in January 2007. <em>See United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 873 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Willis, </em>38 F.3d 170, 175 (5th Cir.1994) (finding that the requirements of duress in <em>Posada-Rios </em>are \u201caddressed to the impact of a threat on a reasonable person\u201d). Because Flores-Vasquez has not presented evidence sufficient to support a defense of duress jury instruction, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to present this charge to the jury. <em>See United States v. Storm, </em>36 F.3d 1289, 1294 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Flores-Vasquez also argues that the district court erred by denying an acceptance of responsibility reduction U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). He argues that, because he admitted the factual elements of the offense, and only went to trial to show that the defense of duress presented a \u201clegal excuse\u201d to his actions, his decision to go to trial constitutes a \u201crare situation\u201d as described in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a), comment. (n.2) and in <em>United States v. Sam, </em>467 F.3d 857, 862-64 (5th Cir.2006), that justifies a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. This court need not reach this issue, however, because Flores-Vasquez\u2019s pretrial statements do not evidence an intent to accept responsibility for his actions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1(a), comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Flores-Vasquez argues that the district court adopted the Government\u2019s erroneous position that he \u201chad made no pre-trial statement indicating his guilt of the offense.\u201d The Government\u2019s position at sentencing, however, was that Flores-Vasquez had not made any statements evidencing an intent to plead guilty or accept responsibility before trial. The Government\u2019s position, adopted by the district court, is supported by the record. There is no indication that Flores-Vasquez intended to plead guilty, and his conduct pre-trial did reflect an acceptance of responsibility. Flores-Vasquez lied to law enforcement officers about his country of origin and his identity. Flores-Vasquez was properly identified only after immigration officials checked his fingerprints. Moreover, the record indicates that Flores-Vasquez did not assert the defense of duress until trial had already started. Thus, the district court\u2019s denial of the reduction is not \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3E1.1(a), comment, (n.20).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
