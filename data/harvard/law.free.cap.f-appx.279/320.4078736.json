He argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period because he diligently pursued postconviction relief. Specifically, he contends that the seven-month delay between the filing of his state habeas application and his written inquiry to the state court about its status does not militate against a finding of \u201cdiligence\u201d on his part in determining whether he is entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-20\">Derouselle bears the burden of proof concerning equitable tolling and must demonstrate \u201crare and exceptional circumstances\u201d warranting its application. <em>Alexander v. Cockrell, </em>294 F.3d 626, 629 (5th Cir.2002). To establish an entitlement to equitable tolling, he must show (1) that he pursued his habeas rights diligently and (2) some \u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019\u201d prevented him from effecting a timely filing. <em>Howland v. Quarterman, </em>507 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>840, 845 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Lawrence v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1079, 1085, 166 L.Ed.2d 924 (2007)), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Mar. 20, 2008) (No. 07-10121).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Derouselle waited seven months after he purportedly filed his state habeas application before inquiring about its status in September 2002. Furthermore, regardless whether he received the state court\u2019s November 2002 correspondence informing him that he had no state application pending before it, Derouselle\u2019s next correspondence with the state court did not come until seven months after his September 2002 correspondence, when he moved to supplement his postconviction application. Notably, the one-year limitations period had already expired by that time. He then waited an additional two months after the Louisiana Supreme Court denied writs before filing the instant \u00a7 2254 petition. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in holding that Derouselle did not act with the diligence required to entitle him to equitable tolling. <em>Cf. Howland, </em>507 F.3d at 846; <em>Fisher v. Johnson, </em>174 F.3d 710, 713 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
