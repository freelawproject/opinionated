On appeal, Mario Magana argues that the court erred when it departed upward or otherwise imposed an unreasonable sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count Two, and that the record is insufficient for us to conduct meaningful appellate review of that sentence. Although Mario Magana agreed, when pleading guilty, to waive the right to appeal his sentence under certain circumstances, the government has indicated that it does not seek to enforce this provision as to Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-22\">Pursuant to the Guidelines, a district court is required at the time of sentencing to state, in open court, the reasons for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>imposition of a particular sentence and \u201cthe specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described,\u201d if any. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">We have previously vacated a defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing where the district court\u2019s lack of findings, either explicit or implicit, precluded meaningful appellate review. <em>See United States v. Reid, </em>139 F.3d 1367, 1368 (11th Cir.1998) (in the context of safety-valve relief). We have also done this where we were unable to tell from the record whether the district court imposed an upward departure or variance, and \u201cthe record was insufficient to permit the affirmance of the sentence\u201d under either scenario. <em>See United States v. Valdes, </em>500 F.3d 1291, 1292 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Recently, in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the Supreme Court noted that a district court, in imposing sentence, \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at \u2014, 128 S.Ct. at 597 (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">On this record, we are precluded from conducting meaningful appellate review of the sentence imposed on Count Two. First, it is unclear from the record whether the district court even intended to deviate upward from Mario Magana\u2019s sentencing range on Count Two. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b), the guideline sentence for that count was the statutory mandatory minimum of 84-months\u2019 imprisonment (or 7 years). However, the district judge, in imposing the 120-month sentence (or 10 years) on the count, asserted, \u201cI have sentenced within the guidelines and I believe it is a reasonable sentence.\u201d Thus, the sentence imposed on Count Two appears to be inconsistent with the district court\u2019s expressed intentions as to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-16\">The government attorney attempted to resolve the lack of clarity between the sentence imposed on Count Two and the court\u2019s subsequent statements by asking the court whether it was \u201cdeparting upward under [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 ] 2K2.4 based on ... [the \u00a7 ] 3553[a] factors,\u201d but the district court further added to the uncertainty surrounding its actions when it merely stated, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d without any additional comment or explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-17\">Second, to the extent that the district court intended to deviate upward, it is unclear whether the deviation was intended to be an upward variance or departure. Finally, the district court did not provide any findings \u2014 either explicit or implicit\u2014 to justify the upward deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-18\">Thus, because we cannot conduct meaningful appellate review, we vacate Mario Magana\u2019s sentence on Count Two and remand for further proceedings with instructions to identify whether the difference between the applicable sentencing range and the sentence imposed resulted from an upward departure or a variance, and to explain its reasons for that decision consistent with Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We also <em>sua sponte </em>direct the district court to review the order of dismissal of Count Four entered on June 25, 2007, and if that order inadvertently reflects a co-defendant\u2019s name (\u201cJulio Magana\u201d), to correct the same.</p>\n<p id=\"A4o\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-13\">. We decline to vacate the entire sentence because of the appeal waiver and Mario Magana\u2019s failure to challenge the sentences imposed for Counts One and Three.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
