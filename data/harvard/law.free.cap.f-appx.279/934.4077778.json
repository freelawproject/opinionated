Grier argues that because the district court had not adjudicated all of the claims in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, the district court\u2019s judgment was not a final appealable order, and, thus, the judgment was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">Normally, we review a district court\u2019s ruling upon a motion filed pursuant to Rule 60(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). However, we review a motion filed pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">Under Rule 60(b)(4), a court may relieve a party from a final judgment if the judgment is void. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). \u201cGenerally, a judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4) if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>252 F.3d at 1263 (quotation omitted). A judgment is void when the court has no power to render judgment. <em>See In re Worldwide Web Sys., Inc., </em>328 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2003). Furthermore, this court\u2019s predecessor stated that \u201c[a] judgment is not void because it is erroneous.\u201d <em>William Skillings &amp; Assocs. v. Cunard Transp., Ltd., </em>594 F.2d 1078, 1081 (5th Cir.1979). \u201cA final decision is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre, </em>701 F.2d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir.1983) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">We conclude from the record that the district court\u2019s judgment was not void because it had the power to enter a judgment in the case. Furthermore, the district court order dismissing Grier\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action was a final appealable order. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Grier\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
