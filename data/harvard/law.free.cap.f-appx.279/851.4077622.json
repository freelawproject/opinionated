Adames argues that the district court failed to adequately explain its decisions not to apply a role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), a one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), and safety valve sentencing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm Adames\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-20\">At Adames\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the government proffered that his role in a certain marijuana-distribution scheme involved coordinating the purchase of marijuana from brokers for resale to other co-conspirators. The government also proffered that Adames had admitted that he was assisted in this role by his girlfriend and co-conspirator, Miguelina Antigua.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-21\">In Adames\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), a probation officer likewise explained that Adames\u2019s role in the conspiracy also involved operating a \u201cgrow house,\u201d supplying marijuana for distribution in New York City, and supervising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>another co-conspirator, Keilyn Lantigua, who helped distribute marijuana in Miami.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Based on the government\u2019s proffer and the PSI\u2019s supplemental information, the probation gave Adames (1) a three-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), because he was a manager or supervisor of a conspiracy involving five or more participants; (2) a two-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), because he had accepted responsibility for his crimes; and (3) a one-level reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b), because he assisted the government\u2019s investigation of his conduct by timely notifying it of his intention to plead guilty. With these adjustments, Adames guideline imprisonment range was 63 to 78 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The probation officer noted that Count 1 carried a statutory range of 5 to 40 years\u2019 imprisonment, Counts 3 and 5 each carried a statutory minimum of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment, all pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1), and Count 6 carried a statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The government objected to Adames\u2019s receipt of a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), as Adames had refused to cooperate with the government since his change-of-plea hearing regarding Antigua\u2019s participation. Adames objected to receiving a role enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), and to not receiving safety valve sentencing, pursuant to \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">At Adames\u2019s sentencing hearing, the parties argued their objections as follows. Regarding the \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) role enhancement, Adames argued that he did not supervise his girlfriend, Antigua, or co-conspirator, Lantigua. He asserted that no evidence was presented showing that he ordered either Antigua or Lantigua to do anything or otherwise exercised control over them. Lantigua actually was his partner and co-owned the aforementioned grow house with Adames. Antigua was not the type of person to be told what to do by anyone. Adames also argued that several of his co-conspirators actually gave orders to others but did not receive role enhancements. The government responded that Adames was a leader of the marijuana distribution scheme. The government asserted that several of Adames co-conspirators indicated during their interviews that Adames \u201cdirected and controlled\u201d some of the co-conspirators. Also, intercepted telephone calls demonstrated that Adames made the decisions as to where, to whom, and in what units the marijuana grown in the grow house would be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Regarding the \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) acceptance-of-responsibility reductions, the government argued that Adames should not receive any credit for acceptance of responsibility or, alternatively, should receive at most a two-level reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a). The government asserted that, since signing the plea agreement and agreeing to provide all possible information, Adames had refused to explain Antigua\u2019s involvement in the scheme and had disavowed statements made about her involvement at previous interviews and debriefings. Antigua had since pled guilty to her involvement. Adames responded that he readily had accepted his responsibility, so he deserved at least a two-level reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a), and had cooperated with the government, so he also deserved the extra one-level reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b). Adames asserted that he never had said Antigua was involved and that his interviewers simply had written in their notes what they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>wanted to hear, such that it was not true that he had disavowed his earlier statements. He provided two hours worth of information about his coconspirators\u2019 roles and that the government had used some of this information at the sentencing hearings of certain of these co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Regarding safety valve sentencing under \u00a7 5C1.2, Adames argued that he deserved a sentence below the statutory minimum because he was 38 years old, never had been in trouble before, always had been gainfully employed, and was the father of two small children whom he financially supported. The government responded that Adames was not eligible for safety valve sentencing because he was a leader within the marijuana-distribution scheme and had not cooperated with the government or been completely truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Also during the sentencing hearing, the government explained that, if the district court granted only a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a), did not grant a role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), and did not apply safety valve sentencing under \u00a7 5C1.2, Adames\u2019s guideline imprisonment range would be 51 to 63 months and minimum sentence would be 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, as that was the statutory minimum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The district court sustained Adames\u2019s role-enhancement objection. The district court reasoned, \u201c[T]he Judge has to find that by a preponderance. And I think that one thing that is clear given the hotly contested arguments here about the defendant\u2019s role or adjustment for role in the offense, [is that] I can\u2019t make that finding by a preponderance.\u201d The district court also granted in part the government\u2019s acceptance-of-responsibility objection, finding that Adames did not merit the extra one-level reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). The district court reasoned, \u201c[T]he government is appropriate in not asking for the third level for acceptance of responsibility. I think that is entirely appropriate.\u201d The district court further declined to apply safety valve sentencing, reasoning, \u201cI think it is entirely appropriate in this case for me not to offer this defendant the safety valve. I don\u2019t think it is appropriate.\u201d Accordingly, the district court sentenced Adames to concurrent terms of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment as to each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">As an initial matter, Adames presents his argument in terms of procedural reasonableness, or that the district court imposed a procedurally unreasonable sentence by failing to adequately explain its decisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His argument, however, does not cleanly fit this bill. We distinguish between, and use different standards of review to analyze, challenges to the district court\u2019s individual guideline calculations and challenges to the ultimate sentence. Reasonableness review applies only to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>latter type of challenge. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). While Adames argues that his sentence was not procedurally reasonable, he does not challenge his final sentence; thus, standard reasonableness review is inapplicable. However, he also does not challenge the district court\u2019s decisions not to apply a role enhancement, an extra one-level aceeptance-of-responsibility reduction, or safety valve sentencing, such that the separate standards of review applicable to these decisions also are inapplicable. Rather, Adames argues that the decision underlying each guideline calculation was not adequately explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">We find that Adames\u2019s argument is best analyzed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\u00a9, which governs the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation of its guideline decisions. Pursuant to this provision, the district court, \u201cat the time of sentencing, shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d We have applied \u00a7 3553\u00a9 to both reasonableness challenges and guideline challenges. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>318 F.3d 1257, 1270 n. 18 (11th Cir.2003) (applying \u00a7 3553\u00a9 to a guideline calculation in finding that the district court adequately stated its reasons for applying an enhancement, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B6.1(b)(2), because the defendant was in the business of receiving and selling stolen property); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (applying \u00a7 3553\u00a9 to a reasonableness challenge). Although Rita deals with a straight argument that the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence was unreasonable, unlike this case, we find the Supreme ' Court\u2019s treatment in <em>Rita </em>of \u00a7 3553\u00a9 instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">In that case, the defendant argued for a sentence below the guideline imprisonment range because of his health, fear of retaliation in prison, and military record. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 127 S.Ct. at 2469. The district court declined to do so, finding that these circumstances were insufficient to merit a lower sentence and that the guideline imprisonment range was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that, while the district court might have said more to explain his reasoning, the context of the case and record made his reasoning clear. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the Supreme Court noted that the record demonstrated that the district court listened to each of the parties\u2019 arguments, was fully aware of defendant\u2019s various physical ailments, understood that the defendant previously had held a job linked to criminal justice, and had a lengthy and decorated military service. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">In holding that the district court\u2019s brief explanation was sufficient in context, the Supreme Court reasoned that \u00a7 3553\u00a9 did not require \u201ca full opinion in every case,\u201d but that the \u201cappropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends upon circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2468. The Supreme Court reasoned that, ultimately, what is important is that the district court \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">Adames has not demonstrated that the district court failed to adequately explain its guideline decisions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\u00a9; <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. at 2468-69. The record demonstrates that the district court heard extensive arguments on the parties\u2019 objections and the possible adjusted offense level calculations immediately before making its decisions. Based on this evidence, it is evident that the district court was resting on the government\u2019s or Adames\u2019s arguments in granting or denying their objections. As such, the district court adequately implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>its reasoning. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. at 2468-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">More specifically, the record illustrates that Adames argued that a preponderance of the evidence did not support a role enhancement under \u00a7 SBl.l(b) because the evidence demonstrated that (1) he had not given orders to any of his co-conspirators, (2) Lantigua actually was his partner, (3) Antigua would not take direction from anyone, and (4) no other of the conspiracy\u2019s alleged leaders received a role enhancement. The record likewise illustrates that the government argued that a preponderance of the evidence did support a role enhancement because Adames\u2019s co-conspirators had said he was a leader and because intercepted telephone calls indicated that he hade important decisions. Because of these arguments, the district court\u2019s statement that it could not find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Adames deserved a role enhancement is not ambiguous. Rather, it is evident that the district court did not believe that the evidence of Adames\u2019s leadership role outweighed the evidence that he acted more as a partner of Lantigua\u2019s and Antigua\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Also, the record illustrates that the government argued that Adames did not merit safety valve sentencing under \u00a7 5C1.2 or a full three-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) because, while he had indicated that Antigua was involved in marijuana distribution during his pre-plea interviews and Antigua had admitted as much later, Adames had refused to provide any more information and had disavowed his earlier information after entering his plea. The record also illustrates that Adames argued that he deserved the acceptance-of-responsibility reductions and safety valve sentencing because he had provided two hours worth of information and had not disavowed anything. Because of these arguments, the district court\u2019s statements that the government was correct in objecting to the extra one-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) and that safety-valve sentencing was inappropriate adequately illustrated that the district court was granting the government\u2019s acceptance-of-responsibility objection and denying Adames\u2019s safety-valve-sentencing objection because it thought the government\u2019s argument were more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Finally, the record illustrates that the government explained what guideline imprisonment range would result if the district court denied Adames\u2019s safety-valve-sentencing objection and granted in part the government\u2019s acceptance-of-responsibility objection. Based on this explanation and the district court\u2019s decisions on the parties\u2019 objections, the district court\u2019s ultimate adjusted-offense-level calculation makes sense. Thus, because the source of the district court\u2019s findings is evident in the record, the district court\u2019s decisions were adequately explained. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. at 2468-69. Accordingly, the district court did not err in the manner claimed, and we affirm Adames\u2019s sentences. <em>See </em>id.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-7\">. Adames\u2019s base offense level was 26, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(a)(3), and criminal history category was I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">. In that case, Adames\u2019s adjusted offense level would be 24 and criminal history category would remain I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">. Indeed, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court must not only correctly calculate the guideline imprisonment range, but must treat that range as advisory and impose a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, the district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Supreme Court has explained that a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the guideline imprisonment range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its reasoning. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">. We note that the government devoted a significant portion of its brief on appeal to arguing that the district court did not clearly err in declining to apply safety valve sentencing under \u00a7 5Cl.2. However, while Adames stated the standard of review applicable to a safety-valve-sentencing determination and that, pursuant to \u00a7 5C1.2, \"a district court shall impose a sentence without regard to any statutory mandatory minimum sentence if a defendant convicted of certain crimes satisfies\u201d the criteria, Adames did not provide any argument on the merits of this matter in his brief on appeal. Rather, Adames argued only that the district court did not explain its deni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>al of safety-valve-sentencing relief. Accordingly, Adames abandoned any claim that the district court clearly erred in denying safety valve sentencing, and we need not address that issue or the government's treatment of it. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that \"a party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate\" and must \"devote[ ] a discrete section of his argument to [that] claim[],\u201d or else abandon the claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
