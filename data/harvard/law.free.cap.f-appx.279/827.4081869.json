Tagle contends that the Administrative Law Judge erred by: (1) summarizing instead of reading into the record at Tagle\u2019s supplemental hearing earlier testimony by Dr. Javier Barquet, a nonexamining medical expert; (2) failing to grant Tagle a subpoena for Dr. Morton Corin, a consultative physician whose report the ALJ relied upon in finding that Tagle\u2019s impairment did not meet the listing; and (3) admitting a comment by the vocational expert after Tagle\u2019s initial hearing that Tagle \u201creeked of alcohol.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">We review factfindings of the Commissioner with deference and legal conclusions <em>de novo. Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). The decision of the ALJ is reviewed as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when, as here, the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review. <em>Id. </em>We do not reweigh evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner, but instead review the entire record to determine if the decision reached is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Cornelius v. Sullivan, </em>936 F.2d 1143, 1145 (11th Cir.1991). Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">Tagle first contends that the ALJ erred by summarizing at his supplemental hearing the prior testimony of Dr. Barquet instead of reading the expert\u2019s testimony into the record. According to Tagle, the ALJ misconstrued Dr. Barquet\u2019s testimony and omitted details of his opinion that might have swayed Dr. Bernard Gran, a subsequent nonexamining expert who testified at the supplemental hearing. Specifically, Tagle argues that the ALJ mischaracterized Dr. Barquet\u2019s testimony by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>stating that peripheral neuropathy was the \u201cmain issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">All evidence from a nonexamining medical expert is considered opinion evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(f). In formulating an opinion, nonexamining medical experts must consider the evidence in the \u201ccase record\u201d and make findings of fact about whether the claimant meets a listing. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(f)(1). The factfindings must be based on the case record, but \u201care not themselves evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Contrary to Tagle\u2019s contention, the ALJ did not mischaracterize Dr. Barquet\u2019s testimony. Dr. Barquet expressly agreed in his testimony that neuropathy was the \u201cmain thing.\u201d In addition, under the regulations relevant to Tagle\u2019s claims, Dr. Barquet\u2019s finding that Tagle met Listing 505(A), the listing for peripheral neuropathy, was not itself evidence. <em>See id. </em>Because Dr. Gran, another nonexamining medical expert, was required to base his opinion on \u201cevidence in [the] case record,\u201d <em>see id., </em>Dr. Barquet\u2019s finding that Tagle met the listing for peripheral neuropathy was not relevant to Dr. Gran\u2019s testimony. The district court did not err by summarizing Dr. Barquet\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Tagle next contends that the ALJ erred by failing to subpoena Dr. Corin, a consultative physician whose report the ALJ relied on in finding that Tagle\u2019s impairment did not meet the listing for peripheral neuropathy. According to Tagle, the cross-examination of Dr. Gran was not an adequate substitute for the testimony of Dr. Corin. He argues that with proper cross-examination of Dr. Corin, he could have challenged the factfindings and shown the limitations of Dr. Corin\u2019s medical report. Moreover, Tagle argues that if he had been able to do so, Dr. Gran may have concluded that Tagle met the listing for peripheral neuropathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). Where an ALJ substantially relies upon a post-hearing medical report that directly contradicts the medical evidence supporting a claimant\u2019s contentions, it violates a claimant\u2019s right to due process for the Commissioner to deny disability benefits without giving the claimant an opportunity to subpoena and cross-examine the authors of such reports. <em>See Demenech v. Sec\u2019y of the Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>913 F.2d 882, 885 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">Dr. Corin\u2019s medical report was prepared before the supplemental hearing, and therefore before the testimony of Dr. Gran. At the supplemental hearing, Tagle received an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Gran about the inconsistencies in the medical reports prepared by the experts consulted in his case, the procedures used by Dr. Corin, and the weight that should be given to each report. In addition, the ALJ did not substantially rely upon Dr. Corin\u2019s report in finding that Tagle did not meet the listing for peripheral neuropathy. The ALJ instead gave \u201cthe most weight to the opinion of Dr. Gran\u201d and noted that Dr. Corin had made a similar assessment. Accordingly, the ALJ did not err in denying Tagle\u2019s motion to subpoena Dr. Corin to the supplemental hearing. <em>See Demenech, </em>913 F.2d at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Finally, Tagle contends that the ALJ erred in admitting a comment by the vocational expert after the initial hearing that Tagle \u201creeked of alcohol.\u201d He argues that the comment was \u201cunsworn\u201d and \u201cunfairly prejudicial.\u201d According to Tagle, the ALJ improperly relied on the comment to discredit his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">\u201c[C]redibility determinations are the province of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2005). While the ALJ is required to articulate explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>and adequate reasons for questioning an applicant\u2019s credibility, the ALJ need not \u201cspecifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Evidence is anything submitted or obtained by the Commissioner that relates to the claim. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(b). It includes: (1) statements by the claimant or others about the claimant\u2019s impairment, restrictions, daily activities, and work efforts; and (2) \u201cany other relevant statements\u201d by the claimant to \u201cmedical sources during the course of examination or treatment\u201d or to the Commissioner \u201cduring interviews, on applications, in letters, and in testimony in [its] administrative proceedings.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The vocational expert\u2019s comment that Tagle \u201creeked of alcohol\u201d was evidence within the meaning of the regulations because it was a statement by another about Tagle\u2019s daily activities that directly contradicted his testimony at the initial hearing that he had stopped drinking. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(b)(3). Contrary to Tagle\u2019s contention, the regulations do not prohibit unsworn out-of-court statements relevant to a claim of disability. <em>See, e.g., Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 402, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1428, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (permitting admission of unsworn medical reports in spite of their hearsay character and the absence of cross-examination). Accordingly, the ALJ did not err by admitting the vocational expert\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-12\">. Tagle also contends that the ALJ erred by failing to further investigate at Tagle's initial hearing the opinion of Dr. Barquet that Tagle met Listing 5.05(A), the listing for peripheral neuropathy. According to Tagle, if further investigation had been done, Dr. Barquet may have presented evidence that Tagle met another listing. However, because Tagle did not request clarification of Dr. Barquet\u2019s opinion before the ALJ and did not raise this argument before the district court, we will not consider it on appeal. <em>See Kelley v. Apfel, </em>185 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.1999) (noting that this Court generally will not consider an argument that a claimant did not raise before the administrative agency or the district court).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
