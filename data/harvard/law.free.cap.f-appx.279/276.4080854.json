Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Miranda v. Univ. of MD, Coll. Park, </em>No. 8:04-cv-02609-AW (D. Md. entered Nov. 20, 2006; filed Nov. 21, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-23\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-15\"> Although Miranda also asserted an age discrimination claim against Defendant under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 to 634 (2000), the district court dismissed that claim by separate order. Miranda does not challenge that order on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
