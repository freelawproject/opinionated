We issued a certificate of appealability on four issues: (1) whether the district court erred in failing to consider whether Byrd\u2019s counsel was ineffective for not challenging his underlying state conviction for theft by taking, which the district court used in calculating his criminal history category for sentencing; (2) whether Byrd sufficiently requested a stay of his \u00a7 2255 motion to allow him to complete his challenges to his prior state convictions in state court; (3) if Byrd sufficiently raised the request for a stay, whether the district court impliedly denied it; and (4) if the district court did deny the request for a stay, whether it erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">Byrd first contends, and the government concedes, that the district court failed to address the first of these issues. It should have addressed all of the issues, including that one. Therefore, to avoid causing piecemeal litigation, we vacate the denial of Byrd\u2019s motion and remand with instructions for the district court to address the issue of whether Byrd\u2019s counsel was ineffective for not challenging Byrd\u2019s underlying state conviction for theft by taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
