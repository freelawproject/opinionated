Pursuant to an agreement between the settlor and his wife, the trust indenture was executed immediately after their divorce. It provides for payment to her of (a) $350 a month while she remains unmarried and (b) $150 a month while a daughter remains a minor and unmarried; any balance of income to he paid to the settlor; that the trust \u201cshall continue during such period as is necessary to fully comply with\u201d payments (a) and (b) ; \u201cand upon such full compliance therewith, the trust hereby created shall terminate * * *\u201d and principal and accumulated income go to the settlor or his executors or administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The settlor has died. His divorced wife remains unmarried. Their daughter is no longer a minor. She is the settlor\u2019s sole heir and next of kin. She has assigned to her mother all her interest in the income of the trust. Mother and daughter have asked the trustee to terminate the trust and dispose of the principal and accumulated income in accordance with their joint order. The District Court \u201cconcluded that all of the purposes of the trust * * * have not been fully performed\u201d and directed the trustee to continue to1 administer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">\u201cThe general rule is that all parties in interest may terminate the trust.\u201d Helvering v. Helmholz, 296 U.S. 93, 97, 56 S.Ct. 68, 70, 80 L.Ed. 76. In a footnote to that statement the Supreme Court cited \u00a7 337 of the Restatement of the Law of Trusts, which reads: \u201c(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), if all of the beneficiaries of a trust consent and none of them is under an incapacity, they can compel the termination of the trust. (2) If the continuance of the trust is necessary to carry out a material purpose of the trust the beneficiaries cannot compel its termination.\u201d Both Shelton v. King, 229 U.S. 90, 33 S.Ct. 686, 57 L.Ed. 1086, and McDonald v. Fulton Trust Co., 71 App.D.C. 36, 107 F.2d 237, illustrate the exception. In each case beneficiaries sought to terminate a trust before reaching the age\u2014 25 in one case, 30 in the other \u2014 specified by the testator who created it. Since the testator\u2019s evident purpose of providing young adults with a secure income had not yet been fulfilled, termination was refused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\"> To say that beneficiaries cannot compel termination of a trust if its continuance is necessary to carry out a <em>material purpose </em>of the settlor is not to say they cannot do so if continuance is necessary to carry out his <em>intent </em>regarding duration of the trust. Such a proposition would go farther than our law in preferring the dead over the living and putting competent adults under guardianship. It would turn the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cgeneral rule * * * that all parties in interest may terminate the trust\u201d into a universal rule that they may not. The \u201cpurpose\u201d with which the rule is concerned is not the settlor\u2019s intent but the aim, object or motive underlying his intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>In this case the settlor\u2019s purposes seem to have been (1) to discharge his obligations to his divorced wife, satisfy her demands, and avoid being subjected to a decree for alimony; (2) to assure his daughter\u2019s support during her minority; and (3) to preserve the residue of the\u2019 fund for himself and his next of kin. Since these purposes have been fulfilled we think the trust should be terminated as its beneficial owners desire and the fund distributed as they direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-11\"> Broad language in the Shelton opinion implying a general rule against termination conflicts with the later Helmholz case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Shortly after the McDonald decision this court used broad language overstating the general rule in favor of termination: \u201cIt is well settled law that a sole beneficiary, or several or successive beneficiaries \u2014 all of whom consent and none of whom suffer from disability \u2014 may direct that the performance of the trust be arrested, modified, or even extinguished.\u201d Washington Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Colby et al., 71 App.D.C. 236, 239, 108 F.2d 743, 746.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
