The District Court dismissed the complaint on the theory that the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia had exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-22\">When this suit was brought the Judicial Code provided that district courts had jurisdiction \u201cFirst. Of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, brought by the United States * * *; or, where the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000, and (a) arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States * * *, or (b) is between citizens of different States * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District of Columbia Code provided that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \u201c(except as otherwise provided in this title) shall have cognizance * * * of all actions or suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, in which the United States shall be plaintiffs or complainants * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By these and previous statutes the United States has expressly conferred upon its district courts jurisdiction of its suits. These statutes have not limited this jurisdiction, as diversity jurisdiction has been limited, to suits for more than $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-25\">In our opinion Congress had no thought of limiting the special right of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>States to sue in. district courts when, without mentioning the United States, it enacted in general terms that the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia \u201cshall have exclusive jurisdiction of ciyil actions, including counterclaims and crossclaims, in which the claimed value of personal property or the debt or damages claimed, exclusive of interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, protest fees, and costs, does not exceed the sum of $3,000 * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General provisions are often not intended to limit special provisions with which, read literally, they conflict. Ex parte United States, 226 U.S. 420, 33 S.Ct. 170, 57 L.Ed. 281; Sanford v. Sanford, 52 App.D.C. 315, 286 F. 777. Moreover, \u201cstatutes which in general terms divest pre-existing rights or privileges will not be applied to the sovereign without express words to that effect.\u201d United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 272, 67 S.Ct. 677, 686, 91 L.Ed. 884. Both principles apply here. Since Congress had conferred upon the United States a right to sue in district courts, irrespective of amount, if Congress had intended to limit this right we think it would have done so expressly. It follows that in our opinion the District Court had jurisdiction of this suit. The question whether the Municipal Court has concurrent jurisdiction of such suits is not before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AJ\"> Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1091, as amended; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 41.
