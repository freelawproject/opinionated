Petitioners have sought, by invoking the doctrine of Gregory v. Helvering, 1935, 293 U.S. 465, 55 S.Ct. 266, <em>79 </em>L.Ed. 596, 97 A.L.R. 1355, to avoid the tax consequences of a transaction falling within the literal language of the statutory definition of a \u201creorganization\u201d. I.R.C. \u00a7 112(g) (1) (D), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 112(g) (1) (D). On the first petition, we vacated the Tax Court\u2019s decision, reported in 1946, 6 T. C. 455, and remanded the case for further proceedings. 1 Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 839. The factual background has been clarified on the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">John B. Lewis died in 1930, and John D. Lewis, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation (hereinafter called the old company), was organized in 1931 to take over the business which the decedent had operated. The common stock was issued to the trustees under decedent\u2019s will, and had a basis of $435,000 in their hands. Petitioners are the surviving trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The old company was engaged in three different lines of business in 1941: the manufacture of synthetic resins, the manufacture of chemicals for the textile industry, and the distribution of chemicals. In July, 1941, the synthetic resin business and the chemical distributing business were sold for a total of approximately $325,000 in cash and marketable securities. At that time petitioners, who were directors of the old company, tried to sell the chemical manufacturing business too, but their efforts were unsuccessful. They decided to continue operating this business until they could dispose of it at a fair price, but they did not want to leave the old company\u2019s liquid assets at the risk of the chemical manufacturing business. Advice of counsel was sought as to how to distribute the liquid assets so as to incur a minimum tax. The decision was reached to transfer the operating assets of the chemical manufacturing business to a new corporation in exchange for its stock and to distribute this stock, together with the old company\u2019s liquid assets, in liquidation of the old company.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Steps were then taken to carry this decision into effect. On December 27, 1941, the directors of the old company voted to transfer to a corporation to be organized (hereinafter called the new company) all the assets of the old company, other than cash in excess of $90,000 and securities, in consideration of the issuance to the old company of the capital stock of the new company and the assumption by the latter of the old company\u2019s liabilities. This action of the directors was ratified by the shareholders on the same day. On December 29, 1941, the new company was incorporated under the laws of Rhode Island. At 11 A.M. on that day, the old company made the transfer of assets to the new company in exchange for its stock, and at 11:30 A.M. the directors of the old company voted to liquidate that company by distributing its remaining assets, including the stock of the new company, to the shareholders of the old company in cancellation of the old company\u2019s outstanding shares. Immediately thereafter the shareholders of the old company ratified this action, and it was carried out. The Tax Court found that the gain realized by petitioners, as trustees, on this exchange was $66,107.30, and this amount was not disputed by petitioners. The cash distributed to petitioners exceeded this sum, and the undistributed earnings or profits of the old company accumulated since 1931 also exceeded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The Tax Court found that \u201cthere was no interruption of [the chemical manufacturing] business and no change of location, policy, personnel, officers, or directors, but no salaries were paid to the officers. The new company continued to conduct the chemical manufacturing business until the latter part of 1944, when the Hercules Powder Co. purchased the bulk of its assets. The new company was liquidated and dissolved in 1945. The 1941 transfer of assets from the old company to the new company in exchange for the latter\u2019s stock was undertaken for reasons germane to the continuance of the corporate business. There was a business purpose in the transaction, and the plan which was adopted and carried out effected a genuine reorganization of corporate business, with a continuity of the enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>prise and continuity of interests therein under a modified corporate structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">On the fiduciary income tax return of' the Estate of John B. Lewis for the year 1941, petitioners reported the gain on the exchange of the old company\u2019s shares as a long-term capital gain under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 115(c) and 117, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 115(c), 117, realized upon the complete liquidation of the old company. The Commissioner determined a deficiency on the grounds that the liquidating distribution to petitioners by the old company was made pursuant to a plan of reorganization; that under \u00a7 112(c) (1) the gain was recognized in full since it was less than the value of the \u201cboot\u201d, that is, the cash and securities (other than the stock of the new company) distributed; and that since the distribution had the effect of a dividend, it was taxable as such pursuant to -\u00a7 112(c) (2). On the basis of the above findings, the Tax Court sustained the Commissioner. This decision of the Tax Court is now before us on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Sometimes the taxpayer seeks to establish that a statutory reorganization did not take place. E.g., Survaunt v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 753. Other times the Commissioner takes that position. E.g., Bazley v. Commissioner, 1947, 331 U.S. 737, 67 S.Ct. 1489, 91 L.Ed. 1782, 173 A.L.R. 905. Our determination of the substantive question must not be controlled by whether in the particular case it is to the advantage of the government or of the taxpayer to make out that no statutory reorganization has been effected. See Lyon, Inc., v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 1942, 127 F.2d 210, 213. \u201cRather, the effort should be to seek out the true intendment of the law, let the chips fall how they may in the particular litigation. Otherwise, to change the metaphor, interpretative chickens may come home to roost at a time when the barnyard wears quite a different aspect.\u201d Portland Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 1940, 109 F.2d 479, 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In the present case, the integrated character of the steps in the plan pursuant to which the new company was created and the old company liquidated is not disputed. What took place is patently within a literal interpretation of the statutory definition of reorganization in \u00a7 112(g) (1) (D): \u201cThe term \u2018reorganization\u2019 means * * * (D) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its shareholders or both are in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred\u201d. Not only do \u201cthe facts answer the dictionary definitions of each term used in the statutory definition\u201d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but we conclude that Congress meant to cover the situation- in suit. As a leading practitioner has put it, \u201cthe essence of [a statutory reorganization] is a continuance of the proprietary interests in the continuing enterprise under modified corporate form, the transaction being deemed insufficiently closed economically to justify a tax at the time, except in so far as the stockholder gets something in addition to stock or securities in the reorganized company.\u201d Darrell, The Scope of Commissioner v. Bedford Estate, 24 Taxes 266, 272 (1946); see Gross v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1937, 88 F.2d 567, 568; Commissioner v. Gilmore\u2019s Estate, 3 Cir., 1942, 130 F.2d 791, 794; 3 Mertens, Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 20.50. This description fits the transaction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">However, petitioners contend that George D. Graham v. Com\u2019r, 1938, 37 B.T.A. 623,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> governs and supports their position that a statutory reorganization did not take place. Even assuming the correctness of the Graham decision <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for purposes of this case, we nevertheless consider it distinguishable. There the old corporation sold about 95% of its assets, and then transferred the remaining 5%, consisting of notes, mortgages, stock, etc., to a new corporation in exchange for the latter\u2019s stock. The old corporation then liquidated, distributing cash and securities and the new corporation\u2019s stock to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>shareholders in return for their stock. The Commissioner disallowed the loss taken on the exchange by some of the shareholders in the old corporation, but the Board of Tax Appeals upheld their contention that no reorganization had taken place. According to the Board, the new corporation \u201cwas organized to liquidate the remaining assets of [the old corporation] and not to carry on any business enterprise\u201d; the statute \u201cwas not intended to include such a transaction\u201d. 37 B.T.A. at page 630. Hence, the loss on the liquidation exchange was held to be allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Thus, in the Graham case, the Board apparently concluded that a sine qua non of a statutory reorganization was absent: \u201cReorganization presupposes <em>continuance of business </em>under modified corporate forms.\u201d Cortland Specialty Co. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1932, 60 F.2d 937, 940, (italics added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But in the present case, petitioners\u2019 plan contemplated that the new company <em>would </em>carry on the chemical manufacturing business transferred to it, and this was done. Although petitioners\u2019 intention was to dispose of the chemical manufacturing business eventually, the fact that a going business was transferred and operated left the new company and petitioners, its shareholders, in a position where they stood to gain or lose from operations just as before the transfer; if business conditions warranted it, the business could have been continued indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The liquidation of the old company docs not change matters because a statutory reorganization may encompass as one of its incidents the liquidation of one of the corporations a party to the reorganization. Commissioner v. Whitaker, 1 Cir., 1938, 101 F.2d 640; Helvering v. Schoellkopf, 2 Cir., 1938, 100 F.2d 415; Fisher v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 1939, 108 F.2d 707; Elise W. Hill\u2019s Estate v. Com\u2019r, 1948, 10 T.C. 1090. Nor does the statute make the amount of property transferred to the new corporation a decisive factor in determining whether a reorganization took place. Helvering v. Schoellkopf, supra. What is controlling is that in both the \u201cpopular and economic sense,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the intendment of the statute, considerations of \u201cboot\u201d aside,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> gain or loss is not sufficiently crystallized for recognition by the mere transfer of a going business to another corporation for operation indefinitely; \u201cthe collective interests still remained in solution.\u201d Helvering v. Gregory, 2 Cir., 1934, 69 F.2d 809, 811. Hence, the transaction was within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">Somewhat the same disposition may be made of petitioners\u2019 further argument. They maintain that the creation of the new company and the transfer to it of the chemical manufacturing business was motivated by the desire to free the liquid assets of the old company from the risk of the manufacturing business; that the old company could have continued to operate the manufacturing business, and that only the shareholders received any advantage from the new arrangement. In short, their position is that no statutory reorganization took place because the plan was motivated by a \u201cshareholder purpose\u201d and not the \u201ccorporate purpose\u201d which they say is required by Gregory v. Helvering, 1935, 293 U.S. 465, 55 S.Ct. 266, 79 L.Ed. 596, 97 A.L.R. 1355. We reject this argument, as did the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">At one time, in applying the so-called \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d test of the Gregory case, the Tax Court did distinguish between \u201cshareholder purpose\u201d and \u201ccorporate purpose\u201d in closely held corporations. Louis Wellhouse, Jr. v. Com\u2019r, 1944, 3 T.C. 363; Alice H. Bazley v. Com\u2019r, 1945, 4 T.C. 897; Adam A. Adams v. Com\u2019r, 1945, 5 T.C. 351;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Marion Heady v. Com\u2019r, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>1945, 4 CCH TCM Dec. 14,702(m) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We think that the Tax Court has been correctly advised in unequivocally repudiating that distinction here. Cf. Richard H. Survaunt v. Com\u2019r, 1945, 5 T.C. 665, affirmed 8 Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 753; see Comment, 43 Ill. L.Rev. 512, 517 (1948). To seek to differentiate between \u201ccorporate purpose\u201d and \u201cshareholder purpose\u201d is unrealistic and impractical, particularly with respect to closely held corporations. See Spear, \u201cCorporate Business Purpose\u201d in Reorganization, 3 Tax.L.Rev. 225, 242-43 (1948). The separate legal identity of these corporations should not obscure the fact that they are operated by their shareholders in a manner thought best calculated to serve the latter\u2019s interests. What is deemed best for the shareholders is deemed best for the corporation, and vice versa. We think it not insignificant that, in affirming the Bazley and Adams decisions, the Supreme Court gave no countenance to the distinction petitioners advocate. 1947, 331 U.S. 737, 67 S.Ct. 1489, 91 L.Ed. 1782, 173 A.L.R. 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Whatever hesitation we may have had earlier, we are' now convinced that emphasis upon \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d as a requisite for statutory reorganization is futile on the facts here presented.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. Lourie, The Business Purpose Doctrine, 25 Taxes 800, 805-06 (1947). This is not a situation as in the Gregory case where the new corporation was an evanescent creature, \u201cbrought into existence for no other purpose\u201d than to serve as \u201ca mere device * * * to transfer a parcel of corporate shares\u201d to a shareholder, and immediately thereafter dissolved. There it was clear that \u201cthe transaction upon its face lies outside the plain intent of the statute.\u201d 293 U.S. at pages 469-470, 55 S.Ct. at page 268, 79 L.Ed. 596, 97 A.L.R. 1355. Here we regard it as equally clear that the transaction lies <em>inside </em>\u201cthe plain intent of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">As we have stated, continuance of the 'business is a sine qua non of a statutory reorganization, but. we need look no further than the Bazley case to see that in some contexts the mere fact that the business is continued does not mean that a statutory reorganization has taken place. See Spear, \u201cCorporate Business Purpose\u201d in Reorganization, 3 Tax L.Rev. 225 (1948). Hence, to denominate as \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d the intention to have the new company continue the chemical manufacturing business would serve only to confuse. Whatever remaining utility there may be in the \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d test, reliance upon such formula must not become a substitute for independent analysis. The controlling factor which we have concluded brings this case within the statute is that a basic element of the plan was the continuance of the chemical manufacturing business in the corporate shell of the new company, with the gain (were it not for the \u201cboot\u201d) not having sufficiently crystallized for recognition, because the collective interests of the shareholders \u201cstill remained in solution.\u201d See Love v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 236; Heatley Green v. Com\u2019r, 1942, 1 CCH TCM Dec. 12,922-E; 34 Va.L.Rev. 842 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">If the shareholders of the old company had received only stock in the new company in cancellation of their old shares, under \u00a7 112(b) (3) of the Code no gain would have been recognized. Because of the \u201cboot\u201d also distributed, \u00a7 112(c) (1) provides that the gain is recognized here. Once it is decided against petitioners that a reorganization took place, petitioners have not argued in the alternative, either here or in the Tax Court, that the gain should nevertheless, under \u00a7 112(c) (2), be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>treated as a gain from the exchange of property (long-term capital gain), and not as a dividend. Compare Commissioner v. Estate of Bedford, 1945, 325 U.S. 283, 292, 65 S.Ct. 1157, 89 L.Ed. 1611; Love v. Commissioner, supra; Hill\u2019s Estate v. Com\u2019r, supra; Heatley Green v.
