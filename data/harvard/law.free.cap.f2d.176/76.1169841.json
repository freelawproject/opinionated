The applicable law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits the taxpayer to file a petition for redetermination of the deficiency with the Tax Court within 90 days of the mailing of the notice, the 90th day in this case being April 8, 1948. On April 6, petitioner\u2019s counsel mailed the petition, air mail, special delivery, from San Francisco. The petition arrived in Washington D. C., at about 2:45 on the afternoon of April 8th and the messenger bearing the petition, arrived at the Tax Court after its normal closing hour of 5:15 p. m.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition was then returned to the Post Office and delivered the following, or 91st day. The Tax Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction and petitioner now petitions his court for review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">There is, at this late date, little doubt that the 90 day requirement is jurisdictional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 lili<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>izes the Tax Court to prescribe rules for the conduct of its own practice and procedure. These rules have the force and effect of law.2 **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus it was necessary that the petition be filed before the closing of business, i. e., 5:15 p. m,, on the 90th day. This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Judge STEPHENS did not participate in the decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\"> 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 272(a) (1) provides: \u201cIf in the case of any taxpayer, the Commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter, the Commissioner is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by registered mail.
