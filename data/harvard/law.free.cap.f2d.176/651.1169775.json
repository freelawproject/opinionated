Tower, 327 U.S. 280, 66 S.Ct. 532, 90 L.Ed. 670, 164 A.L.R. 1135, and Lusthaus v. Commissioner, 327 U.S. 293, 66 S.Ct. 539, 90 L.Ed. 679, which were followed by this court in Hougland v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 Cir., 166 F.2d 815, and numerous other cases, many of which are there cited;</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
