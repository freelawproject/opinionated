Previously, on March 24 of that year, appellant had caused a writ of garnishment to be issued in a suit in the state court against the Meat Company, and by this process had obtained a lien upon the latter\u2019s bank account in an amount exceeding $500. The suit was apparently contested and was still pending at the time of the Meat Company\u2019s adjudication. The Trustee (appellee here) intervened to challenge the validity of the lien, asserting that the bankrupt was insolvent as of the date of its acquisition. The Trustee and the parties plaintiff and defendant in the suit stipulated that the question of insolvency be resolved by the bankruptcy referee, it being agreed by all concerned that the sequestration of the bankrupt\u2019s funds was had within the four mouths\u2019 period prescribed by the Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107, sub. a(l). The state court postponed disposition of the challenged writ until the final determination of the controlling factual issue in the federal jurisdiction. Thereafter the matter came on for hearing before the referee on the Trustee\u2019s petition; and upon the taking of evidence the referee found that the bankrupt was insolvent <em>on </em>March 24, 1948. The appeal is from the order of the district court affirming the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-16\">Appellant contends that the finding of insolvency is unsupported by evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only testimony on the point was that of a certified public accountant, who stated that he made no attempt to appraise the assets. In placing a valuation on certain trucks and other items of the bankrupt\u2019s personal property he adopted the amounts realized \u25a0 on their sale several months subsequent to March 24. These items were encumbered and on their disposition brought nothing beyond the amount of the encumbrances. As to other assets he accepted <em>book </em>values, although believing them excessive. While the accountant stressed realized values, his testimony m its entirety indicates that the values arrived at were in fact his own estimates of what the property would have brought had it been converted into cash on the critical date, the estimates, he- said, being based on a variety of \u201cevidences\u201d he had obtained from the files and from other sources. His testimony was given in conjunction with a tabulation he had prepared analyzing asset value and the tabulation was introduced as an exhibit. It is undisputed that the Meat Company lost money from the inception of its operations and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>there was no good will. In respect to personal property, courts have sanctioned liberal ways of providing value. Sales of such property at a date not too remote from the valuation date are proper criteria of value. 32 C.J.S., Evidence, \u00a7 1049, and compare Bagdasarian v. Gragnon, 31 Cal. 2d 744, 192 P.2d 935. In the absence of countervailing evidence (and there was none here) we think there was sufficient proof of insolvency as of the date of the garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-17\"> The statute, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107, sub. d(1), provides that a person is insolvent \u201cwhen the present fair salable value of his property is less than the amount required to pay his debts\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
