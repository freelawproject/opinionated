In the Revenue Act of 1942 Congress forbade any such deductions except in accord with Section 23 (p) of the Code as amended by that Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">A contribution paid into a profit-sharing trust is deductible under Section 23 (p), as amended, if, among other things, the trust \u201cis exempt under section 165(a)\u201d of the Code. Section 165(a), including sub-paragraphs (1) through (6), sets forth conditions which must be met if a trust is to be exempt. These conditions are quoted in full in the note.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">The amendments were made applicable with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1941. In the taxpayer\u2019s case, that was its 1943 fiscal year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>However, \u201cin order to afford time for existing deferred-payment plans and trusts and contracts to be amended so as to satisfy the requirements of Section 165(a),\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it was provided in Section 162(d) of the Revenue Act of 1942 that a profit-sharing plan in effect on or before September 1, 1942 should not become subject to the requirement of sub-paragraphs (3), (4), (5) and (6) of Section 165(a) until the beginning of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1942, and that such a plan should be considered to satisfy the requirements of those subparagraphs for the period before December 31, 1943, if the plan satisfied such requirements by-December 31, 1943. Subsequently, by Section 3(a) of the Act of December 17, 1943, 57 Stat. 601, and Section 2(a) of the Act of December 20, 1944, 58 Stat. 830, Section 162(d) of the Revenue Act of 1942 was amended to provide that such a plan should be considered as satisfying sub-paragraphs (3) through (6) of Section 165(a) of the Code for the period up to June 30, 1945, if the plan satisfied all those requirements by June 30, 1945, and if by that time all parts of the plan necessary to meet these requirements had been made effective as of December 31, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Taxpayer contends that, by retroactively amending its plan, and obtaining the Commissioner\u2019s approval of that amended plan, it has fulfilled the requirements of Section 165(a) within the grace period given by Section 162(d) of the Revenue Act of 1942. The Commissioner claims that the grace period was extended only for compliance with sub-paragraphs (3) through (6) of Section 165(a), and, he argues, as the taxpayer\u2019s plan did not, during the fiscal years in question, comply with sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of Section 165(a), it cannot claim an exemption under that section. The taxpayer answers that its amendment was completely retroactive to a date before the effective date of the Revenue Act of 1942, and that Congress intended to give all profit-sharing plans, for which deductions were allowed before that <em>date, </em>a <em>grace </em>period in which to qualify. In the alternative, taxpayer contends that the plan in operation before the amendment was a \u201ctrust\u201d as that term is used in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of Section 165(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">We agree with this alternative contention, so we need not consider the other arguments. The issue thus distilled from the complicated collection of statutes involved is the meaning of the word \u201ctrust\u201d in Section 165(a). That section must, of course, be interpreted in the light of the whole statutory scheme and of the purpose of Congress in enacting and amending the statute. \u201cTrust\u201d is not a term of art or of fixed <em>content, and its meaning for </em>the purposes of this section is not necessarily the same as under state law or as under other sections of the Internal Revenue Code. It is thus not conclusive that originally the parties decided not to set up what they called a \u201ctrust,\u201d for they were thinking of the payment of trustees\u2019 fees and the accounting in court which would necessarily be required if a state-law \u201ctrust\u201d were established.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">There is certainly nothing novel about appointing a corporation to act as \u201ctrustee\u201d to hold and invest a trust fund for the benefit of individuals. The purpose of the arrangement here was to adopt a convenient, inexpensive, employee-managed method of holding and investing the funds to be contributed by the taxpayer. The trust corpus could of course be the fund so contributed, and the cestuis, the employees participating in the plan. The broad powers of the corporation must be interpreted in the light of the agreement in accordance with which it was established. Each year, when the payments were made <em>by the </em>taxpayer <em>to </em>the corporation, the amounts paid were at once apportioned and credited to the individual employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>We think this corporate arrangement comes within what Congress had in mind in using the term \u201ctrust\u201d in Section 165 (a). Admittedly, the contributions were deductible under the law as it existed before the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1942. That Act was primarily designed \u201cto insure that stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing plans are operated for the welfare of employees in general, and to prevent the trust device from being used for the benefit of shareholders, officials, or highly-paid employees,\u201d and to insure that \u201cit shall be impossible for any part of the corpus or income to be used for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the employees.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIn the interest of clarification and administration of the tax laws,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it was decided to permit no deductions for pension or profit-sharing funds except under Section 23(p) of the Code. To \u201cafford time for existing deferred-payment plans and trusts and- contracts to be amended so as to satisfy the requirements of section 165(a),\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a grace period was allowed. With the new requirements of Section 165 (a) taxpayer complied, and it obtained the Commissioner\u2019s approval before the expiration of the grace period. This, we think, carries out the intent of Congress to continue allowing deduction of the contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The other requirements of Section 165 (a) have been met by the taxpayer. It is arguable, to be sure, that, as the corporation had power to invest in the taxpayer\u2019s stock and there was testimony that,.at least in 1941, it was intended that the fund should be invested in its stock, the fund is not \u201cfor the exclusive benefit\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s employees. In fact, the fund was not so invested, but was (with the exception of one short-term interest-bearing loan to the taxpayer) invested in government bonds. The Commissioner has made no objection to the deduction on this ground, and has approved the amended plan, which confers equally broad investing powers on the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Nor is it any objection that the original plan was not formally approved by the Commissioner before deductions for contributions made in accordance with the plan were taken. It is now necessary, under sub-paragraph (3) (B) of Section 165(a), as amended in 1942, to obtain the Commissioner\u2019s approval of some profit-sharing plans. As that requirement was not in force when the plan was first adopted, it could not then apply; when the requirement of approval was put into effect by the Revenue Act of 1942, taxpayer was given a grace period, mentioned above, within which to amend its plan and comply, and within that grace period it did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AEO\"> \u00a7 165(a) of the Code provides:</p>\n<p id=\"APs\">\u201c(a) Exemption from tax.

R. C. \u00a7 165(a) (1) and (2), a necessary condition to its being granted grace for complying with the remaining requirements, (3)-(6), of that section under I. R. C. \u00a7 162(d). Among relevant considerations are, first, the form of the legal device actually employed and the intent behind that choice. Concededly a corporation was chosen instead of a trust, because, as is said, \u201cof the \u2018red tape\u2019 involved, the necessity of going \u2018through court,\u2019 and the fee expense\u201d of the latter. While substance should control, if clear, yet these matters tend to show what the substance was. And since the assigned reasons might well have been adduced for an opposite conclusion, namely in favor of a trust, we may look beyond them to other objectives actually subserved by the plan worked out. Second, the beneficiaries were only a limited group of the employees and the benefits to the employer were substantial. Only those employees who re-r mained with the employer for five years received any grants at all. Such grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>were not in cash, but only in stock of the new company, granted out of moneys paid in to it, in the event the employer\u2019s business was profitable. Actually no stock was ever issued. It was expected that the new company would buy stock of the employer; it had already loaned money to the latter. Far from being a strictly limited trust for certain beneficiaries, it was a business company designed to be and actually of mutual help and assistance to both employer and the (older) employees. Third, the control was such as to facilitate these mutual objectives. The three original incorporators remained as directors, choosing their own successors until stock might be issued; and if the original directors were no longer employed by the taxpayer, then it could appoint substitute directors from among its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Such factors as these show the close interconnection, if not the mutually helpful co-operation, of the two companies. They do not show a profit-sharing plan for \u201cthe exclusive benefit\u201d of the employees or one where no part of the trust can be diverted to purposes other than such exclusive benefit. I would affirm the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
