[the Club\u2019s] property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">A second set of ordinances, authorizing construction of the road (# 18-90) and the water main (# 19-90), were adopted on July 9, 1990. Both ordinances directed the City Manager \u201cto cause appraisals of the properties specially benefitted by the proposed public improvements to be made prior to the commencement of the construction of the improvements ... and, in addition, to cause appraisals to be made upon completion of the improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Upon completion of the projects\u2014the road and water main were completed, for costs said to be $24,060,725 and $946,-952.79, respectively\u2014public hearings were held on May 17 and June 21, 1993, with respect to the assessments to be levied in accordance with the ordinances of July 9,1990. By a third set of ordinances, adopted on September 27, 1993, the Mayor and Council \u201caccepted and approved\u201d the road and water main and \u201cfound and declared\u201d that they were \u201cof special benefit to ... properties shown on ... [an attached] list in the amounts assessed on said list\u201d, such amounts being, as to Woodmont, $2,943,000, as a result of the road (# 13-93), and $61,319.38, resulting from construction of the water main (# 14-93).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If paid with interest over a period of 20 years, as allowed by the ordinances, the Club\u2019s total obligations would be $5,212,297.27 and $108,601.71, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The parties\u2019 contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The Circuit Court synthesized the parties\u2019 contentions into 5 issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">1. Has the Club waived its right to complain about the special assessments because it made the first of 20 annual payments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">2. In determining the special benefit to the Club property, was the City correct in appraising the property at its highest and best use?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">3. Was the Club afforded due process in connection with the levy of special assessments against its property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">4. Has the Club met its burden of overcoming the presumption of validity attached to the City\u2019s actions in determining a special benefit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">5. Was the special assessment for the construction of a water transmission main valid?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">The Court directly addressed only the first two issues. The City\u2019s claim that payment of a portion of the special assessment precluded Woodmont\u2019s right to make any objection to the entire assessment process was found to be only \u201cpartially correct.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After extended discussion of the second question, it was squarely held that \u201cit was proper for the City to base its valuation of the special benefit on the properties\u2019 \u2018highest and best\u2019 use.\u201d The remaining matters were given shorter shrift: \u201cQuestions 3, 4 and 5 can be disposed of in short order ... [because] for the reasons set forth in the City\u2019s brief, the Club\u2019s contentions with respect to these questions are without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">For reasons hereafter stated, we agree with the lower court\u2019s conclusion that this appeal is not precluded by Woodmont's having paid installments of the assessments due under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>the ordinances<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and affirm its decision with respect to the second. In our view of the case, however, Woodmont\u2019s contention of denial of due process and the allied issue concerning the absence of any presumption to be accorded the City\u2019s action under that circumstance (the third and fourth questions framed, although not directly addressed below) have controlling merit and require reversal of the action of the Circuit Court. As this will involve further hearings and findings impossible to anticipate, we do not reach other, somewhat hyperbolic arguments here advanced by Woodmont\u2014principally, the supposed applicability of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Dolan v. City of Tigard, </em>512 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 2309, 129 L.Ed.2d 304 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Partial payment as affecting judicial review</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The City argued below that, as stated by the Circuit Court, \u201cthe Club\u2019s payment of a portion of the special assessments precluded it from challenging the assessments.\u201d As noted, the Court ruled that \u201cthe City\u2019s argument in this regard is partially correct\u201d, in that Woodmont was not entitled to a refund of amounts already paid, but \u201cThe simple fact of the matter is that ... [the remaining installments] have not been paid\u201d, and \u201cthere is simply a question of whether or not they should be paid.\u201d The City here narrows the scope of its original argument: \u201cThe Club is barred from recovering that portion of the special assessments it paid prior to taking this appeal\u201d\u2014a clear adoption of the finding below and recognition of the propriety of at least some judicial review.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">While we agree that judicial review is proper in this case, we should not be understood as endorsing the reasoning of the lower court. The case relied upon by it and the City is <em>Wash. Sub. Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. C.I. Mitchell &amp; Best Co., </em>303 Md. 544, 495 A.2d 30 (1985), where the Court stated \u201cthe Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>common law rule under which voluntary payments, made under a mistake of law, of taxes or other public charges are not recoverable\u201d by quoting (at 572, 495 A.2d 30) from <em>Apostol v. Anne Arundel </em>County, 288 Md. 667, 672, 421 A.2d 582 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">It is firmly established in this State that once a taxpayer voluntarily pays a tax or other governmental charge, under a mistake of law or under what he regards as an illegal imposition, no common law action lies for the recovery of the tax absent a special statutory provision sanctioning a refund. This is true even if payment is made under protest. Moreover, in these circumstances, no common law or declaratory judgment action lies to challenge the validity of a tax so paid. Where there is a special statutory provision sanctioning a refund, although no particular statutory remedy is provided, an action in assumpsit is available. However, where there is statutory authorization for a refund and a special statutory remedy set forth, that remedy is exclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4V\">As made clear elsewhere in the <em>Mitchell &amp; Best </em>opinion, the rule is not without exception, albeit such is extremely limited and involves factual determination of whether the payment was made under compulsion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We need not explore the matter here. The rule involved is one which involves the existence of a cause of action for recovery of money which has been paid. This is a proceeding for judicial review of the action taken at the hearings in May and June 1993. Neither the Circuit Court (Rule 7-209) nor this Court (Rule 8-604) has any authority to direct repayment in this proceeding, and we have not been asked to do so. Matters relating to repayment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>will await determination in such proper proceeding as may hereafter be instituted for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Presumption of correctness</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Here, the City first asks that we spare ourselves the exercise of undertaking more than superficial examination of its action, since it claims that \u201cthe method by which a governmental entity assesses and apportions the cost for a public improvement is a legislative question subject only to constitutional limitations, and the exercise of such legislative discretion will not be reviewed by courts when there appears to be neither fraud nor mistake\u201d, citing, <em>inter alia, Williams v. Anne Arundel County, </em>334 Md. 109, 123, 638 A.2d 74 (1994) where it is said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">The legislative judgment in levying benefit assessments ... is entitled to the highest deference. \u2018In the absence of a showing of arbitrary action and plain abuse of power,\u2019 the legislative body\u2019s decision is final.... \u2018And an assessment, if imposed according to a definite and just plan, will not be disturbed where neither fraud nor mistake appears\u2019 ... [citations omitted].<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Numerous other cases (including virtually all of those hereafter cited) are to the same effect. There is even a more specific \u201cgeneral rule that the law presumes that street paving, which facilitates travel and affords better access to abutting property, confers a special benefit upon the abutting property owner as well as a general benefit upon the community.\u201d <em>Maryland &amp; Pa.R.R. v. Nice, </em>185 Md. 429, 433, 45 A.2d 109 (1945), and <em>Silver Spring Memorial Post No. 2562, V.F.W. v. Montgomery County, </em>207 Md. 442, 452, 115 A.2d 249 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>These rules plainly presuppose at least facial regularity of the proceedings in which the action was taken\u2014at the very least, \u201cabsence of a showing of arbitrary action and plain abuse of power.\u201d It would be a strange doctrine indeed which would attach a presumption of correctness to a determination of any kind which was reached through an improper process. The rule must be, and is, as quite simply stated in <em>Town of Somerset v. Montgomery County Bd. of Appeals, </em>245 Md. 52, 67, 225 A.2d 294 (1966), that where a procedural right has been properly asserted, \u201cits denial vitiated the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Plainly, any presumption of regularity must give way if, in fact, a procedural right of due process has been denied. It is undisputed in this appeal that Woodmont was categorically denied the right to cross-examine the experts whose testimony formed the sole basis for the action taken by the City.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Whether that right is one required by procedural due process, as vigorously urged by Woodmont and denied by the lower court and the City, presents a justiciable issue of the highest order.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The hearing requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The City next seeks to avoid Woodmont\u2019s due process claims on the theory that \u201cthe hearings held in May and June 1993 were purely gratuitous\u201d and thus no more was required than what the Council chose to allow. The predicate is that \u201cThe only hearings required by the City Charter were the 1990 hearings preceding the legislative determination to au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>thorize construction of the two public improvements as special assessment projects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">It is difficult to imagine that the City has fully explored the ramifications of this proposition, since to do so would in our opinion call into serious question the ability of the City to make any assessment at all in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Article XI of the Charter of the City of Rockville (\u201cSpecial Assessments\u201d) contains a single section, divided into paragraphs (a) through (h). Subsection (a) authorizes the Council \u201cto grade, construct, reconstruct, pave, provide street lighting, landscaping, or other amenities, for ... any street ... public highway, or any public right-of-way or property ... to such extent and of such materials and in such manner as shall be provided by ordinance and to purchase, contract to purchase, lay or contract to lay water mains and truck and lateral sewers____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">In order to \u201cpay the costs of all such work\u201d, it is also empowered to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">... assess said cost, or any part thereof, against the abutting property and any other properties benefited thereby <em>as hereinafter provided in this section </em>[emphasis supplied].<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Subsection (c) contains express procedures, and an express timetable to be followed by the Council:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\"><em>Before entering upon the construction of any work or improvement specified herein, </em>the Council shall by ordinance designate [1] the location, extent and kind of work or improvement proposed to be done or made, [2] the kind of materials to be used, [3] the estimated cost of the improve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>ment and [4] the real property which will be benefited thereby and which it is proposed to assess to pay all or any part of the cost thereof ... [emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The same paragraph requires the Council to \u201cfix a time and place when and where the owner or owners of the property to be so assessed therefor can be heard in reference thereto\u201d, in connection with which the Council is to \u201cserve\u201d by mail written notice upon such property owners and to publish notice twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Subsection (d) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">If after the hearing the Council shall be of the opinion that the public health, safety, welfare, comfort, or convenience requires the work or improvement proposed to be done or made, it shall provide by ordinance for the same and may charge the expense thereof or any part of such expense against the property which it shall find to be specially benefited thereby according to the front foot rule of apportionment or some other equitable basis as may be determined by it....<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">[\u00b6] The Council shall also provide in said ordinance the time and terms upon which payment of said assessments for said work and improvements shall be made by said property owners, the rate of interest, if any, that shall be charged upon deferred payments and shall provide penalties for failure to pay any deferred payment when due. The ordinance may temporarily exempt certain properties from the assessment, in whole or in part, until a date certain and/or the occasion of a specific event or change in circumstance, provided that such exemption is made pursuant to legislation duly adopted by the Council which shall provide for, among other things, certain criteria and/or standards for properties entitled to an exemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">The same subsection (d) provides that \u201cAn assessment <em>made pursuant to this Article </em>shall be a lien upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>property against which it is charged superior to all other liens from the date of the approval of such assessment by the Council [emphasis supplied].\u201d The subsection concludes with the establishment of an \u201cappeal ... to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County ... according to the Maryland Rules set forth in Title 7\u201d and \u201c[a]ppeals of the decision or judgment of the Circuit Court ... to the Court ofd [sic] Special Appeals and Court of Appeals as prescribed by the Maryland Rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">From the above review, it is manifest that the Charter makes detailed and specific requirements for the establishment of special assessments for public improvements of the type here involved.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although all of those requirements are to be fulfilled \u201cBefore entering upon the construction of any work or improvement\u201d, the City did not follow that timetable.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The initial set of 1990 ordinances, those of May 14, represented no more than formal expression of intention to consider the improvements and establishment of the hearings required by the Charter. They also contained, as to each of the projects, \u201cTotal estimated project cost\u201d,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and \u201cEstimated assessable costs.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The preambles of the second set of ordinances (# 18-90 and # 19-90, adopted July 9, 1990),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> adopted after the first hearing, contain more substance in their recitation that in conformity -with Article XI of the Charter, (1) the Council had in the May ordinance (# 12-90) established \u201cthe location, extent and kind of work or improvements proposed to be done, the kind of materials to be used, the estimated cost of the improvements, the real property which will be specially benefited thereby, and which is proposed to be assessed, and fixed a time and place when and where the owners thereof could be heard in reference thereto\u201d; (2) notice had been given by mail and publication, as required by subsection (c); (3) the hearing had been held; and (4) the first requirement of subsection (d) by the Council\u2019s determination that \u201cthe work or improvements ... is required for the public health, safety or comfort of the City of Rockville\u201d had been fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The first section of this second set of ordinances formally \u201cordained\u201d that \u201cthe public improvements ... are ... authorized to be done and constructed.\u201d A second, and last, section directed the City Manager \u201cto cause appraisals of the properties specially benefited by the proposed public improvement to be made prior to the commencement of the construction of the improvements ... and, in addition, to cause appraisals to be made upon completion of the improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">What both preambles and operative provisions of the 1990 ordinances did <em>not </em>do<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> was to embody what was permissive under subsection (d): assessment \u201cagainst the property <em>which it shall find to be specially benefited </em>thereby according <em>to the </em>front foot rule of apportionment or some other equitable basis.\u201d The ordinances thus state the matter of assessment in the future tense and contain absolutely no current findings with regard to \u201cproperty ... specially benefited.\u201d As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>they did not address the specific direction as to what \u201cthe Council <em>shall </em>also provide in said ordinance\u201d in the event that assessment was made, namely, \u201cthe time and terms upon which payment of said assessments for said work and improvements shall be made by said property owners, the rate of interest, if any, that shall be charged upon deferred payments and ... penalties for failure to pay any deferred payment when due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The fact of the matter is that all of the requirements of Article XI of the Charter were not addressed, much less resolved in 1990. We are offered, and have found, no other authority for the assessments here considered. As a result, if we are to follow the invitation of the City to find that only those proceedings were required, we should be forced to conclude that the City had no authority thereafter to make an assessment. By the express language of Article XI, all proceedings which it authorized were to be taken \u201cBefore entering upon the construction of any work or improvement.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The City\u2019s suggestion is even at odds with its own conduct in this proceeding. The penultimate and final sentences of subsection (d) of Article XI of the Charter provide for an \u201cappeal\u201d by \u201cAny person aggrieved by the levy of a special assessment <em>in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\u201d </em>As recognized by the Circuit Court, this is the only provision which authorizes judicial review of any action taken by the City with respect to a special assessment. Again, we have found no other. If the view of the City were correct, and the only relevant proceedings were those in 1990, Woodmont\u2019s 1993 application for judicial review would have been untimely (Rule 7-203) and the proper course for the City would have been to seek dismissal, yet that is not even suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Manifestly, although such seems to be at odds with a strict interpretation of the language of the Charter requiring all action to be taken \u201cBefore entering upon the construction of any work or improvement\u201d, what the Council intended to do\u2014 and what it actually did\u2014was postpone matters relating to actual assessment, even including the final designation of those to be assessed, until after the work was completed. As flatly recognized in the ordinances adopted in 1993 which are here involved, the 1990 ordinances had only <em>\u201cproposed </em>that the costs of said construction be assessed against the properties specially benefited thereby\u201d, but without the slightest inference that the question had been addressed at the 1990 hearing even to that limited extent, much less that any firm determination had been made that such \u201cspecial benefit\u201d actually existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The wisdom of that course was borne out by subsequent events. As ultimately reflected in the 1993 ordinances, the total project cost for the road was $24,060,725\u2014some $11,071,-086 less than projected in 1990\u2014and $946,952 for the water main\u2014$336,329 less than the original estimate.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The final tabulation was, if anything, more dramatic with regard to assessment. Assessment was ultimately made against only 3 of the 5 property owners identified in 1990. In terms of dollars, the total assessment for the road was to be $6,100,816 (less than 20% of the $31,131,811 estimated in 1990) and $154,295 for the water main (instead of the estimated $363,-299).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">It is more than plain to us that the 1993 ordinances and the hearings upon which they were based were the culmination of the process authorized by Article XI of the Charter and an indispensable part of any special assessment. To say otherwise would render meaningless the opportunity for hearing afforded persons proposed to be assessed, both because the persons to be assessed and the amounts of the assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>were at best tentative and at worst inaccurate, and still more because the predicates for actual assessment <em>(i.e. </em>the amounts by which specific properties derived special benefit) were not addressed at all until 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">We cannot by any stretch of the imagination adopt the City\u2019s view that the 1993 hearings were unnecessary. If Woodmont was entitled to notice and hearing, as it plainly is under Article XI of the Charter, it certainly was not afforded such in the 1990 proceedings. More to the point, and disastrous from the City\u2019s standpoint, if the 1990 proceedings are to be viewed as fulfillment of the Charter requirements, the process was at an end without the City having made any assessment at all. As a result, a proper characterization of the 1993 hearings would not be \u201cgratuitous\u201d, but \u201cillegal\u201d, with the inescapable characterization of the assessments based upon them being \u201cvoid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">For its part, Woodmont has made no suggestion that the 1993 proceedings themselves were unauthorized, and in the absence of such we adopt, at least for purposes of this case, the view that all parties, recognizing the common sense proposition that a final determination of assessment could not be accurately made until the project was completed, viewed the provision requiring all action to be taken prior to commencement of the project as merely directory and bifurcated the required proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">We therefore reject the City\u2019s notion that the 1993 hearings were not part and parcel of what was required of the Council under Article XI of its Charter and turn to the matter of Woodmont\u2019s right to cross-examination at those hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The right of cross-examination</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">We turn at last to the true substance of this appeal. The City\u2019s ultimate contention is that, even if the hearings themselves were required, cross-examination was not, because the Council was engaged in what it regards as \u201cthe uniquely legislative determination as to the appropriate apportionment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>of the funding of a public improvement between the public treasury and benefiting property owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The seminal case of <em>Hyson v. Montgomery County Council, </em>242 Md. <em>55, 217 </em>A.2d <em>578 </em>(1966), involved rezoning of a parcel of land by a county council and failure to allow cross-examination of witnesses. As here, it was argued that the council was acting in a legislative, or quasi-legislative,.capacity in which cross-examination was not required as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The Court recognized the constitutional distinction between executive, legislative and judicial functions, but also noted within the latter two a further division: \u201cfunctions, when they are not purely and completely judicial or legislative in nature, but have qualities or incidents resembling them, are referred to as quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative\u201d (242 Md. at 61, 217 A.2d 578). In that regard, \u201cthe <em>actual acts </em>of zoning and rezoning are legislative or quasi-legislative in nature [emphasis supplied]\u201d, but those \u201cactual acts\u201d are distinguishable from the procedures upon which they are based (at 62, 217 A.2d 578):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0hL\">Up to the present time, no one has been able to delineate, with precision and accuracy, an exact formula for determining the line of demarcation between the differences between legislative and judicial functions. These differences, on occasions, are particularly difficult of determination when mixed, blended, or combined functions are given, and exercised by, the same official, board, or agency ... which is frequently the case____ And when the same official, board, or agency performs, in one proceedings, quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative functions, it is misleading and inaccurate to characterize the whole proceedings as judicial or legislative in nature [citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">In cases where a body, is required \u201cto resolve disputed questions of adjudicative facts (as contradistinguished from legislative facts or judicial action)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> concerning particular par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>ties ... it necessarily was performing a quasi-judicial function, even though its final action, in granting or denying the reclassification which was required to be based upon its findings of adjudicative facts, was quasi-legislative in character\u201d (242 Md. at 64-65, 217 A.2d 578).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">After review of a host of Maryland precedent, the Court had \u201cno hesitancy in holding that the statutes and regulations [involved in that case] ... conferred quasi-judicial functions upon the Council in making its determination of facts at the hearing.\u201d On the matter of the right of cross-examination under that situation, it was squarely held that \u201cThe authorities seem to be in accord that when an administrative board or agency is required to hold a public hearing and to decide disputed adjudicative facts based upon evidence produced and a record made, that a reasonable right of cross-examination must be allowed the parties\u201d (242 Md. at 67, 217 A.2d 578).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">This Court recognized in <em>Tran v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>69 Md.App. 256, 268, 517 A.2d 113 (1986), that under these circumstances, cross-examination involves \u201ca right, recognized and enforced in all courts wherein truth and justice is the objective, for the parties to the cause to be confronted with the witnesses against them, and an opportunity to test the correctness or truthfulness of the evidence by cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The rule has been recognized and applied in, among other cases, <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 7-8, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981); <em>Dickinson-Tidewater v. Supervisor, </em>273 Md. 245, 254, 329 A.2d 18 (1974); <em>Rogers v.

Mont. Co., supra, </em>252 Md. at 725, 251 A.2d 357; <em>Gibson v. Talbot County, supra, </em>250 Md. at 298-299, 242 A.2d 137; <em>Tron v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>69 Md.App. at 266, 517 A.2d 113.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But, nothing in the cases suggests that it may be completely denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>We do note that an important qualification to the rule is that, as stated in <em>Hyson, </em>the right must be asserted in timely fashion. <em>Schultz v. Pritts, supra, </em>291 Md. at 7-8, 432 A.2d 1319; <em>Bayer v. Siskind, supra, </em>247 Md. at 123-124, 230 A.2d 316; <em>Gibson v.

P.S.C., supra, </em>33 Md.App. at 435, 365 A.2d 314. However, it is abundantly clear that such request was made in this case;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and the City does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The character of the 1993 hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The City\u2019s position is that <em>Hyson </em>and its progeny have no application, for the reason that the 1993 hearings regarding special assessment involved a \u201cuniquely legislative determination as to the appropriate apportionment of the funding of a public improvement between the public treasury and benefit-ting property owners.\u201d Primary reliance is placed upon <em>Mont. Co. v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>280 Md. 686, 376 A.2d 483 (1977), <em>cert. den. </em>434 U.S. 1067, 98 S.Ct. 1245, 55 L.Ed.2d 769 (1978), which the City reads as holding that \u201cNo right of cross-examination exists at <em>legislative </em>hearings, and it is not a prerequisite to legislative findings, even when the \u2018decision may dramatically affect an individual.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Importantly, in that case, which involved consideration of a sectional zoning plan, the Court held (280 Md. at 712, 376 A.2d 483):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">That the effect of a zoning authority\u2019s decision may dramatically affect an individual is not determinative of the difference between adjudicative and legislative facts; rather, <em>it is the nature of the decision\u2019s fact-finding process, not the ultimate effect of the decision, </em>that determines the party\u2019s right to an adjudicatory hearing. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The Court found that \u201cA real distinction exists between piecemeal [as in <em>Hyson </em>] and comprehensive rezoning hearings; it lies in the nature of the basic function being performed by the zoning authority in each case\u201d and concluded that, in the latter \u201ccomprehensive\u201d type (280 Md. at 712-714, 376 A.2d 483):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">The procedure is fundamentally legislative and no significant quasi-judicial function is involved. That the Council determined the zoning for each specific property owned by the various appellees and considered the impact of traffic and environmental constraints upon the scale of permissible development within the CBD does not alter the basic fact that the issues for determination were legislative, not adjudicative, and did not require a judicial or trial-type hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">A similar distinction has been recognized in other contexts. <em>Union Investors v. Montgomery County, </em>244 Md. 585, 588-589, 224 A.2d 453 (1966), proceedings for the sale of surplus public property are legislative; <em>Albert v. Pub. Serv. Commission, </em>209 Md. 27, 120 A.2d 346 (1956), no hearing required in proceedings involving issuance of taxicab permits, although the requirement does exist in proceedings for the suspension or revocation of a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In essence, the relevant inquiry here is thus the same as that in <em>Hyson: </em>\u201cwe must determine what is the type of public hearing which the Council was required to afford, and the nature of the functions exercised by the Council at such hearing, before the formal and final act of reclassifying the property or the denial of the application\u201d and, if \u201cthe Council was considering and determining these adjudicative facts concerning particular parties, it necessarily was performing a quasi-judicial function, even though its final action, in granting or denying the reclassification which was required to be based upon its findings of adjudicative facts, was quasi-legislative in character\u201d (242 Md. at 64-65, 217 A.2d 578).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Great assistance lies in the recognized distinction between property taxes and special assessments. As recently noted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Williams v. Anne Arundel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>County, </em>334 Md. 109, 118, 638 A.2d 74 (1994), quoting <em>Gould v. Baltimore, </em>59 Md. 378, 380 (1883):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">The right to make ... [special] assessments is undoubtedly an exercise of the taxing power, but an assessment thus made differs from a general tax levied for State and city purposes. The latter is a tax imposed on all persons within the territorial limits according to the value of their property, in consideration of the protection, which the government affords alike to all. A local assessment, on the other hand, is a tax levied occasionally as may be required upon a limited class of persons interested in local improvement, and who are presumed to be benefited by the improvement over and above the ordinary benefit which the community in general derive from the expenditure of the money. In the payment of the assessment thus made, the adjacent owner is supposed to be compensated by the enhanced value of his property, arising from the improvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">As stated by this Court, in <em>Baltimore County v. Batza, </em>67 Md.App. 282, 303, 507 A.2d 216 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">Because in each such case [involving special assessments] there is necessarily some benefit to the public at large from the improvement, the question arises as to how much of the cost may properly be laid against the specially benefited property (or, conversely, how much of the cost must be borne by the public from general tax revenues). In this regard, the case law makes two things quite clear. To remain true to the underlying justification for special benefit assessments and to avoid an unconstitutional confiscation, (1) there must be some reasonable basis for concluding that the property subject to the special assessment will, indeed, be specially benefited by the improvement over and above the general benefit to the public, and (2) the amount of special assessment may not exceed a reasonable estimate of the special benefit conferred upon the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">A third determination to be made is \u201cthat the proportion of the cost to be recovered through special assessments is fairly commensurate with the ratio that the total special benefit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>that property bears to the general public benefit\u201d (67 McLApp. at 304, 507 A.2d 216).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The determinations made at the 1993 Woodmont hearings concerned no public aspects, such as whether the already-completed projects represented legitimate public purposes or whether abutting property owners should be required to contribute to their cost. The inquiry, specific to each piece of private property sought to be assessed, was twofold. In the first instance, there must be \u201cspecial benefit to the properties to be assessed <em>over and above that accruing to the public </em>[emphasis supplied].\u201d <em>Tyler v. Baltimore County, </em>251 Md. 420, 426, 247 A.2d 704 (1968); <em>V.F.W. v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>207 Md. at 448, 115 A.2d 249. As recognized in <em>Maryland &amp; Pa. R.R. v. Nice, supra, </em>185 Md. at 433, 45 A.2d 109, \u201cIf the Legislature, or municipal officials acting as agents of the State, could impose upon certain private property the cost of a public improvement regardless of any special benefit accruing to the owner from such improvement, the guaranties for the protection of private property would be seriously impaired.\u201d Thus, if no special benefit exists as to that specific property, no special assessment may be made. <em>Leonardo v. County Comm., </em>214 Md. 287, 309, 134 A.2d 284 (1957); <em>United R. &amp; E. Co. v. M. &amp; C.C. of Balto., </em>127 Md. 660, 96 A. 880; <em>Baltimore v. Scharf, </em>54 Md. 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The second inquiry, involving \u201ca reasonable estimate of the special benefit conferred upon the property\u201d, at least in this instance, involved even more specific inquiry. In accordance with the July 1990 ordinances, <em>after </em>completion of the projects, appraisal was made \u201cof the properties specially benefited ... prior to the commencement of the construction of the improvements ... and, in addition ... upon completion of the improvements.\u201d This approach is to be distinguished from that involved when, as in <em>Somerset Co. Sanit. v. Chamberlin, </em>254 Md. 630, 255 A.2d 290 (1969), a legislative body determines the overall assessable benefit to <em>all </em>properties and apportions that general appraisal on the basis of front footage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>In such event (254 Md. at 638, 255 A.2d 290, quoting <em>Dinneen v. Rider, </em>152 Md. 343, 361-362, 136 A. 754):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\">The justification for such a special assessment is the benefit to the property upon which the assessment is laid, and it is presumed that the Legislature considered the purposes for which it authorized the assessment not only a public one, but also one which would be of special benefit to the property upon which the assessment is to be laid in proportion to its frontage. As this special benefit is particular to every property abutting on the improvement, it thereby becomes also general in its extent by reason of the universality of its operation upon all the properties in the area [a]ffected. Because of this double aspect, the common benefit may be measured by the standard of the number of feet fronting upon the improvement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\"><em>See also, Montgomery Co. Council v. Summers, </em>274 Md. 110, 112, 332 A.2d 646 (1975); <em>Leonardo v. County Comm., supra, </em>214 Md. at 307, 134 A.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Article XI of the Rockville Charter did in fact authorize assessment \u201caccording to the front foot rule of apportionment or some other equitable basis.\u201d Here, the Council did not adopt the former course, but proceeded to determine benefit on a property-by-property basis. In a word, the inquiry of the Council was not general, but property-specific. In terms of <em>Hyson, </em>and even <em>Mont. Co. v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop </em>upon which the City relies, it meets all tests of what is regarded as \u201cpiecemeal\u201d rather than comprehensive, for the very reason that \u201cin comprehensive rezoning proceedings the Council does not consider and determine adjudicative facts concerning particular parties within the contemplation of our decision in <em>Hyson </em>\u201d (280 Md. at 712, 376 A.2d 483):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">A real distinction exists between piecemeal and comprehensive rezoning hearings; it lies in the nature of the basic function being performed by the zoning authority in each case. In a local map amendment proceeding in Montgomery County, the zoning authority considers a single piece of property and must make a factual determination, based on evidence of record, as to whether there has been a change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the physical character of the neighborhood where the property is located or a mistake was made in the original zoning. Piecemeal rezoning hearings, therefore, contemplate an adversary or trial-type procedure to resolve adjudicative facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As5J\">[\u00b6] A different determinative standard applies where the Council is considering a comprehensive rezoning by the sectional map amendment process; there its focus is not on a single piece of property, but rather on a considerable number of properties as they relate to each other and to the surrounding area. The Council in that instance considers whether the comprehensive rezoning takes into account future public needs and purposes; whether it is designed to provide an adequate potential for orderly growth in the future and to satisfy local and regional needs; and ultimately whether it bears the requisite relationship to the public health, safety and general welfare. As appellants correctly point out, these are not adjudicative determinations affecting one property owned by one person, but instead are classically legislative determinations designed to affect local and regional needs and all property owners \"within the planning area. The procedure is fundamentally legislative and no significant quasi-judicial function is involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The only matter involved in the hearings before the Rockville Council which came even close to general or public policy concern was the benefit which the City would ultimately derive from the assessment to be made against the Woodmont property. We have no hesitation in viewing the 1993 hearings as being adjudicative to the same degree as those involved in <em>Hyson.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Actual prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The City is nearer, but still wide of, the mark in its ultimate argument that \u201cThe Club was given a full and complete opportunity to comment on, and criticize the appraisals prepared for the City and to present its own appraisals, both in writing and through live testimony of three expert witnesses who testified for over an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">As expounded by the City, the proposition seems to have two dimensions, the first being that the participation which the Council did allow Woodmont was the functional equivalent of cross-examination.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In <em>Birckhead v. Board of Co. Comm\u2019rs, supra, </em>260 Md. at 600, 273 A.2d 133, the Court of Appeals noted that \u201cOrdinarily, the opportunity of denial and rebuttal is not a substitute for cross-examination.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Earlier, Judge Oppenheimer very specifically stated for the Court of Appeals in <em>Town of Somerset v. Board, supra, </em>245 Md. at 65, 225 A.2d 294, that \u201cthe rule that in an adversary proceeding before an administrative board, the opportunity for reasonable cross-examination is a basic right.\u201d Even the right to call persons as adverse witnesses provides no adequate substitute (245 Md. at 66, 225 A.2d 294):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">The right of a party to call hostile witnesses as its own after the testimony of the adverse party has been complet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ed, in our opinion, is not the substantial equivalent of the right to cross-examine immediately after the direct testimony of the witness has been concluded. The techniques of advocacy so essential to our system of justice are largely stultified when resort must be had to such a cumbersome and delayed substitute for immediate and direct cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Perhaps sensing the weakness of the argument that what was allowed was sufficient substitute for cross-examination, the City wanly asserts that Woodmont has shown no prejudice.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Although no authority is cited for this proposition, it is true that in <em>Hyson, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals held that \u201calthough cross-examination should have been allowed if properly requested, the slight denial here (if it can properly be termed a denial under the circumstances) has not been shown to have prejudiced the protestants\u2019 cause\u201d (242 Md. at 71-72, 217 A.2d 578).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">However, as soon thereafter explained in <em>Town of Somerset v. Board, supra, </em>245 Md. at 66-67, 225 A.2d 294:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyS\">The appellants\u2019 contention that actual prejudice must be shown before denial of procedural due process can be established is without merit ... [citations omitted]. It would be a mockery of justice to hold that a person cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>complain of the denial of the right to cross-examine unless he can show what the result of the cross-examination would have been; that result is often as unexpected as it is revealing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">[\u00b6] Chief Judge Prescott\u2019s statement in <em>Hyson, </em>at 242 Md. 71-72, 217 A.2d 578, that, under the circumstances, any denial of the right of cross-examination \u2018has not been shown to have prejudiced the protestants\u2019 cause\u2019 is to be taken in the context of his finding that cross-examination, in effect, had been waived. There was no prejudice because there had not been, in substance, a denial of the right. In this case, the right had been vigorously and repeatedly asserted, and its denial vitiated the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Later cases do not retreat from this position. For example, in <em>Birckhead v. Board of Co. Comm\u2019rs, supra, </em>260 Md. at 600, 273 A.2d 133, it was held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">Ordinarily, the opportunity of denial and rebuttal is not a substitute for cross-examination but <em>in view of the peripheral and oblique nature and type of the information sought and received, </em>we find no deprivation of fundamental procedural rights in the Council\u2019s limiting the protestants to written rebuttal on the legislative aspects of the case. We think the \u2018basic rules of fairness\u2019 as to parties before the Council were observed ... and that there were preserved \u2018the fundamentals applicable to the decision of adjudicative facts.\u2019 [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Similarly, in <em>Rogers v. Radio Shack, supra, </em>271 Md. at 129, 314 A.2d 113, a report had been placed in the record following a hearing. The Court \u201cagree[d] ... that under the circumstances here, with no opportunity for cross-examination or rebuttal, fundamental fairness would preclude reliance upon the report by an administrative agency or a reviewing court\u201d, but found that \u201cneither the Board of Appeals nor the circuit court placed any weight upon the investigator\u2019s report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">In <em>Dickinson-Tidewater v. Supervisor, supra, </em>273 Md. at 254, 329 A.2d 18, it was held that \u201cWhere ... the facts upon which a witness relies for his expert opinion come as no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>surprise to the complaining parties, and, indeed, are actually presented by the latter in the first instance, absent any other basis for so contending, no violation of the basic rules of fairness is manifested\u201d, but it was also recognized that <em>\u201cextensive cross-examination which appellants were afforded </em>and exercised merely reinforces this conclusion [emphasis supplied].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Moreover, having reviewed the extensive record in this case, we would be hard pressed to conclude that actual prejudice was not present. Ultimately, the Council placed exclusive reliance upon its two appraisers, although its determination seems to involve something akin to no more than a flip of the coin. Woodmont presented substantial evidence which, if believed, indicated that such appraisals proceeded upon improper predicates or were otherwise flawed. This is the sort of material to which cross-examination may be especially effective. Judge Oppenheimer\u2019s characteristically wise observation bears repeating: the \u201cresult [of cross-examination] is often as unexpected as it is revealing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We hold that the denial of cross-examination at the hearings of May 17 and June 21, 1993, was fundamentally unfair and violative of Woodmont\u2019s right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Valuation based upon potential use</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Woodmont urges that \u201cSpecial assessments against country clubs must be based on country club use and not the hypothetical highest and best use of the property.\u201d As this will have direct effect upon any further assessment proceedings, we express our concurrence in the view of the lower court that the contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">We first observe that there is nothing inherently improper in basing special assessments upon \u201chighest and best use\u201d, even though that use may be merely potential. In <em>V.F.W. v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>an affiliate of the Veterans of Foreign Wars made the argument, not dissimilar to that of Woodmont here, that a certain 6-acre parcel was \u201c \u2018acreage\u2019 property, not lots in a subdivision ... [and] that any benefit to</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>its land could be realized only through a change of use of the land by its development as suburban lots, which possible use, it claims, is remote and speculative\u201d (207 Md. at 444, 115 A.2d 249).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Speaking for the Court, Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e noted that \u201cThe law is firmly established in Maryland that in order to justify a special assessment for a local improvement such as the paving of a street, there must be both a public purpose and a special benefit to the properties to be assessed over and above that accruing to the public\u201d and that \u201cThe difficulty of balancing the necessary public interest and the required special benefits to particular properties has often led to imposing a part of the cost on the community at large through general taxation and a part on properties specially benefited\u201d (207 Md. at 448, 115 A.2d 249).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The Court squarely held that the Post\u2019s contention that \u201cthe asserted enhancement in value could be realized only through abandoning the ... present use of the acreage and converting it into a suburban subdivision\u201d was beside the point. Quoting <em>Cons. G.E.L. &amp; P. Co. v. M. &amp; C.C. of Balto., </em>130 Md. 20, 99 A. 968 (1917), it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">It would be a very illogical rule which would require damages to be estimated with due regard to all the uses to which the land may be adapted, and would exclude from consideration all but its actual and present use for the purposes of the benefit assessment. The sole object of the inquiry, from either point of view, is to determine the comparative market values of the property before and after the appropriation of a part for the intended public use, and in ascertaining those values, with reference to either period, all the available uses of the land may properly be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>An \u201cobjection to the application of the front foot rule of assessment on the ground that its land is rural\u201d was found to be \u201creally a variation of the objection to considering the use of its land for any purpose other than that to which it is presently\u201d (at 450, 115 A.2d 249). A similar response was made under still more apposite circumstances in <em>Beauchamp v. Somerset County, </em>243 Md. 98, 103, 220 A.2d 135 (1966), to an argument that \u201cthe present assessment will force the conversion of its agricultural land to non-agricultural uses, which result, it asserts, is contrary to the legislative intent\u201d regarding agricultural uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We thus regard it as settled law that consideration of what was described in the <em>VFW </em>case as the \u201cmost valuable monetary use\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> of Woodmont\u2019s property was, in addition to being proper, under ordinary circumstances, legally required. Nor does the prior history of the Woodmont property suggest that contemplation of a more valuable use is either conjectural or even improbable.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">\u2018Country club\u2019 assessment</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Indeed, the City had no authority to exempt Woodmont\u2019s property from the special assessment. In <em>Church Home v. Baltimore, </em>178 Md. 326, 333, 13 A.2d 596 (1940), it was stated that \u201ca municipality has no power to exempt land and other property from special assessment. Where the General Assembly possesses such a power, the asserter of the exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>must show a clear and unambiguous legislative law in support of his contention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Woodmont finds not only permission, but controlling exemption in the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 8-212 <em>et seq. </em>of the Tax\u2014Property Article of the <em>Code</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which as recently noted in <em>State v. Burning Tree Club, Inc., </em>315 Md. 254, 258, 554 A.2d 366 (1989), \u201cauthorized the State to enter into agreements with private country clubs under which the clubs would maintain their land as open spaces in exchange for favorable assessment of those lands for property tax purposes.\u201d Woodmont, which has entered into such an agreement with the State,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> argues that this statutory scheme \u201ccontains both a positive mandate as to assessments for property tax purposes and a prohibition against valuation as other than a country club for any other purpose.\u201d This view of the statute is wholly unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">To begin with, as noted earlier, a recognized distinction exists between property taxes and special assessments. <em>Williams v. Anne Arundel County, supra, </em>334 Md. at 118, 638 A.2d 74. Although acknowledging the distinction, Woodmont erroneously asserts that \u201cnowhere in the statutory scheme providing for valuation, assessment and taxation of country clubs is there a limitation of its applicability to simply <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes.\u201d \u201cAssessment\u201d of real property is defined as \u201cthe adjusted value to which the <em>property tax </em>rate may be applied [emphasis supplied]\u201d (TP \u00a7 l-101(c)); and \u201c \u2018Property tax\u2019 means the property tax imposed by: (1) the State; (2) a county; or (3) a municipal corporation\u201d (TP \u00a7 1-101(aa)). When applied to a municipality such as Rockville, \u201cproperty tax ... means the tax on property authorized under \u00a7\u00a7 6-203 and 10-102 through 10-105 of this article,\u201d with the important exception that \u201c \u2018Municipal corporation property tax\u2019 does <em>not </em>include a tax imposed on property specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>benefited by local improvements [emphasis supplied]\u201d (TP \u00a7 l-101(t)).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">As Woodmont recognizes none of these provisions, it of course does not appreciate their profound effect upon the provisions to which it does refer. For example, it is correctly noted that TP \u00a7 8\u2014101(b)(4) recognizes \u201cland of a country club\u201d as a sub-class of real property; but, by subsection (a), such is \u201c[f]or assessment purposes.\u201d Since \u201cassessment\u201d is defined as exclusively applicable to \u201cproperty tax\u201d (which, in turn, expressly does not involve \u201ca tax imposed on property specifically benefited by local improvements\u201d), the classification has no meaning here. The short of the matter is that, as stated in the above quotation from <em>Burning Tree, </em>special country club valuation within the Tax\u2014Property Article relates solely to \u201cassessment ... for property tax purposes\u201d, as clearly distinguished from assessment for special benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">For reasons stated earlier, we conclude that the denial of Woodmont\u2019s right to cross-examination at the 1993 hearings of the Rockville Council represented denial of a fundamental right to due process of law and vitiates those proceedings and the ordinances upon which they were predicated. The judgment of the Circuit Court must therefore be reversed, with instructions to reverse the action of the City of Rockville in accordance with Rule 7-209 and remand the action for such proceedings as may be authorized by law and consistent with this opinion for determination and assessment of special benefit in connection with the construction of Wootton Parkway, the water main and other related facilities which were the subject of the ordinances # 13-93 and # 14-93 of the Mayor and Council of Rockville.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE ACTION OF THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF ROCKVILLE</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>AND REMAND THE ACTION TO THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL FOR WHATEVER FURTHER PROCEEDINGS MAY BE AUTHORIZED BY LAW AND CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-11\">.

The cases were consolidated for hearing in the Circuit Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">. Although couched as a dismissal, its effect was actually to deny a request by the City for a dismissal and to affirm the City's action in adopting the ordinances. <em>Compare, </em>Rule 7-209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\">. The new road also affected an area known as Tower Oaks (referred to as \u201ca mixed-use site\u201d) and several properties which fronted on Rock-ville Pike and were owned by D.F. Antonelli, Wintergreen Plaza Shopping Center and Congressional Oldsmobile. Ultimately, it was determined that the only properties \"specially benefitted\u201d were those of Woodmont, Antonelli and Tower Oaks. Antonelli and Tower Oaks entered into agreements acknowledging special benefit and establishing the amounts to be assessed. Only Woodmont is involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b728-10\">. 15.83 acres was necessary for the road. The additional 4.47 acres represented land which construction of the road would sever from the main tract owned by Woodmont.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\">. These included screening, fencing, protecting \u201cthe existing water source presently feeding the Seller\u2019s pond\", \u201c[plrotection of the existing water service line\u201d during construction and replacement of the latter \u201cwith an improved service line\u201d from a new main to be constructed in Wootton Parkway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">. The ordinances included assessments against the properties of Antonelli ($100,000, as to the road, and $18,750.06, as to the water main) and Tower Oaks ($3,057,816.69 road benefit and $74,226.93 for the main), as to both of which agreement had previously been reached. <em>See </em>footnote 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b730-12\">. The trial judge said, \"The simple fact of the matter is that they [the remaining \u00cd9 installments] have not been paid.

In the same vein, but more specifically, the City urges that \"a finding by a legislative body that special benefit exists is presumed to be correct and constitutional, \u2018even if the legislative body acted without any evidence at all. <em>Murphy v.
