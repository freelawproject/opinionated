Appellants argue that, on appeal from a hearing officer\u2019s decision on a development plan, the Board of Appeals must conduct a <em>de novo </em>hearing, or at a minimum, the Board must make an \u201cindependent evaluation\u201d of the record. Appellants also raise several procedural issues in which prejudice is alleged. We find no merit to their assertions and shall therefore affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The controversy originated in November 1992, when the Gaylord Brooks Realty Corporation held a concept plan conference for the development of a 15 lot residential subdivision of single family dwellings on 85 acres of land zoned RC-4. The proposed development, known as Magers Landing, is located on the north side of Monkton Road at its intersection with Piney Hill Road in northern Baltimore County. Pursuant to County Code, Title 26, Article 5, \u201cDevelopment Regulations\u201d, the concept plan was submitted to the community for comment at a Community Input Meeting. On December 31, 1992, a development plan for the project was filed in Baltimore County, comments were submitted by the appropriate agencies, and a revised development plan incorporating those comments was presented to a hearing officer on February 10, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">At the preliminary stage of the hearing, Gaylord Brooks Realty and the represented Baltimore County agencies re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>sponded that there were \u201cno unresolved comments or conditions which needed to be addressed.\u201d Appellants had various concerns about the proposed development, however. They complained that stormwater management had been waived by Baltimore County for the proposed project and that such a waiver would have a negative environmental impact on the surrounding properties and the nearby Gunpowder River, that the development \u201cinvolves\u201d buildings on Baltimore County\u2019s Landmarks Preservation List, that Baltimore County Code \u00a7 26-207 requires a hearing officer to refer such a plan to the Planning Board to consider the impact of the proposed development upon the landmark, and that the development plan was procedurally incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Following five full days of hearings, the hearing officer issued a 63-page detailed opinion and order approving the plan. A condition to the approval was that the case was to be \u201cremanded to the Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management (DEPRM) for their reconsideration of the appropriateness of the waiver of storm water management quantity which was granted to this Developer.\u201d DEPRM reaffirmed that waiver, following which the hearing officer entered an amended order approving the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Appellants appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Board of Appeals, which met to consider the appeal on October 6,1993. Regarding itself as sitting in an appellate capacity, the Board declined to take additional testimony and instead gave deference to the decision of the hearing officer, ultimately affirming his decision. Appellants then sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, which affirmed the decision of the Board of Appeals. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">We consider initially the standard of review that the Baltimore County Board of Appeals must apply when reviewing cases from a hearing officer. Appellants contend that, even though there are two strata of administrative hearings, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>County Board of Appeals must conduct hearings <em>de novo, </em>or in the alternative, must make, upon the hearing officer\u2019s record, its own \u201cindependent evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">In determining whether the County Board of Appeals must conduct a <em>de novo </em>hearing, we must first review the language of Md.Code, art. 25A, \u00a7 5(U), which authorizes chartered counties to establish a board of appeals and provides that such a board, if created, shall render a decision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201con petition by any interested person and after notice and opportunity for hearing <em>and on the basis of the record before the board, </em>of such of the following matters arising (either originally or on review of the action of an administrative officer or agency) under any law, ordinance, or regulation of, or subject to amendment or repeal by, the county council, as shall be specified from time to time by such local laws enacted under this subsection: An application for zoning variation or exception or amendment of a zoning ordinance map.... <em>Provided, that upon any decision by a county board of appeals it shall file an opinion which shall include a statement of the facts found and the grounds for its decision.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">(Emphasis added.) Baltimore County, a chartered county, availed itself of the power to create a board of appeals in \u00a7 601 of the Baltimore County Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Baltimore County Charter \u00a7 603 sets forth the rules of practice and procedure for the Board of Appeals. It states that \u201c[a]ll hearings held by the board shall be heard de novo, unless otherwise provided by legislative act of the County Council.\u201d The County Council did enact such legislation. County Code \u00a7 26-209, dealing specifically with appeals from a final action on a development plan, states in subsection (c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u201cThe board shall conduct a proceeding under this section by hearing oral argument of the parties and by receiving written briefs, if requested by any party to the proceeding. At the board\u2019s direction, additional evidence and testimony may be allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Section 26-209(c), therefore, expressly excludes appeals of this kind from the requirement of a <em>de novo </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Appellants argue that \u00a7 5(U) at least implicitly requires a <em>de novo </em>hearing before the Board of Appeals and that \u00a7 26-209(c), to the extent it permits something less, is invalid as being in conflict with the supervening State law. They point to two piovisions in \u00a7 5(U) to support that proposition\u2014 the statements that the Board is to render a decision \u201con the basis of the record before the board\u201d and that the Board must file an opinion including a \u201cstatement of the facts found and the grounds for its decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We noted in <em>General Motors Corp. v. Bark, </em>79 Md.App. 68, 79, 555 A.2d 542 (1989), that \u201c[a] true trial <em>de novo, </em>of course, puts all parties back at \u2018square one\u2019 to begin again as if the adjudication appealed from had never occurred.\u201d We see nothing in \u00a7 5(U) requiring that approach\u2014of essentially disregarding the full evidentiary hearing conducted by a hearing officer and trying the whole case anew, and we are aware of no appellate holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The reference to the decision being based on the record before the board is somewhat ambiguous, but where the evidentiary record made before the hearing officer is, in fact, before the Board, a decision based on that record can be viewed as being based on the record before the Board. Indeed, the Court adopted essentially that approach in <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Crown Development, </em>328 Md. 303, 614 A.2d 553 (1992). The same argument made here was made in that case\u2014that \u00a7 603 of the County Charter, when combined with a county ordinance allowing the Board of Appeals to consider an appeal on the record, was in contravention of \u00a7 5(U)\u2014and it was rejected. The Court held that the procedure followed in the case\u2014considering the record made below with such additional evidence as the Board chose to allow\u2014was \u201cnot in conflict with express powers granted by the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316, 614 A.2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Having reached that conclusion based on the administrative structure and procedure then in effect, the Court noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the procedure had been changed to that now before us. It stated, however, at 317 n. 3, 614 A.2d 553:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">\u201cWe note in passing that the Baltimore County Council has significantly revamped the procedure for consideration of development plans. Under the revised procedure, interested persons may participate in a community input meeting, after which a hearing is held by a hearing officer. The decision of the hearing officer may be appealed to the Board of Appeals, <em>which may decide the case on the record made by the hearing officer or, in its discretion, may receive additional evidence. </em>A limited scope of review by the Board of Appeals is mandated. Bill No. 1-92, effective March 2, 1992.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">(Emphasis added.) We must assume that the Court of Appeals had a good reason for including that footnote, which was not necessary to resolve the case then before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Although a <em>de novo </em>hearing is clearly not required, the question remains whether the \u201climited scope of review\u201d that the <em>Crown </em>Court makes brief reference to requires an \u201cindependent evaluation\u201d of the record or permits the County Board of Appeals to apply a more deferential standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">We note that the Court of Appeals addressed a similar issue in <em>Board of Educ. of P.G. Co. v. Waeldner, </em>298 Md. 354, 470 A.2d 332 (1984). In <em>Waeldner, </em>the Court considered the standard of review to be applied by the State Board of Education in an appeal from a decision of the County Board of Education dismissing a tenured teacher. After first recognizing that the Administrative Procedure Act did not \u201cdelineate the applicable scope of review where one administrative agency is empowered to determine an \u2018appeal\u2019 from the decision of another administrative agency,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 361 n. 2, 470 A.2d 332, the Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u201cthe legislature did not intend that the State Board\u2019s review of the County Board\u2019s action in such cases would be restricted to mere determination on the record made before the County Board of whether there was competent and substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tial evidence to support that agency\u2019s factual determination. On the contrary, we think it evident from the statutory scheme of the Education Article, and the allocation of powers between the State and County Boards, that the legislature intended that the State Board would <em>exercise its independent judgment on the record before it </em>in determining whether disciplinary infractions, as charged, had been established....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See also, School Comm\u2019rs v. James, </em>96 Md.App. 401, 625 A.2d 361, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 382, 631 A.2d 452 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">There is a significant difference between the role of the State Board of Education <em>vis a vis </em>county boards and that of the Board of Appeals in reviewing development plans. As the <em>Waeldner </em>Court pointed out, the appellate review process of the State Board of Education is part of that Board\u2019s broad visitatorial power over the State public school system. Because it is quintessentially a policy-making body, its reviewing authority \u201cis not narrowly focused, as in judicial review of administrative agency decisions____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 470 A.2d 332. A county board of appeals is not intended to be that kind of policy-making body; at least with respect to reviewing development plans, it is not vested with broad visitatorial power over other county agencies, but acts rather as a review board, to assure that lower agency decisions are in conformance with law and are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Art. 25A, \u00a7 5(U) does require a county board of appeals \u201cto file an opinion which shall include a statement of the facts found and the grounds for its decision.\u201d Appellants interpret that statement to require, at a minimum, a county board of appeals to conduct an \u201cindependent evaluation\u201d of the record from a hearing officer and not simply act as an appellate body. We disagree. The language does not necessitate an \u201cindependent evaluation\u201d to be made. The legislature left the door open for chartered counties to enact their own standard of review for their boards of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>In that regard, County Code \u00a7 26-209(d)(3) provides that the Board may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">\u201cReverse or modify the decision if a finding, conclusion or decision of the hearing officer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">(a) Exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the hearing officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">(b) Results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">(c) Is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">(d) Is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">(e) Is arbitrary or capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The first three of these reasons involve errors of law, and, as to them, no deference is due to the hearing officer. The Board clearly must make its own independent evaluation. That is also true with respect to paragraph (e)\u2014whether the hearing officer\u2019s decision is arbitrary or capricious. When it comes to reviewing the factual basis for the hearing officer\u2019s decision, however, the standard is the traditional one of looking only to whether there is substantial evidence to support the findings. In that examination, the Board does <em>not </em>make independent evaluations, for to do so would require the Board to make credibility decisions without having heard the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">This is <em>not, </em>as appellants argue, inconsistent with art. 25, \u00a7 5(U). That section requires the Board to support its deci-. sion with specific written findings of fact and conclusions of law. \u201cThis requirement is in recognition of the fundamental right of a party to a proceeding before an administrative agency to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the agency in reaching its decision and to permit meaningful judicial review of those findings.\u201d <em>Harford County v. Preston, </em>322 Md. 493, 505, 588 A.2d 772 (1991). The Board can comply with that requirement by filing an opinion that includes the statement of the facts found and the grounds for its decision. One of the facts required to be found is that substantial evidence exists in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the record to support the findings of the hearing officer, and, upon that determination, the Board may affirm those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">In addition to the petition and its exhibits, the Board had before it all of the exhibits that were filed in the proceedings below and a copy of the testimony and the numerous comments given by the various County agencies. Although it gave deference to the hearing officer\u2019s determinations of credibility of the witnesses, the Board found that the decision to approve the plan was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence and that the hearing officer did not act in any arbitrary or capricious manner. As a result, the facts found by the hearing officer were adopted by the Board. Accordingly, the standard of review applied by the County Board of Appeals was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\n<em>TESTIMONY OF JAMES PATTON</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The issue of the waiver of stormwater management was clearly considered by the hearing officer. As part of the development plan\u2019s approval, the hearing officer required DEPRM to reassess the waiver of stormwater management. After DEPRM reaffirmed the waiver, the hearing officer issued an amended order approving the development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">James Patton, an engineer, testified for appellants before the hearing officer on the issue of the waiver of stormwater management. Subsequent to the hearing, Mr. Patton located a Baltimore County Soil Conservation report that recommended denial of the waiver, and he wished to testify with respect to that report before the Board of Appeals. Appellants argue that disallowing that testimony constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Section 26-209(c) provides the Board of Appeals with discretion to allow additional evidence into testimony. The Board of Appeals had a proffer as to what Mr. Patton\u2019s testimony would have been were he permitted to testify. Given the in-depth consideration of this issue by the hearing officer and the proffer before the Board of Appeals, it was within the Board\u2019s discretion to deny the request for additional testimony at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\n<em>LANDMARKS PRESERVATION LIST</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Baltimore County Code, \u00a7 26-207(a)(3) requires a hearing officer to refer a development plan to a Planning Board when \u201c[t]he plan involves a building, structure or site included on the landmarks preservation commission preliminary or final list or is located within a Baltimore County historic district.\u201d Although the development plan is not located within a Baltimore County historic district, appellants argue that the development plan \u201cinvolves\u201d landmark buildings because such structures are nearby to the Magers Landing site.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The term \u201cinvolves\u201d is not defined in BCZR. When a term is not specifically defined, it \u201cshall have the ordinarily accepted definition as set forth in the most recent edition of Websters Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged.\u201d BCZR, \u00a7 101. Websters defines the term \u201cinvolves\u201d as follows: \u201cto envelop\u201d, \u201cto draw in as a participant\u201d, \u201cto have within or part of itself\u2019, and \u201cto engross or occupy fully.\u201d In light of that definition, the hearing examiner considered whether the development plan \u201cinvolves\u201d such a building. There was competent evidence before the hearing officer that the plan did not \u201cinvolve\u201d landmark buildings and that it was not necessary for the matter to be referred to the Planning Board. The Landmarks Preservation Commission itself did not recommend that this development be referred to the Planning Board. The hearing examiner stated in his opinion at 49:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u201cI do not find that this development involves such a building or structure. The fact that a historic structure or building might exist nearby, or, as Mr. Holzer argues in his Memorandum, within three miles of this site, is not a sufficient reason to refer the matter to the Planning Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We agree with the hearing officer and the County Board of Appeals that this matter did not \u201cinvolve\u201d such a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">\n<em>MASTER PLAN CONFLICT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Baltimore County Code, \u00a7 26-207(a) states that \u201c[t]he hearing officer shall refer the plan to the planning board in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the following circumstances: (1) The proposed plan conflicts with the master plan.... \u201d After reviewing the master plan and the proposed development plan, the hearing officer stated in his opinion at 51:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">\u201cThis development has been proposed pursuant to Bill No. 113-92 and according to all of the Baltimore County agencies who reviewed this project, satisfies the requirements and dictates of that Bill. I do not believe and will therefore find that a conflict does not occur with the Master Plan. This matter does not need to be referred to the Planning Board, pursuant to Section 26-207(a)(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">Again, I am not alone in my thinking. The Planning Office also was of the opinion that the matter did not need to be referred to the Planning Board. The Planning Office found that there was not a conflict with the Master Plan and that the matter did not need to be referred to the Planning Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">There was ample evidence before the hearing officer to substantiate his opinion. The development plan conforms to the principles and guidelines of the master plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\n<em>COMPLETENESS OF THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AmG\">Appellants provide numerous examples in which they claim that the development plan was procedurally incomplete and that the plan violated the guidelines of BCZR, \u00a7 1A03.5 which governs the performance standards for rural cluster developments in an RC^l zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Appellants allege, in part, that the ground water study was not proper, that the conservancy area was not in compliance, and that the soil evaluation was not appropriate. After reviewing BCZR, \u00a7 1A03.5 and the development plan, we conclude that the plan conformed to the standards of BCZR, \u00a7 1A03.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">With respect to the procedural completeness of the plan, the hearing officer made the following statement in his opinion at 37:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">\u201cThe hearing before me is not a hearing for the issuance of building permits for any of the proposed lots in Magers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Landing. The Development process must proceed in different steps and phases. Common sense dictates that it must proceed in this fashion. The Developer must have an approved plan to work with and to rely upon in order to proceed with his investment. Therefore, it is obvious that the various departments of Baltimore County must continue with their review of this plan as the developer gets closer to the actual construction phase. It is an ongoing process that continues past this Hearing Officer\u2019s hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We agree with this conclusion. The development process is indeed an \u201congoing process,\u201d and the hearing officer\u2019s affirmation of the plan is just the first step. This conclusion is supported by Baltimore County Code, \u00a7 26-206(Z), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">\u201cAll subsequent detailed development plans such as the final grading and sediment control plan, stormwater management plan, landscape plan, and record plat shall be sealed and certified as being in accordance with the approved development plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">For the above-mentioned reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
