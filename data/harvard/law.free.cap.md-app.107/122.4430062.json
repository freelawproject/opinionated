In this appeal, we consider whether \u00a7 10-708(k) of the Health-General Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland comports with the requirements for due process contained in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The statutory provision, on its face, imposes a forty-eight hour window in which to appeal to an administrative law judge decisions made by clinical review panels to forcibly medicate psychiatric patients. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The statute does not expressly take into account the patient\u2019s mental capacity to understand and exercise that right of appeal. Because we believe that the existing procedural protections contained in the statute as a whole, in light of the presumption of competency and the availability of alternative guardianship proceedings, adequately protect the patient\u2019s constitutional liberty interests, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<em>ISSUES PRESENTED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Appellant presents two issues for our consideration, which we have slightly re-phrased for analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">I. Does the failure by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to assess and account for an involuntarily committed psychiatric patient\u2019s mental capacity to understand and exercise her right to an administrative appeal from a decision by a clinical review panel to forcibly medicate her violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">II. Does the failure by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to assess and account for an involuntarily committed psychiatric patient\u2019s mental capacity to understand and exercise her right to an administrative appeal from a decision by a clinical review panel to forcibly medicate her violate the anti-discrimination prohibitions and reasonable accommodation obligations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and/or Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\n<em>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">On 23 July 1993, appellant was involuntarily retained at the Thomas B. Finan Center (\u201cFinan Center\u201d), a psychiatric institution operated by the Maryland State Department of Health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d) in Cumberland, Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant soon thereafter refused to take medication (Lithium and Thiothixene) that was prescribed for her by Dana Calder-one, M.D., her attending physician, to treat appellant\u2019s mental problem, diagnosed as \u201cschizoaffective disorder.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 27 July 1993, appellant received notice that a clinical review panel (\u201cpanel\u201d) would be convened on the following day to determine whether medication would be administered to her despite her refusal to take it willingly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After appellant received notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>that the panel would be assembling, but before the scheduled meeting, appellant consulted with her rights advisor,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. Delores Ortiz, who provided her with information and assistance regarding the upcoming meeting with the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The panel convened as scheduled on 28 July 1993, with appellant and her rights advisor, among others, present. The panel approved the use of forced medication to treat appellant\u2019s mental disorder for a period not to exceed ninety days, and documented its decision as required by HG \u00a7 10-708(i).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant received written notice of the panel\u2019s decision on Friday, 30 July 1993 at approximately 9:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">That same Friday, after receiving notice of the panel\u2019s decision, appellant met twice with Ms. Ortiz, who advised appellant of her statutory right to appeal the decision of the panel to an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and left with appellant the partially completed appeal form. All that remained to be done to the form in order to perfect an appeal was for appellant to affix her signature to it, write in the date and time, and deliver the form to any Finan Center staff person. Ms. Ortiz also left additional copies of the appeal form in appellant\u2019s chart and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the charting room. Moreover, Ms. Ortiz notified staff at the Finan Center, and particularly those assigned to appellant\u2019s cottage, that appellant may want to appeal the panel\u2019s decision over the upcoming weekend. Although appellant had previously appealed at least one prior panel decision requiring her to submit to forced medication, and often initiated contact with an attorney at the Legal Aid Bureau office in Cumberland, she did not express ostensibly to anyone a desire that she wanted to appeal the panel\u2019s decision in this case on 30 July, 31 July, or on 1 August 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The forty-eight hour deadline for taking an administrative appeal, provided by HG \u00a7 10-708(k)(l), <em>supra, </em>n. 6, expired on 1 August 1993 at approximately 9:30 a.m. Thereafter, on 2 August 1993, after another meeting with her rights advisor, in which appellant made no outward expression of a desire to appeal, medication was administered to appellant, pursuant to the panel\u2019s decision, at approximately 10:00 a.m. Later on 2 August 1993, at approximately 3:50 p.m., roughly thirty hours past the statutory deadline, appellant tendered a hand written letter to Finan Center staff, indicating that she wanted to appeal the panel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Appellee, DHMH, filed with the OAH a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s appeal on the ground that it was not timely filed. The assigned ALJ held an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss at the Finan Center on 13 August 1993. At that hearing, appellant was represented by an attorney from the Legal Aid Bureau who was familiar with her background and current predicament. On 22 October 1993, the ALJ issued her written decision and order dismissing appellant\u2019s appeal, finding generally that (1) appellant was properly advised of her appeal rights and otherwise had the assistance required by law of her rights advisor; (2) appellant had timely filed an appeal on at least one prior occasion, but did not do so in the present case; and (3) that she was \u201cnot persuaded that [\u00a7 10-708 was] unconstitutional nor [was she] persuaded that the statute was applied [to appellant] in an unconstitutional man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ner.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Appellant timely sought judicial review of the decision of the ALJ by the Circuit Court for Allegany County on 4 November 1993, pursuant to HG \u00a7 10-708(0(1). Appellant persuaded the circuit court, over appellee\u2019s objection, not to employ the statutorily provided expedited appeal proceedings under HG \u00a7 10-708(Z )(4), which would have required a decision by the circuit court within seven days, but rather to proceed under the more relaxed time provisions of Maryland Rule 7-201, <em>et seq. </em>This decision enabled appellant to prosecute <em>Beeman I </em>on the faster track before having to move forward on the instant appeal. Oral argument was held on the instant appeal on 8 July 1994. The court took the matter under advisement following the hearing. While the matter was pending <em>sub curia, </em>on 18 August 1994, after having received the full course of treatment approved by the panel, appellant was discharged from the Finan Center. On 8 December 1994, the circuit court issued its written opinion and order affirming the decision of the ALJ. Appellee has moved to dismiss the instant appeal as moot. Additional facts will be supplied as necessary in our discussion of the issues we address.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\n<em>MOOTNESS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Appellee contends that the issues raised by appellant in this appeal are moot because the clinical review panel\u2019s decision approving the forced medication of appellant, on which this appeal is based, expired approximately on 28 October 1993, and any reversal of the ALJ\u2019s dismissal of appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>lant\u2019s appeal and remand for a hearing on the merits would be meaningless. Thus, appellee asserts that the instant appeal should be dismissed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Attorney Gen. v. Anne Arundel Cty. Sch. Bus, </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">A question is moot if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Furthermore, \u201ccourts of appeal \u2018do not sit to give opinions on abstract propositions or moot questions; appeals which present nothing else for decision are dismissed as a matter of course.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beeman I, supra, </em>105 Md.App. at 157, 658 A.2d 1172 (quoting <em>In re Riddlemoser, </em>317 Md. 496, 502, 564 A.2d 812 (1989)). We agree with appellee that the question of whether appellant\u2019s appeal to the OAH should have been dismissed is moot because, no matter how we would resolve the question, it would be impossible for us to provide an effective legal remedy for appellant when she has already been medicated pursuant to the 28 July 1993 panel decision and subsequently released from the Finan Center. The fact that the issues are moot, however, does not preclude <em>per se </em>our consideration of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Although the instances in which courts will depart \u201cfrom the general rule and practice of not deciding academic questions\u201d are rare, they have been articulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMP\">[I]f the public interest clearly will be hurt if the question is not immediately decided, if the matter involved is likely to recur frequently, and its recurrence will involve a relationship between government and its citizens, or a duty of government, and upon any recurrence, the same difficulty which prevented the appeal at hand from being heard in time is likely again to prevent a decision, then the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>may find justification for deciding the issues raised by a question which has become moot, particularly if all these factors concur with sufficient weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em>Mercy Hosp., Inc. v. Jackson, </em>306 Md. 556, 562-63, 510 A.2d 562 (1986) (quoting <em>Lloyd v. Supervisors of Elections, </em>206 Md. 36, 43, 111 A.2d 379 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">When applying the standard expressed in <em>Lloyd </em>to the questions presented in the instant case, we conclude that our review and resolution of issue I, subject to our discussion in n. 13 and n. 15, <em>infra, </em>is appropriate. The forcible administration of medication to patients confined in state hospitals undoubtedly concerns \u201ca relationship between the government and its citizens.\u201d <em>Beeman I, supra, </em>105 Md.App. at 158, 658 A.2d 1172. Similarly, we are convinced that ensuring that forced medication procedures are conducted in concordance with constitutional due process principles is a \u201cmatter of important public concern.\u201d <em>See Williams v. Wilzack, </em>319 Md. 485, 573 A.2d 809 (1990) (holding that previous version of HG \u00a7 10-708 violated due process rights of patients, discussed <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Additionally, the situation involved here is likely to recur as to appellant and others similarly situated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The parties do not seriously dispute that appellant\u2019s schizoaffective disorder is generally resistant to treatment, depending, <em>inter alia, </em>on the regularity with which she takes her medicine. The record also reflects that appellant has habitually refused to take her prescribed medicine voluntarily in the past, requiring repeated involuntary admissions to the Finan Center, thus perpetuating the issues raised here. <em>See Beeman I, supra, </em>105 Md.App. at 152, 658 A.2d 1172. Moreover, while not part of the record in this case, statistics compiled by DHMH in its evaluation reports on clinical review panels contained in the statute\u2019s legislative history indicate that, in fiscal years 1992, 1993, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>1994, clinical review panels convened in Mental Hygiene Administration (\u201cMHA\u201d) facilities approved forced medication in 175 cases per year, from which 73 appeals were taken annually to the OAH, on average.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These numbers are certainly large enough to convince us that the potential for recurrence of the issues raised here with respect to the exercise of appeal rights is of substantial magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Lastly, because forced medication decisions are only valid for ninety days from their date of issuance, HG \u00a7 10-708(m), \u201ceven an expedited appeal is not sufficiently swift to assure review of an order authorizing forced administration of anti-psychotic medications.\u201d <em>Beeman I, supra, </em>105 Md.App. at 159, 658 A.2d 1172. Therefore, upon subsequent recurrences of the issues properly presented in this case, because of inherent time constraints, the same difficulty that rendered the present appeal moot would also prevent later cases from being reviewed ordinarily. Accordingly, being satisfied that the <em>Lloyd </em>factors \u201cconcur with sufficient weight,\u201d we shall address the merits of appellant\u2019s case as properly raised on this record by issue I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Before we begin our examination of the disputed issues, we note the scope of review we shall apply. The scope of review on appeal to this court is substantially that of the circuit court\u2014we must review the administrative decision itself. <em>Beeman I, supra, </em>105 Md.App. at 154, 658 A.2d 1172 (citing <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elect. Co., </em>273 Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691 (1974)) (other citations omitted). The decision of the ALJ in the instant case constituted a final decision for judicial review purposes under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), codified at Md. State Gov\u2019t Code Ann. (\u201cSG\u201d) \u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>HG \u00a7 10-708(k)(9). Pursuant to the APA, whether the reviewing court is a circuit court or an appellate court, <em>Kohli v. LOOC, Inc., </em>103 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>694, 708, 654 A.2d 922 (1995) (citing <em>Fort Washington Care Ctr. v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>80 Md. App. 205, 213, 560 A.2d 613 (1989)), it may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">(1) remand the case for farther proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">(in) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">(iv) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\">(v) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">SG \u00a7 10-222(h) (Supp.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"A2M\">Although the primary thrust of appellant\u2019s contentions of error put forth in this appeal is constitutional in nature, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s administrative appeal should be dismissed was also dependent on her factual findings. A distinction is drawn in the scope of review depending upon whether the court is reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact as opposed to purely legal conclusions. \u201cTo the extent the issues on appeal turn on the correctness of an agency\u2019s findings of fact, such findings must be reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Department of Human Resources v. Thompson, </em>103 Md.App. 175, 190, 652 A.2d 1183 (1995) (citing <em>State Election Bd. v. Billhimer, </em>314 Md. 46, 58-59, 548 A.2d 819 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1007, 109 S.Ct. 1644, 104 L.Ed.2d 159 (1989)). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Department of Public Safety, </em>330 Md. 187, 213, 623 A.2d 198 (1993) (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978)). In utilizing the substantial evidence test, an appellate court does not substitute its judgment, even on the question of the appropriate inference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>be drawn from the evidence, for that of the agency. <em>E.g., Liberty Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 442, 624 A.2d 941 (1993) (and cases cited therein). Rather, the test is a deferential one, requiring restrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the factual conclusions of the agency that are adequately supported by the record. <em>Billhimer, supra, </em>314 Md. at 58, 548 A.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">A different, more expansive standard applies to purely legal conclusions, i.e., \u201cwhere the agency\u2019s decision is predicated solely upon an error of law, no deference is appropriate and the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Kohli, supra, </em>103 Md.App. at 711, 654 A.2d 922 (citing <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>308 Md. 370, 378-79, 519 A.2d 1277 (1987)); <em>see, e.g., Liberty Nursing, supra, </em>330 Md. at 443, 624 A.2d 941 (citing <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 837, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985)). Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion regarding the impact of appellant\u2019s constitutional due process challenge will not be given the same deference in our analysis as her fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\n<em>STATUTORY BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In 1990, the Court of Appeals, in <em>Williams v. Wilzack, supra, </em>declared the prior version of HG \u00a7 10-708 unconstitutional because it contravened procedural due process protections of both the state and federal constitutions. The specific due process requirements, mandated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Washington v. Harper, </em>494 U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990), that the <em>Williams </em>court indicated the prior statute lacked were: (1) \u201cadvance notice of the proceedings before the clinical review panel;\u201d (2) the right of the patient<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cto be present\u201d when the panel convened; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u201cto present evidence^ (4) ] to cross-examine witnesses[; (5) ] to have the assistance of an advisor who understands the psychiatric issues involved[;] and [ (6) ] to obtain judicial review of an adverse panel decision before its implementation.\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>319 Md. at 509, 573 A.2d 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">After <em>Williams </em>invalidated HG \u00a7 10-708, psychiatric facilities in Maryland were not able to administer antipsychotic medication involuntarily to mental patients who refused it unless a court declared the patient incompetent and the appointed guardian approved the administration of the medicine. <em>See </em>Bill Analysis of H.B. 588 (1991). In response to <em>Williams, </em>a Mental Hygiene Administration task force, consisting of mental health consumers, advocates, attorneys, doctors, and state officials, was assembled to draft proposed legislation, which was later enacted by the Maryland General Assembly in 1991 as the successor statute to the invalidated HG \u00a7 10-708. The revised statute provided for enlarged procedural safeguards purportedly in order to comport with the due process requirements as defined by caselaw.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, the 1991 revision of the statute included a \u201csunset provision,\u201d i.e., the statute would expire on its own terms two years from its effective date of 1 July 1991. The new statute also directed that an evaluation report recommending either reestablishment or termination of the revised statute was to be prepared by DHMH and submitted to the Governor and the General Assembly by \u201cthe end of 1 January 1993.\u201d Ch. 385, \u00a7 2 (Acts of 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">During the 1993 legislative session, DHMH submitted its evaluation report recommending reestablishment of the revised HG \u00a7 10-708. The constituency that was represented on the original task force, augmented by the Legal Aid Bureau, Inc., commented on this proposal. The Maryland Disability Law Center and the Legal Aid Bureau, Inc., concerned generally with a patient\u2019s competency to understand the process, recommended that the statute be further revised, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>inter alia, </em>to require a clinical review panel, before it decided to order forced medication, essentially to determine whether the individual lacked the capacity to make or communicate responsible or reasonable decisions concerning mental health treatment or other personal matters. DHMH opposed such an amendment because, absent specific instances of \u201cmiscarriages of justice\u201d under the present statute, it \u201cwould place additional burdens, in terms of both time and money, on providers.\u201d The legislature did not include the proposed amendments from these advocacy groups in the adopted bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The expiration period of the statute was thereafter extended until 1 July 1995, with another evaluation report being required in January of 1995. Ch. 135 \u00a7 1 (Acts of 1993). DHMH submitted another evaluation report, upon which the task force constituency again commented, for the 1995 legislative session, at which the statute was further extended until 1 July 1999, with another evaluation report being due at the end of 1 January 1999. Ch. 266 (Acts of 1995). Concerning the 1995 session proposal, the Maryland Disability Law Center advocated, once again without avail, the need to include a provision requiring the review panel to determine, concurrently with any decision to force medication, the competency of the patient to make or communicate reasonable decisions concerning his or her treatment. Additionally, another patient advocacy group, On Our Own of Maryland, Inc., unsuccessfully proposed a mandate that legal counsel be provided for a patient at the time the panel convenes.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Having considered the history of the statute, we turn now to address the contentions of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\n<em>DUE PROCESS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Appellant contends that the application of the forty-eight hour appeal period provided in HG \u00a7 10-708(k)(l) to her in this case, without assessing or accounting for her mental capacity to understand and exercise her appeal rights during that period, violated her due process rights under the Four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>teenth Amendment or Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Essentially, according to appellant, in order for the statute to withstand constitutional scrutiny, it must be construed as requiring a determination of the patient\u2019s mental competency to understand his or her administrative appeal rights concurrent with notice being given to the patient of the clinical review panel\u2019s decision to medicate forcibly. Appellant submits that, if it is determined that the patient lacks the mental capacity to understand his or her right of appeal at that time, the appeal should be automatically docketed, and the matter should proceed to the ALJ. Alternatively, appellant argues that if the appeal is filed late, as it was iri the instant case, the matter should also proceed to the ALJ as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>matter of course for a determination of whether the time limit should be waived because of the patient\u2019s lack of capacity to understand and exercise the right of appeal during the forty-eight hour period. Thus, she continues, since the ALJ in this case only determined whether the requirements of the statute were adhered to by DHMH and whether appellant noted her appeal within the forty-eight hour period, and not whether appellant was mentally competent to understand and act on her administrative appellate rights, her constitutional rights were thereby infringed. Although appellant has only preserved, on this record, an \u201cas applied\u201d due process challenge <em>(see </em>n. 13, supra), her contention presents us with the opportunity to determine whether HG \u00a7 10-708, revised in response to <em>Williams v. Wilzack, supra, </em>comports with due process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that additional protections are not required to be judicially engrafted to the already hybridized vine and protecting leaves of the statute as currently codified in order to save it from the constitutional phylloxera infestation identified by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">As a threshold matter, we note that the due process clauses of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution have the same meaning. <em>Pitsenberger v.

We also acknowledge that legislative acts are presumed to be constitutional, and that a person challenging a statute has the burden of affirmatively establishing its invalidity. <em>Cider Barrel Mobile Home Court v.

We believe that she has a significant constitutional liberty interest in being free from the arbitrary and capricious administration of such medicines.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Riggins v. Nevada, </em>504 U.S. 127, 112 S.Ct. 1810, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992); <em>Washington v. Harper, supra, </em>494 U.S. 210, 221-22, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 1036-37, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990); <em>United States v.

On the contrary, due process is flexible and calls only for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>E.g., Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n v. Castrenze, </em>335 Md. 284, 299, 643 A.2d 412 (1994) (citing <em>Department of Transp. v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 416, 474 A.2d 191 (1984)). In <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), the United States Supreme Court formulated a balancing test that it continues to employ in evaluating due process questions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>[O]ur prior decisions indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 334-35, 96 S.Ct. at 903. The parties agree that this is the balancing test to be employed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The first <em>Mathews </em>factor, the nature of the private interest affected, was discussed above as being a significant right. Nevertheless, as was recognized in <em>Charters, supra, </em>constitutional interests retained by involuntarily committed individuals \u201cmust yield to the legitimate government interests that are incidental to the basis for the legal institutionalization, and are only afforded protection against arbitrary and capricious government action.\u201d <em>Charters, supra, </em>863 F.2d at 305 (citations omitted). Appellant was involuntarily retained at the Finan Center because she needed mental health treatment. <em>See </em>HG \u00a7\u00a7 10-613 to 10-633 (describing the criteria and procedures for involuntary admissions). Thus, the governmental interest in providing appellant with the mental health care that she required must also be considered alongside appellant\u2019s interest in being free from arbitrary and capricious government action.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The second factor in the <em>Mathews </em>balancing test is really the main focus of the constitutional questions raised on this appeal. This is especially so because the record of appellant\u2019s case, as opposed to the legislative history of the statute, is completely devoid of any empirical data that could be used to formulate an argument one way or the other on the final factor, i.e., the fiscal or administrative burdens that the additional procedures requested by appellant would place upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>State.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The second factor looks first at the risk of an erroneous deprivation of appellant\u2019s constitutional interests through the existing procedures. Without considering the due process safeguards afforded to appellant relating to her involuntary admission to the Finan Center, but focusing solely on the forced medication at issue, the following procedural protections are provided by the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">(1) Medication cannot be administered to a patient in a non-emergency situation, unless the patient is hospitalized involuntarily and the medication is approved by a clinical review panel, HG \u00a7 10\u2014708(b), and in any event, medication cannot be involuntarily administered for a period of longer than 90 days, without another panel being convened and approving a renewal. HG \u00a7 10-708(m);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">(2) Notice of the panel must be given to the patient and the lay advisor at least 24 hours prior to the convening of the panel. HG \u00a7 10-708(d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">(3) The notice provided must include the date, time, location, and purpose of the panel, and must also describe the following rights of the patient:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">(a) the right to attend the meeting of the panel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">(b) to present information to the panel, including witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">(c) to ask questions of any person presenting information to the panel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">(d) to request assistance from a lay advisor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>(e) to be informed of their diagnosis and an explanation of the clinical need for the medication, including potential side affects, and the material risks and benefits of taking or refusing the medicine. HG \u00a7 10-708(e);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">(4) Once a decision has been made by the panel to medicate, pursuant to the contours set forth in HG \u00a7 10\u2014708(g) and (h), it must be documented with notice given to the patient of his or her right to request a hearing under HG \u00a7 10-708(k), his or her right to counsel, and the name, address, and telephone number of the State protection and advocacy agency and the Lawyer referral service. HG \u00a7 10\u2014708(i);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">(5) The patient is entitled to the benefit of the lay advisor, who, after the panel has approved the medication, shall promptly inform the patient of his or her right to appeal under subsection (k), insure that the patient can access a telephone, and notify the appropriate personnel if the patient desires to appeal. HG \u00a7 10-708(j);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">(6) The patient has the right, within forty-eight hours of receipt of the decision by the panel to appeal the decision to an administrative law judge, with the administration of medicine being stayed during that forty-eight hour period, or, if a hearing is requested, the stay continues until the administrative decision is issued. HG \u00a7 10-708(k); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">(7) The patient is given the further right to expedited judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision on the record to the circuit court within fourteen days of the administrative decision. HG \u00a7 10-708(Z).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In comparing the aforementioned protections with the deficiencies of the prior statute enunciated in <em>Williams v. Wilzack, </em>discussed in the Statutory Background section, <em>supra, </em>we conclude that the present statute satisfies constitutional due process requirements. All of the prior defects brought to light in <em>Williams </em>have been cured, and additional safeguards have been added by the legislature in the revised statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Furthermore, with respect to appellant\u2019s specific assertion that a determination of a patient\u2019s mental capacity to understand and exercise appeal rights is constitutionally re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>quired, we must examine the statute in relation to other existing law. As was recognized in <em>Williams, </em>the statute, in its entirety, is a narrow legislative exception to the common law rule that a physician cannot administer treatment of any kind to a patient without that patient\u2019s consent, absent emergency circumstances. <em>Williams, supra, </em>319 Md. at 494, 573 A.2d 809 (quoting <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, 439, 379 A.2d 1014 (1977)). The law of Maryland presumes that adults are competent to make their own informed decisions, and this presumption of competency does not disappear upon an involuntary admission to a mental health facility for psychiatric treatment, absent a proper determination otherwise. <em>See </em>HG \u00a7 5\u2014601(f) (\u201c \u2018Competent individual\u2019 means a person who is at least 18 years of age or who under \u00a7 20-102(a) of this article has the same capacity as an adult to consent to medical treatment and who has not been determined to be incapable of making an informed decision.\u201d); <em>see also, Wall v. Heller, </em>61 Md.App. 314, 326, 486 A.2d 764, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 297, 493 A.2d 350 (1985) (In the context of capacity to make a will, \u201cthe law presumes that every man is sane and has capacity to make a valid will.\u201d) (citations omitted); 60 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 208 (1975) (Mental patients retain their right to vote, provided they have not been declared judicially incompetent and have had a guardian appointed.); <em>Hill v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 98, 105, 369 A.2d 98 (1977) (Presumption of competency of accused to stand trial.). The legal distinction between competency or incompetency can be determined in a judicial forum, whether under Title 13 of the Estates and Trusts Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland or otherwise. There is no separate need for a specialized administrative competency determination, unless the legislature expresses a desire to carve a broader exception to the presumption of competency.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The inherent \u201csafety valve\u201d for those who lack the mental capacity to understand their right of appeal is to have their appointed guardian, or other person to whom they granted a limited durable power of attorney, make the appeal decision on their behalf. Accordingly, when HG \u00a7 10-708(k) is analyzed in <em>pari materia </em>with the rest of the statute, as well as the presumption of competency, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of appellant\u2019s right to be free from the arbitrary and capricious administration of antipsychotic medications within the existing procedural protections is not so great as to warrant our embrace of the relief sought in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The other portion of the second <em>Mathews </em>factor appraises the probable value, if any, that the procedures proposed by appellant would have in minimizing the risk of an erroneous deprivation of her rights. The determination of mental capacity that appellant seeks would be made at the time of receiving notice of the panel\u2019s decision. Counsel for appellant suggested at oral argument that the competency determination could be made by a \u201cmental health professional\u201d within the facility where the patient is retained. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that it was determined that the patient could not fully understand his or her right of appeal sufficient to enable him or her to decide properly whether to exercise it <em>vel non, </em>and yet he or she nevertheless received the automatic administrative appeal that appellant is urging this Court to grant, the administration of medicine and the rest of the therapeutic regimen would be stayed at least until the ALJ issued his or her decision. Moreover, it is doubtful that patients who cannot understand their right of appeal can effectively communicate with and provide assistance to their counsel before the ALJ, especially with at least a portion of their treatment plan placed on hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We are certainly not unmindful of the gravity of the personal liberty rights at stake in this case and of the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>administrative appeal, especially in terms of it being the gateway to judicial review of the panel\u2019s decision; however, we do not believe that the scope of due process requires the requested additional procedures. In the most basic analysis, in light of the existing presumption of competency and the availability of appointed guardians, the competency assessment that appellant requests is not an essential safeguard. The legislature may, in the future, deem such a procedure desirable, but such considerations as who should make the competency determination, at what point it should be made, whether it can be appealed, how long the right for the administrative appeal will remain open, and how much any additional hearings and subsequent judicial review will cost the State, particularly make these issues better suited to be resolved by the executive and legislative branches of government rather than by this Court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">As discussed above, no data has been presented properly to us in the record on the third <em>Mathews </em>factor sufficient to weigh it in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Being satisfied that the statute as written comports with due process concerns, we next review the administrative decision itself. Affording appropriate deference to the factual findings, we hold that they were based on substantial evidence. The record adequately supports the findings that: (1) appellant had appealed at least one panel decision before; (2) appellant had the assistance of a lay advisor who was familiar with psychiatric issues, clinical review panels, and the appeals process; (3) appellant had access to a telephone and had regularly initiated contact with her Legal Aid Bureau coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>sel;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and (4), despite being questioned several times by her rights advisor if she desired to appeal, appellant did not in any way indicate a desire to appeal during the forty-eight hours following the decision of the panel.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, the requirements of HG \u00a7 10-708(k) not having been met by appellant, we find no error by the ALJ in dismissing her appeal because it was untimely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">To the extent that appellant maintains that she was entitled to have her ability to appreciate and act on her appeal rights during the pertinent forty-eight hour period determined as a result of the proceeding before the ALJ, we hold that she had a full and fair opportunity to produce any evidence bearing on that issue, and that she availed herself of that opportunity. Her attorney called as witnesses Ms. Ortiz,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Dr. Calderone, and Ms. Beeman herself. DHMH, represented by an Assistant Attorney General, limited itself to cross-examination of appellant\u2019s witnesses and written affidavits of certain Finan Center staff. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Ms. Beeman\u2019s awareness of her appeal rights prior to and during the relevant forty-eight hour period was specifically explored. For example, during appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Ms. Ortiz, the following colloquies occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Q.

Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">Q. What was she like before she took the medication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">A.

When she was able to communicate, was she able to communicate meaningfully?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">A. At times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">Q. At times she was not able to communicate meaningfully, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">A. Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I\u2019m not with her all the time. When I was with her, she was able to understand and was able to use the phone and you know that. She called you all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">Q. Can you tell me\u2014in fact, she was not able to communicate meaningfully a lot of the time.

And were there times when she was logical or not acting during that period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">A. Well, it was just a short period that she refused medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">Q. And in fact on August 1st she cursed the nurse and she refused medication, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">A. Let me see. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">A fairly debatable issue was generated by the substantial evidence on the record thus developed as to whether this appellant, affected as she was by her mental disability, could not \"reasonably be expected to conform to the short 48-hour deadline for exercising the important right to appeal.\u201d The ALJ concluded from this that there was substantial evidence to conclude that appellant understood her appellate right and had the capacities, both mental and physical, to exercise it; in effect, the presumption of competency had not been overcome by appellant. We shall not disturb that conclusion on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Appellant also contends, in essence, that DHMH\u2019s rigid application of the forty-eight hour appeal deadline to Ms. Beeman in the present case, without making an assessment of her mental capacity to understand and exercise her appeal rights, discriminates against her because of her disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Appellant did not advance this argument in the administrative proceeding or at the circuit court, raising it for the first time before this Court and imploring us to decide the merits of this issue, using our discretionary power to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>unpreserved issues. We decline appellant\u2019s invitation to do so.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Maryland Rule 8-131(a) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The \u201cclear meaning\u201d of Rule 8\u2014131(a) \u201cis that no unpreserved appellate issue, other than jurisdiction, may serve as the reason for an appellate reversal.\u201d <em>Wieland v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 1, 34, 643 A.2d 446 (1994). The only circumstance in which the \u201cextraordinary but limited exception\u201d to the foreclosure of a reviewing court addressing an unpreserved issue is applicable occurs when the case is going to be remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, as there can be no remand in the present case because the questions raised are moot, the exception to the Rule does not apply, and we shall not decide this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">DECISION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ALLEGANY COUNTY AFFIRMING THE DISMISSAL OF APPELLANT\u2019S APPEAL IS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-5\">.

This was the sum of the ALJ's analysis or reasoning as to the constitutional challenge. Administrative proceedings may be the first forum in which constitutional challenges to statutes are permitted (even required, in certain situations) to be litigated, and in those circumstances, ALJ's should not simply \"blow by\u201d those issues because they are raised in am administrative, quasi-judicial, as opposed to a purely judicial, forum. <em>Insurance Commissioner v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, </em>339 Md. 596, 619, 622-24, 664 A.2d 862 (1995) (and cases cited therein).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\">. Our power to dismiss moot appeals is set forth in Md. Rule 8-602(a)(10).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\">. In reaching this conclusion, we did not rely on appellant\u2019s prior admission records at the Finan Center, which were not included in the record extract (because it was not in the record made before the ALJ), but was included by appellant in an appendix to her reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. <em>See </em>Bill Files for H.B. 482 (1995); and H.B. 170 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">. Both <em>Williams </em>and <em>Harper </em>dealt with the due process rights of a mentally ill prisoner to refuse medication, and those cases employ the term \"inmate\u201d as opposed to \u201cpatient,\u201d the latter of which is more applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. The procedural protections are discussed more thoroughly, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\">. Appellant only argued below that the statute was unconstitutional <em>as applied </em>to her because it did not afford her with <em>procedural </em>due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. She did not challenge the statute on its face, i.e., she did not contend that it was unconstitutional in every possible application. Likewise, appellant did not raise <em>substantive </em>due process issues below. Moreover, she did not assert her companion argument before the ALJ or the circuit court that Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights was also violated; however, as the meaning of both constitutional provisions is analogous, <em>see infra, </em>it does not affect our analysis, and we exercise our discretion to consider it. <em>See, e.g., Crown Oil v. Glen, </em>320 Md. 546, 561, 578 A.2d 1184 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In that same vein, appellant makes certain \"equitable tolling\" arguments under the umbrella of her due process argument. She states in n. 3 of her brief that \u201c[e]quitable tolling ... provides an alternative ground for reversing the Circuit Court\u2019s decision in the present case.\u201d As we are holding that due process, which incorporates the concept of fundamental fairness, <em>see, e.g., Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 559, 625 A.2d 914 (1993); <em>Meyers v. Montgomery County Police Dept., </em>96 Md.App. 668, 698, 626 A.2d 1010 (1993) (citations omitted), is not offended by the statute as currently codified, appellant\u2019s equitable tolling argument, even if specifically preserved below, would not serve as an independent ground of reversal because fairness is the platform on which the doctrine of equitable tolling rests. <em>See Nixon v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 485, 500-08, 625 A.2d 404, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 454, 632 A.2d 151 (1993) (Discussing the doctrine of equitable tolling as it relates to statutes of limitation in Maryland, and noting that \"Maryland has not expressly adopted the federal equitable tolling standard\u201d in the context of the Maryland Equal Pay Act.).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">We can appreciate that appellant is becoming more creative as this litigation (and from the resolution of <em>Beeman </em>/) proceeds. However, we will not allow appellant's arguments to grow and multiply on this appeal. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131, discussed in II, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">. <em>See Vavasori v.

The opinion nevertheless addressed broader issues concerning whether the statute, as codified, comported with due process concerns).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">. Appellant also argues that she has a \"fundamental right of bodily privacy against forced treatment with psychotropic drugs.\" In that we are reaching the procedural issues on the basis that there is a significant liberty interest raised, it is unnecessary for us to conclude that this specific right exists in this case, especially since it was not raised below. <em>See </em>n. 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\">. Appellee included in the appendix to its brief the affidavit of Ms. Paula Carolyn Bell, DHMH\u2019s Director of the Resident Grievance System, which contained certain selected statistics regarding the number of clinical review panels and the number of administrative appeals. This evidence was not, however, part of the record before the ALJ in this case, and we did not rely upon it. Just as appellant\u2019s effort to augment the record via the appendices to her brief was inappropriate, see n. 9, <em>supra, so </em>too was this inclusion by appellee. We also note in passing that the statistics selected by appellee (Fiscal Year 1995 in MHA inpatient facilities) were not representative of the data contained in the legislative history cataloging similar statistics for the three prior fiscal years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b172-4\">. As noted earlier, as part of the legislative history of HG \u00a7 10-708, though not explicitly made part of the record in this case, the Maryland Disability Law Center and the Legal Aid Bureau made proposals to the legislature in 1993 and in 1995 regarding certain competency determinations (although not specifically with respect to understanding the right to appeal), none of which were adopted. Moreover, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>legislative history also reveals, in the immediate <em>post-Williams </em>void, resort to <em>ad hoc </em>judicial determinations of competency was the chief, if not only, legal resort in forced medication cases. In today\u2019s post-<em>Williams </em>era, there is no reason to believe that such a venue is any less available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">. That is not to say, however, that if we had been presented with a proper record from which we could conclude that the statute, as written, violated appellant\u2019s due process rights, we would not declare it constitutionally invalid, and thus unenforceable against appellant. <em>See Williams v. Wilzack, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b175-5\">. Appellant did request that she be allowed to contact an attorney, Paul Sullivan, Esquire, concerning a house that she believed she owned. She made a telephone call to his office the morning of 2 August 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\">. Of the multiple contacts between Ms. Ortiz and appellant during the time period involved here, appellant\u2019s only reported response to a pertinent query\u2014whether appellant wanted assistance from the Legal Aid Bureau\u2014was \"what for, they never do anything\u2014-just talk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. Counsel for appellant at the ALJ's hearing initially announced her intent to call Ms. Ortiz as appellant\u2019s witness. When DHMH offered Ms. Ortiz\u2019s affidavit in evidence as part of its case-in-chief, appellant's counsel lodged a hearsay objection based on the availability of the live witness. To save time, counsel for DHMH called Ms. Ortiz as a witness. Thus, appellant, through a liberally allowed cross-examination, obtained from Ms. Ortiz what she had intended to obtain earlier through calling her as her own witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. Our decision not to review and resolve this issue is not inconsistent with our decision to consider appellant\u2019s argument under the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which was also not raised below. <em>See </em>n. 13, <em>supra. </em>The latter issue does not affect our review of one of the properly preserved issues, namely Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process, whereas resolution of the former is dependent on interpreting and applying an entirely separate body of federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
