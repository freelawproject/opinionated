Sweeney, made application to Montgomery County for \u201cservice related disability\u201d retirement benefits provided for County employees by \u00a7 33-43 of the Montgomery County Code (1984, as amended). The County\u2019s retirement system administrator (the Administrator) found that Mr. Sweeney was not disabled. Mr. Sweeney appealed the denial, and on December 13, 1990, hearing examiner Richard J. Sincoff conducted a hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">On January 14, 1991, Mr. Sincoff rendered a decision in which he found: 1) that Mr. Sweeney suffered a work-related disability due to an accident on December 10, 1986; 2) that as a result of the accident he suffered a 10 percent temporary-partial disability; and 3) that he should be re-evaluated in one year to determine whether his condition was permanent. Based on Mr. Sincoffs decision, the Administrator recommended to the County that Mr. Sweeney receive a \u201cTemporary-Partial Service Connected Disability Retirement pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ant to Section 33-43(e) [of the County Code] ... [and] in accordance with \u00a7 33-43(h)(2) partial benefits\u201d would be 25 percent of final earnings. The Administrator\u2019s recommendation was appealed by Mr. Sweeney to the Montgomery County Merit System Protection Board (the Board), which, on June 17, 1991, sustained the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Mr. Sweeney then appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The circuit court, on November 21, 1991, remanded the case to the Board for a <em>de novo </em>hearing on all issues. The Board, on March 4, 1993, held a second hearing. On June 21,1993, the Board issued a written decision in which it \u201creaffirm[ed] its decision of June 17, 1991,\u201d thereby sustaining the Administrator\u2019s decision. Mr. Sweeney again appealed to the circuit court. This time the circuit court affirmed the decision of the Board, and Mr. Sweeney noted a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Appellant, age 54, became employed as a Montgomery County firefighter in 1966. On December 10, 1986, he was helping to extinguish a fire when an oxygen cylinder exploded. The force of the explosion hurled him some 20 feet. He was taken to Holy Cross Hospital where his shoulder, neck, and back were x-rayed. The x-rays were negative, and he was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In February 1987, about seven weeks post accident, appellant returned to his job as a Master Firefighter/Rescuer. The job specifications for this position cover more than three pages, but in general, the job is frequently strenuous. A firefighter must be well-conditioned and capable of lifting equipment weighing at least 100 pounds. Some duties are more sedentary. For instance, a Master Firefighter/Rescuer\u2019s duties include: conducting in-service training and classroom instruction for firefighters in firefighting evolutions, hazardous materials, and apparatus practices; providing training and instruction in the use of fire/rescue equipment and apparatus; attending training sessions; studying and analyz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ing technical books and bulletins to assist in making recommendations for changes in existing programs and/or the development of new training programs; enforcing the County fire safety code and the State fire prevention code through inspections and testing; performing and leading personnel in the receipt of radio and telephone fire, rescue, and related calls; relaying emergency calls to the appropriate fire department, rescue squad, or other agencies; scheduling work assignments; and providing input to supervisors in evaluating the activities of personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">According to appellant, he returned to work even though he had significant and recurring physical problems while on duty. The main problems were intermittent blurry vision and pain in his neck, low back, and left shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">About the same time that he returned to work, appellant began a fifteen hour per week part-time job as a bus driver. He worked at this part-time job for approximately two and one-half years\u2014until September 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Appellant stopped working as a Master Firefighter/Rescuer on October 10, 1989. On his last day of work, he experienced pain in his back and legs and was placed on leave. He retired from the fire department on February 1, 1991. Upon retirement, appellant began a 20-30 hour per-week job driving a twenty-five passenger bus. As of the March 4, 1993 hearing before the Board, he still held that job.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The exact amount of time appellant missed from work prior to his retirement is not in the record. The record does show that he missed 130 hours in 1987, and an additional 130 hours between March and June 1988. A form dated June 9, 1989, which was considered by the Board, shows that he had lost no time from work due to illness or accident since his last annual physical,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that he had been taking no drugs or medication, and that he currently was not on restricted duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Mr. Sweeney testified before the Board, both in 1991 and 1993, that he did not believe that he could perform the duties of a Master Firefighter/Rescuer. He produced testimony and medical reports that, if believed, showed that as of the March 4, 1993 hearing he had constant pain in his lower back with radiating pain down the front of his thighs and intermittent tingling sensation in his right foot, which occasionally radiated up the back part of his right thigh and calf. He also had pain in his left shoulder. According to Mr. Sweeney\u2019s evidence, these physical problems were all caused by the December 10, 1986 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">When it rendered its June 21, 1993 decision, the Board had before it the reports of seven orthopedic surgeons (Harvey Mininberg, Eli Lippman, German Nader, Mark Rosenthall, Clifford Hinkes, E. Masoud Pour, and Erroll Bennett), two neurosurgeons (Mark Klein and Octavio Palanco), a neurologist (Brian Avin), and a family practitioner (Donald Frye). These experts evaluated Mr. Sweeney\u2019s physical condition, and to say the least, there was a wide range of opinions. For instance, Dr. Hinkes, in his last report, dated July 10, 1991, stated that he would recommend no \u201cfurther medical treatment for Mr. Sweeney\u201d because \u201che has exhausted all medical tests and treatment____\u201d Dr. Hinkes \u201cwould allow Mr. Sweeney to return to his old job as a fire fighter, full-time, full duty without restriction.\u201d Dr. Pour and Dr. Nader agreed with Dr. Hinkes. On the other hand, Dr. Rosenthall was of the view that Mr. Sweeney suffered from a herniated disc at the L-4-5 level due to the subject accident; that he would greatly benefit by surgery; but that even with surgery he would be \u201cpermanently disabled from functioning at his usual occupation as a firefighter in the future.\u201d Dr. Frye concurred with Dr. Rosenthall\u2019s opinion. Doctors Mininberg, Lippman, Klein, and Palanco all treated Mr. Sweeney and wrote reports that, broadly speaking, were more favorable to appellant\u2019s position than were the reports of Drs. Hinkes, Pour and Nader. In his last report, dated July 27, 1987, Dr. Mininberg opined that Mr. Sweeney had a chronic neck and low back problems; Dr. Lippman, in his report of October 30, 1987, said that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>findings in regard to Mr. Sweeney\u2019s low back problem were \u201cvery minimal in nature\u201d but that Mr. Sweeney had \u201csignificant findings\u201d in his neck and mid-back area (19)6% total impairment of the whole body); Dr. Klein in his report of November 2, 1989, noted that appellant had a bulging disc at the L 3 4 level and that he should not return to work as a firefighter; Dr. Palanco, in a report dated March 6, 1990, said that a myelogram showed a central disc herniation at L-4-5 and opined that he did not foresee any early resumption by Mr. Sweeney of his duties as a firefighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Dr. Bennett evaluated Mr. Sweeney at the request of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. His report was presented to the Board by the appellant. Dr. Bennett expressed an opinion in his report of October 8, 1991 that was somewhere between Dr. Hinkes\u2019s \u201cno disability\u2014no treatment needed\u201d view and Dr. Rosenthall\u2019s \u201cpermanent injury\u2014disc surgery needed\u201d opinion. Dr. Bennett\u2019s October 16, 1992 report, the most recent reviewed by the Board, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsM\">IMPRESSION: This is a rather involved and complex case. At the present time, the patient\u2019s level of activity is not prevented by his complaints. It is, perhaps, unlikely that even if he were to undergo a successful fusion, that he would be able to return to his former occupation. At the present time, a lot of his symptomatology and physical findings are the result of a muscular ligamentous limitations, secondary to chronic back pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient should recommence physical therapy and to be reevaluated at sometime when the therapist feels that he has reached maximum medical improvement. I feel the patient also needs to have a brace as this has been demonstrated to give him good relief of his symptoms. Further, I think reevaluation would be appropriate especially in view of the fact the patient has not reached maximum medical improvement at the present time and that he remains significantly partially disabled. I do not feel that it would be appropriate for this patient to undergo a spinal fusion at present. I think that his treating physician may want to review his condition 20 months after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the initial recommendation [of surgery] to see if any new findings are present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Besides the testimony of Mr. Sweeney and the medical reports of the eleven physicians mentioned above, the Board received in evidence at its March 4, 1993 hearing an Order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission of May 4, 1988. The Commission found that as a result of December 10, 1986, Mr. Sweeney suffered a <em>\u201cPERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY: 10% </em>under \u2018Other Cases\u2019 industrial loss of use of the body as a result of the injury to the neck (5%) and low back (5%).\u201d (Emphasis in the original.) Additionally, the Board had before it a transcript of Mr. Sweeney's testimony before Hearing Examiner Sincoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">On June 21, 1993, the Board issued a five-page opinion in which it accurately reviewed 1) the procedural history of this case, 2) the testimony of Mr. Sweeney, and 3) a substantial number, but not all, of the reports of the eleven physicians. Although the reports of the physicians showed that there were serious differences of medical opinion, the Board simply found that \u201c[t]here are conflicting medical reports as to the extent of [Mr. Sweeney\u2019s] injuries and whether surgery would correct the problem.\u201d The other findings of fact were that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">1. A review of the testimony as well as the exhibits fails to indicate that Mr. Sweeney has m\u00e9t evidentiary standards set forth in Section 33^3(e) of the Montgomery County Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">2. A review of the testimony indicates that Mr. Sweeney has not met the burden of proof under Sections 2A-8 &amp; 2A-10(b) of the Montgomery County Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>3. Mr. Sweeney did sustain a work-related back injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">4. Mr. Sweeney has been working regularly as a bus driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">5. Surgery was recommended to Mr. Sweeney by doctors Palanco, Rosenthall, and Frye, but Mr. Sweeney has refused to have the surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">6. Physical therapy was recommended to Mr. Sweeney in the latter part of 1989 and as recently as October 16, 1992 by Dr. Bennett but Mr. Sweeney \u201chas refused\u201d it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">7. The reports of Dr. Pour dated September 23, 1992 and Dr. Bennett dated October 16, 1992 \u201cadd[ed] nothing new to this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In rendering its decision, the Board failed to indicate its view as to what proof a firefighter would need to present in order to show that he had a permanent total disability within the meaning of \u00a7 33-43(e) of the Montgomery County Code. The Board merely concluded: \u201cIt is the opinion of the Board, that the testimony indicates by a preponderance of the evidence that [Mr. Sweeney] is not entitled to a Total Permanent Service Connected Disability Retirement Benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Appellant makes two arguments in this case. First, he argues that he was entitled to a total permanent service connected disability and that the Board decision to award a temporary partial disability was \u201carbitrary, capricious ... unreasonable and unlawful\u201d because it was not based on substantial evidence. Second, he contends that the Board failed to meet the legal requirement that it apprise the parties of the facts upon which it relied in reaching its conclusions. We shall address the second issue. For reasons explained below, we need not address the first issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Section 2A-10(a) and (b) of the Montgomery County Code is applicable to this case and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">Sec. 2A-10. Decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">(a) <em>Content. </em>All recommendations and/or decisions of the hearing authority except rulings on preliminary matters or on motions or objections shall be in -writing, based on evidence of record and <em>shall contain findings of fact, conclusions of law and an appropriate decision </em>and order; provided, however, any decision stipulated or consented to by the parties need only be reflected by an appropriate written order or consent decree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">(b) <em>Evidence required. </em>All recommendations and/or decisions of the hearing authority shall be based upon and supported by a <em>preponderance of the evidence of record.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">The role of agency findings of fact in judicial review is crucial. As we recently stated in <em>Baines v. Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City, </em>100 Md.App. 136, 143, 640 A.2d 232 (1994) (quoting <em>United Steelworkers v. Bethlehem Steel, </em>298 Md. 665, 679, 472 A.2d 62 (1984)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJP\">Judicial review of administrative action differs from appellate review of a trial court judgment. In the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court. However, in judicial review of an agency action the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is <em>sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajs\">(Emphasis in original.) Courts of this State have consistently required that administrative agencies make findings of fact and conclusions of law. \u201cAt a minimum, one must be able to discern from the record the facts found, the law applied and the relationship between the two.\u201d <em>Forman v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>332 Md. 201, 219-22, 630 A.2d 753 (1993); <em>Ocean Hideaway Condominium Association v. Boardwalk Plaza Venture, </em>68 Md.App. 650, 656-57, 515 A.2d 485 (1986); <em>State Commission on Human Relations v. Malakoff, </em>273 Md. 214, 229, 329 A.2d 8 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">In <em>Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>75 Md.App. 87, 540 A.2d 820 (1988), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABT\">[Tjhere are three principal reasons for the findings\u2019 requirement. The most obvious today is the overriding policy against government operating in secret.... Requiring articulation of the reasoning process evokes care on the part of the decider: \u201cto set in precise words the facts as he finds them is the best way to avoid carelessness in the discharge of that duty. Often a strong impression of that, on the basis of the evidence, the facts are thus and so, gives way when it comes to expressing that impression on paper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">In the second place, a losing party has a right to know why he lost his case. The requirements of findings meets the elementary demand of those injured by an agency decision to be told \u201cthe reason why.\u201d Findings serve as an explanation to the parties as to the basis for the decision. Thirdly and the reason most frequently emphasized, is the role of the findings requirement in facilitating judicial review. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"><em>Id., </em>75 Md.App. at 97-98, 540 A.2d 820 (quoting B. Schwartz, <em>Administrative Law, </em>\u00a7 140 (1976) (footnotes omitted)). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>also Forman, supra, 332 </em>Md. at 220-221, 630 A.2d 753 (an appellate court cannot review an agency\u2019s decision under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d or \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standards unless the agency\u2019s opinion makes findings of fact on all material issues and clearly states the rationale behind the agency\u2019s action).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The Board\u2019s findings of fact<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plainly did not satisfy the requirement that the agency must \u201cresolve all significant conflicts in the evidence.\u201d <em>Malakoff, supra; Forman, supra. </em>The most significant evidentiary conflict in this case was the wide divergence of opinion among the eleven doctors whose reports were reviewed by the Board. The Board made a \u201cfmding[ ] of fact\u201d that \u201cthere are conflicting medical reports as to the extent of [Mr. Sweeney\u2019s] injuries and whether surgery would correct the problem\u201d but made no attempt to articulate how it resolved those conflicts. Moreover, the Board failed to make any finding of fact that would support its conclusion that Mr. Sweeney\u2019s disability was temporary rather than permanent. Additionally, the Board did not say whether it believed Mr. Sweeney\u2019s testimony regarding his current physical problems, and the Board gave no indication of which, if any, of the duties of a Master Firefighter/Rescuer Mr. Sweeney was unable to perform. Lastly, the Board did not set forth its rationale for its conclusions that Mr. Sweeney\u2019s disability was partial as opposed to total.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Because we do not know the rationale for the Board\u2019s findings and because the Board failed to make crucial factual findings, our only viable alternative is to remand the case to the Board. The clumsy alternative to remand would be \u201cto <em>read </em>the record, <em>speculate </em>upon the portions which were probably believed by the board, <em>guess </em>at the conclusions drawn from the credited portions, <em>construct a basis </em>for decision, and <em>try to determine </em>whether a decision thus arrived at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>should be sustained.\u201d <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research, </em>83 Md.App. 432, 446, 575 A.2d 750, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 164, 582 A.2d 499 (1990) (quoting <em>Gough v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>21 Md.App. 697, 702, 321 A.2d 315 (1974)) (emphasis in original). As we pointed out in <em>Mortimer, supra, </em>the \u201cclumsy alternative\u201d is unacceptable because it would force a reviewing court to perform duties that the law assigns to the administrative agency. <em>Id. </em>For these reasons, we decline to answer the question raised by appellant as to whether the Board\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious ... unreasonable and unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Upon remand, the Board should prepare legally adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law. In performing this function, we strongly recommend that the Board follow the format set forth in <em>Redden v. Montgomery Co., </em>270 Md. 668, 685-86, 313 A.2d 481 (1974), viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">[A]n acceptable format for the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions ... would be to set out its finding that the particular requirement had, or had not, in its opinion, been established by the applicants and then add, \u201cbecause the Board finds the following facts to be true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">(Insert the facts here)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201cand does not accept as true the following testimony [or evidence].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">(Insert the rejected testimony [or evidence] here).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">In this way, a court on appeal will be able to ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Because the issue will necessarily arise on remand, we must address the meaning of the term \u201ctotal incapacity for duty\u201d as used in \u00a7 33-43(e). In this regard, Mr. Sweeney contends that he should be classified as totally disabled for duty if the evidence shows that \u201che cannot perform the regular and routine requirements\u201d of a Master Firefighter/Rescuer. The County does not say in its brief what must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>be proven in order to be eligible for a total disability but it does expound on the meaning of \u201cpartial incapacity for duty.\u201d The County states, \u201c[A] finding of a partial disability is appropriate where the evidence shows that the claimant is unable to perform all of the duties of the job but is not totally disabled from employment.\u201d In oral argument, the County clarified its position by asserting that an employee would not be totally incapacitated for duty unless he could perform no job (for which a reasonably stable market exists) anywhere. If the County\u2019s position were to obtain, whether Mr. Sweeney was \u201ctotally incapacitated for duty\u201d would be determined by ascertaining whether he was employable in any job\u2014not whether he could perform any of the tasks required of a Master Firefighter/Rescuer (or a position of comparable status within the department).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Section 33-43(e) of the Montgomery County Code (1984, as amended) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\"><em>Service-connected disability retirement. </em>A member may be retired on a service-connected retirement if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">(1) The member is totally incapacitated for duty or partially and permanently incapacitated for duty as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring, ... while in the actual performance of duty; that the incapacity is not due to willful negligence, and the incapacity is likely to be permanent. In extenuating circumstances, the administrator may waive the requirement that a member\u2019s incapacity is likely to be permanent and may approve a temporary disability retirement for one (1) or more one-year periods until the capacity is either removed or it becomes apparent that it is likely to be permanent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">(2) The member is unable to perform the duties of the occupational classification to which assigned at the time disability occurred or a position of comparable status within the same department, if qualified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Once it is determined the employee is eligible for a service-connected disability retirement, the amount of the pension is determined according to \u00a7 33-43(h), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>(1) Total Incapacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">a. 2 percent of final earnings, multiplied by years of credited service, up to a maximum of 36 years, plus sick leave credits, but not less than 66% percent of final earnings, if the member is totally and permanently incapacitated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">(2) Partial incapacity. 6 percent of final earnings for each 10 percent of permanent disability, but not less than 25 percent of final earnings, if the member is partially and permanently incapacitated....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">As already noted, we do not know what criteria the Board used in making the determination that appellant was not totally incapacitated. Moreover, case law provides only limited guidance in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>96 Md.App. 206, 208, 624 A.2d 1274 (1993) <em>(Buckman </em>I), one of the issues presented was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">Is an employee who sustains an occupational injury and otherwise meets the requirements of Montgomery County Code \u00a7 33-43(e) entitled to full disability retirement benefits under \u00a7 33-43(h)(l) if he is incapacitated for duty, yet capable of performing certain job duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">We answered that question in the affirmative. <em>Id., </em>96 Md. App. at 217-18, 624 A.2d 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">The <em>Buckman </em>case concerned a County employee who worked as a liquor store clerk. His duties included lifting liquor cases and other merchandise weighing up to 40 pounds. In addition, he operated a cash register, provided information to customers, and performed other clerical duties. <em>Buckman, </em>96 Md.App. at 210, 624 A.2d 1274. The hearing officer found that, because of a back injury, the employee could not perform all the duties of a liquor store clerk and awarded the employee a 35 percent permanent partial disability. The Board affirmed, and the employee appealed, contending that even though he could perform some of the duties of a liquor store clerk he was nevertheless totally incapacitated because he could not perform all the duties necessary to maintain his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>employment as a clerk. The circuit court agreed with the employee, reversed the Board, and ordered an award of full disability retirement benefits. <em>Id., </em>96 Md.App. at 211, 624 A.2d 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In <em>Buckman I, </em>we affirmed and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">Section 33-43(e) contains a patent inconsistency. The following example is illustrative. Employee A, a laborer, sustains a work-related injury which causes a fifty percent permanent partial disability and renders her unable to perform any job duties. Employee B, an administrator, sustains a more serious job-related injury which causes a seventy-five percent permanent partial disability. Because of B\u2019s occupational classification and job duties, however, the injury only prevents her from performing some job duties. Under the County\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 33-43(e), A is granted a full service-connected disability retirement because she cannot perform any job duties, and B is only granted a partial service-connected disability retirement because she is unable to perform <em>enough duties to remain in her position.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">There is no question that A and B both lose their jobs as the result of a work-related injury. It is not in keeping with the benevolent nature of \u00a7 33^3(e) that A receives full benefits while B, more seriously injured, and equally unable to continue in her position, receives only partial benefits solely because she is able to perform some job duties. It is inconceivable that the Montgomery County Council could have intended such an inconsistent result when it enacted \u00a7 33-43(e).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">Accordingly, we shall liberally construe \u00a7 33-43(e) and resolve its inconsistency in favor of Buckman. Under the hearing officer\u2019s construction of \u00a7 33^3(e), it would be rare, indeed, that an employee would be eligible for full benefits. The County could point to any one or more ministerial tasks routinely included in any job description which an employee, although incapacitated for <em>duty, </em>could nevertheless still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>perform. The County\u2019s attempt to skirt the intent of \u00a7 33-43(e) is ingenious, but nonetheless unavailing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Our holding in <em>Buckman I </em>was that an employee would be considered totally disabled for duty within the meaning of \u00a7 33-43(e) if he could not perform enough of his duties to remain employed at his job or in a position of comparable status within the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed our holding. <em>Montgomery Co. v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 636 A.2d 448 (1994) <em>(Buckman II). </em>The Court of Appeals interpreted the term \u201cpartially incapacitated for duty,\u201d as used in \u00a7 33-43(e)(1), as meaning \u201csomething less than totally incapacitated for duty.\u201d The Court held that by enacting \u00a7 33-43(e) the County had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7d\">unambiguously created a type of disability retirement for an employee, who because of a workplace accident, suffers from a permanent partial disability which prevents that employee from performing enough of the duties of the job held at the time the disabling accident occurred<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but who is not totally incapacitated from employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\"><em>Montgomery Co. v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 524, 636 A.2d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The Court of Appeals held in <em>Buckman II </em>that even though Buckman lost his job as a liquor store clerk because his back injury made him incapable of performing his job (or a position of comparable status within the department) he was still only partially disabled from duty because he could still perform some of a liquor store clerk\u2019s more sedentary clerical duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">With the above in mind, we must examine appellant\u2019s argument. As noted above, Mr. Sweeney\u2019s proposed test as to whether an employee is \u201ctotally incapacitated for duty\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 33-43(e) is whether the employee can \u201cperform the regular and routine requirements\u201d of his position. If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, appellant contends that the worker is totally incapacitated for duty. This proposed test was implicitly rejected by the Court of Appeals in <em>Buckman II, </em>and we explicitly reject it. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>Buckman II, </em>one of the liquor store clerk\u2019s regular and routine duties was to \u201clift cases of merchandise.\u201d 333 Md. at 521, 636 A.2d 448. The employee lost his job because he could not perform that job duty. The <em>Buckman II </em>Court nevertheless upheld the Board\u2019s finding that the employee was partially rather than totally disabled because he could still perform sedentary duties connected with his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">It is safe to say that under appellant\u2019s formulation few employees would ever be deemed \u201cpartially incapacitated for duty.\u201d The only employee who could meet appellant\u2019s proposed test would be those who could do all the regular and routine duties associated with his job but nevertheless somehow lost his job due to disabilities that incapacitated him from performing some non-routine job functions. Appellant cites no case law to support his position, and nothing in the language used in \u00a7 33-43(e) suggests that the Montgomery County Council intended the phrase \u201cpartially incapacitated for duty\u201d to apply only to such an exclusive group.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In interpreting \u00a7 33-43(e)(l), it is important to note that the words \u201ctotal incapacity\u201d and \u201cpartial incapacity\u201d are followed by the words \u201cfor duty.\u201d Section 33-43(d)(2) makes it clear that the term \u201cfor duty\u201d applies to the job the employee performed \u201cat the time disability occurred or to a position of comparable status within the same department, if qualified.\u201d Thus, in determining whether an employee is totally incapacitated for duty, the focus should not be (as the County contends) on jobs the employee can or cannot do outside the Montgomery County Fire Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Moreover, to prove total incapacity under \u00a7 33-43(e), the employee need not prove that he cannot perform even the most minor functions required in the job held at the time of disability. This was explained in <em>Buckman II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">Buckman claims that our interpretation is unreasonable because it \u201cwould effectively render the total disability provisions meaningless since there are no cases short of coma or total paralysis in which the injured employee is unable to perform even one of his duties set forth on his job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>description.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Brief at 25. Buckman\u2019s concern, however, is unfounded because we have not said, nor has Montgomery County asserted, that every employee who is capable of performing <em>even the most minor task would be ineligible for full disability retirement benefits. </em>What we do say is this: \u00a7 33-43(e) provides two distinct forms of service-connected disability retirement\u2014one for those employees who suffer total incapacity and another for those employees who suffer partial incapacity. It is the function of the administrative agency, the Board, to make the factual determination as to whether the employee is totally incapacitated for duty or partially incapacitated for duty. On judicial review, the court determines if the decision of the Board is arbitrary or capricious by examining whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the factual finding of the administrative agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><em>Id., </em>333 Md. at 525, 636 A.2d 448 (citations omitted, emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We interpret the term \u201ctotally incapacitated for duty\u201d as the term is used in \u00a7 33-43(e) as meaning incapacitated from performing <em>any </em>of the important functions of the job held at the time the disability occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A person is \u201cpartially incapacitated for duty\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 33-43(e) if he or she can perform some but not all of the important functions of the job held at the time the disability occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">It is the Board\u2019s obligation to determine what those important functions are and whether Mr. Sweeney is capable of performing any of them. Upon remand, in the Board\u2019s discretion, additional evidence may be considered regarding whether appellant is permanently incapacitated from duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY MERIT SYSTEM PROTECTION BOARD FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCON<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>SISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">.
