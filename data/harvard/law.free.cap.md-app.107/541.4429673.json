(AECI). On appeal, appellant presents us with but one question: was summary judgment properly granted? We shall answer in the affirmative, and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">Appellant was employed by AECI, a construction company based in Manassas, Virginia. AECI was engaged in construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>tion in a number of states, including Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, North and South Carolina, and the District of Columbia. In addition to being occasionally engaged in construction in Maryland, AECI also carried Workers\u2019 Compensation in Maryland. Although appellant is a Maryland resident and claims to have worked in Maryland about three or four months each year, he was employed by a Virginia corporation, and was supervised, and received his pay from AECI\u2019s headquarters in Manassas, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">AECI provided appellant with transportation for himself and other personnel. On 1 December 1990, appellant was involved in an accident in Virginia while returning to his home in Maryland after completing a project in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Although he received Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits from Virginia, appellant sought from, and was granted benefits by Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">After appellee noted an appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, both parties moved for summary judgment. Conceding that appellant had suffered a compensable injury, appellee nevertheless maintained that the Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission lacked jurisdiction to entertain appellant\u2019s claim. The circuit court agreed, and granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">At the outset, we point out that Rule 2-501(e) \u201cdirects that the court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment.\u201d Thus, \u201cthe standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion of summary judgment is simply whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster, </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993). Since there are no material facts in dispute, we must determine whether the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>court was legally correct in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In making that determination, we turn to Md.Code Ann.Labor and Employment, Section 9-202, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Covered Employee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Except as otherwise provided an individual, including a minor, is a covered employee while in the service of an employer under an express or implied contract or apprenticeship or hire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">As appellant was employed by AECI at the time of his injury, we believe that he falls within the purview of \u00a7 9-202(a), and appellee does not suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Section 9-203,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> however, narrows the definition of a covered employee. According to \u00a7 9-203:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">Site of Employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Except as otherwise expressly provided, an individual is a covered employee while working for the employer of the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">(1) in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">(2) outside of this State on a casual, incidental, or occasional basis if the employer regularly employs the individual within this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">(3) wholly outside the United States under a contract of employment made in this State for the work to be done wholly outside of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\">(b) <em>Incidental service in </em>State.\u2014(1) An individual is not a covered employee while working in this State only intermittently or temporarily if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-15\">(i) the individual and employer make a contract or hire in another state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-16\">(ii) neither the individual nor the employer is a resident of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(iii) the employer has provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage under a workers\u2019 compensation or similar law of another state to cover the individual while working in this State * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">As appellant sees it, although he was injured in an accident in Virginia he is entitled to Maryland benefits because he resides and is regularly employed in Maryland. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">At the time of the accident, appellant was neither regularly employed in Maryland, \u00a7 9-203(a)(l), nor employed wholly outside of the United States, \u00a7 9-203(a)(3). Consequently, \u00a7 9-203(a)(2) vests jurisdiction in Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission only if appellant is regularly employed in Maryland, but was working outside the State at the time of the accident on a casual, incidental, or occasional basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">From the record before us, we are unable to conclude that appellant was regularly employed in Maryland. Testifying on his own behalf, appellant said that he worked in Maryland for about \u201ctwo or three months.\u201d Other than appellant\u2019s testimony, there was no basis upon which the trial court could determine that appellant was regularly employed in Maryland at the time he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Relying upon <em>Turner v. State Office of Public Defender, </em>61 Md.App. 393, 486 A.2d 804 (1985), appellant contends that the Commission\u2019s findings are presumptively correct. Although that statement is accurate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant fails to recognize that the presumption applies to findings of fact, not conclusions of law. As the Court of Appeals recently pointed out, \u201cthe legislature has specified that the decision of the Commission is \u2018(1) presumed to be prima facie correct,\u2019 and \u2018(2) the party challenging the decision has the burden of proof.\u2019 \u201d The Court did so to ensure that \u201cthe finder of fact [would be] aware that the presumption [of fact] resulted from the Commission\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Holman v. Kelly Catering, </em>334 Md. 480, 485-86, 639 A.2d 701 (1994). Since we are presented with the issue of whether or not appellant is a covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>employee under the Act, an exercise is statutory interpretation, and hence a question of law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> neither <em>Turner </em>nor <em>Holman </em>is helpful to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Citing <em>Willson &amp; Sons v. </em>Garrett, 76 Md.App. 120, 543 A.2d 875 (1988), appellant contends that, as he worked for three or four months a year in Maryland, and is a Maryland resident, Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission had jurisdiction to entertain his claim. Unfortunately for appellant, he fails to recognize that in <em>Garrett </em>we answered a question different from that now before us. <em>Garrett </em>was employed by a Maryland corporation engaged in various projects in Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia. When he was injured, he was assigned to a project in Virginia, and worked only in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai1\">Noting that Garrett, \u201ca Maryland resident, was hired at the main office of a Maryland company engaged in business in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia; that [Garrett] was hired as a full-time employee; [and] that he was told that the Virginia job would last approximately 12 to 13 weeks, after which he would be assigned to a worksite in Maryland,\u201d we affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[Garrett] was not <em>\u2018employed </em>to do work entirely or wholly outside of the State,\u2019 and therefore, that his work in Virginia was \u2018incidental employment outside the State.\u2019\u201d Accordingly, we held that Garrett was entitled to Maryland\u2019s benefits, although he was injured while working in Virginia. 76 Md.App. at 126-27, 543 A.2d 875. We said also that \u201cthe question whether an employee was employed to work wholly outside of the State of Maryland is to be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As appellant does not contend that he was employed wholly outside the State at the time he was injured, <em>Garrett </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Appellant cryptically asserts, however, that in enacting \u00a7 9-203 the \u201cMaryland legislature intended that an employee who was <em>partially </em>employed within Maryland <em>could </em>be covered under the provisions of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u201d (emphasis added). Although we agree, we note that the qualifying word is <em>could. </em>An employee who was partially employed within the State of Maryland <em>could </em>be covered by the Act, provided the claimant is a covered employee as defined by \u00a7 9-203(a) and is not subject to the exclusions contained in \u00a7 9-203(b). We turn now to \u00a7\u00a7 9-203(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">As we have said, the issue before us is whether appellant is a covered employee as defined in \u00a7 9-203(a)(2). In order to be a covered employee, appellant must have been injured while working casually, incidentally, or occasionally, outside the State, although he was regularly employed in Maryland. Otherwise, appellant does not fit the definition of a covered employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The material facts are not in dispute. As we have said, appellant was employed by a Virginia corporation, and was working in Virginia when injured. Of course, appellant places great emphasis on his Maryland residency, and the facts that AECI maintains a warehouse in Maryland and carries Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Lest there be confusion, we point out that a covered employee is defined solely by \u00a7\u00a7 9-202 and 9-203, Consequently, if a claimant is not a covered employee, Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has no jurisdiction to entertain a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">According to appellant, as AECI maintains a warehouse in Maryland and carries Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation insurance, AECI \u201cobviously contemplated that [appellant] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and other employees would spend time in Maryland.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To be sure, appellee no doubt contemplated that its employees would be working in Maryland from time to time; however, it does not necessarily follow that they are covered employees. The fortuity of AECI\u2019s contacts with Maryland have nothing whatsoever to do with the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">That appellant is a Maryland resident is also irrelevant. Section 9-203(a) does not mention a claimant\u2019s residency. While we agree that one purpose of the Act is to ensure that injured employees do not become charges of the state, <em>Gatton v. Sline Company, Inc., </em>199 Md. 578, 583, 87 A.2d 524 (1952), that policy does not in and of itself confer jurisdiction on the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">During the hearing before the Commission, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">Counsel: Now, you say you had worked somewhere in Maryland right before this accident occurred; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">Appellant: I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">Counsel: And how long did you work at that job in Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">Appellant: I\u2019m thinking it was about maybe two months, maybe not at that exact address, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">Counsel: Within Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">Appellant: We did work about two or three months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">We think it clear that \u00a7 9-203(a) requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">(1) that a claimant\u2019s work outside of Maryland be casual, incidental, or occasional; to the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">(2) employee\u2019s regular employment in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Nevertheless, appellant seeks to persuade us that he is regularly employed in Maryland, and that his work outside the State is of no effect. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The word \u201cregular\u201d implies a uniform course of conduct, and we find nothing in the record indicating that appellant is regularly employed in Maryland. That appellant worked for several months in Maryland during a particular year appears to be more a matter of chance than of regularity. Indeed, appellant worked in at least four other jurisdictions during that same year. While we acknowledge there to be no particular formula for establishing \u201cregular\u201d employment, we do not believe that working in Maryland for several months during a particular year constitutes \u201cregular\u201d employment as envisioned by \u00a7 9-203(a). Yet, appellant offers no other evidence that he is regularly employed in Maryland. Moreover, it is obvious from the record that appellant works outside of Maryland nine (9) to ten (10) months each year. Consequently, we conclude that appellant is not regularly employed in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Appellant relies upon <em>Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>330 U.S. 469, 67 S.Ct. 801, 91 L.Ed. 1028 (1947), in support of his position that a resident of Maryland injured while outside of the State is entitled to Maryland benefits. <em>Cardillo </em>is of no help to appellant. In <em>Cardillo, </em>a resident of the District of Columbia was employed by a District of Columbia employer and had worked in Virginia for three years before being injured. The United States Supreme Court concluded that he was covered by the District of Columbia\u2019s Compensation Act. Appellant fails to recognize, however, that the Court was interpreting the District of Columbia\u2019s Act, not Maryland\u2019s. Unlike Maryland\u2019s Act, the District\u2019s Act applies to any employee whose employer carries on employment in the District. Unfortunately for appellant, Maryland\u2019s Act is not so broad. <em>See generally, Gatton, </em>199 Md. at 583-84, 87 A.2d 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We also point out to appellant that <em>Cardillo </em>was a resident of the District of Columbia and was employed, paid, and supervised by a District of Columbia company. Conversely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>although appellant is a resident of Maryland, he is employed, paid out of, and supervised by a Virginia company. The <em>Cardillo </em>Court noted that the District of Columbia\u2019s \u201clegitimate interest in providing adequate workmen\u2019s compensation measures for its residents ... depends upon some substantial connection between the District and the particular employee-employer relationship[ ].\u201d <em>Cardillo, </em>330 U.S. at 476, 67 S.Ct. at 805. The connection between Maryland and appellant\u2019s employee-employer relationship is far more tenuous, and as we also said earlier, the fact that he resides in Maryland is irrelevant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-203(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Although neither party referred to that fact, it appears that appellant sought Maryland\u2019s benefits because they were more favorable than those of Virginia.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although we acknowledge that Maryland\u2019s Act \u201cshould be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes [and that] [a]ny uncertainty should be construed in favor of the claimant,\u201d <em>Baltimore v. Cassidy, </em>338 Md. 88, 97, 656 A.2d 757 (1995) (citations omitted), we \u201cmay not disregard the plain meaning of the Act in the name of liberal construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we hold that appellant is not a covered employee as defined by \u00a7 9-203(a)(2). Therefore, Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission was without jurisdiction to entertain appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-17\">.
