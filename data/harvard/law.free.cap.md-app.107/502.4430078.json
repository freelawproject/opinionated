He was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment. In this timely appeal, appellant presents the following question for our consideration: Did the trial court err in admitting hearsay evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">At trial on 12 January 1995, the State called Robin Hammond Walker (\u201cMrs. Walker\u201d) as a witness. Mrs. Walker testified that she was appellant\u2019s wife, having been married to him on 1 September 1994. She indicated that although she was subpoenaed by the State to testify in this case, she was invoking her spousal privilege not to testify against her husband.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">At this point, the State, in a motion in limine, requested the circuit court to admit into evidence several written, signed statements that Mrs. Walker gave to police officers concerning a series of robberies committed by appellant, her then boyfriend. The State argued that the statements should be admitted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">into evidence as inherently reliable hearsay statements made by [Mrs.] Walker to the police at the time in the hopes of obtaining some help for [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">In response, appellant\u2019s counsel indicated, and the State agreed, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">[i]t is my understanding that when the statements were made ... [Mrs.] Walker indicated at the time that she was doing this because she wanted [appellant] to get some help for his drug problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then asserted that these statements should not be admitted because they were hearsay that did not fall into an exception to the exclusionary rule. Specifically he argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>[N]ow, unless there is an exception, I think universally the rale is it does not come in. I think the State has to show the Court a basis, other than the fact that says I submit it because it is inherently reliable. They have to show you something other than that. They have to show you a basis for this to come in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">After implicitly recognizing that Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements did not fall within the \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exceptions, the trial judge noted that \u201cif you want to look for an exception with the hearsay rale then turn to [Rule 5-804 since] she is unavailable.\u201d He explained that it was clear that Mrs. Walker was unavailable because she exercised her privilege not to testify against her husband. Then, on his own initiative, the trial judge ruled that Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements came in under Rule 5-804(b)(5), the residual exception, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">[Ujnder exceptional circumstances the following are not excluded even though the declarant is unavailable as a witness: a) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact\u2014here it clearly is; b) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts.... [T]he victim in this case is more likely than not unable to identify his assailant in this case ... [; (c) ] the general purpose of these rales in the interest of justice will best be served by admission of these statements into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The trial judge explained further that he saw</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au5\">no indicia that this statement would be unreliable. In fact, it would appear to me to be a reliable statement. For what possible purpose would this woman have made the statement to the police officers implicating her boyfriend, but for the fact to get him help, and that is not a reason to implicate someone, to get him help in a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Thereafter, Jose Iraheta (\u201cIraheta\u201d) testified that on 10 June 1994 at approximately 4:00 a.m., while riding his bicycle to work on Twinbrook Parkway in Rockville, a man (the \u201cassailant\u201d) approached him and pushed him to the ground. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The assailant then picked him up by the collar, put a knife to his stomach, and demanded his wallet. Iraheta indicated that he gave the assailant his wallet which contained $60. After taking the money, the assailant returned the wallet, and Iraheta was allowed to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Iraheta explained that he subsequently called the police, who arrived approximately fifteen minutes after the robbery. He testified that he told the police that the assailant was an African-American male \u201cabout [his] height, kind of heavy ... [who] was using a type of sweater, a green sweater with a hood covering the head.\u201d On cross-examination, Iraheta acknowledged that he did not see his assailant\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Officer Ivan Langford (\u201cLangford\u201d) next testified that sometime after 10 June and before 15 June 1994 \u201ca friend of [Mrs. Walker\u2019s] had her page [him] because ... [s]he was having problems, and she wanted to talk.\u201d In response, Langford indicated that he met Mrs. Walker<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at a shelter in Rockville where he received \u201csome information which [he] turned over to [Detective Klarko].\u201d While giving this information to Detective Klarko, he received a page from Mrs. Walker. Langford testified that after calling Mrs. Walker, he gave the phone to Detective Klarko who then proceeded to speak with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Detective Richard Klarko (\u201cKlarko\u201d) testified that, in the early part of June during a meeting with Officer Langford, he spoke with Mrs. Walker on the telephone. After this telephone conversation, he and Detective Bauers met with Mrs. Walker at her parents\u2019 residence for about an hour and a half on 15 June 1994 beginning at approximately 6:00 p.m. Mrs. Walker\u2019s father was also present during this meeting. Over a continuing objection, Klarko explained that Mrs. Walker had information concerning \u201can incident that had occurred ... the day before, in which [appellant] had indicated that he had committed a robbery\u201d and that he had reduced what she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>said to writing. After refreshing his memory, Klarko testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">She indicated to me\u2014[Mrs. Walker] indicated to me on June 11th she and [appellant] were walking on Twinbrook Parkway. At some point in time during this walking along Twinbrook Parkway a Montgomery County Police cruiser passed them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">At such time [appellant] hung his head down low as if to hide his face. [Mrs. Walker] indicated why or questioned him as to why he was doing this, and he said well, I committed a robbery last night and they might see me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">He then went on to describe to [Mrs. Walker] ... an incident where he had approached a Hispanic male and robbed him of $60 cash. At that time he was wearing a green hooded sweatshirt, and the hooded sweatshirt was pulled over his face. [Appellant] indicated to [Mrs. Walker] that he didn\u2019t know if the person who he had robbed on Twinbrook Parkway would recognize him because his sweatshirt was pulled over his head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">At some point in time during the evening, shortly thereafter the robbery, after he had taken the $60 from this Hispanic male, [appellant] threw the sweatshirt which he was wearing and had used to conceal his face in the area off Twinbrook Parkway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">At that point, which was the next day when he was discussing this matter with [Mrs. Walker] he said wait a minute, I will be right back, and he went off behind some apartments, retrieved a green hooded sweatshirt and then proceeded to throw it into a dumpster along Twinbrook Parkway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Klarko testified further that Mrs. Walker read over the statement and was given an opportunity to make any necessary corrections or additions to the statement. While doing so, she signed each page, put her initials at the bottom of each page, and signed the end of the statement. Over objection, the State introduced Mrs. Walker\u2019s statement to Klarko as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1. In addition to repeating Klarko\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>testimony regarding what Mrs. Walker had told him about the robbery, this statement indicated that Mrs. Walker has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoA\">known [appellant] since 1989. We\u2019ve been living together off and on since then. About March 9th I moved out of the apartment he and I were living at. I moved down to the shelter ... I\u2019ve stayed there since then. I still see [appellant] regularly. He had moved ... [to] his moms house down on Twinbrook Pkwy. I take the kids down to see him. It was the 11th [when appellant,] me and my daughter were walking along Twinbrook Pkwy. It was about 10:00 a.m. [The statement then described the robbery.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Because this statement contained some information that was ruled inadmissible at trial, certain portions were redacted. An uncensored copy was submitted by the State for identification only as Exhibit No. 3. This uncensored copy contained information that \u201c[t]he last month or so [appellant has] been doing more crack cocaine than usual\u201d and \u201cI moved out of the apartment he and I were living at because I couldn\u2019t handle his drug use ... [i]t was a bad influence on the kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVh\">On cross-examination, Klarko acknowledged that Mrs. Walker told him that she and appellant lived together until Mrs. Walker moved out because she could not handle the situation with appellant. Klarko testified that he did not recall whether Mrs. Walker said that she wanted to get appellant some kind of help.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Detective Jane Bauers (\u201cBauers\u201d) testified that on 15 June 1994 at approximately 5:30 p.m. she accompanied Klarko to Mrs. Walker\u2019s parents\u2019 residence. Over a continuing objection, Bauers testified that Mrs. Walker told her that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUPu\">on the 11th that [appellant] had robbed someone the previous night, which would have been June 10th of $60.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">[Appellant] told her that he pulled the victim\u2019s wallet out of the back of the victim\u2019s pants. He told her he was wearing a green sweatshirt with a hood at the time of the robbery. Then on the next day, June 12, 1994, they were in front of the Halpine View Apartments down in Twinbrook at approximately 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon and [appellant] told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>her that he had discarded that green sweatshirt that he wore during the robbery and now he had to get it back. She told me that [appellant] went behind the apartment complex which is in Halpine View. She did not accompany him. She waited. About three minutes later he came back holding a dark green sweatshirt. He threw the green sweatshirt into the complex\u2019s dumpster. He also told her that he used mace on someone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Bauers indicated that she wrote down Mrs. Walker\u2019s statement. After doing so, she read the statement back to Mrs. Walker and gave her the opportunity to make changes to it. Mrs. Walker signed the statement without making any changes. Over objection, the State introduced Mrs. Walker\u2019s statement as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This statement tracked Bauers\u2019s testimony as to what Mrs. Walker had told her.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">After the State rested, with regard to Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements, appellant\u2019s counsel argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK-\">my argument ... is going to be based on the hearsay nature of these items, the same argument that I made before concerning the hearsay nature. I think they are inappropriate, and I don\u2019t think they should be admitted at all. I think they are inherently unreliable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">They are, I think, being admitted in violation of our Rules of Evidence and specifically 5-803(24), and I would ask that the Court reconsider its decision and deny the State the opportunity to use those.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In response, the trial judge stated \u201cfor the reasons I gave earlier I will deny the motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Appellant argued in his brief before this Court that the trial judge erred in admitting Mrs. Walker\u2019s hearsay state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ments<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under Maryland Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5) because: (1) \u201cthe statements did not fall within the rare and exceptional circumstances contemplated by the rule\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe statements did not qualify as having \u2018circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d Alternatively, appellant asserted for the first time in this case in his reply brief that Maryland \u201cRule 5-804(b)(5) is not applicable to this case\u201d and Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements should have been excluded because they do not fall within any of the hearsay exceptions in effect prior to 1 July 1994, the date that the rules took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>Standard of review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Before we begin our analysis of these matters, we note the scope of review we shall apply in the event we reach the matter of the circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5). The Court of Appeals, by Order dated 15 December 1993, effective 1 July 1994, codified the rules of evidence to be applied in Maryland courts by adopting Title 5 of the Maryland Rules. These rules included the adoption of a \u201cresidual\u201d or \u201ccatch all\u201d exception for reliable, necessary hearsay in Rules 5-803(b)(24) and 5-804(b)(5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During the process of formulating Title 5, the Court of Appeals contemplated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>standard of review to apply to decisions involving the residual exception as revealed by Professor McLain\u2019s<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> observation that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ast\">[t]here was some discussion at the Court of Appeals\u2019 hearing on November 15,1993, about the standard of review of a trial court\u2019s admission of hearsay under a residual exception. One of the judges opined that such a ruling would be reviewed net under the abuse of discretion standard but by <em>de novo </em>review of whether the trial judge erred as a matter of law in, in effect, creating a new hearsay exception, applicable to the case before it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Rules of Evidence </em>\u00a7 2.803.4jj. at 269-70 (1994). We agree with this observation and hold that in reviewing a trial court\u2019s admission of hearsay under a residual exception we will decide whether the trial judge erred as a matter of law. We are persuaded to adopt this standard of review because the trial judge is given broad discretion to admit hearsay that does not fall within a recognized exception; in essence, creating heretofore unrecognized hearsay exceptions. A Committee note to the newly codified Maryland Rules of Evidence recognizes the substantial role that trial judges are given in the process of evolving the residuary exception, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">[T]he residual exceptions ... provide for treating new and presently unanticipated situations which demonstrate a trustworthiness within the spirit of the specifically stated exceptions. Within this framework, room is left for growth and development of the law of evidence in the hearsay area, consistently with the broad purposes expressed in Rule 5-102.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Md. Rule 5-803 (advisory committee note). An error made while acting in this capacity would amount to an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Moreover, in order to ensure that such decisions by trial judges receive meaningful appellate review, thereby assuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>that uniformity and predictability are present in this new and developing area of the law, we will apply a <em>de novo </em>review of whether the trial judge erred as a matter of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Did Mm yland Rule 5-804(b)(5) apply to this case?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Appellant asserts for the first time in his reply brief that \u201cMaryland Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5) is not applicable to this case [because] Title 5 does not apply ... the crime charged was committed prior to July 1, 1994,\u201d and the disputed evidence would not have been admissible under the law and rules in effect prior to 1 July 1994. Appellant contends, instead, that the admissibility of Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements \u201cis governed by pre-Title 5 law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">As noted, <em>supra, </em>the Court of Appeals adopted Title <em>5 </em>by Order effective 1 July 1994. In doing so, Maryland\u2019s codified rules of evidence were made applicable to \u201call actions and proceedings in the courts of this State,\u201d with some exceptions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Md. Rule 5-101. With respect to when the rules would become applicable, the Order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">[the Rules in Title 5] shall take effect July 1, 1994 and shall apply in all trials and hearings commenced on or after that date; provided, however, that (1) any trial or hearing commenced prior to July 1, 1994 shall continue to be governed by the law and Rules in effect on June 30, 1994, and (2) no evidence shall be admitted against a defendant in a criminal action in proof of a crime committed prior to July 1, 1994, unless that evidence would have been admissible under the law and Rules in effect on June 30,1994.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">This portion of the Order is not contained in the actual text of Title 5. Rather, it is found in an Editor\u2019s note introducing Title 5, as well as in an annotation to Rule 5-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial took place on 12-13 January 1995 and the crime for which appellant was convicted allegedly occurred on 10 June 1994. As appellant\u2019s late blooming argument goes, if Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements would not have been admissible under pre-Title 5 law, Rule 5-804(b)(5) would not have been applicable and the hearsay should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\n<em>Will we reach appellant\u2019s unpreserved issue?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Before delving into this issue, we pause to consider whether to reach the merits of this argument that was clearly unpreserved. It is apparent from the record that the prosecutor, defense counsel, and the trial judge did not give any thought specifically to whether the hearsay statements would have been admissible under pre-Title 5 law. We recognize that our decision whether to reach this unpreserved issue is limited by the provisions of Maryland Rule 8-131(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">[t]he issues of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter and, unless waived under Rule 2-322, over a person may be raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial court. <em>Ordinarily, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">(Emphasis added). The primary purpose of this rule is \u201cto ensure fairness for all parties in a case and to promote the orderly administration of law.\u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107 (1994) (citations omitted). Under this rule, an appellate court will ordinarily only consider \u201cthose issues that were raised or decided by the trial court, unless the issue concerns the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter.\u201d <em>County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Offen, </em>334 Md. 499, 508, 639 A.2d 1070 (1994) (citations omitted). Although the Court of Appeals has recognized that an appellate court possesses discretion to consider matters that were not relied upon by the trial judge or raised by the parties, \u201c[t]his discretion ... is not unbridled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508-09, 639 A.2d 1070. In using its discretion, the Court in <em>Offen </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">[I]f an issue does not fall within a common exception to the general \u2018raise or waive\u2019 rule, an appellate court should weigh carefully whether its consideration of an issue not raised in the lower court is in fact \u2018necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal\u2019 before it exercises its discretion under Rule 8-131(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">334 Md. at 510, 639 A.2d 1070. In <em>Wieland v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 1, 643 A.2d 446 (1994), we recently elaborated on our ability to utilize this limited exception stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">[T]he limited exception to what is \u2018ordinarily\u2019 review foreclosure \u2018kicks in\u2019 when the case is going to be remanded in any event, necessarily on the basis of some other issue that was preserved____ Those qualifying contingencies could not even come into play unless the case were going to be remanded in any event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 34, 643 A.2d 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">We recognize that, under this authority, we ordinarily would not reach this unpreserved issue. In this case, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>er, the trial judge overlooked what ordinarily would be a necessary step in attempting to apply the newly codified Maryland Rules of Evidence. Although we are not excusing this error, we recognize that mistakes in evaluation may occur in the cases considered shortly after the adoption of a new subtitle of rules. This particular omission, of admitting evidence under Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5) without considering whether the evidence would have been admissible under pre-Title 5 law, is so basic that we deem it unwise to leap to a review and interpretation of this particular rule without observing what is the correct analytical framework that applies under Title 5. An opinion reached on the basis of such a faulty methodology of analysis could have limited precedential value. Moreover, the potential for this omission to recur in these \u201ctransition cases\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is high because the provisions in the Rule\u2019s Order pertaining to the conditions of applicability are not contained in the text of the Title 5 rules themselves. Instead, they are found in an Editor\u2019s note introducing the rules, as well as in an annotation to Rule 5-101. Under these circumstances, it would be unwise for both trial and appellate courts to explore the envelope of the residual exception if a necessary step in the analysis goes unaddressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">As a result, we will reach the merits of appellant\u2019s unpreserved argument in order to guide the trial judge in this case, which judgment would have been reversed in any event. Our decision to do so conforms to our holding in <em>Wieland </em>because, as indicated in Section I.C., <em>infra, </em>had we not reached the merits of this unpreserved issue, we would have reversed the case otherwise based on the trial judge\u2019s clear error in applying Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5). Our decision to use our limited discretion and reach the merits of this issue is also influenced by our desire to remind trial judges of the manner in which they must approach the newly codified Maryland Rules of Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>in these \u201ctransition cases.\u201d We stress that our decision to reach this unpreserved issue is limited to the facts of this case and should not be interpreted as a deviation from the maimer in which recent appellate cases have interpreted in a restrictive way the language of Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\n<em>Merits of whether Maryland Rule 5-804.(b)(5) applied</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In order to reach the merits of appellant\u2019s argument that Rule 5-804(b)(5) did not apply to this case, we must establish the correct analytical framework for approaching Title 5 in these \u201ctransition cases.\u201d Appellant asserts that in this \u201ctransition case\u201d the trial judge, before applying the rules of Title 5, must first decide, as a threshold matter, if the contested evidence would have been admissible under pre-Title 5 law. His argument continues that if pre-Title 5 would have barred the evidence, no analysis under Title 5 is performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Appellant\u2019s suggested approach, however, misinterprets the language of the Order adopting Title 5. As indicated, under the Order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">[the Rules in Title 5] shall take effect July 1, 1994 and shall apply in all trials and hearings commenced on or after that date; provided, however, that ... no evidence shall be admitted against a defendant in a criminal action in proof of a crime committed prior to July 1, 1994, unless that evidence would have been admissible under the law and Rules in effect on June 30,1994.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The Court of Appeals has stated that under this language \u201c[t]he Rules in Title 5 take effect July 1, 1994 and apply in all trials and hearings commenced on or after that date, except that no evidence is to be admitted against a defendant in a criminal action in proof of a crime committed prior to July 1, 1994, unless the evidence would have been admissible under the law and the Rules in effect on June 30, 1994.\u201d <em>Graves v. State, </em>334 Md. 30, 36-37 n. 2, 637 A.2d 1197 (1994). The Order thus makes clear that Title 5 applies in \u201call trials ... commenced\u201d on or after 1 July 1994. The Order then pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>vides for an express limitation on evidence that can be admitted under Title 5 cases where the alleged crime subject to prosecution occurs before 1 July 1994. Specifically, in these situations evidence that would not have been admissible under pre-Title 5 caselaw cannot be admitted under Title 5. In essence, this portion of the Order acts as a final \u201cbackstop,\u201d which is only i eferenced after a trial judge rules that evidence in a case is admissible under Title 5 when the trial takes place on or after 1 July 1994 and the alleged crime occurs before 1 July 1994, to ensure that criminal defendants will have the benefit of pre-Title 5 law if that law is more strict with regard to what would have been admissible under the codified rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">As a result, despite appellant\u2019s assertion to the contrary, Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5) was clearly applicable to this trial that took place after 1 July 1994. Appellant is, however, partially correct in that the trial judge did omit a necessary step in the application of Title 5 to this \u201ctransition case.\u201d That is, after deciding that the evidence against appellant was admissible under Title 5, the trial judge should have considered whether the evidence was admissible also under pre-Title 5 law. Our review of the record reveals that the trial judge never inquired about or made this appropriate determination in admitting Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements. Rather, without specific urging by either prosecutor or defense counsel, he initiated a truncated analysis under Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5) and ruled that the statements were admissible. As we shall consider, <em>infra, </em>had this analysis been performed, it may have resulted in the exclusion of Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements even if it had been determined that all of Rule 5-804(b)(5)\u2019s limiting requirements were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\n<em>Maryland Rule 5-80k(b)(5) analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">As appellant\u2019s trial took place after 1 July 1994, the residual exception provided by Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5) is implicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>because the declarant is unavailable<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the hearsay does not fall within any other recognized exception. Under this rule, hearsay is not excluded if the declarant is unavailable as a witness if the following criteria is satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\"><em>[u]nder exceptional circumstances </em>...: A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having <em>equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, </em>if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. A statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party, sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Md. Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Initially, this rule makes clear that it will only be applied in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d A review of the rule\u2019s legislative history indicates that the Court of Appeals intended this \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement to be followed strictly. First, a Committee note demonstrates the intention for this rule to be utilized to admit hitherto inadmissible hearsay evidence \u201cvery rarely, and only in exceptional circumstances\u201d and that it is included so as to provide room \u201cfor growth and development of the law of evidence in the hearsay area, consistently with the broad purposes expressed in Rule 5-102.\u201d The note states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>[T]he residual exceptions provided by Rule 5-803(b) (21) and Rule 5-80)(b)(5) do not contemplate an unfettered exercise of judicial discretion, </em>but they do provide for treating new and presently unanticipated situations which demonstrate a trustworthiness within the spirit of the specifically stated exceptions. <em>Within this framework, room is left for growth and development of the law of evidence in the hearsay area, consistently with the broad purposes expressed in Rule 5-102.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\"><em>It is intended that the residual hearsay exceptions will be used very rarely, and only in exceptional circumstances. </em>The Committee does not intend to establish a broad license for trial judges to admit hearsay statements that do not fall within one of the other exceptions contained in Rules 5-803 and 5-804(b). The residual exceptions are not meant to authorize major judicial revisions of the hearsay rule, including its present exceptions. Such major revisions are best accomplished by amendments to the rule itself. <em>It is intended that in any case in which evidence is sought to be admitted under these subsections, the trial judge will exercise no less care, reflection, and caution than the courts did under the common law in establishing the now-recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Md. Rule 5-803 (advisory committee note) (Emphasis added). Judge Chasanow of the Court of Appeals, in an article written with Professor Anderson, states that this Committee note leaves \u201clittle doubt that the residual exceptions to the Maryland Rules of Evidence [which by requiring exceptional circumstances are more restrictive than their federal counterparts] would receive only a lukewarm welcome into Maryland\u2019s courts.\u201d Judge Howard S. Chasanow and Jos\u00e9 Felip\u00e9 Anderson, <em>The Residual Exceptions: Maryland\u2019s Lukewarm Welcome, </em>24 U.Balt.L.Rev. 1,24-25, 25 n. 167 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Further revealing the intended narrow scope of Maryland\u2019s residual exception, this article recognizes that \u201c[d]uring the process of drafting and adopting the new rules, one of the more difficult decisions for the court was whether to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>some form of the residual hearsay exceptions.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 24. Although a residual exception was eventually adopted, \u201cthe \u2018legislative\u2019 history was clear that the Court, while seeing the need under exceptional circumstances for a \u2018wild card\u2019 hearsay exception, did not intend by this action to open the door to all kinds of \u2018junk\u2019 which fails to qualify under the specific exceptions.\u201d Lynr. McLain, <em>Maryland, Rules of Evidence </em>\u00a7 2.803.4jj. at 269 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">It is clear to us that, although the Court of Appeals ultimately decided to adopt a residual exception, the introductory limiting language and the Committee note should be interpreted in a manner that requires the trial judge to perform a careful and thoughtful consideration on the record of all of the rule\u2019s limiting requirements before admitting evidence under the residual exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>in allowing Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements to be admitted under Rule 5-804(b)(5), the trial judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">[I]t would appear to me to be a reliable statement ... [fjor what possible purpose would this woman have made the statement to the police officers implicating her boyfriend, but for the fact to get him help, and that is not a reason to implicate someone, to get him help in a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In making his determination, however, as discussed more fully in Section H.A., <em>infra, </em>he did not consider other relevant facts that may have shown that the statements did not possess sufficient \u201ccircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Moreover, the trial judge did not make any findings as to why he felt there were \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d present that would justify the admission of the hearsay in this case. The failure to give proper attention to these requirements results in our holding that the trial judge erred in reaching his conclusion that the requirements of the rule were satisfied. Although we are reversing the judgment in this case, we wish to offer the trial court guidance on how to interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>limiting provisions of Maryland\u2019s codified residual exception to the hearsay rule in the event of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\n<em>Rule 5-801p(b)(5)\u2019s requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In the event of a new trial, the court must initially give consideration to the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement of Rule 5\u2014804(b)(5). We conclude that such consideration requires the trial judge, if he finds the presence of \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d to state on the record the factual findings supporting his conclusion. <em>See Huff v. White Motor Corp., </em>609 F.2d 286, 291 (7th Cir.1979) (noting that in reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling under the residual exception the appellate court is \u201cgreatly aided when the record contains a statement of the reasons for the ruling and any findings made\u201d); Fed.R.Evid. 803(24) (Senate Judiciary Committee Report) (stating that \u201c[i]n order to establish a well-defined jurisprudence, the special facts and circumstances which, in the court\u2019s judgment, indicates that the statement has a sufficiently high degree of trustworthiness and necessity to justify its admission should be stated on the record.\u201d); Sang W.

State, </em>333 Md. 547, 636 A.2d 463 (1994), wherein the Court of Appeals discussed the criteria used to establish that a hearsay statement possessed sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to qualify under the penal interest exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The <em>Simmons </em>court began its analysis by pointing out the presumption of unreliability, stating that \u201cas a threshold requirement, the statement [must] be marked by particularized guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to overcome the presumption that it was unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561, 636 A.2d 463. The <em>Simmons </em>court next recognized that a showing of \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d is made from the totality of circumstances when \u201cthe only relevant circumstances are \u2018those that surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 636 A.2d 463 (citing <em>Idaho v.

In order to suggest for the trial judge a starting point, we shall outline relevant factors considered by other appellate decisions. The <em>Simmons </em>court considered the following factors: (1) \u201c \u2018age, education, experience and condition of the declarant,\u2019 \u201d <em>see Simmons, </em>333 Md. at 563, 636 A.2d 463 (quoting <em>State v. Standifur, </em>310 Md. 3, 12, 526 A.2d 955 (1987)); (2) the statement\u2019s spontaneity, <em>see Simmons, </em>333 Md. at 562, 636 A.2d 463 (citations omitted); (3) the motive of the declarant, <em>i.e, </em>did the declarant \u201cdesire to mitigate his own involvement or to overstate the involvement of the person he implicated,?\u201d <em>see Simmons </em>333 Md. at 563, 636 A.2d 463. \u201cOne of the factors which a court may not consider, however, is other corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 636 A.2d 463; <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 822, 110 S.Ct. at 3150. Moreover, in <em>Bailey v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>State, </em>327 Md. 689, 612 A.2d 288 (1992), the Court of Appeals indicated that the factors used in determining whether admitted testimony bears sufficient indicia of reliability so as not to offend the Confrontation Clause include \u201cthe type of and centrality of the issue that the hearsay is being offered to prove; and the source of the hearsay, including the possibility of bias or motive to fabricate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700, 612 A.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Of further guidance to the trial judge might be <em>Dallas County v. Commercial Union Assurance Co., </em>286 F.2d 388 (5th Cir.1961), wherein Judge John Minor Wisdom set out what is now the federal residual hearsay exceptions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(24) (advisory committee note). In discussing the instances when hearsay is \u201ctrustworthy enough to serve as a practicable substitute\u201d for cross-examination, Judge Wisdom took note of the following three sets of circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">[ (1) ] \u2018[wjhere the circumstances are such that a sincere and accurate statement would naturally be uttered, and no plan of fabrication would be formed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">[ (2) ] where, even though a desire to falsify might present itself, other considerations, such as the danger of easy detection or fear of punishment, would probably counteract its force;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">[ (3) ] where the statement was made under such conditions of publicity that an error, if it had occurred, would probably have been detected and corrected.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Id. at 397 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Our review of the record of this case suggests certain considerations that might have affected the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of whether Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements had particularized guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to overcome the presumption that they were unreliable. We note some of the circumstances. First, tending to support the statements\u2019 reliability is appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d at the motion in limine hearing that, at the time she gave her statements, Mrs. Walker indicated that \u201cshe was doing this because she wanted [appellee] to get some help for his drug problem.\u201d Additionally, in support of the statements\u2019 spontaneity, Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Walker initiated the interview with the police and she gave the statements in the presumably non-hostile environment of her parents\u2019 house. Also, because Mrs. Walker was not a suspect in the crime at issue, she did not have a motive to lie in order to either mitigate her own involvement or to overstate appellee\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">There are, however, other facts that should have been considered and that may have tended to suggest that the statements \u201care [not] such that a sincere and accurate statement would naturally be uttered.\u201d <em>Dallas County, </em>286 F.2d at 397 (citation omitted). Specifically, we note that Mrs. Walker waited four days after allegedly being told by appellant of the 10 June 1994 incident before she called the police. This lapse of time appears to cut against the statements\u2019 spontaneity. The trial judge also might have attempted to explore more fully Mrs. Walker\u2019s motive in making her statements and whether she had any possible motive to fabricate them. For instance, it is possible that Mrs. Walker\u2019s admitted interpersonal problems with appellee, <em>ie., </em>Mrs. Walker and her children moved out of the apartment being shared with appellant into a shelter because she \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle [appellant\u2019s] drug use ... [i]t was a bad influence on the kids,\u201d could have motivated her to make the statements to the police out of anger. It is also possible that other inter-personal problems not described in the record could have resulted in Mrs. Walker fabricating a story about appellant. For example, if appellant\u2019s conduct forced Mrs. Walker and the children out of the apartment they shared, and if she was the lessee of the apartment, she might have a motive to oust him from occupancy through an arrest. It also begs inquiry why procuring appellant\u2019s arrest on a robbery charge necessarily furthers her objective of getting appellant help for his drug problem. In essence, before ruling that this evidence would have been admissible, the judge must be satisfied \u201cthat adversarial testing would add little to [the statements\u2019] reliability.\u201d <em>Chapman v. State, </em>331 Md. 448, 457, 628 A.2d 676 (1993) (citing <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 821, 110 S.Ct. at 3149).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>If after performing this enhanced reliability analysis, the trial judge concludes that the statement possessed sufficient indicia of trustworthiness, he shall state on the record the factual findings supporting his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Assuming the trial judge finds that the rule\u2019s two threshold requirements are satisfied, he should proceed to perform an analysis under parts (A), (B), and (C) of the rule. Here, too, the trial judge must state the factual findings supporting a conclusion that the conditions are satisfied. Finally, if all the conditions are satisfied, the judge must ensure that the adverse party of the evidence was given advance notice. This finding must also be made on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">If the trial judge determines that Mrs. Walker\u2019s statements should not be admitted under Rule 5-804(b)(5), the statements, not falling into any other exception, should be ruled inadmissible. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-802.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">If, on the other hand, after performing this analysis and providing appropriate factual findings, the trial judge concludes that Mrs. Walker\u2019s statement should be admitted under Rule 5-804(b)(5), the lower court should consider whether these statements would have been admissible under pre-Title 5 law.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">\n<em>Admissibility under pre-Title 5 law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Appellant, in his reply brief, contends that these statements would have been inadmissible, arguing that \u201c[i]n pre-Title 5 case law, neither [the Court of Special Appeals] nor the Court of Appeals has recognized a \u2018catch-all\u2019 exception that would allow the admission of hearsay evidence against an accused in a criminal trial where the evidence is not admissible under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d In support of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>argument, appellant directs our attention to <em>Cassidy v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 1, 536 A.2d 666 (1988), in which we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa5\">[UJnlike Federal Rule of Evidence 803(24), which creates a miscellaneous exception to the Hearsay Rule for other \u2018equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,\u2019 Maryland, in the common law tradition, is more rigorous and orthodox in its approach to hearsay exceptions. A proponent will not satisfy the rule by showing generalized indicia of trustworthiness but must qualify under one of the clearly identifiable and classically recognized exceptions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYZ\"><em>Id. </em>at 8-9, 536 A.2d 666. Appellant also points to <em>Cain v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 227, 492 A.2d 652, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 300, 498 A.2d 1186 (1985), where we similarly determined that \u201cMaryland has yet to adopt that rule of evidence [Federal Rule of Evidence 803(24) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 492 A.2d 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Appellant is correct technically that pre-Title 5 law never officially declared the adoption of a \u201ccatch-all\u201d or \u201cresidual\u201d exception by name. Although pre-Title 5 caselaw is not crystal clear on the matter, our review of the decisions indicates that, on occasion, pre-Title 5 Maryland law allowed the admission of hearsay evidence not falling into a recognized exception for evidence that was \u201cnecessary to the accused\u2019s defense\u201d and carried \u201csufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Foster v.

In <em>Foster, </em>the defendant was convicted of felony murder. On appeal, a statement made by the victim to his friend that the defendant\u2019s husband had threatened to kill the victim was at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 209, 464 A.2d 986. The Court of Appeals held, as a matter of due process,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that this evidence must be admitted, even though it did not satisfy the requirements of any common law exception, upon finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>statement was \u201ccritical to the defense and that [it] bore persuasive assurances of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 464 A.2d 986. In reaching this decision, the Court explained that, \u201c[u]nder the facts and circumstances of this case, the exclusion of exculpatory hearsay evidence deprived the accused of a fair trial and, therefore, of due process of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although the <em>Foster </em>decision was obtained by a plurality vote only, in light of the following authorities, we believe that supports the proposition that hearsay evidence that was necessary to the accused\u2019s defense and sufficiently reliable could have been admissible under pre-Title 5 Maryland law. <em>See Brown v.
