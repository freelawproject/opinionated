As the basis of the recovery here sought, plaintiff relies upon the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of National Life Insurance Company v. United States, 277 U. S. 508, 48 S. Ct. 591, 72 L. Ed. 968, wherein that court held that life insurance companies were entitled under the provisions of section 245(a) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 261) to deduct the full 4 per cent, of the mean o\u00a3 their reserve funds required to he maintained by law, and that in so far as said section attempted to diminish said 4 per cent, by the amount of tax-exempt interest received during the tax year, said section was unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The defendant has interposed a demurrer which raises the question of jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">It is apparent from an examination of paragraph twentieth of section 24 of the Judicial Code, as amended, and re-enacted by section 1122(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (28 USCA \u00a7 41(20), that this section applies-only to the District Courts and has no application to the jurisdiction of this court. Before the amendment (Act of February 24, 1925 [43 Stat. 972]), suits could only be brought for the erroneous or illegal collection, of taxes by the collector of internal revenue while he was in office, and the courts have <em>repeatedly </em>held that it was a personal action. Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., 257 U. S. 1, 42 S. Ct. 1, 66 L. Ed. 99. Suits could not be brought against the United States in the District Courts where it was alleged that the collector of internal revenue had erroneously or illegally assessed or collected taxes. Of course, no suit could be maintained in the Court of Claims against the collector. This court has only jurisdiction of cases where the-, government is defendant. The object of this-amendment was to give the district courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of' Claims to try cases against the United States where taxes had been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected by the collector, after he had ceased to be the collector at the time the suit was instituted. However, we only refer to this point because this issue has been raised. We do not lay particular stress on it. The main point on which this case must devolve, and the controlling point in the case, is that no claim for refund was ever filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. There is no allegation in the complaint that a claim for refund was ever filed. It has been repeatedly held by the courts that in order to give jurisdiction it is essential that a claim for refund shall have been filed, and the omission of an allegation that a claim has been made is fatal. Davis v. United States, 67 Ct. Cl. 643, and eases cited. It is apparent from an examination of the petition that no claim for refund was filed, and the bar of the statute of limitations -having fallen no claim can be filed. The court has no jurisdiction. The demurrer is sustained and the petition dismissed. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
