Those services were rendered under contracts which petitioner had with the state tax commissioner of Georgia and boards of commissioners of several counties of Georgia. The contract with the state tax commissioner was authorized by act of the Legislature, Georgia Laws of 1919, page 55; and it will be assumed that the contracts. with the counties were also authorized by that act. Employment under each contract was subject to be terminated on short notice. Petitioner claims that his income was exempt from federal taxation under the Revenue Act of 1926, \u00a7 1211 (26 USCA \u00a7 1065-b) on the ground that he was an officer or employee of the state and political subdivisions thereof; hut, under the decisions of the Supreme Court in Metcalf v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514, 46 S. Ct. 172, 70 L. Ed. 384, and Lucas v. Howard, 280 U. S. 526, 50 S. Ct. 87, 74 L. Ed. 593, he must be held to have been an independent contractor, and not entitled to- claim exemption because of the nature of his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-21\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
