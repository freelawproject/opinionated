Wheeler, Jr., and Edmund F. Maher, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-15\">Geo. J. Hatfield, U. S. Atty., and Sol.

The Sarah, 8 Wheat. 391, 5 L. Ed. 644; Armstrong\u2019s Foundry, 6 Wall. 766, 18 L. Ed. 882; Confiscation Cases, 7 Wall. 454, 462, 19 L. Ed. 196; Morris\u2019 Cotton, 8 Wall. 507, 19 L. Ed. 481; Garnhart v. United States, 16 Wall. 162, 21 L. Ed. 275; Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 22 L. Ed. 320; Shawnee Nat. Bank v. United States (C. C. A.) 249 F. 583; National Surety Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 17 F.(2d) 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-21\">It is equally well settled that, if an action at law is tried by the court- without a written waiver of a jury, the jurisdiction, of the appellate court to review the judgment is limited to the process, pleadings, and judgment. This latter proposition is too firmly established to require citation of authority. See, however, United States v. McGovern (C. C. A.) 299 F. 302; Graver Corporation v. Hercules Gasoline Co. (C. C. A.) 16 F. (2d) 459; National Surety Co. v. United States, supra; Greer-Robbins Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 19 F.(2d) 841. Here there was no waiver of a jury, by stipulation or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-22\">The judgment must therefore bo affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
