The application was rejected by both the examiner and the Board of Appeals on the ground that the claimed design shows nothing patentable over prior art as illustrated in patent to Keely, design No. 59898, of December 6, 1921. Appeal was taken from the hoard\u2019s decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-24\">Both designs show wheeled toys constructed somewhat in airplane form.- The Keely design follows the biplane structure, and shows four wheels; that of appellant represents a monoplane, and has three wheels. There are differences of configuration in the bodies of the toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-25\">We do not, however, find in these differences anything of an inventive nature on the part of appellant. Appellant is not a pioneer in this field of toy designing, and the modifications of the Keely structure shown in appellant\u2019s structure do not involve invention. Invention must be present in a design in order to render it patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-26\">The authorities sustain the action of the Patent Office tribunals. White Co. v. Converse &amp; Son (C. C. A.) 20 F.(2d) 311, 305 O. G. 4; Elite Mfg. Co. v. Ashland Mfg. Co. (C. C. A.) 235 F. 893, 895; Chas. Boldt Co. v. Nivison-Weiskopf Co. (C. C. A.) 194 F. 871; King Ventilating Co. v.
