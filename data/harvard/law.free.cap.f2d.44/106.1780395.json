This suit arose over a bill for repairs and materials furnished to the yacht Antares, by the appellee, William P. Smith, of Tuckerton, N. J. While the yacht was in Atlantic City, Henry Martin sold, her to the appellant, Emerson, under the representation, that there was no lien or claim against her. Emerson went to Tuckerton to see Smith shortly after he had purchased her. What took place between Emerson and Smith at Tuckerton is somewhat in dispute. Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>says that Emerson said to him, \u201cIf Martin don\u2019t pay it (Smith\u2019s hill), I will,\u201d and that he replied, \u201cI guess Martin will pay \u2014 always has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Mr. Emerson\u2019s testimony as to what happened follows: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u201cQ. What happened when you got there? A. Mr. Mathis went to look Mr. Smith up, and ho came down to the wharf. Now, this boat sits up above the wharf considerable, and being a little heavy, and cozy, I didn\u2019t get up on the wharf. I sit there on the boat, and was introduced to him, and brought that subject up at once with Mr. Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201cQ. What subject? A. The subject if he had a bill against this boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">\u201cQ. What did he say? A. Mr. Smith replied that he had a small bill. How much it was, well, he didn\u2019t tell me. So then \u2014 I said, \u2018What\u2019s the amount?\u2019 \u2018It isn\u2019t any great amount,\u2019 he said, \u2018That\u2019s a private matter, and I will take Mr. Martin for that.\u2019 I told him I wanted to pay him, however, if there was any bill there, I wanted to pay him then and there; I didn\u2019t want anything hanging over this boat, that I had a chance to deduct it from the cheek. The other conversation wasn\u2019t relative to this; it was simply the covering and taking care of the boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">\u201cQ. What did ho say ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">\u201cMr. Harris: I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">\u201cBy Mr. Long:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">\u201cQ. All right. When yon say the check, you mean the $9,000 cheek you have in your hand? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">\u201cQ. When was that check paid? A. That cheek wasn\u2019t paid then until I came back on the morning of the 16th \u2014 so marked by the cashier of the bank; that was according to telephone conversation; marked <em>on the </em>back of the cheek and paid on the 16th, and charged to my account on \u2014 Mr. Smith told us positive he would look to Mr. Martin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">This took place on July 14,1927. On August 22, 1928, Mr. Emerson \u2018Wrote Mr. Smith as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-15\">\u201cMr. William Smith,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-16\">\u201cTuckerton, N. J.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-17\">\u201cDear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-18\">\u201cYour bill received. When I was at your place a year ago you did not tell me there was a bill unpaid by Mr. Martin. Martin also assured me there was none.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-19\">\u201cI have written Martin a short letter in order to force him to pay, a copy of which T enclose.- Now, follow it up without delay and make a demand on him and let me hear how you come out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-20\">\u201cYou should have given some notice to me in order to make your claim binding and I could have held up the payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-21\">\u201cBest regards, Victor Lee Emerson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-22\">Mr. Smith replied on August 27, 1928, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-23\">\u201cMr. Victor Emerson,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-24\">\u201c0381 Overbrook Avenue,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-25\">\u201cPhiladelphia, Pa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-26\">\u201cDear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-27\">\u201cYour letter of August 22 regarding the bill of $221.00 against the Andares has been received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-28\">\u201cIf you will look back to the evening you was at my place you will remember that Captain Mathis told me in your presence that Mr. Martin told him to tell me that he would send me a check and you said that you would pay it if he did not, and I told you I thought he would settle it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-29\">\u201cI am today writing to Mr. Martin again requesting him to settle this bill, a copy of which I am sending to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-30\">\u201cYours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-31\">'\u201cWilliam P. Smith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-32\">Floyd Mathis, \u2022 who was captain of the yacht, was present at Tuckerton when the conversation took place between Mr. Emerson and Mr. Smith. His testimony as to what took place follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-33\">\u201cQ. Coming down to the arrival of this yacht at Tuckerton, will you kindly tell the Court what took place, and what was said, and who was present at any conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-34\">\u201cMr. Long: Give us the date of the conversation, will you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-35\">\u201cA. Mr. Smith and I, we went and tried to get the little boat, and we got the little boat at the dock, and Mr Emerson came out. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-36\">\u201cBy Mr. Harris:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-37\">\u201cQ. Where was Mr, Emerson? A. Right next to the dock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-38\">\u201cQ. Was he on the dock? A. Yes; he was on the dock. The boat laid light along the dock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-39\">\u201cQ. Who was present? A. Mr. Smith, and I, and Emerson talked there a little while, and we were talking about the boat, and who bought her, an'd I told Smith he had bought her. That\u2019s all \u2014 maybe a little more; I couldn\u2019t tell you. I was busy, and he wanted to get out of there \u2014 it was hot in tho creek \u2014and we went out that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-40\">\u201cQ. Was <em>that </em>all the conversation at that time? Did you have any conversation in regard to the bill against this boat at the time? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>A. I told Mr. Emerson about that bill several times. I told him that bill was a lien against my wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">\u201cQ. Was that before or after the sale? A. That was after he bought her, and then I talked \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many times \u2014 and I told Martin about sending Captain Smith a check right away because he would tie the boat up before she left Atlantic City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201cQ. Coming up to the conversation on the pier, what was said to Mr. Smith by Mr. Emerson about this bill, and Mr. Smith\u2019s reply ? A. He just told Mr. Smith, \u2018If Martin don\u2019t pa.y, I will see you get it,\u2019 or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201cQ. What did Mr. Smith say \u2014 \u2018All right,\u2019 and let it go ? A. He wasn\u2019t there very long; a very short time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u201cQ. There was no one else present than you three? A. No; not on the dock there. The whole gang was aboard. I don\u2019t know how many of these fellows were ashore.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The learned trial judge said that what Smith, the libelant, meant by his statement to Emerson was that he would not give up his lien,,but at the same time refrained from saying anything against Martin, with whom he had done business, but the claimant did not understand him and thought that the libelant meant that he would waive his lien against the yacht and look entirely to Martin. He held, however, that an expression of confidence in Martin was not a release of his lien. We agree with the trial judge that \u201cestoppel or an equitable release required more than\u201d an expression of confidence that Martin would pay the bill. Under the provisions of the Act of June 5,1920, e: 250, \u00a7 30, sub-sec. S, U. S. Code, title 46, \u00a7 974 (46 USCA \u00a7 974), known as the Ship Mortgage Act, the furnisher of repairs and supplies may waive his lien against a vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The real question is whether or not Smith did waive the lien. The trial judge found that he did not, and this finding was based upon the assumption that the testimony of both Smith and Emerson as to what occurred when they met at Tuckerton was true, but that they misunderstood each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">Assuming, however, that both Smith and Emerson testified to the truth of what took place at Tuckerton as they remembered it, we must conclude that the memory of one of them was inaccurate. Emerson did say, \u201cIf Martin don\u2019t pay it, I will,\u201d or he did not. Smith said that he did, and he repeated that statement in his letters both to him and to Mr. Long, his proctor, at a time when it might have been thought that the case would be settled and not brought to trial. Captain Mathis, a disinterested witness, testified to the same effect. On the other hand, Mr. Emerson testified that Smith said he had a small bill against the yacht but gaye the impression that it was of no \u201cgreat amount,\u201d was a \u201cprivate matter,\u201d and that he would \u201ctake Mr. Martin for that.\u201d But when he wrote to Smith on August 22, 1928, he said to him: \u201cWhen I was at your place (Tuckerton) a year ago, you did not tell me there was a bill unpaid by Martin.\u201d These two statements on the same subject by Mr. Emerson are contradictory and indicate that it is Mr. Emerson\u2019s memory that is poor and inaccurate. There is no explanation, so far as we can ascertain, as to why he went to Tuckerton, if it was not to see Smith about a bill which Captain Mathis told him Smith had against the yacht.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">We agree with the District Court that the evidence shows that Mr. Smith did not waive his lien against the yacht Antares. The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
