The superposed strips are rolled together in a single roll. Due to the increased circumference of the roll of the outermost of the strips with respect to the circumference of the underlying strips, ordinarily when the strips would be tom off, the'top strip would be tom off in a different position relative to the other strips. Appellant\u2019s device contains two feed rolls, one of which has an edge sufficiently narrow to enter the perforations, thereby causing that sheet to stop rolling, thus permitting the other sheets to be moved up to where the perforations are brought into alignment, and thus bringing about an alignment of the printed forms and any carbon paper that might be used in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-28\">It will not be necessary to discuss all the references. They disclose in some instances rolls of paper and flat pads of paper which are unrolled or drawn out for use, as sales-books, etc. The Wiswall patent, 1,534,478, shows a manifolding book for the same machine as is used at bar with the same superposed record strips with form-registering apertures contained therein in substantially the same relative position on the strips, and intended to perform the same purpose as those at bar. Its use is confined to the use of zigzag pads, which are pads made of the strips of paper, folded in zigzag fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-29\">Appellant contends that it is desirable to use the paper in the form of a roll rather than in the form of a zigzag pad; that his device permits the use of same without having the ends of the strips uneven at the point where they are torn off. It is contended by applicant that it has required inventive genius to thus provide strips which can be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>in the form of rolls rather than in the form of flat packs.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The Board of Appeals held that, \u201cThe claims distinguished from Wiswall only by defining the package as being in the form of a roll,\u201d and further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201cAs we view the case it did not involve invention to roll the superposed strips disclosed in Wiswall into a single roll, in view of the disclosures in the other cited patents. The patent to Shirek et al. well illustrates the equivalency of the zigzag and the rolled types of packages, shown respectively in Figures 2 and 3 of the patent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">We do not think appellant\u2019s disclosure shows any invention not already disclosed in the references, and agree with the conclusion reached by the Board, of Appeals, and its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
