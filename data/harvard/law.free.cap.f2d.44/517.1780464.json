This motion also alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-17\">\u201cAnd your petitioners further say that they have at all times since the filing of the original petition on May 24, 1929, exercised due diligence in ascertaining the facts as herein set forth, and have done all in their power to proceed in the premises with due dispatch, and that the interests of justice require that this Honorable Court allow the foregoing amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">On October 11, 1929, the special master made his first report, setting forth that he had refused to hear evidence on the merits of the ease until the court had passed upon the motion, and also dealing with the appellant\u2019s principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-19\">On October 15,1929, the motion <em>to </em>amend the petition was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-20\">On November . 3, 1929, the master filed a second report, finding preferences as alleged, and recommending adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">On November 18, 1929, after hearing, the motion to dismiss was denied. Thereupon the respondent undertook to appeal to this court, but the petition for appeal was denied by this court on January 23,1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-22\">On February 7, 1930, adjudication followed, and an appeal to this court was allowed on March 6, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-23\">The gist of the appellant\u2019s contention is that the court below erred in grounding jurisdiction- on the general allegation of preferences, without particulars as to dates, creditors, and kind of property transferred. This contention cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-24\">The general allegation of preferences to persons unknown, while insufficient, was amendable, as held by the Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit in Bradley v. Huntington, 277 F. 948. The defect was not jurisdictional. If the respondent had seasonably asked for a hearing on the motion to dismiss, it might perhaps have been granted, but with leave to amend. The amendment was nothing but in the nature of a bill of particulars. It did not set up new and independent acts. Millan v. Exchange Bank of Mannington (C. C. A.) 183 F. 753. All it did was to give greater precision to charges already seasonably made. In re Bieler and Batzer (C. C. A.) 295 F. 78. The case falls within the principle laid down by this court in the Harris Case, 299 F. 395, 400, where Judge Bingham said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-25\">\u201cThe main purpose of the Bankruptcy Act [11 USCA] is that the assets of an insolvent person, who has committed an act or acts of bankruptcy within four months before the filing of an involuntary petition against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>shall be equally distributed among his creditors. It cannot he that Congress intended that this purpose should be defeated by a resort to technicalities in pleading, and that petitioners, who have set forth in their petition facts constituting a sufficient ground of complaint to warrant an adjudication of bankruptcy, should not be permitted by amendment to add other facts in support of tho same general ground of complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAS\">Compare also In re Hibel Fur Co. v. Strongin (C. C. A.) 33 F.(2d) 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed, with costs to the appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
