It was pomposed entirely of peace officers. Its purpose, in addition to promoting effectiveness of law enforcement generally, was to represent sheriff\u2019s employees of rank below captain and district attorney\u2019s investigators in labor negotiations with the County of San Mateo. Captains were thus members of ODS but not represented by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>After the passage of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (MMB, <em>post; </em>also, code references <em>post </em>are to Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3500 to 3510 unless otherwise stated), appellant county in August 1970, as authorized by section 3507,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> promulgated Resolution 28068 to govern employer-employee relations therein. The resolution contained rules of procedure for the establishment and modification of representation units for various classifications of employment. Pursuant thereto, ODS petitioned for its recognition as the representation unit for sheriff\u2019s employees below captain and for inspectors in the district attorney\u2019s office, all of whom were peace officers as defined by Penal Code sections 830.1 and 830.3, subdivision (b). The petition was granted and a Law Enforcement Unit was established with ODS recognized as the organization representing these employees. The sheriff\u2019s captains, chief civil deputy and the district attorney\u2019s chief investigator were designated as management employees and placed in the All County Management Unit which included managerial and confidential employees in departments having nothing to do with law enforcement and was thus not composed entirely of peace officers. This unit was represented by the County Employees Association, a countywide employee\u2019s organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Less than two years thereafter, ODS, upon the initiative of respondent Captain Elvander and other peace officers who were in the All County Management Unit, petitioned the civil service commission to create a new Law Enforcement Management Unit to be composed entirely of peace officers and to thus remove them from representation by the All County Employees Association. They asked that ODS be recognized as their representation organization. The petition was granted but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>commission took it a step further and determined that sheriff\u2019s lieutenants had managerial duties and they were thus included in the Law Enforcement Management Unit. Before an election could be held to designate an employee\u2019s organization to represent them\u2014a step contemplated by section 3507, subdivision (d), where regulations for such elections existed\u2014ODS, Captain Elvander and Lieutenant Hoover (who had served on ODS\u2019 negotiating team for two years), individually and on behalf of the officers placed in the new unit, filed their petition in the superior court seeking mandate and injunction to prevent the creation of the new unit or the inclusion therein of said upper echelon employees. They sought to compel the county to continue lieutenants in the (basic) Law Enforcement Unit and to add thereto the sheriff\u2019s captains, his chief deputy and the district attorney\u2019s chief inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The trial court found that the creation of two law enforcement units violated the rights of peace officers under section 3508 which in relevant part provides: \u201c. . . the governing body may not prohibit the right of its employees who are full-time \u2018peace officers\u2019 ... to join or participate in employee organizations which are composed solely of such peace officers, which concern themselves solely and exclusively with the wages, hours, working conditions, welfare programs, and advancement of the academic and vocational training in furtherance of the police profession, and which are not subordinate to any other organization. [\u00b6] The right of employees to form, join and participate in the activities of employee organizations shall not be restricted by a public agency on any grounds other than those set forth in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The mandatory and injunctive relief prayed for was granted, including a mandate that ODS be recognized as the representative for the basic law enforcement unit which, as reconstituted according to the mandate, would include both upper and lower echelons of peace officers. The court made findings and conclusions which recited the resolution\u2019s definition of \u201cmanagement employees\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and found that the commission had \u201cauthority to find that lieutenants are management employees;\u201d that its finding to that effect was supported by evidence both before the commission and at trial; that lieutenants and captains were management employees and that the \u201cCounty\u2019s prohibition restricting management and confidential employee\u2019s activities, expressed in section 17 [of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>resolution] is valid.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find nothing in the judgment itself that reduces these latter findings and conclusions to judgment either by way of declaration or order.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The County and Civil Service Commission appealed. ODS and Captain Elvander and Lieutenant Hoover cross-appealed \u201cfrom that portion of the judgment . . . [which held] . . . that lieutenants in the Sheriff\u2019s Department. . . were and are \u2018management employees\u2019 as that term is defined\u201d in said resolution. Although the point is not properly before us on the cross-appeal because the judgment is completely silent concerning it, the point must be discussed because for reasons explained below we have concluded that the judgment must be reversed as to that portion which prohibits appellant from designating any management and confidential employees in the sheriff\u2019s office as a separate representation unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">MMB furnishes a sketchy and frequently vague framework of employer-employee relations for California\u2019s local governmental agencies. It has been criticized for lack of specificity, \u201cconfusing lack of clarity\u201d and internal inconsistencies in many important areas. (Grodin, <em>Public Employee Bargaining in California </em>(1972) 23 Hastings L.J. 719, 738-739, 760; Schneider <em>An Analysis of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act of 1968 </em>1 Civ. Pub. Employment Relations (CPER) 1 and <em>Unit Determination, Experiments in California Local Government, </em>3 CPER 1.) The dispute herein arises out of the kind of vagueness and inconsistencies described by Dr. Grodin, <em>supra, </em> The basic issue presented is whether MMB\u2019s grant of authority for a public agency to designate some employees in various departments as management or confidential employees and restrict them from representing any employee organization which represents nonmanagement or nonconfidential employees (\u00a7 3507.5)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was rendered inapplicable to the law enforcement branches of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>local governments by the provisions of section 3508 heretofore quoted and precluded the county from designating management employees therein as an appropriate bargaining unit separate from nonmanagement employees therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The trial court held that \u201cthe creation of a separate [law enforcement] management unit of peace officers abridges the statutory right that the management employees have to join and participate in the Organization of Deputy Sheriffs. . . .\u201d Although we have phrased the basic issue in a different manner by placing emphasis on the postulated inconsistency of the two sections of MMB, we are not in disagreement with the trial court\u2019s statement that the issue was whether the civil service commission had the power to create the two separate bargaining units for the county\u2019s deputy sheriffs if they are opposed to being divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Appellant contends that MMB contemplates separate representation units determined or defined as to job classification included within an appropriate unit by the public agency and employee organizations whose right to represent such units is determined by vote of the employees \u201cof the agency or an appropriate unit thereof.\u201d (\u00a7 3507.) Grodin points out that ffie phrase \u201cappropriate unit\u201d is borrowed from the federal statute. Reference to standards of appropriateness established by NLRB decisions is arguably invited\u2014an invitation accepted in <em>Alameda County Assistant Public Defenders Assn. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 825, 829 [109 Cal.Rptr. 392], which cites and relies upon NLRB decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Schneider at 1 CPER, pages 12-13, <em>supra, </em>states that in the complex matter of unit determination, MMB neither requires nor prohibits such determination. The language of section 3507 as to adoption of rules and regulations is permissive. The only limitations are that they must be (a) preceded by \u201cconsultation in good faith\u201d with employee organizations; (b) rules promulgated must be reasonable; and (c) section 3507.3 requires that professionals must be allowed the option of separate representation in an organization of similar employees\u2014an aspect not here involved. Nor is the question of whether or not mandamus would issue at the instance of an employees\u2019 organization if the governing body refused to make any unit determination. The point is that such determination is for the agency as employer subject only to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>restrictions set forth above. (Cf. Grodin, <em>supra, </em>23 Hastings L.J. pp. 741-742.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The record herein reflects considerable consultation between the employees involved with various county officers before the commission\u2019s hearing that resulted in the creation of the management unit that is here sought to be nullified. Evidence was taken at said hearing. It appears not to have been reported but various witnesses testified to the gist of it in court. As to such unit determination and the designation of management employees made by the commission, the only criteria for judicial review provided by MMB is that of reasonableness. (Grodin, <em>supra, </em>23 Hastings L.J. p. 741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Contrary to federal practice, by virtue of the broad definition of \u201cpublic employee\u201d in section 3501, subdivision (d), which excludes only elected officials and those appointed by the Governor, MMB extends organizational and representation rights to supervisor and managerial employees without regard to their position in the administrative hierarchy. The act is silent about their unit placement. The California Legislature thus minimized the potential or actual conflict of interest that, as mentioned in <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Bell Aerospace Co. </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 267, 271-272 [40 L.Ed.2d 134, 141-142, 94 S.Ct. 1757], was the basis for the total exclusion of management employees that obtains under federal law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Where a legislative action by a local governmental agency is attacked as unreasonable, the burden of proof is on the attacking party. Such regulations are presumed to be reasonable in the absence of proof to the contrary. <em>(Fillmore Union High School Dist. </em>v. <em>Cobb </em>(1935) 5 Cal.2d 26, 33 [53 P.2d 349]; <em>Dept. Alcoholic Bev. Control </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. Control Appeals Board </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 785, 792-793 [338 P.2d 50].) If reasonable minds may be divided as to the wisdom of a board\u2019s action, its action is conclusive and courts should not substitute their judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>for that of the board. <em>(Rible </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 437, 445 [150 P.2d 455, 154 A.L.R. 137].) We are of the opinion that the reasonableness or appropriateness<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the unit here under attack finds support in the following considerations: (a) the existence of actual or potential conflicts of interest where management employee\u2019s loyalties may be split between the employers\u2019 interests and those of employees; (b) histoiy of collective bargaining; (c) the greater responsibility of management employees for the efficient functioning of a department constitutes a community of interest not necessarily shared by rank-and-file employees; (d) lack of reason why a sheriff\u2019s office should be treated differently as to management employees than any other county office; and (e) the public interest served by a sheriff charged with vitally important functions of law enforcement, is such that if a governing agency determines that he, as the representative of the public employer, should be entitled to the undivided loyalty of his managerial and confidential employees, we cannot say this determination is either unreasonable or not in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">We have noted that MMB differentiates between the designation of appropriate bargaining units and the formation of employee organizations. When the Legislature departed from the federal policy of excluding management employees and gave them organizational and representation rights, it must have been aware of the sometimes stormy developments in labor relations that gave rise to the exclusionary federal policy and practice. The trial court, in its memorandum opinion, read into the language of section 3507.5 <em>(ante, </em>p. 336), the sole purpose of restricting such employees from bargaining for the organization to which they belong. The judge stated that this was made doubly clear by the provision that \u201cthis section does not otherwise limit the right of employees to be members of and hold office in an employee organization.\u201d At first reading, under section 3507, which declares MMB\u2019s purpose and intent, that right would appear to be an absolute right of employees to \u201cjoin organizations of their own choice and be represented\u201d by them. But the 1972 amendment stating that MMB was not intended to bind public agencies which provide procedures for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>administration of employer-employee relations in accordance with the provisions of this chapter (a clear reference to \u00a7 3507) preserves to local agencies, as employer, rule making power as to recognition of organizations and of unit determination therefor. Insofar as such rules and regulations are reasonable and are promulgated after consultation with such organizations, the \u201cabsolute\u201d right to join and to be represented by an organization of the employee\u2019s choice is subject to such rules. <em>City of San Diego </em>v. <em>American Federation of State, etc. Employees </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 308, at page 312 [87 Cal.Rptr. 258], states: \u201cOf particular significance is the fact the employer-employee relationship in public employment is the product of law\u2014constitutional, legislative and decisional\u2014rather than the product of a contract as in private employment. [Citations.] The terms and conditions of public employment are fixed by the public through the processes of law, and acceptance of such employment requires acceptance of the processes by which the terms arid conditions of employment are fixed, i.e., by law rather than by contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The strict interpretation of section 3507.5 adopted by the trial court is difficult to reconcile with the unit determination rights contained by necessaiy implication in section 3507. Section 3507.5 speaks of organizations and not units. Such view also overlooks the possibility that in giving a governmental agency the right to designate management employees and to restrict them from representing an organization that includes nonmanagement employees, the Legislature may have intended to retain to the public employer some measure of protection against conflict of interest considerations that might arise when management employees\u2019 loyalties are split between the employer\u2019s interests and those of employees while preserving to such employees an optional right to form their own organization and thus escape the restriction of said section 3507.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">When reasonably possible, courts must harmonize statutes, reconcile seeming inconsistencies and construe them to give force and effect to all provisions thereof. <em>(Hough </em>v. <em>McCarthy </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 273, 279 [5 Cal.Rptr. 668, 353 P.2d 276].)  Courts may not add to or detract from a statute or insert or delete words to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on its face or from its legislative history.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Estate of Simmons </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 217, 221 [49 Cal.Rptr. 369, 411 P.2d 97]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Pepper </em>v. <em>Board of Directors </em>(1958) 162 Cal.App.2d 1, 4 [327 P.2d 928].)  Administrative regulations are subject to the same rules of construction and interpretation that apply to statutes. <em>(Lertora </em>v. <em>Riley </em>(1936) 6 Cal.2d 171 [57 P.2d 140]; <em>Duke Molner etc. Liquor Co. </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 873, 884 [4 Cal.Rptr. 904].)  In the light of these rules, we have examined sections 9, 10 and 11 of San Mateo\u2019s Resolution 28068 which provide for the establishment of representation units, their modification, and establishes criteria to be considered in the determination of modification of appropriate representation units. We find nothing unreasonable in them. The segregation of management employees into a separate bargaining unit is appropriate under standards used by N.L.R.B. heretofore discussed and under factors (b) (c) (d) and (f) of<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> section 11 of said resolution. Subdivision h of said section 11 reads, \u201cManagement and confidental employees shall not be included in the same unit with non-management or non-confidential employees.\u201d A tabulation prepared by Ross<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and De Gailly<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> for their article in 8 CPER 6 shows that eight counties (Alameda, Los Angeles, Marin, Sacramento, San Benito, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Ventura) and five cities (Berkeley, Concord, Glendale, Pasadena and Sacramento) have like unit limitations.  Interpretation and application of the statute, by administrative agencies charged with its implementation, although not determinative, is an aid to construction that is entitled to weight unless it is clearly erroneous. The number of agencies that have made this segregation of management employees also argues the reasonableness thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Finally, we must determine whether or not the segregation of management employees who are in law enforcement into a separate unit is a prohibition of peace officers\u2019 rights under section 3508 \u201cto join or participate in employee organizations which are composed solely of such peace officers . . . which are not subordinate to any other organization.\u201d ODS advances no reason why a sheriff\u2019s department should be treated differently as to management employees than any other department of the county. Autonomy of such organizations is required by the last phrase of section 3508. The plural use of \u201cemployee organizations\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>appears to recognize the possibility of the existence of more than one peace officer employee\u2019s organization within the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">ODS argues that section II, subdivision h of said resolution is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. The argument, however, is based upon a faulty <em>concept of </em>what is meant by \u201cmanagement employees\u201d which is viewed as a contradiction in terms. But this is confusing ownership with management. The county argues that the designation of management employees was authorized by section 3507.5 and their placement in a separate unit was authorized by section 3507 and that neither the designation nor the creation of the management unit had any effect upon these employees\u2019 right to maintain their membership in ODS, or, if they so elect, to form their own peace officers\u2019 management organization. The county acknowledges that these management employees as an appropriate unit, are free to select ODS as their representative organization. The county\u2019s arguments are persuasive and reconcile the seeming inconsistencies between the code sections involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Our decision herein does not rest upon the estoppel which the county attempts to predicate upon the fact that the action protested was initiated at the request of the officers involved. Basic elements of estoppel are missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Respondent officers\u2019 arguments attacking the finding that lieutenants were properly designated as managerial employees overlook the testimony of the personnel director, as well as that of Lieutenant Hoover which described duties and authority that brought him within the definition of a management employee. The findings in this regard were supported in the record. We explain that this comment is made solely because if the involved employees were not within the definition of management then the import of the resolution and of the later modification could not be considered reasonable under section 3507.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The judgment is reversed and the trial court is instructed to dismiss the petition. Each side will bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Draper, P. J., and Brown (H. C.), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The petition of the plaintiffs and appellants for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 4, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\"> Retired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\"A public agency may adopt reasonable rules and regulations after consultation in good faith with representatives of an employee organization or organizations for the administration of employer-employee relations under this chapter (commencing with Section 3500).
