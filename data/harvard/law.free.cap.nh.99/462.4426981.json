The consideration for the note, and an assignment not material here, was an advance of $2,200 made to James by the plaintiff. All of these facts were known to Comolli.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">Under R. L., c. 366, s. 29, an accommodation maker \u201cis liable on the instrument to a holder for value.\u201d The $2,200 advanced to James by Comolli constituted consideration or value to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>James\u2019 promise as maker as well as that of the defendant. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Favazza, </em>325 Mass. 627; <em>South Side Window Frame Shop </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>(Ill. App.) 13 N. E. (2d) 863; Britton, Bills and Notes, 366. Defendant\u2019s liability would not be affected by the fact that Comolli \u201cat the time of taking the instrument knew him to be only an accommodation party.\u201d <em>S. </em>29. <em>Amodeo </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>94 N. H. 370, 371; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Favazza, supra; </em>Britton, <em>Id., </em>367.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">By signing the note as a maker defendant undertook to pay it according to its tenor and his obligation became primary and absolute the same as that of the ordinary maker of a note. R. L., c. 366, s. 191; <em>Stoughton Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>282 Mass. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Being primarily liable <em>(Cf. Merchants National Bank </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>86 N. H. 144) defendant was not entitled to presentment for payment or to notice of dishonor. R. L., c. 366, <em>ss. </em>70, 89. <em>Bank Commissioners </em>v. <em>Trust Co., </em>70 N. H. 536, 538; <em>Schoenwetter </em>v. <em>Schoenwetter, </em>164 Wis. 131; <em>South Side Window Frame Shop </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>(Ill. App.) 13 N. E. (2d) 863, <em>supra. </em>See <em>Dunning </em>v. <em>Dunning, </em>300 N. Y. 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In view of the conclusion reached it is unnecessary to consider whether plaintiff as payee was or could be a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
