H. 411; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>87 N. H. 391; <em>Worthen </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>90 N. H. 164; <em>Abell </em>v. <em>Company, </em>95 N. H. 439, 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Defendants\u2019 property is a two and a half story apartment house located at the corner of Walnut and West Hollis Streets. Its roof has an approximate pitch of 60 degrees and parts of it join to form a valley. The ground slopes downward in the direction in which the plaintiff was walking at the time of the accident. The house is about six or eight feet from the sidewalk. There is an asphalt covered area or apron from the house to the sidewalk which is approximately five feet wfide with a \u201cpitch of about 4 inches in the corner nearest the valley . . . and the other end pitches in proportion to the foundation.\u201d There is a curb about 6 inches thick and probably 10 inches high between the apron and the sidewalk. The apron pitches toward the sidewalk to keep water out of the cellar and to take care of the drainage from the roof so it will not go into the cellar.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">There was testimony that: \u201cWater accumulates from both roofs at the same time into the valley, then runs over down on to the apron\u201d and \u201cthen from the apron, with that pitch,\u201d it goes \u201con to the sidewalk . . . There is broken-in places where ice constantly forming and melting and reforming again had chewed through the cement,\u201d of the curb between the apron and the sidewalk. \u201cI have seen the rain come off the roof on the hard surface there and roll right on to the sidewalk.\u201d An expert testified that: \u201cGutters properly applied around the edges of the roof at the eaves and a drain spout draining into the city sewerage system in the cellar\u201d or \u201ca dry well dug in between the house and the sidewalk\u201d very likely would take care of all the water coming off the roof.</p>\n<p id=\"AKl\">This accident happened sometime after nine or nine-thirty in the morning of December 30. It was quite cold and below freezing. \u201cDecember 29 the maximum temperature was 34\u00b0, and the minimum 4\u00b0 below zero; snow, one hundredth of an inch. December 30, maximum temperature 45\u00b0, minimum temperature 16\u00b0; snow and rain, one and one-tenth inch.\u201d Such a precipitation is quite heavy and would cause the water to go down the center of the valley and flow out and be concentrated over the apron and on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The condition of sidewalks generally that morning was: \u201cWell, icy, a little snow just covered the ice, and it wasn\u2019t very slippery.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Plaintiff had walked some distance that morning and at the time of the accident was walking easterly on West Hollis Street in the middle of the sidewalk. \u201cI didn\u2019t have no trouble until I came to this spot, and all of a sudden my feet just went up in the air and I landed on my back.\u201d His feet slid \u201ca couple feet ... It was all ice there. Couldn\u2019t get my hands. You know, it was \u2014 slide.\u201d <em>\u201cI </em>could see there was ice there on the curb of the apron as I was trying to get up.\u201d You could get your footing on the other sidewalks \u201cbut you couldn\u2019t get no footing where I fell . . . There was a difference the ice was thicker there and it wasn\u2019t level. It was slant; that is how I happened to fall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">There was sufficient evidence of the defendants\u2019 negligence to take the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The defendants also contend that the facts are such that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Plaintiff was walking slowly on the sidewalk because he knew it was slippery and that underneath the fine coating of snow there was probably ice and he might come to a slippery spot and slip. He knew there was apt to be ice along the sidewalk adjacent to defendants\u2019 premises and he \u201cwalked slow and careful.\u201d He had walked slowly and carefully from the time he left his house because it was slippery and he proceeded in the same manner at the place of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We cannot say that the only inference permissible from that evidence was that the plaintiff fully comprehended the danger and negligently chose to brave it rather than to avoid it. The facts are not so conclusive as to require a finding of contributory negligence as a matter of law. <em>Palmer </em>v. Edgerly, supra, 393; <em>Papakalos </em>v. <em>Shaka, </em>91 N. H. 265, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The defendants\u2019 motions were properly denied and the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
