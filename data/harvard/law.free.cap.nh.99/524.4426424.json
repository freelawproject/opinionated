R. L., c. 312, <em>s. </em>13; Laws 1927, c. 135. Enactment of the bill as proposed to be amended would not alter that prohibition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Your inquiry, as submitted to us, is limited to those provisions relating to advertising. It thus brings into question the constitutionality of existing law.
