L., c. 351, s. 7) the judge of probate affirmed the former probate, so stated orally from the bench in open court and endorsed his decree on the petition. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>97 N. H. 311, 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">No statute requires that notice of this decision be sent to the parties. Nor was there any evidence of a rule of court so requiring or of a well established custom so to do. We therefore agree with defendant\u2019s position that the action of the probate court constituted at least constructive notice of the decree confirming the prior allowance and approval of this will in common form. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>328 Ill. 136, 143; <em>F. Nat. Bk. Spring Mills </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>296 Pa. 192, 196; <em>State ex rel. Harp </em>v. <em>Vanderburgh Circuit Court, </em>227 Ind. 353, 360; 49 C. J. S. 236. This would be sufficient to put in operation the statutory period within which an appeal therefrom was to be taken under Revised Laws, chapter 365, section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In considering whether the conduct of the plaintiff, and more particularly that of her counsel, constituted \u201cmistake, accident or misfortune\u201d and not neglect, it is clear that the statute (R. L., c. 365, s. 7) confers discretion on the Trial Court to decide these matters on the basis of the particular facts involved. <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>98 N. H. 272, 275. However this exercise of discretion calls for a determination of questions of fact and not for dispensation of grace. To be sustained, it must find support in the record. <em>Twardosky </em>v. <em>Company, </em>95 N. H. 279, 285, and cases cited. Such support is lacking in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The findings establish that plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cmust be considered as having known the time limit on appeals,\u201d and also the fact that \u201cthey made no inquiries ... to determine what decree, if any, the [Probate Court] had made.\u201d There was evidence that \u201ctwo or three times a week\u201d one of them was in the registry where the decree was a public record. The other testified that he \u201cnaturally would\u201d have inquired about the decree \u201cbut . . . did have a lot of work to do.\u201d For four months neither asked that he be notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>or made any inquiry. The evidence furnishes no basis for a finding that the plaintiff was \u201cprevented from appealing . . . through mistake, accident or misfortune, and not from . . . neglect\u201d (s. 7, <em>supra) </em>and no such finding was expressly made. On the contrary, it appears that counsel followed \u201ca course of the safety of which [they] could not be certain, in preference to one which [they] knew, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known was safe.\u201d <em>Arnold </em>v. Hay, 95 N. H. 499, 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The purpose of Revised Laws, chapter 365, section 2, \u201cof securing the orderly and expeditious settlement of estates\u201d requires that the petition be dismissed. <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Couture, supra, </em>274; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Hay, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
