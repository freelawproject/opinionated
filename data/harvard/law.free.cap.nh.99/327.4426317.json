Liability having been admitted, the plaintiff, who was pregnant at the time of the accident, testified that upon the collision, \u201cI was thrown back against the steering wheel\u201d and \u201cfelt a severe pain in my back, and I thought I was going to miscarriage my child ... I was black from my kneecap right up through my hip . . . My arm was bruised some, and I had a bruise on my head . . . Immediately following the accident I had a severe backache.\u201d She also testified that she worried a great deal about a possible miscarriage, that she had to remain in bed for a week and was unable to return to full-time work for some three years after her injury because when she tried to work her back pained her so she had to stop. There was corroborative evidence from her employer as to her numerous complaints about her back aching and the date when she returned to a full-time job. It is unnecessary to further detail the evidence on this score; it was ample to support a verdict. The fact no medical testimony was offered is not fatal for the jury were entitled to believe her story as to her injury and ensuing suffering and incapacity and to draw \u201csuch inferences as are justified by the common experiences and observations of mankind.\u201d <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>96 N. H. 138, 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">There was also testimony that she had long been the mainstay of her employer on his chicken farm, having been employed by him for some ten years prior to the accident, that before her injury she tossed about bags of grain, handled heavy chicken crates, was a \u201cvery hard\u201d worker and a \u201cvery good employee.\u201d It was findable she was steadily employed at the time she was hurt, earning $35 to $40 a week and sometimes more. Had she not been incapacitated, the jury could fairly infer from the evidence that she would have continued to earn approximately the same amount. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Company, </em>96 N. H. 14, 17; <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Shattuck, </em>91 N. H. 234, 241, 242. For four months after her injury she earned nothing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and thereafter and until she returned to full-time employment three years after the accident, her earnings dropped sharply, averaging some $33 per month in 1950 and 1951, and $42 per month in 1952. True, there was conflicting evidence and the books which her employer produced to show payments for labor, including those to the plaintiff, were not such as would have aroused the enthusiastic approval of a certified public accountant. As he said, \u201cI\u2019m not a bookkeeper. I\u2019m a farmer.\u201d However, he testified that she was \u201cthe major one that received all the salaries,\u201d regardless of the fact that he paid her husband some money. The jury had an opportunity to size up him and his books. The conflicts and the veracity of the witnesses were for them to resolve as it cannot be said that this is a case where the testimony was such as to be incredible or speculative as a matter of law. <em>Manseau </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>96 N. H. 7, 13, and cases cited. In short, on the entire record the jury could believe that before she was hurt this plaintiff was a robust and hardworking woman, who, as her counsel argued, was no \u201ccream puff\u201d to surrender to petty pains and idleness, and that she suffered a substantial and disabling injury as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The allowance of leading questions was within the Court\u2019s discretion <em>(LePage </em>v. <em>Theberge, </em>97 N. H. 375, 377, 378), and no abuse appears. It seems also the defendant takes nothing by his objections to the argument on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was testifying. We believe in the circumstances that the jury understood from counsel\u2019s explanation of his remarks and from the Court\u2019s instructions, which the jury are presumed to have followed <em>(State </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>95 N. H. 217, 221), that the argument was intended merely to illustrate a point and was not to be taken as testimony. See <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>80 N. H. 252. The Court\u2019s implied finding that plaintiff\u2019s counsel committed no prejudicial error upon this score or in any other aspect, and that the trial was fair <em>(LePage </em>v. <em>Company, </em>97 N. H. 46, 53) is sustainable. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>95 N. H. 194, 197. The amount of the verdict being within the bounds of reason and no further exceptions of merit appearing, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
