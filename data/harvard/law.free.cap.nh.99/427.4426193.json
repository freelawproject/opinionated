Skillings with larceny of $12,000 from the home of Sarah A. Rollins on December 13, 1949, under R. L., c. 452, <em>s. </em>3, as amended by Laws 1949, c. 140, <em>s. </em>1. On a previous transfer of this case we held \u201cthe evidence supporting [this] indictment was clearly sufficient to present an issue for the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Skillings, </em>98 N. H. 203, 207. It would serve no useful purpose to again detail the salient testimony as was done in that opinion because in essentials it is substantially the same, with one important exception. At the first trial, a witness for the State testified he saw the defendant leaving the Rollins home with \u201ca shopping bag.\u201d At the trial which resulted in the present transfer, he stated he saw Skillings \u201ctaking the money out of the bureau which was at the head of [Sarah\u2019s] bed,\u201d and putting it into \u201ca shopping bag, red, white, and blue.\u201d While this was taking place, Sarah was asleep, because, according to the witness, Skillings had \u201cdoped\u201d her by giving her a \u201cjigger with two pills in it.\u201d When asked what he was doing, Skillings told the witness to \u201ckeep [his] mouth shut\u201d and the next day, admonished him further, \u201cif you think anything of your wife and children, I\u2019d keep my mouth shut.\u201d It is apparent that the evidence relied upon to sustain the verdict of guilty on this indictment is more favorable to the State than upon the previous transfer when we held it sufficient to warrant submission to the jury, and the defendant\u2019s exception upon this ground must be overruled. <em>Bean </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>94 N. H. 342, 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>It is claimed, however, that \u201cif the owner or anyone else speaking with the authority of the owner will not swear that the property was lost, then ownership is not established sufficiently to prove or even establish \u2018Corpus Delicti.\u2019 \u201d We find no authority nor persuasive reason in the defendant\u2019s brief or elsewhere to support this contention. It is true that cases may be cited for the proposition that evidence of nonconsent to the taking must come from the owner. But it is \u201cwell established that want of consent may be proven by circumstantial evidence if the alleged owner is dead or incompetent to testify.\u201d <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>State, </em>120 Tex. Cr. 590. In this case Mrs. Rollins, the alleged owner, suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in November preceding the alleged theft, and died in the following April. Other evidence was therefore competent to prove the theft. In the circumstances here, it seems clear that there is no merit in the claim that the owner or someone in her behalf must complain of the theft to support the indictment for larceny, and this exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The defendant also argues that the Court erred in admitting in evidence a prior consistent statement of a witness for the prosecution to rehabilitate his credibility which had been attacked in cross-examination. Our law is firmly established that the admissibility of such evidence rests within the discretion of the Trial Court, and no abuse appearing, the defendant takes nothing by this exception. <em>Marchand </em>v. <em>Company, </em>95 N. H. 422, 425, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Finally, it is contended that since the indictment averred that the larceny was committed on the \u201cthirteenth day of December,\u201d 1949, the Court was in error in charging the jury that if they found the theft occurred \u201con or about December 13th, 1949\u201d they could return a verdict of guilty, provided the other essential elements of larceny were proved. This claim cannot be sustained. Our law is that in the circumstances here, where time is not an element of the crime charged, proof that the event happened on the precise day named in the indictment is not required. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>70 N. H. 330, 331, 332, and cases cited; see also, <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Varney, </em>83 N. H. 467, 472, and cases cited. No other exceptions of merit appearing, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b469-8\">Goodnow, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
