H. 190, 192; <em>Jaques </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>73 N. H. 376, 381; <em>Indian Head Bank </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>96 N. H. 23, 27. \u201cSuch a finding, if supported by any competent evidence, cannot be set aside except under such circumstances as would authorize the setting aside of the verdict of a jury as against the weight of the evidence <em>. ... \u201d Jaques </em>v. <em>Chandler, supra, </em>382; <em>Wisutskie </em>v. <em>Malouin, </em>88 N. H. 242, 246; <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>99 N. H. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Defendant however takes the position that both claimants were chargeable with culpable neglect as a matter of law, that is, that the facts warranted no other reasonable conclusion. <em>Emerson\u2019s Sons </em>v. <em>Cloutman, </em>88 N. H. 59, 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u201cCulpable neglect has been defined to be that which is censorious, faulty or blamable ... It signifies a lack of due diligence . . . It is less than gross carelessness, but more than the failure to use ordinary care, it is culpable want of watchfulness and diligence, the unreasonable inattention and inactivity of \u2018creditors who slumber on their rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>90 N. H. 36, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Isabel Sullivan retained Bolic A. Degasis, Esquire, on or about February 26, 1952. Marie Lucier retained him a few weeks later. She was ill and unable to discuss her claim with him from that date until early January, 1953, after counsel had been stricken with a serious illness which incapacitated him until after February 12, 1953. Although Isabel was available at all times and did give counsel \u201ca barrel of' information\u201d her claim was connected with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that of her mother Marie as they and the deceased all lived together in the same home and for that reason counsel wanted to file the claims together. He was unable to act during the final month of the year allowed for demand. R. L., c. 355, s. 3. Their petition was filed February 26, 1953. The above facts are not such as to compel a finding of culpable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">No evidence was offered relative to the validity or value of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the Court ruled as requested by the defendant that the evidence submitted by plaintiffs relative to the validity or extent of their claim was insufficient to sustain their claim for relief and to entitle them to judgment under R. L., c. 355, s. 28. The Court however allowed plaintiffs \u201cthirty days within which to amend their petition setting forth all the facts upon which their claims are based.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Plaintiffs maintain in their brief that \u201cin the conference with the court, not taken down by the . . . stenographer . . . [they] asked to be permitted to amend their petition by adding a detailed specification, and it was understood that if the court found for the petitioners, counsel would be allowed to amend by adding a specification.\u201d This was denied by defendant\u2019s counsel in oral argument. <em>Gitchell </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>59 N. H. 363, 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Although section 28 requires that a \u201cpetition setting forth all the facts\u201d should be filed there is nothing in the record to show that the Trial Court abused its discretion in granting plaintiffs leave to amend whether a request therefor was made at the hearing or not. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>87 N. H. 270. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Jewell, </em>98 N. H. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
