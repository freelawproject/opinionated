This clause is applicable because the truck was being operated with the permission of Albert, the named insured, towing a trailer not covered by like insurance in the company. Hence there was no coverage except for the financial responsibility law.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\">In paragraph III the policy states that the \u201cunqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured\u201d and any person using the insured vehicle with his permission. It does not follow, however, that the word \u201cinsured\u201d was intended to mean in all contexts and circumstances both the named and the additional insured. In <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>87 N. H. 338, 341, this court held that while the duty of cooperation imposed by a policy upon the assured was an obligation of the husband who had sought the protection of the policy as an additional insured, it was not an obligation of the named insured, his wife, who recovered in tort against him. It was there stated that the requirements of the provision in question were \u201conly meant to apply, in fact, they only have sensible meaning, when the assured is a defendant and when the insurer has assumed the defence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In our opinion the same principle should apply here. A person in the position of the named insured would not reasonably understand <em>(Fireman\u2019s Ind. Co. </em>v. <em>Associates, </em>97 N. H. 434, 436) that the obligation to reimburse was intended to be his in a case where there was no occasion for him to seek the protection of the policy, and where the liability of the company arose solely out of the negligence of an additional insured with which he was not chargeable. In other words, we conclude that the parties intended that only the insured who invokes the protection of the policy should have the obligation to reimburse the company under the clause in question.
