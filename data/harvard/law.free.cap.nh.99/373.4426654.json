E. Sellers, the owner of the vehicle and the person in whose name it was registered, at his residence in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The application for the policy, signed by the agent in Johnstown through whom it was procured, recited that the driver of the car other than the named insured was to be his son, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Donald, and stated that the vehicle was \u201cto be used at Johnstown.\u201d The policy applied to accidents occurring outside the state of Pennsylvania as well as in that state. Even if it were findable, as contended by the plaintiffs, that the agent \u201cprobably knew\u201d that the car was to be used primarily by Donald in the state of New York, the fact remains that the policy was issued in Pennsylvania and \u201ceven performance there, at least in some measure, was contemplated by it.\u201d <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>88 N. H. 346, 348. The liabilities of the company arising out of the contract are to be governed by the law of Pennsylvania, where the policy was issued. <em>Boisvert </em>v. <em>Boisvert, </em>94 N. H. 357, 358; 12 Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, s. 7079.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">One of the company\u2019s obligations under the terms of the policy was to furnish coverage with respect to bodily injury liability to the named insured and also to \u201cany person while using the automobile and any person . . . legally responsible for the use thereof, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or with his permission.\u201d The company\u2019s obligation was thus limited to those cases in which \u201cthe actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or with his permission.\u201d While the acts on the part of Donald Sellers, which it is claimed brought O\u2019Rourke within the coverage of the policy, occurred in the state of New York, the law of that state is not applicable in determining the rights and obligations of the company under this provision. Its substantive rights under a policy issued in Pennsylvania cannot be affected by the laws of New York in the absence of an agreement that they should be. <em>Boisvert </em>v. <em>Boisvert, supra, </em>359.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The principal issue in this action is whether \u201cthe actual use of the automobile\u201d at the time of the accident was \u201cwith [the insured\u2019s] permission\u201d within the interpretation put upon that language by the laws of Pennsylvania. The automobile had been turned over by the insured to his son \u201cfor Donald to . . . use for all purposes as though it were his own.\u201d Under this broad authority, Donald had the right to allow others to drive it and anyone driving with Donald\u2019s permission was also driving with the permission of his father, the named insured. <em>Odden </em>v. <em>Union Indemnity Co., </em>156 Wash. 10. The issue is therefore to be determined on the basis of whether the actual use was with Donald\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The Trial Court found that when Petell asked for the use of the car on September 6, 1951, in order to go to the fair at Syracuse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>he was informed by Donald that \u201che would not lend him the car if O\u2019Rourke was going with him\u201d; that when Venturini later brought a note to Donald from Petell in which the loan of the car was requested, Donald again refused when told by Venturini that O\u2019Rourke was going; and that it was only when he was thereafter informed by Venturini that O\u2019Rourke was not going but that another man named Tempo would go in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s place that Donald gave the keys to Venturini to give to Petell \u201cthereby giving permission to Petell to take the car accompanied by Venturini and Tempo.\u201d After receiving this permission, Petell, Venturini and O\u2019Rourke left the base in Donald\u2019s car, Donald being unaware that O\u2019Rourke instead of Tempo was one of the passengers. These findings of fact are unquestionably warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It is the law of Pennsylvania that while slight and inconsequential deviations from the permitted use will not annul the coverage provided by an omnibus clause similar to or like the one involved here, there is an absence of \u201cpermission\u201d within the meaning of the policy if the car is being used \u201cat a time or place or for a purpose not authorized by the insured.\u201d <em>Laroche </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>335 Pa. 478, 482; <em>Freshkorn </em>v. <em>Marietta, </em>345 Pa. 416. Coverage is not afforded simply on the basis that permission was granted to take and use the car in the first instance. Its use at the time of the casualty must be one which was contemplated when permission was granted. When consent is required not merely for the \u201cuse\u201d but for the \u201cactual use,\u201d as in this case, coverage is dependent upon the existence of permission for the \u201cparticular use\u201d at the time of the accident. The permission must \u201ccover the specific purpose for which the car is being driven.\u201d <em>Laroche </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., supra, </em>483.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">When the accident occurred, the car was being driven at a time and place which Sellers had authorized. In granting permission to Petell to take the car, however, Sellers had not only limited the passengers to Venturini and Tempo but had specifically excluded O\u2019Rourke. The use for which permission was granted to Petell was not simply taking the car to the fair, but the transportation of himself, Venturini, and Tempo to the fair provided O\u2019Rourke was not also transported. It was not contemplated by Sellers that O\u2019Rourke would be a passenger, much less that he would be the driver. The particular use to which the car was being put, insofar as it was being driven by O\u2019Rourke and used for his transportation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>was neither actually nor impliedly within the limits of the permission granted by Sellers to Petell. Unlike the situation in <em>Arcara </em>v. <em>Moresse, </em>258 N. Y. 211, where the thing forbidden related to the operation of the vehicle, the limitation upon the permission given in this case was that the car should not be used at all if O\u2019Rourke was a passenger. Similarly in <em>Glens Falls Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Zurn, </em>87 F. (2d) 988, also relied on by the plaintiffs, the insured consented to the use of the car for the transportation of his son and his friends and the question of permission was concerned with the operation of it by one of the son\u2019s friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The plaintiffs contend, however, that even if the use of the car fell without the limits of the permission given to Petell, the operation of the car by O\u2019Rourke at the time of the accident had been impliedly permitted by Sellers. It cannot be doubted that permission \u201cmay result by implication from ... a course of conduct in which the parties have mutually acquiesced.\u201d <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Duffin, </em>158 Pa. Super. 305, 309; <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Employer\u2019s Liability Assurance Co., </em>318 Pa. 440. The plaintiffs argue that such a permission existed in this case because O\u2019Rourke had implied permission to go in the car as a passenger whenever it was loaned to others; and because \u201cDonald approved the custom of swapping drivers\u201d whenever the car was loaned and thereby impliedly consented to the operation of the car by anyone, including O\u2019Rourke, who might be a passenger in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Whether there had been such a common practice on the part of Sellers as would support a finding that O\u2019Rourke was impliedly permitted by him to go in the car as a passenger on this trip (see <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>115 Pa. Super. 549), as to which we express no opinion, it is apparent that the plaintiffs\u2019 contention as to Sellers\u2019 consent to the exchange of drivers is contrary to the Court\u2019s findings on that subject. \u201cThere was testimony that on other trips in which several men had been in the car that they had been in the habit of changing around. Sellers testified that he did not condone this practice and never knew it, but the Court finds that the exchange of drivers was a normal and habitual use of the borrowed car.\u201d This was not a finding that Sellers approved the custom of swapping drivers. The Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request that it find \u201cthat Donald Sellers knew that when O\u2019Rourke, or other persons, took the car that they took other men along with them, and that they swapped drivers during the trips,\u201d as well as three other requests concerned with Sellers\u2019 knowledge of the swapping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>of driving. The denial of these requests would not amount to a specific finding that Sellers did not know of the swapping <em>(Thistle </em>v. Halstead, 96 N. H. 192, 193) but when considered in conjunction with the findings made on the subject, it seems clear that by its recital of Sellers\u2019 testimony, the Court impliedly found that he \u201cnever knew\u201d of the practice. Without such knowledge on the part of Sellers, his consent to the exchange of drivers cannot be implied. O\u2019Rourke had no permission to operate the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 request that \u201cthere is a presumption that O\u2019Rourke was operating the car with the permission of the owner at the time and place of the accident\u201d was properly denied. The case of <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Mitosky, </em>353 Pa. 401, 408, cited by the plaintiffs, merely holds that in the absence of any evidence that the driver has exceeded the limits of his permission, there is a presumption that he was \u201cacting rightfully rather than wrongfully,\u201d and is not applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The accident happened on September 7, 1951. The defendant company was seasonably informed of it and its investigators took statements from various witnesses in the four months following its occurrence. In March, 1952, a claim was made by a Vermont attorney for damages for the death of Petell and on March 10, 1952, the company replied from its Albany, New York, office as follows: \u201cThis is to inform you that we have completed our investigation into the above matter and that your client\u2019s claim has been given our careful consideration. Since the result of this investigation indicates that responsibility for the accident does not rest with our insured we regret that we must respectfully decline to make any payment.\u201d Thereafter present counsel for the plaintiffs wrote to the company in May and June, 1952. In reply, the company referred to its letter of March 10, 1952, to the Vermont attorney, stating that it there set forth its position with reference to these cases. Suits against O\u2019Rourke to recover for the death of Venturini and Petell were commenced on July 18, 1952. In each case, O\u2019Rourke appeared <em>pro se </em>and the company entered a special appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Before the Trial Court, the plaintiffs claimed that the company\u2019s letter of March 10, 1952, confirmed in June, 1952, merely denied liability for the accident but did not deny insurance coverage and that by not then disclaiming coverage, the company, as to the plaintiffs, waived its right to now do so. The Court properly denied the request of the plaintiffs that the company be found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>have waived its right to deny coverage. Even if the letter be considered as assigning nonliability as the company\u2019s sole reason for refusing to pay, as claimed by the plaintiffs, that did not, under the law of Pennsylvania, constitute a waiver by the company of its claim of noncoverage as an additional reason. Noncoverage was obviously not a reason \u201cwhich could have been remedied or obviated\u201d by the plaintiffs had they known of it. <em>Slater </em>v. <em>General Casualty Co., </em>344 Pa. 410, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Claims were advanced in this court that the company also waived its right to deny coverage because it failed to so inform O\u2019Rourke until more than ten months after the accident and that the company is estopped from claiming that no coverage exists. Neither of these claims were raised at the trial. The issue of waiver was not pleaded by the plaintiffs and when raised by them during the trial was the subject of considerable discussion. The claim then advanced was that the defendant had failed to disclaim coverage to the plaintiffs, not to O\u2019Rourke. The Court specifically inquired of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel: \u201cDo I understand . . . your claim is by not disclaiming coverage to your client or to you as counsel for the plaintiff that that constitutes a waiver?\u201d To this inquiry, counsel replied: \u201cYes . . . under the law as we understand it.\u201d It was this claim as to waiver that the Presiding Justice was called upon to consider. None other was stated. A ground of recovery not presented at the trial will not be considered here. <em>Fitch Company </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>99 N. H. 1; <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Company, </em>82 N. H. 543, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The defendant company is not obligated, under its policy issued to O. E. Sellers, to provide coverage for the defendant O\u2019Rourke nor to pay any claims or defend any action against him or Petell arising out of the accident of September 7, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">After the Court\u2019s findings of fact had been made, the plaintiffs filed a motion for voluntary nonsuit. \u201cAfter verdict there can be no nonsuit.\u201d <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 397. The denial of this motion as a matter of law was proper. In making its findings of fact, the Court took the place of the jury. As to the facts, its findings constitute the verdict. The questions transferred to this court by the Trial Court were ones of law only. As to the facts, the plaintiffs have had all the trial of their suit to which they are entitled. They cannot avoid the results of an action which they themselves started and prosecuted, by now becoming nonsuit. The cases relied on by them in which the plaintiffs were permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>to take a nonsuit after the verdict was set aside <em>(Simpson </em>v. <em>Gafney, </em>66 N. H. 477) and after the case had been reopened by Court order for further evidence <em>(Saykaly </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>97 N. H. 4), are not in point. In neither case was a verdict in existence when the nonsuit was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Nor does the action of the plaintiffs in filing motions for voluntary nonsuits in the civil actions brought by them against O\u2019Rourke affect this result. The commencement of this action was not dependent upon them. Without them, the company\u2019s claim of noncoverage is still \u201csufficiently definite to constitute a genuine threat or prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s interest\u201d to support the present action to its conclusion. <em>Merchants Mutual &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Kennett, </em>90 N. H. 253, 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
