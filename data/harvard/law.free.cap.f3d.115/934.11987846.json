The City removed the action to federal district court based on federal subject matter jurisdiction and filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. The district court granted the motion on the federal claim and remanded the case to state court for determination of the remaining state law claims. For the reasons explained by the district court in its orders, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>At the outset we must determine whether we can review the district court\u2019s order dismissing the federal claim and remanding the remaining claims to state court. Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) generally precludes appellate review of an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed, where (as here) the remand order is a consequence of the dismissal of claims creating federal jurisdiction, that dismissal is reviewable on appeal. <em>See Armstrong v. Alabama Power Co., </em>667 F.2d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir.1982) (recognizing that, although order of remand not appealable, decree of dismissal must, perforce, precede order of remand and is appealable).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">Condominium alleges that the City provides, without charge, waste collection services to residential premises unless the property is owned as a condominium and that the failure to accord condominium owners this service constitutes a denial of equal protection in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Condominium does not contend that the City\u2019s ordinances draw a distinction based on a suspect classification, such as race, alienage, national origin, indigence or illegitimacy. Instead, the contention is that the distinction is based on the form of ownership,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which is not among the \u201csuspect\u201d classifications recognized by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Nor can Condominium contend that a fundamental right is implicated: the right to free waste collection is no fundamental right. <em>See Goldstein v. City of Chicago, </em>504 F.2d 989, 991-92 (7th Cir.1974) (denying claimed violation of equal protection clause by condominium owners based on provision of free garbage collection to single-family residences); <em>Szczurek v. City of Park Ridge, </em>97 Ill.App.3d 649, 52 Ill.Dec. 698, 422 N.E.2d 907 (1981) (upholding validity, against equal protection challenge, of city ordinance providing free sanitation collection to single-family residences but not to multi-family residences).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The applicable standard for testing the constitutionality of the City\u2019s pertinent ordinance is the \u201crational-basis\u201d standard. <em>Clements v. Fashing, </em>457 U.S. 957, 961-63, 102 S.Ct. 2836, 2843, 73 L.Ed.2d 508 (1982). This standard \u201crequires that classifications made by the challenged statutes or ordinances be rationally related to the achievement of some legitimate government purpose.\u201d <em>Haves v. City of Miami </em>52 F.3d 918, 921 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Determining whether legislation survives rational-basis scrutiny is a two-step process. The first step is to identity a legitimate government purpose the enacting governmental body could have been pursuing. <em>Id. </em>The actual motivations of the legislators are unimportant, and the decisionmakers are not required to articulate a reason for their acts. <em>Id. </em>at 921-922. The second step of the rational-basis inquiry is to determine \u201cwhether a rational basis exists to believe that the legislation would further the hypothesized purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922. Here the inquiry is whether a conceivably rational-basis exists, \u201cnot whether that basis was actually considered by the legislative body.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">Efficient sanitation is a legitimate goal; the provision of free waste collection service to residential premises consisting of four or fewer units is rationally related to achieving that goal. If we assume, as Condominium contends, that all condominiums are excluded, a legislature still could believe that \u2014 because of the benefits of a larger scale \u2014 condominium owners (through their representative condominium association) generally enjoy greater bargaining power with private waste removal services. That the legislature did not articulate this presumed goal \u2014 sanitation\u2014or the rationale for its classification \u2014 scale and bargaining power\u2014 is not important. <em>Id. </em>at 921-922.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">A government is not required to provide sanitation service to all or none; the Equal Protection Clause does not always preclude a legislature from treating some of its citizens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>differently from others. <em>See Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., </em>410 U.S. 356, 357-59, 93 S.Ct. 1001, 1003, 35 L.Ed.2d 351 (1973). A government\u2019s line-drawing need not be accomplished with mathematical precision \u2014 rough accommodations are tolerated even if some inequality results. <em>See Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 483-85, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). The usual presumption is that the legislature has acted constitutionally. <em>See Clements, </em>457 U.S. at 961-63, 102 S.Ct. at 2843.</p>\n<p id=\"AGpM\">That the City may have sought to achieve the legitimate state interest in sanitation by providing, at no cost, waste collection service to individuals or small groups of individuals less likely to have sufficient bargaining power to obtain such services at a reasonable price satisfies rational-basis scrutiny and, therefore, constitutes no violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"AOY\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED for return to state court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-6\"> For our purposes, it is unimportant whether the classification was, in reality, ownership based (as Condominium contends) or numerically based (as the City contends). The important point is that a legislature could reasonably assume condominium owners tend to reside in larger facilities and with their representative condominium association are likely to be better positioned to negotiate with private sanitation services.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
