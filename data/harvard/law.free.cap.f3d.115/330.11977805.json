SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Hugh Dreher appeals a summary judgment in which the district court refused to declare that he has not been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) (West Supp.1997). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Dreher entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>in August 1987 to two counts involving mail fraud: conspiracy to commit mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and mail fraud and aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 &amp; 1342. The charges arose from a scheme by which Dreher, an independent contractor under a construction contract with International Paper Company and PAP-CO, Inc., sought reimbursement for work and materials that he claimed to have supplied, when in fact they had been supplied by International Paper and PAPCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">In September 1995, after having completed his prison and probation sentences, Dreher sought restoration of his firearm privileges that had been revoked pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (West Supp.1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Dreher petitioned the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(e), for relief from \u00a7 922(g)(1), he received no response.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, Dreher filed the instant declaratory judgment action asking the district court to declare that he is not a convicted felon under \u00a7 921(a)(20) because he falls into the \u201cbusiness offenses\u201d exception of \u00a7 921(a)(20)(A) or, in the alternative, to enter a judgment restoring his firearm privileges pursuant to \u00a7 925(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">The district court denied relief, concluding that the criminal statutes under which Dre-her was convicted do not seek to preserve competition in the marketplace, the focus of the \u201cbusiness offenses\u201d exception. The court dismissed Dreher\u2019s \u00a7 925(c) claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that the language of \u00a7 925(c) permits the court to review ATF denials of firearms disabilities applications only.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-17\">Because Dreher has abandoned on appeal his \u00a7 925(c) claim, we address his \u00a7 921(a)(20) claim only. Dreher submits that, because his criminal activities \u2014 billing for services not rendered \u2014 permitted him to submit lower bids to International Paper and PAPCO than otherwise possible and thereby to destroy the competitive bidding process and injure its (Dreher\u2019s) competitors, his \u201coffenses pertain[ ] to antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, restraints of trade, or other similar offenses relating to the regulation of business practices.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-19\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Hanks v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., </em>953 F.2d 996, 997 (5th Cir.1992). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The starting point for statutory interpretation is the language of the statute. <em>See Kellogg v. United States {In re </em>West Texas Marketing Corp.), 54 F.3d 1194, 1200 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 523, 133 L.Ed.2d 430 (1995). Absent congressional direction to the contrary, words in statutes are to be construed according to their \u201cordinary, contemporary, common meaning[s].\u201d <em>Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>507 U.S. 380, 388, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 1495, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). Where the statute\u2019s language is plain, \u2018\u201cthe sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enters., </em>489 U.S. 235, 241, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 1030, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989) (citation omitted). \u201cIf the language of a provision ... is sufficiently clear in its context and not at odds with the legislative history, it is unnecessary to examine the additional considerations of policy ... that may have influenced the lawmakers in their formulation of the statute.\u201d <em>Randall v. Loftsgaarden, </em>478 U.S. 647, 656, 106 S.Ct. 3143, 3149, 92 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Section 921(a)(20) states in pertinent part, \u201cThe term \u2018crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u2019 does not include \u2014 (A) any Federal or State offenses pertaining to antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, restraints of trade, or other similar offense relating to the regulation of business practices.\u201d Dreher urges that the focus of this section is on the actions perpetrated by the defendant that comprise the punishable crime. Thus, according to Dreher, the term \u201coffenses\u201d in \u00a7 921(a)(20)(A) refers to the facts underlying the charged crime \u2014 here, Dreher\u2019s unlawful billing of International Paper and PAPCO for services not rendered. Dreher continues that, because his underlying activities destroyed the competitive bidding process and injured its competitors, his \u201coffenses\u201d (i.e., his actions that comprise the charged offense) \u201cpertain[ ] to antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, restraints of trade, or other similar offenses relating to the regulation of business practices.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">We agree with the government that the plain meaning of the term \u201coffenses\u201d in the context of the statute is the charged violation of law, not the facts underlying the violation of law. <em>Cf. </em>WebsteR\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1566 (1986). Thus, the statute excludes from the applicable crimes \u201c(A) any Federal or State [violations of law] pertaining to antitrust violations ... or other similar [violations of law] relating to the regulation of business, or (B) any State [violation of law] classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To define the term \u201coffenses\u201d as Dreher has suggested makes little sense within the context of the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., United States v. Meldish, </em>722 F.2d 26, 28 (2d Cir.1983) (looking to the elements of the conviction only to determine whether the \u201coffense\u201d has an anti-competitive effect); <em>United States v. McLemore, 792 </em>F.Supp. 96, 98 (S.D.Ala.1992) (noting that \u201c[t]he government must live with its decision to prosecute Mr. McLemore\u2019s odometer rollback activity as a Title 15 trade offense [which is defined as an unfair trade practice], rather than as Title 18 mail fraud or wire fraud offense [which is not an unfair trade practice].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">The \u201coffenses\u201d (or violations of law) of which Dreher was convicted are conspiracy to commit mail fraud and mail fraud, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1341. To prove conspiracy under \u00a7 371, the government must show: (1) an agreement between two or more persons to commit an unlawful act and (2) an overt act by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the agreement. <em>See United States v. Schmick, </em>904 F.2d 936, 941 (5th Cir.1990). To convict under \u00a7 1341, the government must prove (1) a scheme to defraud; (2) intent to defraud; and (3) use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>28 F.3d 477, 481 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Because violations of \u00a7\u00a7 371 &amp; 1341 in no way depend on whether they have an effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>upon competition, they are not offenses\u201d that are excluded from the \u00a7 921(a)(20) definition of \u201ccrimes punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d Thus, we agree with the district court that, pursuant to \u00a7 922(g)(1), Dreher has been convicted of a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-13\">. Section 922(g)(1) provides in pertinent part, \"It shall be unlawful for any person. \u2014 (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-20\">. Dreher acknowledged in the district court that the ATF had informed him that it could not act on his request for relief under \u00a7 925(c) because Congress had ceased to provide funding for this purpose. <em>See </em>Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1993, Pub.L. No. 102-393, 106 Stat. 1729 (1992). Since 1992, Congress has continued to deny funds for this purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\">. For example, the statute would read as follows: \"[C]rimes punishable\u201d excludes \"(A) any Federal or State [sets of facts underlying a charged crime] pertaining to antitrust violations ... or other similar [sets of facts underlying a charged crime] relating to the regulation of business practices, or (B) any State [set of facts underlying a charged crime] classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
