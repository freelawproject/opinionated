Master Employee Benefits Plan Administrative Committee (the SONAT Committee) appeals from a judgment that it wrongfully set off the proceeds of a Jones Act settlement against benefits owed to Plaintiff-Appellee John M. Jones under the SONAT Inc. Disability Plan (the SONAT Plan). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b166-18\">Jones was injured while in the course and scope of his employment for Southern Natural Gas Co. (SONAT). As a result of his injury, Jones was totally and permanently disabled for purposes of the Louisiana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LWCA), LaRev. StatAnn. \u00a7 23:1021 <em>et seq., </em>social security disability benefits, and \u00a7 1.24 of the SONAT Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-19\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3.01 of the SONAT Plan, the parties stipulated that Jones was entitled to a plan benefit of $805.66 per month, subject to any setoff under \u00a7 3.04. Under \u00a7 3.04, any plan benefits to which Jones was entitled would be further reduced by the full amount of any \u201cpayment for disability\u201d that he received under the LWCA or other worker\u2019s compensation scheme \u201cor any legislation of similar purpose, which payment arises as a result of a disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-20\">Jones collected compensation under the LWCA at the maximum rate of $1,135.33 per month from shortly after the date of injury to May 24, 1989. Jones\u2019s combined LWCA and social security benefits exceeded his entitlement under- the SONAT Plan until May 24, 1989; therefore, he received no plan benefits during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-21\">On August 16, 1988, Jones sued SONAT under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 688, claiming that his injuries were due to SO-NAT\u2019s negligence. In April 1989, prior to trial of the Jones Act claim, the parties settled, <em>specifically excluding any claims arising out of his employee benefits plans. </em>The settlement of $260,000.00 (not counting $30,-000.00 to Jones\u2019s wife for loss of consortium) has an actuarial monthly value of $1,135.33 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-22\">After Jones\u2019s entitlement to LWCA benefits expired in May 1989, he did not receive any additional benefits from the SONAT Plan. Jones appealed his denial of benefits to the SONAT Committee. The Committee determined that the full amount of the settlement should be set off, under \u00a7 3.04 of the plan, against Jones\u2019s plan benefits. Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>then brought this present suit, challenging the SONAT Committee\u2019s denial of his Plan benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The district court held that the SONAT Committee had abused its discretion in deciding to set off the Jones Act settlement against the benefits due Jones under the SONAT Plan. The district court ordered the SONAT Plan to pay Jones $805.66 per month from May 25, 1989 until Jones reaches age 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Because Jones\u2019s action is brought under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Godwin v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, </em>980 F.2d 323, 329 (5th Cir.1992). The Supreme Court has held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">a denial of benefits challenged under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a <em>de novo </em>standard <em>unless </em>the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.... Of course, if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest, that conflict must be weighed as a \u201cfacto[r] in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\"><em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 956-57, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989) (quoting Restatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 187 cmt. d (1959)) (emphasis added). The parties do not dispute that the SONAT Committee, as administrator of the SONAT Plan, (1) had \u201cdiscretionary authority ... to construe the terms of the plan,\u201d and (2) was \u201coperating under a possible or actual conflict of interest.\u201d Therefore, our task is to ascertain whether the SONAT Committee abused its discretion by denying Jones his SONAT Plan benefits under \u00a7 3.04 of the plan. <em>Wildbur v. ARCO Chem. Co., </em>974 F.2d 631, 636 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Kennedy v. Electricians Pension Plan, IBEW </em># <em>995, </em>954 F.2d 1116, 1121 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">A. \u201cLegal Correctness\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">In analyzing the SONAT Committee\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3.04, we must first decide whether the Committee\u2019s interpretation of the plan was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc., </em>900 F.2d 53, 56 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 939, 111 S.Ct. 344, 112 L.Ed.2d 308 (1990). Factors to be considered in making this decision are: (1) whether the SONAT Committee has uniformly construed \u00a7 3.04 in the past; (2) whether the Committee\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3.04 in Jones\u2019s case is consistent with a fair reading of the Plan; and (3) whether the interpretation results in any unanticipated costs. <em>See id; accord Wildbur, </em>974 F.2d at 637-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">While the SONAT Committee argues that it applied a setoff in the one prior instance\u2014the \u201cIkerd case\u201d\u2014where a SONAT employee had received a settlement similar to Jones\u2019s, there is some disagreement as to the similarity between Ikerd\u2019s and Jones\u2019s claims against SONAT. There was also testimony before the district court that the Committee would not set off tort settlements achieved by SONAT employees injured in automobile accidents\u2014casting serious doubt on their contention that one purpose of their interpretation of \u00a7 3.04 was to \u201cachieve parity between onshore and offshore workers\u201d\u2014 or employees who were injured by a third party <em>(i.e., </em>not SONAT) and who got recovery from that third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">Moreover, the Committee\u2019s decision fails the \u201cfair reading\u201d test. The SONAT Committee unfairly characterized Jones\u2019s settlement as a worker\u2019s compensation settlement, or one \u201cpursuant to ... any other legislation of similar purpose,\u201d which would be covered by \u00a7 3.04. In the first place, Jones sued SONAT under the Jones Act, and the settlement was reached in that action. In the second place, the settlement included $30,000 for Mrs. Jones\u2019s loss of consortium claim which could only arise under the Jones Act. The record establishes that the settlement was a Jones Act settlement, and the SONAT Committee was \u201clegally incorrect\u201d in setting off the entire settlement against Jones\u2019s SO-NAT Plan benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>B. Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">Having decided that the Committee\u2019s interpretation was \u201clegally incorrect,\u201d we must next determine whether the Committee abused its discretion. <em>Wildbur, </em>974 F.2d at 637. Mere error will not warrant supplanting the Committee\u2019s decisionmaking authority. <em>Kennedy, </em>954 F.2d at 1124. We consider the following factors in assessing whether the Committee abused its discretion: (1) whether the Committee\u2019s interpretation is internally consistent \"with the remainder of the Plan; (2) whether the Committee\u2019s interpretation comports with any relevant regulations formulated by the appropriate administrative agencies; (3) whether the factual background supports the Committee\u2019s determination; and (4) any inferences of lack of good faith on the Committee\u2019s part. <em>See Wildbur, </em>974 F.2d at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Focusing on the question of lack of good faith, we are guided by the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">[A] wrong but apparently reasonable interpretation is arbitrary and capricious if it advances the conflicting interest of the fiduciary at the expense of the affected beneficiary or beneficiaries unless the fiduciary justifies the interpretation on the ground of its benefit to the class of all participants and beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\"><em>Brown v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama, Inc., </em>898 F.2d 1556, 1566-67 (11th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1040, 111 S.Ct. 712, 112 L.Ed.2d 701 (1991), <em>quoted with approval in Wildbur, </em>974 F.2d at 638; <em>see also Lowry v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Retirement Plan, </em>871 F.2d 522, 525 n. 6 (5th Cir.) (describing a \u201csliding scale\u201d judicial review of trustees\u2019 decisions for lack of good faith as being \u201cmore penetrating the greater ... the suspicion of partiality, less penetrating the smaller that suspicion\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 852, 110 S.Ct. 152, 107 L.Ed.2d 111 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">As the district court found, there is a significant potential conflict of interest here, since all members of the SONAT Committee at the time of Jones\u2019s claim denial were SONAT corporate officers. Furthermore, a complete setoff clearly advanced SONAT\u2019s conflicting interest \u2014 reducing benefit outlays from an unfunded employee welfare plan \u2014 at the expense of the affected beneficiary\u2014 Jones. Finally, the SONAT Committee fails to justify its decision in terms of greater benefit to the class of Plan participants and beneficiaries. We therefore conclude that the SONAT Committee did abuse its discretion in deciding to set off the full amount of Jones\u2019s settlement against benefits due him under the SONAT Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">We find that the SONAT Committee was legally incorrect and abused its discretion when it decided to set off the full amount of Jones\u2019s settlement against his SONAT Plan benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
