Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>103 M.S.P.R. 234 (M.S.P.B.2006), which denied rehearing of its initial decision denying her petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement, <em>Henson v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>DA-0752-03-0645-C-1 (M.S.P.B. Mar. 9, 2006). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-31\">Here, Henson failed to carry her burden in establishing that the settlement agreement was breached. Indeed, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>agreement does not require the amended SF-50 to be sent to her, failing to send it to her does not constitute a breach. Nor do we find any error in the board\u2019s conclusion that Henson failed to establish that the amended SF-Z50 was not issued by the Marshals Service within a reasonable time, particularly in light of evidence that it was issued within two months of the agreement. In addition, because the board has discretion in whether to allow a hearing concerning petitions for enforcement, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.183(a)(3), we find no merit to Henson\u2019s contention that she was improperly denied a hearing. Finally, we find no evidence to support Henson\u2019s contention that she was denied subsequent employment due to the Marshals Services\u2019 actions or inaction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
