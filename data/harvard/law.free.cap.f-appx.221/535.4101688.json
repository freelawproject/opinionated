He argues that the district court erred in failing to suppress evidence obtained through the use of a telephone wiretap because the wiretap application failed to meet the statutory requirement of \u201cnecessity.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">\u201cTitle III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518, prohibits electronic surveillance by the federal government except under specific circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Canales Gomez, </em>358 F.3d 1221, 1224 (9th Cir.2004). The Government\u2019s application must include \u201ca full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2518(l)(c). We have emphasized \u201cthe statutory presumption against this intrusive method\u201d and have interpreted these statutory prerequisites as a \u201cnecessity\u201d requirement. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, Inc., </em>412 F.3d 1102, 1112 (9th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, we evaluate the presence of \u201cnecessity\u201d using \u201ca \u2018common sense approach[,]\u2019 ... [and] law enforcement officials need not exhaust every conceivable alternative before obtaining a wiretap.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>388 F.3d 1199, 1235-36 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Canales Gomez, </em>358 F.3d at 1225-26).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-15\">We agree with the district court that the affidavit supporting the wiretap constituted a full and complete statement of the facts; any omissions were not material and could not have led the \u201cjudge inappropriately to find necessity for [the] wiretap order.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, Inc., </em>412 F.3d at 1110. The affidavit described at length, and with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>reference to the subject investigation, why-traditional techniques had been or would prove to be unsuccessful or too dangerous; it detailed the attempts to use and specific problems with undercover agents, confidential sources, controlled buys, surveillance, search warrants, arrests, interviews, and grand jury questioning. In light of this detail, the minor omissions, such as the fact that the use of traffic stops as an investigatory technique had <em>also </em>been tried with only limited success, does not change the tenor of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">On this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding necessity for the wiretap. Although the DEA had some success using traditional techniques, the investigation had been unable to identify the \u201csources of supply, couriers used by the organization, distributors and others who are criminally assisting.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>219 F.3d 1117, 1122 (9th Cir.2000). Further, in cases that, like this one, involve a criminal conspiracy, we have allowed wiretaps when, although traditional techniques \u201cprovided much of the investigation\u2019s preliminary information,\u201d only a wiretap would \u201cpenetrate the inner workings of the drug conspiracy\u201d and \u201cidentify and investigate the whole of the network, including the <em>entire </em>hierarchy of suppliers, transporters, distributors, customers, and money launderers.\u201d <em>Canales Gomez, </em>358 F.3d at 1224-25 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Finally, Ruiz-Maldonado contends that the affidavit relied too heavily on \u201cinherent limitations\u201d of normal investigative procedures, <em>United States v. Blackmon, </em>273 F.3d 1204, 1210 (9th Cir.2001), but we have upheld necessity findings regardless of any such reliance so long as the supporting affidavits were not \u201cplagued by material misrepresentations and omissions,\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>388 F.3d at 1237. Here, the DEA conducted a lengthy investigation before seeking a wiretap. The affidavit described the many traditional techniques attempted with only limited results. Given the \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d that we afford necessity findings, <em>United States v. McGuire, </em>307 F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir.2002), we will not second guess the district court\u2019s determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b564-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
