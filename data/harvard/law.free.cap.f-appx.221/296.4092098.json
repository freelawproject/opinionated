Pazir contends that the IJ erred in finding that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel at the February 5, 2004 hearing. We have reviewed the record and conclude that this contention is without merit. <em>See Delgado-Corea v. INS, </em>804 F.2d 261, 263 (4th Cir.1986). Next, we reject Pazir\u2019s claims that the IJ and government counsel behaved inappropriately and unfairly, or violated his right to due process, at the February 5, 2004 hearing. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320 (4th Cir.2002). Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance from the March 1, 2004 hearing. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
