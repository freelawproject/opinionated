At sentencing the judge applied a statute requiring consecutive terms for multiple convictions if any one of them is a Class X felony and the defendant \u201cinflicted severe bodily injury.\u201d <em>See </em>730 ILCS \u00a7 5/5-8-4(a)(i). The judge found that Hong inflicted severe bodily injury on Rose \u2014 one of the razor cuts penetrated her arm nearly to the bone, causing potentially life-threatening blood loss \u2014 and sentenced him to consecutive terms of 8 years for the home invasion and 14 years for the attempted murder. Hong later sought postconviction relief from the state courts on the premise that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), requires the jury, not the judge, to make the finding of \u201csevere bodily injury\u201d before consecutive sentences can be mandatory. The state courts rejected this argument, as did the district court when Hong repeated it in this action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Hong appeals the district court\u2019s ruling, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\"><em>Apprendi </em>holds that facts other than prior convictions must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt before they can be used to increase the punishment for a crime \u201cbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The state appellate court \u2014 the last Illinois court to reach the merits of Hong\u2019s claim \u2014 cited two decisions from the state supreme court in holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to consecutive sentencing. <em>See People v. Carney, </em>196 Ill.2d 518, 256 Ill.Dec. 895, 752 N.E.2d 1137, 1147 (2001); <em>People v. Wagener, </em>196 Ill.2d 269, 256 Ill.Dec. 550, 752 N.E.2d 430, 441 (2001). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), that decision is entitled to deference from the federal courts unless it is \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Lamon v. Boatwright, </em>467 F.3d 1097, 1100-01 (7th Cir.2006). Clearly established federal law for purposes of \u00a7 2254 consists of \u201cthe holdings, as opposed to the dicta,\u201d of the Supreme Court \u201cat the time of the relevant state-court decision.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Hong is free to base an argument on <em>Apprendi </em>because the case was decided while his convictions were on direct appeal. <em>See Jones v. Hulick, </em>449 F.3d 784, 790 (7th Cir.2006). But the Supreme Court has never held that <em>Apprendi </em>applies to factual findings used to impose consecutive sentences. Indeed, we and several other circuits have held that, so long as the sentence for each individual count does not exceed its statutory maximum, a judge may impose consecutive sentences based on a fact not found by the jury. <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>389 F.3d 514, 531\u201432 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Pressley, </em>345 F.3d 1205, 1213 (11th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Hollingsworth, </em>298 F.3d 700, 702 (8th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Noble, </em>299 F.3d 907, 909-10 (7th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. White, </em>240 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir.2001). Home invasion and attempted murder both carry a statutory maximum of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment. 720 ILCS \u00a7\u00a7 6/8-4(c)(l), 5/12-ll(c); 730 ILCS 5/5-8-l(a)(3). Because Hong\u2019s sentence for each offense is well under that maximum, the decision of the Illinois appellate court was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">For the sake of completeness, we add that Hong gains nothing by citing to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely </em>more than three years after Hong\u2019s convictions became final, and thus, unless <em>Blakely </em>applies retroactively, we may not even consider its application to Hong\u2019s claim. <em>See Muth v. Frank, </em>412 F.3d 808, 816 (7th Cir.2005). It remains an open question whether <em>Blakely </em>applies retroactively on collateral review, <em>see Burton v. Stewart, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 793, 794, 166 L.Ed.2d 628 (2007), but Hong could not benefit even if it does. <em>Blakely </em>did not apply the <em>Apprendi </em>rule to consecutive sentencing decisions; instead, the case holds that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d 542 U.S. at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis omitted). Here, the jury\u2019s verdict authorized a sentence of up to 30 years on each count without any additional findings by the judge. Thus, even if <em>Blakely </em>applied to this case, there is no <em>Blakely </em>violation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
