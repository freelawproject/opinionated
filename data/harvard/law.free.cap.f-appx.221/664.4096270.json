To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss in part, deny in part, and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the petitioners\u2019 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because they failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201can alien who argues ineffective assistance of counsel [is required to] exhaust his administrative remedies by first presenting the issue to the BIA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-25\">To the extent the petitioners challenge the agency\u2019s discretionary hardship determination, we lack jurisdiction. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-26\">The petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA violated their due process rights by granting their previous counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is unavailing. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>PaMlla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the agency for further proceedings regarding voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
