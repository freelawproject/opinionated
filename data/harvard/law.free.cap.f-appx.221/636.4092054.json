To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider, <em>see Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005), and review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>see Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Jaswal\u2019s motion to reconsider as untimely where it was filed more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Moreover, the BIA acted within its discretion in not construing the motion as a motion to reopen where it faded to offer new facts or evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (explaining that \u201ca motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be proven ... if the motion is granted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">Jaswal\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider violated due process is unavailing. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (to prevail on a due process challenge, a petitioner must show error).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-18\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing Jaswal\u2019s direct appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s decision because the petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b665-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
