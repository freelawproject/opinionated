In her amended complaint in this case, she sought money damages from Naphcare, Inc., which provided medical care for inmates at BCCF, ten physicians, and thirty-eight other individuals, including BCCF\u2019s Director of Nursing, several nurses and correctional officers and the warden. The amended complaint contained four counts; Counts II, III, IV, V, VI, and VII each incorporated by reference the allegations of all preceding counts. Reduced to their essentials, these counts presented two bases for liability: (1) the defendants failed to exercise the care, skill, and diligence as other similar health care providers would have afforded Cassady under the circumstances, as required by the Alabama Medical Liability Act (AMLA), Ala.Code \u00a7 6-5-480 <em>et seq., </em>and \u00a7 6-5-540 <em>et seq., </em>and (2) the defendants were deliberately indifferent to Cassady\u2019s serious medical needs, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and, thus, were answerable in damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. By the time the district court disposed of this case via the summary judgment now before us for review, the defendants were Naphcare, three physicians, Drs. Lang Huynh, George Lyrene and Uchenna Ifediba, Director of Nursing Robert Nichols (RN), a certified registered nurse practitioner, Belinda Hogue (CRNP), and a licensed practical nurse, Eula Smith (LPN).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-19\">The district court granted these defendants summary judgment in a comprehensive 91-page Memorandum of Opinion and final judgment issued on May 5, 2006. The court rejected the plaintiffs AMLA claim on two grounds. First, the plaintiffs experts failed to satisfy the AMLA re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>quirement that they be \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to the defendants, i.e., those involved in the patient\u2019s, i.e., Cassady\u2019s, care and treatment. Second, the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendants\u2019 alleged negligence \u201cprobably\u201d caused Cassady\u2019s death. As the district court expressed it on page 46 of its Memorandum of Opinion, \u201cPlaintiff has not met her burden of establishing that there is more than a mere possibility that the doctor\u2019s alleged negligence caused Cassady\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The court rejected the plaintiffs constitutional claim under \u00a7 1983 on the ground that the plaintiff failed to establish the components of an Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim against any of the defendants; that is, that the defendant was aware of Cassady\u2019s serious medical needs and yet was deliberately indifferent to such needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">The plaintiff now appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment rulings. She contends that the court erred in rejecting her experts\u2019 testimony that the defendants\u2019 conduct fell below the standard of care required in a correctional facility; in concluding that she failed to demonstrate more than a mere possibility that the defendants\u2019 alleged negligence caused Cassady\u2019s death; and in concluding that she failed to present a case that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to Cassady\u2019s serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Her arguments replicate those she presented to the district court in responding to the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The district court thoroughly considered those arguments, as its Memorandum of Opinion reflects. We find no error in the court\u2019s analysis of the claims presented, and agree with its disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
