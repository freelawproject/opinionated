We have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to reconsider pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We have jurisdiction to review the denial of a SAW application pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(3). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-24\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Vaquero\u2019s motion to reconsider because she did not identify an error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s June 17, 2004 decision. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b) (requiring a motion to reconsider to specify error of fact or law in original decision). Contrary to Vaquero\u2019s assertion, the BIA\u2019s dismissal of her appeal was not in conflict with <em>Matter of Ige, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 880 (BIA 1994). Vaquero\u2019s contention that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>agency did not consider evidence of the birth of her fifth child is not supported by the record, and Vaquero\u2019s contention that the BIA did not consider her legal argument is unavailing because she did not submit a timely brief to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We reverse a decision of the LAU where it abuses its discretion or makes findings that are contrary to clear and convincing facts contained in the record considered as a whole. <em>Perez-Martin v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 752, 758 (9th Cir.2005). It was not abuse of discretion for the LAU to dismiss Vaquero\u2019s appeal where the government offered rebuttal evidence which called into question her claim of employment for Pascasio Ramirez and where Vaquero\u2019s initial SAW application omitted any reference to her claim of employment for Maria Mireles.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Vaquero\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
