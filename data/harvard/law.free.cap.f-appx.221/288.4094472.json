Champ, pursuant to 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-945 (2000). Our review of the record discloses that the Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>West Virginia Coal Workers\u2019 Pneumoconiosis Fund v. Champ, </em>No. 05-569-BLA (BRB June 22, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-17\"> On appeal, the Fund asserts that Champ should have been required to render a designation of x-ray evidence in proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge, and that the Administrative Law Judge erred by failing to consider pulmonary evaluation reports prepared by Dr. Castle and Dr. Forehand. We deem these contentions waived, however, as they were not presented during the course of the administrative proceedings. <em>See Armco, Inc. v. Martin, </em>277 F.3d 468, 476 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
