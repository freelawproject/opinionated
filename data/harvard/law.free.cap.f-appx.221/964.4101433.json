In addition, Aguilar was charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2. Aguilar pleaded guilty to all three counts, and was sentenced to 248 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Aguilar argues that his sentence is unreasonable. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">Aguilar and Medina were arrested after a confidential source arranged a half-pound methamphetamine purchase with Medina. A search of the vehicle in which Aguilar, Medina, and a juvenile were sitting uncovered a box containing 155.1 grams of methamphetamine and a 9mm semi automatic handgun. Aguilar admitted that both the drugs and the firearm were his, and that he had more methamphetamine and another handgun in the room he rented. A subsequent search of Aguilar\u2019s room uncovered 19.6 grams of methamphetamine mixture and a .44 Magnum handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">On the drug charges, the probation officer calculated a Guideline imprisonment range of 210-262 months\u2019 imprisonment based on a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category of V. The probation officer included a two-level enhancement for using a minor to commit a crime under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4, based on the fact that the juvenile, a 17-year-old male, accompanied Aguilar and Medina to the transaction and stated that Aguilar asked him to act as a back-up. Aguilar\u2019s firearm conviction carried a statutory minimum five-year consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">The district court granted a downward departure to a criminal history category of IV, reducing Aguilar\u2019s advisory Guideline range to 188-235 months\u2019 imprisonment on the drug charges. Considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court found no reason to impose a sentence outside the advisory Guideline range. The court, which previously noted that: (1) codefendant Medina was not held accountable for the firearm or the recruitment of a juvenile; (2) Medina had a lower criminal history category; and (3) the government filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for substantial assistance on Medina\u2019s behalf, found \u201ca difference\u201d in its reasons for Medina\u2019s sentence. It further stated that Aguilar had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>gun and that there was a large quantity of methamphetamine, but concluded that it would impose a sentence at the low end of the Guideline range based on Aguilar\u2019s admissions and cooperation. The district court sentenced Aguilar to two concurrent 188-month sentences on the drug charges followed by 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on the firearms charge, for a total sentence of 248 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">On appeal, Aguilar challenges the reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that, in light of the facts and circumstances of this case, the court\u2019s failure to impose a sentence below the Guideline range was error. Specifically, Aguilar points to: (1) his participation in the offense only as the supplier; (2) lack of evidence of his involvement in any such drug deals prior to his arrest; (3) mitigating circumstances surrounding the minor\u2019s role based on the minor\u2019s age, 17 years, and minimal role in the crime; (4) his drug addiction; (5) the lack of violent or drug dealing crimes in his adult criminal history; (6) his age, 24 years; (7) the likelihood of his deportation; and (8) the disparate sentence received by his codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). When evaluating the reasonableness of a sentence, we consider the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2006), <em>pet. for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 19, 2006) (No. 06-7352). When imposing a sentence, the district court must first correctly calculate the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Second, the district court must consider the following factors to determine a reasonable sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-6\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">\u201c[Tjhere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,j\u201d and we will not \u201csubstitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors because our review is not <em>de novo.\u201d Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363 (citation, quotation marks, and alteration omitted) (emphasis added). Although a sentence within the Guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, the use of the Guidelines remains central to the sentencing process and we ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787-88. However, the district court\u2019s choice of a sentence is not unfettered. <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363. \u201cWhen reviewing the length of a sentence for reasonableness, we will remand for re-sentencing if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>Aguilar received the statutory minimum consecutive sentence on the firearms charge. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). His 188-month sentences on the drug charges were at the low end of the Guideline range the court calculated after granting a downward departure and were well below the statutory maximum term of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). The district court\u2019s comments reflect that it recognized that Aguilar\u2019s codefendant was sentenced under different circumstances. The court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and specifically discussed the firearm, the large amount of methamphetamine, and Aguilar\u2019s admissions and cooperation. Neither the district court\u2019s reasoning nor the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warrant a conclusion that Aguilar\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. In light of the foregoing, Aguilar\u2019s sentences are</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
