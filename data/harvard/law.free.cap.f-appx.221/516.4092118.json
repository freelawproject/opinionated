The district court concluded that Palazzolo\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims were barred by the statute of limitations. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">State law determines the statute of limitations period for actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Usher v. City of Los Angeles, </em>828 F.2d 556, 558 (9th Cir.1987). California\u2019s one-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions applies to Palazzolo\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>See Cervantes v. City of San Diego, </em>5 F.3d 1273, 1275 (9th Cir.1993); Cal. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 340(3). Federal law determines the point at which the limitations period begins to run. <em>McCoy v. City &amp; County of S.F., </em>14 F.3d 28, 29 (9th Cir.1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Palazzolo argues that the statute of limitations began to run \u2014 i.e., the final decision was made \u2014 when the Monterey County Board of Supervisors adopted the arbitrator\u2019s award. We agree. A cause of action accrues \u201cwhen a plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). There is no dispute that Palazzolo knew that he was in trouble with his department when Sonne issued the Notice of Punitive Action on December 17, 2001, but that decision was far from final. The Memorandum of Understanding governing Palazzolo\u2019s employment contemplates that a departmental decision is just the first rung on the ladder leading to a final decision. Next come proceedings before an arbitrator. Then, the Board of Supervisors makes the final decision. Sonne\u2019s Notice of Punitive Action <em>would </em>have been the end-of-the-line had Palazzolo chosen to desist from taking the next step, but he <em>did </em>go to the next step. Because Palazzolo\u2019s post-December 17, 2001 actions were those provided for by the Memorandum of Understanding and were a part of the process leading up to the Board\u2019s decision, they cannot be said to have been a \u201ccollateral challenge,\u201d as would have occurred had Palazzolo pursued remedies such as arbitration (or litigation) <em>after </em>the employer\u2019s final decision had been made and thereby challenged that final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Therefore, Palazzolo\u2019s lawsuit, filed about seven months after the Board rendered its decision, did not violate the one-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Judge Rymer would affirm. <em>See Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980); <em>International Union of Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 229, 97 S.Ct. 441, 50 L.Ed.2d 427 (1976).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">. The district court treated the starting date for the statute of limitations as the same for both the Sand City defendants and the Monterey County defendants. On remand, the district court should determine whether the claims against the Sand City defendants accrued earlier, an issue on which we express no opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
