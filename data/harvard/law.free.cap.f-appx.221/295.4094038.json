Mollohan appeals following his guilty plea and the imposition of a 120-month sentence for knowingly and intentionally possessing a quantity of pseudoephedrine, knowing and having reason to believe it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c)(2)(2000). Mollohan\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court abused its discretion by not imposing the minimum guideline sentence. The Government did not file a reply brief, and although advised of his right to do so, Mollohan did not file a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-23\">Mollohan contends that the district court committed reversible error by not imposing the minimum guidelines sentence of 100 months. After <em>United States v. Book</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>er, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. However, in imposing a sentence post <em>-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a post <em>-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Here, the district court sentenced Mollohan post-Boofcer and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. The court sentenced Mollohan after considering and examining the sentencing guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as instructed by <em>Booker. </em>Mollohan\u2019s 120-month sentence is within the advisory guidelines range, and it is below the statutory maximum of twenty years. Finally, neither Mollohan nor the record suggests any information so compelling as to rebut the presumption that a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Mollohan\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Mollohan, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Mollohan requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Mollohan.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
