We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-23\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-26\">The district court\u2019s order denying Hoggard\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was entered December 13, 2005, and the sixty-day appeal period expired on February 13, 2006.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We initially remanded this case to the district court to determine whether Hoggard timely filed his notice of appeal. <em>See United States v. Hoggard, </em>195 Fed.Appx. 137, (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished). On remand, the district court determined that the notice of appeal was filed on February 17, 2006, several days after the sixty-day appeal period expired. Hoggard does not challenge this factual finding. Because Hoggard failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-27\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-20\"> Because the sixtieth day of the appeal period fell on Saturday, February 11, 2006, Hoggard had until Monday, February 13, to timely file his notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
