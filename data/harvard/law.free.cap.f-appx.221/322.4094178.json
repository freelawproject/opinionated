Boulds al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>leged that, on specific dates in December 2005 and February 2006, he was subjected to sub-freezing temperatures in his cell because the prison heating system was not working properly. Boulds further alleged that, in addition to failing to maintain and repair the prison heating system, the defendants failed to provide prisoners with supplemental heaters and extra blankets during extremely cold periods and that they failed to investigate and respond to complaints that the heat was not working. Bould attached to his complaint prison grievance forms showing that he had exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to both periods when his cell was allegedly not heated.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The district court held that Boulds\u2019s allegations of \u201cextremely cold temperatures in his cell block\u201d did not state a violation of the Eighth Amendment because the Constitution does not require \u201ccomfortable prisons.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 349, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (holding that doublecelling is constitutional). The district court also held that the allegation that prison officials failed to investigate Boulds\u2019s complaints and were deliberately indifferent to his needs did not state a claim for relief because Boulds had not shown \u201cthat the defendants exhibited anything more than a lack of due care\u201d and that he had failed to establish that they had \u201ca culpable state of mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">A prison official has a duty to provide prisoners \u201cthe minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Setter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 304, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). This requirement includes a responsibility to provide \u201cadequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Allowing a prisoner to be exposed to extreme temperatures may violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Wilson, </em>501 U.S. at 304, 111 S.Ct. 2321; <em>Gates v. Cook, </em>376 F.3d 323, 333-40 (5th Cir.2004). In <em>Wilson, </em>the Supreme Court speculated that the combination of a failure to issue blankets and a cold cell at night could violate the Eighth Amendment. Moreover, Boulds\u2019s charge that he complained to prison officials about the cold adequately alleges a culpable state of mind. We vacate the dismissal of the complaint and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
