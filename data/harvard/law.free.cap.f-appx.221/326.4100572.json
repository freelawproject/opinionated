Getachew has failed to brief the issue whether the BIA erred in holding that she was ineligible for asylum because she filed an untimely application. She has therefore waived its review. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-26\">The BIA did not adopt the immigration judge\u2019s opinion but rather concurred in the result. Consequently, our review is of the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 666 (5th Cir.2002). The BIA denied Getachew withholding of removal and relief under the CAT based only on the insufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, insofar as Getachew seeks review of the immigration judge\u2019s credibility determination, that issue is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-27\">An asylum applicant can be required to provide corroborating evidence where it is reasonable to do so. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>404 F.3d 295, 304 (5th Cir.2005). Getachew argues that it was unreasonable to require her to provide corroborating evidence of her travels and her injuries. The BIA, however, rejected Getachew\u2019s claim for withholding of removal because she presented no documentary evidence establishing her identity, nationality, or citizenship. Getaehew does not address this determination by the BIA. She has therefore waived review of her eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros, </em>809 F.2d at 1052. Similarly, with regard to her eligibility for relief under the CAT, Getaehew also does not set forth an argument that the evidence was sufficient to show that if removed to Ethiopia, it is likely that she would be tortured. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). She has therefore also waived review of that issue. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros, </em>809 F.2d at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
