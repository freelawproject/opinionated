The court sentenced Jenkins to 180 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release. Jenkins\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In his pro se supplemental brief, Jenkins argues enhancing his sentence based on prior convictions results in double punishment. Jenkins contends his \u201cillegal incarceration\u201d gives rise to a private cause of action against his warden, and on that basis he seeks an \u201cequitable remedy\u201d from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">We reject Jenkins\u2019s argument, <em>see United States v. Thomas, </em>930 F.2d 12, 14 (8th Cir.1991) (use of prior crimes to enhance sentence does not violate Double Jeopardy Clause), and hold his request for an equitable remedy is frivolous. Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Pen-son v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Thus, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\">. The Honorable William R.
