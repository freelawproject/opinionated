June 24, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>A95 461 785 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 14, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-21\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the IJ\u2019s findings concerning the legal sufficiency of the evidence, as they present questions regarding the application of law to fact. <em>Edimo-Doualla v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 276, 281 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">A. Failure to Meet Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985), the BIA interpreted past persecution to include \u201charm or suffering inflicted upon an individual in order to punish him for possessing a belief or characteristic a persecutor sought to overcome.\u201d While no court has established a minimum threshold of harm that an asylum applicant must show in order to establish past persecution, all courts, including this one, require that the alleged harm be severe. <em>Ai Feng Yuan v. DOJ, </em>416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cpersecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive\u201d)). Persecution must rise above mere harassment, but it is not limited to threats to life or freedom; violence that is not life-threatening also falls within this category. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 128 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The IJ determined that Euw\u2019s experiences did not constitute past persecution, noting that harassment and discrimination do not constitute persecution. As the IJ determined, the problems Euw encountered (such as taunting, the taking of his possessions, and the pelting of his home with rocks) were not severe enough to be considered persecution. <em>See Ai Feng Yuan, </em>416 F.3d at 198. The IJ also properly determined that Euw did not show that the two beating incidents, even when coupled with the discrimination he felt as a child and the harassment he experienced in his neighborhood, were a threat to his life or freedom, or more than unfortunate incidents of harassment. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that the difference between harassment and persecution is one of degree and must be decided on a case-by-case basis). The IJ\u2019s finding that Euw failed to show past persecution is supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Relying heavily on State Department country condition material indicating that ethnic Chinese have not been targets of violence since the 1998 riots in Jakarta, the IJ determined that Euw did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution by Indonesian Muslims. State Department reports are probative. <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, 446 </em>F.3d 395, <em>400 </em>(2d Cir.2006). Here, because the IJ considered the State Department material in conjunction with Euw\u2019s testimony regarding his personal experiences, the conclusion that Euw did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution is substantially supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The IJ\u2019s denial of asylum was thus appropriate. Because Euw was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">B. Adverse Credibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">The finding that Euw failed to establish his eligibility for asylum relief is substantially supported by the record. Accordingly, a review of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
