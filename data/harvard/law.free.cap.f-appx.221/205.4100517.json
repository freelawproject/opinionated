On appeal, he alleges that the district court erred by denying his proposed jury instruction regarding confession evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision not to issue Jacobs\u2019 proffered instruction. <em>United States v. Helem, 186 F.8d 449, 454 (4th </em>Cir.1999) (stating standard). In particular, we find that there was sufficient evidence of Jacobs\u2019 guilt unrelated to his confession of possessing the firearm at issue. See <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488-89, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963) (noting that a conviction must rest on more than uncorroborated admission or confession); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>396 F.2d 841, 844-45 (4th Cir.1968) (same). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-21\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
