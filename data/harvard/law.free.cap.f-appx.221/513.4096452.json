R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b542-13\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">Margarito Nunez was arrested with a gun at the scene of a methamphetamine transaction between his co-defendant and a government informant. He was convicted at trial of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); and carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Nunez now appeals his sentence, arguing that in deciding to impose a sentence above the statutory minimum, the trial judge improperly relied on the characterization of his gun as \u201ccocked and ready to use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">The officer who testified about how Nunez\u2019s gun was found at the crime scene described it as having its safety on, its hammer cocked to the rear, and a magazine full of ammunition. Although there was no bullet in the gun\u2019s chamber and it was necessary to slide a spring to push a bullet into the chamber prior to firing the gun, the officer testified that the gun could be fired in less than a quarter of a second.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">Because Nunez did not raise this issue before the district court, we review the district court\u2019s finding for plain error. We can reverse it only \u201cwhen (1) there was actual error; (2) the error was plain (i.e. \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious\u2019); and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s \u2018substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. PimentelFlores, </em>339 F.3d 959, 967 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-17\">There is no such error here. The characterizations that Nunez challenges\u2014 \u201ccocked\u201d and \u201cready\u201d \u2014 were pertinent as indications that the gun could be fired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>easily and so was particularly dangerous. The evidence indeed showed that with the magazine full of bullets, the gun could be fired in less than a quarter of a second\u2014 essentially, instantaneously. That the additional step of pushing a bullet into the chamber needed to be taken does not detract from the essential thrust of the court\u2019s finding. Absent any evidence to the contrary, it was also not plain error for the court to understand the officer\u2019s testimony as asserting that the gun was ready to fire, despite the officer\u2019s statement that the gun appeared modified to accept a different kind of bullet than when originally manufactured.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b542-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
