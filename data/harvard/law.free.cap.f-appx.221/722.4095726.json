Four of the agents remained in the front and side of the house, while the two remaining agents, including Eric McGee, an officer with the Eddy County (New Mexico) Sheriffs Department, approached the back door of the residence and knocked.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The back door opened and a woman named Rachelle Hays answered. McGee was not surprised to see Hays. More specifically, McGee was familiar with both Crabb and Hays, having responded as a patrolman to a domestic violence call involving Crabb and Hays at an apartment they previously shared on Canal Street in Carlsbad. McGee and the other agent asked Hays if they could visit with Crabb. Hays stated that Crabb wasn\u2019t there. McGee, concerned that Hays might not be telling the truth, explained: \u201cLook, we just want to talk to him [Crabb]. We\u2019re not here to arrest him or anything.\u201d ROA, Vol. Ill at 10. Hays responded by saying that McGee and the other agents \u201ccould come in and look for [Crabb], that he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. According to McGee, neither he nor the other agent at the back door asked Hays for permission to enter the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">Several agents entered the one-bedroom house and conducted a brief search for Crabb. During the course of the search, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the agents observed drug contraband, including a pipe and a bong. The agents also observed on the mirror of the bedroom the names of several people with numerical figures next to the names. The agents believed this to be a drug ledger.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">After concluding the search for Crabb, the agents spoke briefly to Hays inside the house, explained the reason for their visit, and again told her that they needed to speak to Crabb. Hays, in response, told the agents where Crabb was and that she expected him back at any time. She also stated that \u201cshe was on and off staying there [at the house] with [Crabb],\u201d and that she had agreed to \u201cwait there [at the house] until he got back.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. Hays proceeded to allow the agents to remain in the residence until Crabb returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Crabb eventually returned to the residence and was met in the driveway by the agents. <em>Id. </em>The agents detected a strong odor of marijuana in the vehicle that Crabb was driving and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Crabb admitted possessing the drug paraphernalia found in his home, as well as a small amount of methamphetamine. Crabb was arrested and searched. During the search, agents discovered that Crabb had in his possession over ninety grams of methamphetamine. A search of Crabb\u2019s vehicle and residence produced additional paraphernalia and small quantities of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">On November 2, 2005, a federal grand jury indicted Crabb on one count of possession with intent to distribute fifty grams and more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and 2. Crabb moved to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless entry into his residence on September 28, 2005, arguing that Hays lacked actual or apparent authority to consent to the agents\u2019 entry into and search of the residence. The district court, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, denied Crabb\u2019s motion, concluding that Hays had apparent authority to consent to the agents\u2019 entry into and search of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">On February 14, 2006, Crabb, acting pursuant to a written plea agreement with the government, entered a conditional plea of guilty to the count alleged in the indictment. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Crabb reserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. The district court subsequently sentenced Crabb to a term of imprisonment of sixty months. Crabb has since filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Crabb contends on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. \u201cWhen reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous, and we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>472 F.3d 767, 775 (10th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]e review de novo the ultimate determination of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment because that is a legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of establishing a Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment generally prohibits the warrantless entry of a person\u2019s home, whether to make an arrest or to search for specific objects.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 181, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990). \u201cThe prohibition does not apply, however, to situations in which voluntary consent has been obtained, either from the individual whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>property is searched, or from a third party who possesses common authority over the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe consent of a third party to a search of common premises is effectual if the third party has either the actual authority or the apparent authority to consent to a search.\u201d <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Hermosillo, </em>142 F.3d 1225, 1230 (10th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 188, 110 S.Ct. 2793).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Rodriguez </em>delineates the proper analysis for determining whether third-party consent searches are valid under the \u2018apparent authority\u2019 exception.\u201d <em>Gutierrez-Hermosillo, </em>142 F.3d at 1230. <em>\u201cRodriguez </em>held that the Fourth Amendment is not violated when officers enter without a warrant when they reasonably, although erroneously, believe that the person who consents to their entry has the authority to consent to this entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe determination of the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 belief is an objective one: \u2018[W]ould the facts available to the officer at the moment ... warrant a man of reasonable caution [to believe] that the consenting party had authority over the premises?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 188, 110 S.Ct. 2793) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Applying that standard to the facts presented here, we agree with the district court that McGee and the other agents reasonably believed that Hays had authority to consent to their entry. At the time McGee approached and knocked on the back door of the house, he was already familiar with Crabb and Hays, having previously responded to a domestic violence call involving Crabb and Hays when they lived together at a different residence. In other words, McGee had knowledge that Crabb and Hays were romantically involved and had, at least in the past, lived together. Based upon that information, we conclude it was reasonable for McGee to have believed, at the time Hays answered the knock on the backdoor of the house, that Hays and Crabb were still romantically involved and lived together at the house. Importantly, nothing said by Hays was sufficient to dispel McGee of that reasonable belief. When McGee asked Hays if he could speak with Crabb, Hays simply responded that Crabb wasn\u2019t there. When McGee then explained that they didn\u2019t want to arrest Crabb, Hays, without prompting, invited McGee and the other agents inside the house to look for Crabb. By doing so, Hays clearly implied that she possessed the authority to consent to their entry into and search of the house. Although Crabb correctly notes that \u201cHays had been arrested the month before, and the booking records showed that she had a different address,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 9, the fact remains that there was no evidence presented indicating that McGee or the other agents were aware of that information at the time they approached the house and spoke with Hays. Indeed, McGee specifically denied such knowledge. In sum, we conclude that a reasonable officer in the position of Officer McGee would have believed that Hays shared joint access to the home with Crabb, and thus possessed the authority to consent to the agents\u2019 entry into and search of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
