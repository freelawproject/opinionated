Williamson appealed, and we vacated his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), concluding that the sentence violated his Sixth Amendment rights. On remand, the district court applied a cross-reference to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(1) (2002) (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder), considered the advisory guideline range and the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and reimposed a 100-month sentence. Williamson appeals, and we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-23\">Williamson contends that the district court should have applied the cross-reference in USSG \u00a7 2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), not USSG \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l). Where, as here, the facts are not contested, the issue is a legal one, and this court\u2019s review is de novo. <em>United States v. Fullilove, </em>388 F.3d 104, 106 (4th Cir.2004). Our careful review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court properly applied the cross-reference to USSG \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(1). Williamson and his friend, Mike Jefferson, saw the victim outside a convenience store, and, after a brief conversation, Jefferson told Williamson to \u201cwet\u201d the victim. Williamson responded by pulling a gun, telling the victim he was going to die, and firing twice at the victim from about twelve feet away. We conclude that the district court did not err in applying the cross-reference to \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Williamson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
