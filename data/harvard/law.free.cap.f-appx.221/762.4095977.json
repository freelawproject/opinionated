McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">David Anderson, Sr., a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) that would allow him to appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). Because we conclude that Mr. Anderson has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d we deny his request for a COA, and dismiss the appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b791-16\">On the evening of May 3, 2000, Mr. Anderson\u2019s truck collided with a motorcycle driven by Gary Wagner. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Wagner were transported to the hospital where Mr. Wagner subsequently died. An eye witness reported to police that Mr. Anderson was driving without his lights on and that he had crossed the center line several times before the collision. At the hospital, an officer read Mr. Anderson an implied consent form and asked for his permission to perform a blood test. Mr. Anderson responded, \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d and the police instructed a nurse to take a blood sample. Approximately an hour later, police arrested Mr. Anderson and he was eventually charged with violating a number of Kansas statutes, including involuntary manslaughter, driving under the influence, reckless driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ing, failure to use headlights, and driving on the left side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">At trial, the prosecution attempted to introduce the results of the blood alcohol test, which showed Mr. Anderson had a blood alcohol content of 0.21 at the time of testing. Mr. Anderson argued that the sample should be excluded because it was taken without consent and prior to his arrest. The court agreed and held that the evidence should be excluded. The government appealed the district court\u2019s ruling and the Kansas Court of Appeals reversed. The appellate court held that the blood test was admissible under <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), because the officer had probable cause to believe Mr. Anderson was driving under the influence of alcohol, the \u201cevanescent nature of the [blood alcohol] evidence\u201d created exigent circumstances allowing seizure without a warrant, and the test was performed in a reasonable manner.App. 2526. The Kansas Supreme Court denied Mr. Anderson\u2019s request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">After remand to the state district court, a jury found Mr. Anderson guilty on all counts. Mr. Anderson appealed, and the Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. The Kansas Supreme Court denied Mr. Anderson\u2019s petition for review. Thereafter, Mr. Anderson filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, challenging his involuntary manslaughter conviction on Fourth Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The district court did not reach the merits of Mr. Anderson\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim; rather, it dismissed the petition because Mr. Anderson had already received an opportunity for full and fair litigation of the claim in state court under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 482, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976). The district court refused to grant a COA. This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">An individual in state custody may appeal the denial of a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 only if the district court or this Court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In order to make such a showing, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">Mr. Anderson claims, without citation to authority, that the district court should have considered the merits of his Fourth Amendment claim despite the fact that he received multiple hearings on the matter before at least two different state courts. On the merits, Mr. Anderson argues that the state court erred in its interpretation of <em>Schmerber. </em>In <em>Schmerber, </em>the Supreme Court held that taking a blood sample without a warrant after an arrest did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the delay required in procuring a warrant risked destruction of evidence. 384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. 1826. Mr. Anderson contends that the <em>Schmerber </em>exception to the warrant requirement only applies to blood samples taken after an arrest has occurred, and the taking of his blood sample \u2014 which occurred prior to his arrest \u2014 thus constitutes an unlawful seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">In <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere the State has provided an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at his trial.\u201d 428 U.S. at 494, 96 S.Ct. 3037. The opportunity for full and fair litigation \u201cincludes, but is not limited to, the procedural opportunity to raise or otherwise present a Fourth Amendment claim,\u201d a \u201cfull and fair evidentiary hearing contemplated by <em>Townsend [v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963)],\u201d and state court \u201crecognition and at least colorable application of the correct Fourth Amendment constitutional standards.\u201d <em>Gamble v. Oklahoma, </em>583 F.2d 1161, 1165 (10th Cir.1978). Whether Mr. Anderson had an opportunity for a full and fair litigation of his Fourth Amendment claim in state court is a question this Court reviews <em>de novo. Cannon v. Gibson, </em>259 F.3d 1253, 1260 (10th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The state appellate court correctly recognized that <em>Schmerber </em>enunciated the governing legal standard for Mr. Anderson\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim and applied it to the facts of Mr. Anderson\u2019s case in at least a colorable manner. The state appellate court was convinced that the police were justified in taking Mr. Anderson\u2019s blood sample prior to arrest based on logic similar to that employed in <em>Schmerber: </em>the officers had probable cause to believe that Mr. Anderson was under the influence of alcohol and, in light of the evanescent nature of blood alcohol evidence, exigent circumstances existed that made an immediate sampling necessary. No reasonable jurist could find that the state court failed to colorably apply the correct legal standard, as enumerated in <em>Schmerber. See Cannon v. Gibson, </em>259 F.3d 1253, 1264 (10th Cir.2001) (dismissing a petition for habeas corpus based on a Fourth Amendment claim because the challenge was \u201cmore akin to an attack on the merits of the [prior state court] decision rather than a charge that [it] willfully misapplied constitutional law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Anderson\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
