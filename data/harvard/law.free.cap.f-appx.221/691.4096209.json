BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">Defendant Martin Hietala, a Deputy Sheriff in Davis County, Utah (Deputy Hietala), brings this interlocutory appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. Because we lack appellate jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s ruling, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">According to plaintiff Fred Dreis\u2019s version of events, on the evening of January 10, 2002, he was driving his 1976 truck in Ogden, Utah, on his way to a friend\u2019s home in Syracuse, Utah. While in Ogden, an unmarked vehicle, driven by off-duty Deputy Hietala (and containing a passenger), honked at Mr. Dreis and started following him. The unmarked vehicle followed Mr. Dreis \u201cfor a total of approximately 20 miles or nearly 30 minutes ... in a menacing manner, violating the right-of-way of oncoming traffic ... and running a red light....\u201d Aplt.App. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">When Mr. Dreis reached his destination he pulled up to the curb, stopped, and exited his truck. Deputy Hietala \u201cscreeched to a halt at an angle to\u201d Mr. Dreis\u2019s truck, <em>id. </em>at 61, and \u201cjumped out of his vehicle in [a] ... violent manner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12. After Mr. Dreis asked, \u201c Why are you following me?\u2019 \u201d Deputy Hietala threw a badge wrapped in leather across the hood of his car, grabbed Mr. Dreis, struck him with his left forearm, and announced \u201c T\u2019m a Deputy Sheriff; you are going to jail!\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Dreis asked why, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>and Deputy Hietala responded, \u201c \u2018For reckless driving.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Mr. Dreis, who himself is a trained law enforcement officer, observed that Deputy Hietala did not appear to have handcuffs or a weapon, and he neglected to ask Mr. Dreis for his license or registration. When Mr. Dreis asked to see Deputy Hietala\u2019s identification, Deputy Hietala refused and told Mr. Dreis that he \u201cwas going to \u2018start stacking charges.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Meanwhile, the female passenger who was riding in Deputy Hietala\u2019s unmarked car continued to sit in the passenger seat. Mr. Dreis asked Deputy Hietala to call an on-duty uniformed officer or a supervisor, and he informed Deputy Hietala that he had a permit for, and was carrying, a concealed weapon. Deputy Hietala responded that \u201che was a supervisor and he didn\u2019t need to call anyone,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 62, and that \u201cmaking that statement [regarding the concealed weapon] was an \u2018assault on a peace officer,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 12. \u201c[Mr.] Dreis did not believe Hietala to be a true peace officer....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. And because Mr. Dreis did not want Deputy Hietala to gain access to his concealed weapon and \u201cus[e] it on him,\u201d he refused to cooperate with Deputy Hietala\u2019s request that he \u201cturn his back ... and place his hands behind him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>During the confrontation, Deputy Hietala grabbed at Mr. Dreis\u2019s coat, pulled, and shoved him, and hit him in the chest with the palm of his hand \u201c[f]ive or six\u201d times. <em>Id. </em>at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">When an on-duty police officer arrived, Deputy Hietala told him to \u201c \u2018Hook [Dreis] up,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 13. Mr. Dreis voluntarily submitted to the uniformed officer\u2019s handcuffing and told him, \u201c T have a concealed weapon and a permit to carry it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66. After the officer handcuffed Mr. Dreis, Deputy Hietala \u201cpulled [Mr.] Dreis to the sidewalk [by] the handcuffs\u201d and then \u201croughly raised [his handcuffed] hands high in the air behind him, bruising his wrists.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. While Mr. Dreis\u2019s hands were still in the air, Deputy Hietala searched him, jerking money from his pants pocket with sufficient force to tear several bills in half. Mr. Dreis\u2019s gun was seized and was not returned to him for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Mr. Dreis filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-10\">alleging six claims for relief: (1) unreasonable search and seizure; (2) failure to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; (3) use of excessive force; (4) punishment without the benefit of a jury trial; (5) taking Dreis\u2019s property without due process of law; and (6) taking Dreis\u2019s property without just compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Aplee. Br. at 3. At the end of the hearing on Deputy Hietala\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court concluded that genuine issues of material fact precluded the grant of qualified immunity. This interlocutory appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">This court ordered the parties to brief the appealability of the district court\u2019s decision denying summary judgment based -on \u2014 qualified immunity. \u201cOrders denying qualified immunity before trial are appeal-able only to the extent they resolve abstract issues of law.\u201d <em>Shrum v. City of Coweta, </em>449 F.3d 1132, 1137 (10th Cir.2006). Abstract issues of law include \u201cwhat the current applicable law is, whether that law was clearly established at the time the official\u2019s action occurred, and whether the official\u2019s acts were objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Mercer, </em>926 F.2d 990, 991 (10th Cir.1991). Orders denying qualified immunity before trial are not immediately appealable \u201cwhen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>question is the sufficiency of the evidence or the correctness of the district court\u2019s findings with respect to a genuine issue of material fact,\u201d <em>Shrum, </em>449 F.3d at 1137. <em>See also Gross v. Pirble, </em>245 F.3d 1151, 1156-57 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e lack jurisdiction ... if our review would require second-guessing the district court\u2019s determinations of evidence sufficiency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Deputy Hietala asserts that we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal as to Mr. Dreis\u2019s claims for illegal seizure and arrest because the district court \u201cplainly concluded both that (1) Officer Hietala\u2019s seizure and arrest of Dreis, viewed in light of the evidence most favorable to Dreis, violated Dreis\u2019s constitutional rights and (2) those rights were clearly established.\u201d Aplt. Jurisdictional Br. at 6. Having carefully reviewed the hearing transcript, we disagree. The district court did not determine whether Deputy Hietala\u2019s seizure and arrest of Mr. Dreis violated Mr. Dreis\u2019s constitutional rights. Rather, it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">One, it is disputed, and the record does not lend itself to a finding as a matter of law, that the deputy identified himself in such a way that a reasonable man in Mr. Dreis\u2019[s] position would have known when the deputy said, \u201cYou are under arrest,\u201d that he was being arrested by a police officer. I think that is a factual issue whether it was reasonable for Mr. Dreis to not recognize him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">Secondly, there is the question of the probable cause for the arrest. There is almost no evidence in this record that tells me one way or the other whether the probable cause statement is true. That is particularly significant in view of the fact that the question of whether Mr. Dreis can be said to legally have resisted arrest knowingly when all the circumstances under which this arrest was made are not clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">ApltApp. at 178. Further, the district court\u2019s observation that \u201cit would appear under the circumstances of this case that the law was clearly established regarding this sort of situation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 179, does not make \u201cevident,\u201d as Deputy Hietala contends, that the district <em>concluded </em>that Deputy Hietala had violated Mr. Dreis\u2019s constitutional rights, Aplt. Jurisdictional Br. at 6. The district court did not so hold. Indeed, the court\u2019s very next words belie Deputy Hietala\u2019s characterization of the court\u2019s oral ruling. Read in its entirety, the court\u2019s statement was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">As far as the other steps in qualified immunity, certainly it would appear under the circumstances of this case that the law was clearly established regarding this sort of situation. <em>But, again, because of the paucity of the record, I cannot say. </em>And I really don\u2019t know whether if a mistake was made by the deputy, whether that mistake was reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">ApltApp. at 179 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Deputy Hietala also argues that, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Dreis, he did not illegally seize or arrest Mr. Dreis. <em>See, e.g., </em>Aplt. Opening Br. at 12-16. While it is true that a district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity is immediately appealable if a defendant\u2019s appeal \u201cis based on the argument that, even under the plaintiffs version of the facts, the defendant did not violate clearly established law,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Martin, </em>195 F.3d 1208, 1214 (10th Cir.1999), Deputy Hietala omits constitutionally salient facts. Because Deputy Hietala omits salient facts, he fails to demonstrate that, on the facts as alleged by Mr. Dreis, Deputy Hietala\u2019s seizure and arrest did not violate Mr. Dreis\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">Deputy Hietala next asserts that we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal as to Mr. Dreis\u2019s claim for exces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>sive force despite the \u201cdistrict court[\u2019s] fail[ure] to conduct a proper qualified immunity analysis with respect to Dreis\u2019s excessive force claim,\u201d Aplt. Jurisdictional Br. at 11. We disagree. With respect to excessive force, the district court found disputed issues precluded the grant of qualified immunity. Specifically, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">Third, there is a question of excessive force.... [T]his record is almost devoid of any evidence of what was objectively reasonable in this case. According to the evidence that I have before me, Mr. Dreis was struck five or six times during the course of this incident. A jury might find that under the circumstances to be unreasonable. I simply cannot say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Aplt.App. at 178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Because the district court\u2019s conclusion concerning excessive force, like the district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the alleged unlawful seizure and arrest of Mr. Dreis, is, at base, nothing more than a decision about evidentiary sufficiency, we must DISMISS this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Gross, </em>245 F.3d at 1157 (\u201cIf we determine the district court\u2019s conclusion rests on findings of evidence sufficiency, we must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b720-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
