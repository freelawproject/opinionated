After review, we deny De Garcia\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">In 1983, De Garcia, a Cuban national, became a legal permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d) of the United States. In 1991, De Garcia was convicted of cocaine trafficking in Florida state court and sentenced to four years in prison. On April 1, 1992, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) began deportation proceedings against De Garcia. The INS issued an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing, charging De Garcia with being a deportable alien, pursuant to former Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251 (a)(2)(A)(iii) (1992), because of her cocaine trafficking conviction, which was both an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">On June 22, 1993, at the initial deportation hearing, De Garcia appeared without counsel and acknowledged receiving a written copy of the Order to Show Cause. De Garcia stated her desire to be represented by a lawyer, and the IJ continued the deportation hearing. Because De Garcia was still in prison and her release date was approaching, the IJ repeatedly warned De Garcia that her final deportation hearing would be held in the coming months, that the notice of her final deportation hearing would be sent to the address De Garcia provided, that De Garcia would need to keep the court informed of her address once she was released from prison, and that the final deportation hearing would proceed <em>in absentia </em>if she failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>to appear. De Garda indicated that she understood the IJ\u2019s warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The final deportation hearing was scheduled for October 22, 1993. The INS sent the notice of the hearing by certified mail to 508 Louisa Street in Key West, Florida, an address found on a Form 1-156 in De Garcia\u2019s INS file.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The post office returned the notice of the hearing undelivered with no forwarding address. De Garcia failed to appear at her final deportation hearing, and the IJ entered the deportation order <em>in absentia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In 2003, at Miami International Airport, De Garcia applied for admission to the United States as a returning LPR. The Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDH S\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> served De Garcia with a Notice to Appear, charging De Garcia with failing to obtain permission to reenter the United States after having been deported. While in removal proceedings, De Garcia and the DHS filed a joint motion to reopen the deportation proceedings, stating that notice of her hearing had not been sent to her last known address. The motion also indicated that De Garcia had appeared several times before DHS after her release from prison to renew her LPR card. De Garcia sought to reopen her deportation proceedings so she could apply for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">The IJ denied the motion to reopen, finding that: (1) De Garcia had received notice of the final deportation hearing at her last known address; (2) she was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief; and (3) that De Garcia had \u201cself-deported\u201d by leaving the United States after an order of deportation had been entered against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">De Garcia appealed to the BIA. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, finding that the notice of hearing was proper because it was sent to De Garcia\u2019s last known address by certified mail and that De Garcia failed to exercise due diligence in determining the status of the deportation hearing or in keeping the Immigration Court apprised of any change in her address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">On appeal, De Garcia argues that the BIA violated her due process rights and abused its discretion when it denied her motion to reopen her deportation proceedings because she did not receive notice of the final deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">We lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal if the alien is deported based on a conviction for an aggravated felony or controlled substance offense. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). \u201c[T]he limitations on our jurisdiction to review a final order of removal, including any pertinent statutory amendments, also control our jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>tion to review an order denying a motion to reopen a final order of removal.\u201d <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 809 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006). However, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see also Camacho-Salinas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>460 F.3d 1343, 1346\u201447 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the only issue we may address is De Garcia\u2019s due process claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">An alien who is present in the United States is entitled to due process under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). To comport with due process, an alien must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard in the removal proceedings. <em>Sebastian-Soler v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>409 F.3d 1280, 1287 n. 14 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, due process does not require that the alien receive actual notice of a hearing; rather, due process \u201cis satisfied if notice is accorded in a manner \u2018reasonably calculated\u2019 to ensure that notice reaches the alien.\u201d <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">De Garcia was ordered deported under the INA prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 304, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-587. Thus we discuss only prellRIRA law.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Under the pre-IIRIRA INA, notice of the time and place of the deportation hearing was to be provided by certified mail. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252b(a)(2)(A) (1993). However, an alien was required to provide the Attorney General with a written record of any change of address, and the INS was not required to provide notice of the hearing if the alien failed to comply with this address-notification requirement. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1252b(a)(l)(F), (a)(2) &amp; (c)(2). If the alien failed to appear at the deportation hearing, the alien was required to be deported <em>in absentia </em>if the INS established by clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence that written notice had been given to the alien and that the alien was deportable. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252b(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Furthermore, written notice was deemed sufficient if it was made to the most recent address reported by the alien. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252b(c)(2); <em>see also Dominguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>284 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that \u201can alien has an affirmative duty to provide the government with a correct address\u201d and that \u201c[flailing to provide the INS with a change of address will preclude the alien from claiming that the INS did not provide him or her with notice of a hearing\u201d); <em>In re Grijalva, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 27, 33-34, 37 (BIA 1995) (concluding that proof of actual service was not required where the notice of the hearing was sent to the alien\u2019s last known address as provided by the alien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>and that the alien could overcome the presumption of delivery of the notice by providing substantial and probative evidence that \u201cnondelivery was not due to the respondent\u2019s failure to provide an address where he could receive mail\u201d). Under preIIRIRA law, the Order to Show Cause also warned the alien of the address-notification requirement and the consequences for failing to comply. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252b(a)(l)(F) (1993).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Here, there was no violation of De Garcia\u2019s due process rights. De Garcia appeared in person at the initial hearing. At the initial hearing, De Garcia acknowledged receiving the Order to Show Cause, which informed her of the requirement to keep the government apprised of her address and warned her of the consequences if she failed to do so. In addition, the IJ emphasized to De Garcia at the initial hearing (1) that her deportation proceedings were underway; (2) that it was imperative to provide the INS with her current address; (3) the consequences of failing to appear at the next deportation hearing; and (4) that the hearing would be commencing in the coming months.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">In providing De Garcia notice of the final deportation hearing, the INS followed the notice procedures in the pre-IIRIRA INA. Specifically, De Garcia\u2019s notice of the final deportation hearing was sent by certified mail to her last known address as reflected in her immigration records. There is no evidence in the record that De Garcia advised the INS or the Immigration Court in writing of a change in her address. Therefore, the sending of the notice of the final deportation hearing to the last address noted in De Garcia\u2019s immigration file was a method \u201creasonably calculated\u201d to ensure that De Garcia received notice. Furthermore, the IJ was authorized to proceed with the deportation proceedings <em>in absentia. </em>De Garcia\u2019s due process claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">. The Form 1-156, entitled \"Deportation Docket Control Action Slip or Notice,\u201d listed De Garcia and her immigration case number and the following notation in the \"Action\u201d portion of the form: \u201creleased 508 Louisa Street Key West, FLA 33040.\u201d The form also stated that the action had been taken on September 13, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\">. The INS was abolished on March 1, 2003, and its functions were transferred to DHS. <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, \u00a7 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 291(a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b845-15\">. The BIA also found that, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(d) and 1003.23, it lacked jurisdiction to consider De Garcia\u2019s motion to reopen because she had departed the United States. As the government concedes, this Court recently concluded that the IJ and BIA retain jurisdiction to reopen proceedings where an alien has been removed from the United States following an <em>in absentia </em>order of removal for the purpose of addressing whether the alien received sufficient notice of the hearing. <em>Contreras-Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>462 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2006) (relying on 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\">. Although we also retain jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction, De Garcia does not contest that she is an alien who is removable based on a disqualifying offense. <em>See Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 923 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">. We review constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">. An alien also can state a due process claim by showing that she was deprived of a liberty interest without due process of law, which caused substantial prejudice. <em>Sebastian-Sol-er, </em>409 F.3d at 1287 n. 14. However, \"aliens do not enjoy a constitutionally protected liberty interest in a purely discretionary form of relief.\u201d <em>Garcia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1224 (11th Cir.2003). The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen is a discretionary decision, even if the alien demonstrates that she is entitled to relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Therefore, De Garcia had no protected liberty^ interest in having her motion to reopen granted and cannot state a due process claim on this basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\">. De Garcia does not facially challenge the notice and removal <em>in absentia </em>procedures of the pre-IIRIRA INA. We previously have upheld the constitutionality of those procedures. <em>SeeAnin, 188 </em>F.3d at 1277-78.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
