Evans appeals his sentence, alleging that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the district court\u2019s factual finding that he possessed a firearm during the drug offense and application of a two-level enhancement.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-24\">In the district court, Evans principally contested the weapon enhancement on factual grounds, but also challenged it under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court is required to calculate the appropriate advisory guideline range after making any necessary findings of fact, and consider the range in conjunction with all relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2006), before imposing a sentence. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). The district court followed this procedure. Because Evans was sentenced under an advisory guideline scheme, no Sixth Amendment error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-18\"> We previously affirmed Evans\u2019 sentence using a plain error standard of review. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). Evans filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, pointing out that, after sentence was pronounced, counsel informed the court that his client wished to challenge the enhancement under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We therefore granted panel rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
