Holland, Esq., Visalia, CA, for Plaintiffs-Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b551-16\">Before: REINHARDT, RYMER, and SILVERMAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b551-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-18\">Plaintiffs appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) due to their counsel\u2019s lack of compliance with court orders. We review this decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Hernandez v. City of El Monte, </em>138 F.3d 393, 398 (9th Cir.1998). Finding no such abuse, we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the history of this litigation, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-21\">District courts must weigh five factors in addressing a Rule 41(b) motion: \u201c(1) the public\u2019s interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court\u2019s need to manage its docket; (3) the risk of prejudice to the defendants; (4) the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits; and (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Duncan, </em>779 F.2d 1421, 1423 (9th Cir.1986). We may affirm the dismissal where \u201cat least four factors support dismissal ... or where at least three factors \u2018strongly\u2019 support dismissal.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>138 F.3d at 399 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-22\">The record supports the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the action. Four years had passed since the first complaint was filed. The district court\u2019s civil docket had been severely disrupted, and plaintiffs\u2019 noncompliance forced defendants to file additional motions to dismiss and face further delays in the prosecution of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-23\">And, most significantly, the district court previously attempted a less drastic alternative \u2014 an attorneys\u2019 fee award that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had himself requested as an appropriate sanction \u2014 and had twice advised plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in writing that failure to timely comply with court orders would result in dismissal of the action. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel still did not comply. Each observation, standing alone, substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tiates the court\u2019s conclusion that less drastic sanctions would fail. <em>See Malone v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>833 F.2d 128, 132 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">For the same reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs\u2019 request for an extension to file the opposition to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment after the deadline had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Finally, we decline plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to review the district court\u2019s interlocutory order dismissing MAGEC as a defendant. Such interlocutory orders, while generally appealable after final judgment, are not appealable after a dismissal under Rule 41(b). <em>See Al-Torki v. Kaempen, </em>78 F.3d 1381, 1386 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Ash v. Cvetkov, </em>739 F.2d 493, 497-98 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
