Rohan denying their claims for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>In Re Tonin Gjuraj/Liza Gjuraj/Vilma Gjuraj/Daniela Gjuraj, </em>Nos. A 73 555 747, A 73 555 748, A 73 555 749, A 73 555 750 (B.I.A. May 23, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A 73 555 747, A 73 555 748, A 73 555 749, A 73 555 750 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 18, 1998). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); Yu <em>Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004)(per curiam). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003), <em>Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review a BIA member\u2019s decision to resolve a particular appeal unilaterally, and without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), rather than referring it to a three-member panel. <em>See Kambolli v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 454, 463 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, the BIA\u2019s affirmance, without opinion, of the IJ\u2019s decision does not violate due process. <em>See Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 160 (2d Cir.2004)(per curiam) (streamlining procedure does not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Gjuraj did not argue before the BIA that the Government violated 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.6 when it investigated the authenticity of a document which Gjuraj claimed corroborated his testimony. Because the government has raised the affirmative defense that Gjuraj waived this argument by failing to exhaust administrative remedies and because the issues are not central to our view of the merits of Gjuraj\u2019s appeal, we decline to address this issue. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>461 F.3d 101, 116 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">As to changed country conditions, the IJ noted that the evidence in the record indicates that Albania was \u201cmovfing] closer to the west\u201d under the leadership of the Democratic Party (\u201cDP\u201d), which was taking action against those associated with the former Communist regime. The IJ found a \u201csubstantial change\u201d in the dominance of the \u201cMuslim Communist regime,\u201d remarking that evidence suggests that \u201c[significant Orthodox and Roman Cathode minorities are also now able to freely practice their religion whereas they were not able to do so during Albanians <em>[sic] </em>communist period.\u201d We have recently held that events that occurred in Albania under the Communist government and during the period of time between the fall of the Communist government and the success of the Democratic Party are \u201ctoo remote given the substantial change in circumstances\u201d in Albania to constitute past persecution. <em>Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.2006). Thus, the beatings that Gjuraj suffered cannot give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution, as they occurred while the Communist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Party was in power. In this instance, remand would be futile, because, even though the IJ\u2019s reasoning is deficient in certain respects, <em>see Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006) (even a \u201c \u2018minor beating\u2019 or, for that matter, any physical degradation designed to cause pain, humiliation, or other suffering, may rise to the level of persecution if it occurred in the context of an arrest or detention on the basis of a protected ground\u201d), we can state with confidence that the IJ would adhere to the same decision upon remand. <em>See Hoxhallari, </em>468 F.3d at 187; <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338-39 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ\u2019s finding that country conditions in Albania had changed for Christians, and that the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership was moving Albania \u201ccloser to the west,\u201d was based on the record, and adequately provides support for her finding that Gjuraj did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Hoxhallari, </em>468 F.3d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Gjuraj\u2019s failure to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out his asylum claim necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of deportation, which requires a higher burden of proof. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot. The pending request for oral argument is DISMISSED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
