Korman, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b35-18\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b35-19\">Petitioner Golam Rabbee Chowdhury petitions for review of a decision of the BIA denying his motion to reopen. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the issues on appeal and the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-20\">We review denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 76, 77 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the BIA must be filed no later than ninety days after the date of the BIA\u2019s decision, except in circumstances not relevant to petitioner. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2)-(e)(3). Yet petitioner\u2019s motion was filed more than a year after the BIA decision that he sought to reopen, and petitioner failed to introduce evidence into the administrative record before the BIA that he exercised <em>diligence </em>sufficient to support equitable tolling of the ninety-day limitations period set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). <em>See Iavorski v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-21\">Further, the BIA properly concluded as an alternative basis for its decision that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>favorable exercise of discretion allowing an adjustment in petitioner\u2019s status was not warranted. It is well settled that, where an alien is seeking to reopen removal proceedings, \u201cthe BIA may, \u2018in cases in which the ultimate grant of relief is discretionary,\u2019 such as adjustment of status, \u2018simply determine that even if [the first two requirements for granting a motion to reopen] were met, the movant would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mariuta v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 361, 364 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 105, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)). Here, the BIA determined that even if it reached the merits of petitioner\u2019s application for adjustment of status, petitioner would not be entitled to relief. Because such determinations fall firmly within the agency\u2019s discretion, we lack jurisdiction to review them on appeal. <em>See Mariuta, </em>411 F.3d at 364-65; <em>see also Rodriguez v. Gonzales, </em>451 F.3d 60, 62 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e have no jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determinations concerning either cancellation of removal or adjustment of status.... \u201d). Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise favorable discretion over his claims is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
