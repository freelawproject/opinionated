He maintained that Officer Cantu had done nothing to stop this assault. Rivera asserted that Salazar filed a fraudulent disciplinary report (DR) against him, charging him with possessing contraband (two razor blades) and threatening an officer (Salazar).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that summary judgment be granted in favor of defendants Salazar and Cantu. The magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation was based primarily on the following reasons: Rivera failed to establish a retaliatory motive because the \u201cchronology\u201d of the case showed that Rivera had threatened Salazar before he had threatened to file a grievance against Salazar and that Salazar had searched the cell and found the blades before Rivera made any such threat. Moreover, Rivera had no constitutional right to complain to a supervisor about Salazar\u2019s alleged misconduct. That Rivera was found guilty of the DR charging him with possession of contraband (although not guilty of charge that he threatened Salazar) showed that the DR was issued legitimately and not for a retaliatory motive. Finally, Rivera could not show retaliatory motive because his excessive-force complaint against Salazar was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s order granting a party\u2019s summary-judgment motion. <em>Whittaker v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>206 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate if the record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">\u201cTo state a valid claim for retaliation under section 1983, a prisoner must allege (1) a specific constitutional right, (2) the defendant\u2019s intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his or her exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory adverse act, and (4) causation.\u201d <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999). An inmate must allege more than his personal belief that he is the victim of retaliation. <em>Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 310 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cThe inmate must produce direct evidence of motivation or, the more probable scenario, \u2018allege a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred.\u2019\u201d <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">In declarations made under penalty of perjury, Rivera explicitly denied that he had threatened either Salazar or Cantu and that he had possessed razor blades in his cell. Contrary to the district court\u2019s determination that Rivera had submitted \u201cno evidence\u201d to disprove the disciplinary charges, Rivera\u2019s declarations amounted to competent summary-judgment evidence to dispute the accuracy of those charges. <em>See Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 (5th Cir.2003). Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u201cguilty\u201d finding as to the contraband DR was \u201cprobative and potent\u201d evidence that Rivera committed the infraction, it was not an \u201cabsolute bar\u201d to Rivera\u2019s retaliation claim. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). The court\u2019s conclusion that Rivera had no constitutional right to complain to a supervisor about Salazar\u2019s misconduct is not supported by this court\u2019s decisional authority. <em>See Hart, </em>343 F.3d at 764 (citing <em>Woods, </em>60 F.3d at 1164); <em>see also Gibbs v. King, </em>779 F.2d 1040, 1046 (5th Cir.1986). Finally, we conclude that the court\u2019s reliance <em>on Johnson, </em>110 F.3d at 311, for the proposition that Rivera\u2019s unsuccessful excessive-force complaint precludes a retaliation claim, was inapposite. <em>Johnson </em>addressed a retaliation claim by an inmate \u201cwrit writer\u201d who had been filing civil-rights and habeas lawsuits on behalf of fellow inmates. <em>See id. </em>at 309-11. We are not prepared to extend <em>Johnson </em>to preclude a retaliation claim in a case like Rivera\u2019s, in which the administrative disposition of his excessive-force claim was quite vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We conclude that Rivera\u2019s declarations were sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to his retaliation claim against defendant Salazar. For that reason and for the other reasons discussed above, we vacate and remand for further proceedings with respect to Rivera\u2019s retaliation claim against defendant Officer Salazar.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We affirm the order granting summary judgment as to defendant Officer Cantu. Rivera has effectively abandoned his conspiracy claim against Cantu by failing to brief the same, <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993), and his allegation that Cantu merely did nothing while Salazar abused Rivera is not sufficient to support the \u201cadverse act\u201d necessary for a retaliation claim. <em>See Jones, </em>188 F.3d at 324-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">We also affirm as to Rivera\u2019s claims that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions to compel discovery and to extend the time for filing a summary-judgment response. <em>See Moore v. Willis Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>233 F.3d 871, 876 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Becerra v. Asher, </em>105 F.3d 1042, 1048 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
