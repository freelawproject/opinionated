Hisle, debtor in bankruptcy, appeals the judgment of the district court reversing the bankruptcy court\u2019s award of sanctions to her based on appellee Bill Heard Chevrolet Corporation\u2019s violation of the automatic stay arising pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. The bankruptcy court imposed minimal sanctions on Bill Heard Chevrolet in the amount of $2500 based on its determination that Bill Heard Chevrolet\u2019s post-petition pursuit of its motion to dismiss Hisle\u2019s state court claim against it constituted an \u201coffensive action\u201d against an asset of the estate, in violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1) and (3). On appeal, the district court reversed, holding (a) that the automatic stay does not apply to a lawsuit instituted by the debtor; and (b) that a motion to dismiss the debtor\u2019s lawsuit is neither an \u201caction or proceeding against the debtor\u201d under \u00a7 362(a)(1) nor an \u201cact to obtain possession of or exercise control over property of the estate\u201d under \u00a7 363(a)(3). The district court thus held that Bill Heard Chevrolet\u2019s actions were not in violation of the automatic stay and that sanctions were imposed in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-21\">Having carefully considered the record on appeal, the briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, we are not persuaded that the district court erred in reversing the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. Appellant Hisle has failed to persuasively identify any error of fact or law in the district court\u2019s opinion. Because we conclude the reasoning that supports the district court\u2019s judgment has been correctly articulated by the district court, issuance of a detailed written opinion by this court would be duplicative and serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is, upon the reasoning employed in its opinion issued on February 10, 2006, hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
