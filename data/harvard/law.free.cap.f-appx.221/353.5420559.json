We reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">On May 23, 2005, Peque\u00f1o appealed to the district court an order of the bankruptcy court reconverting his bankruptcy case from a Chapter 13 proceeding back to Chapter 7 proceeding. On May 27, 2005, the district court dismissed his appeal without prejudice for failing to pay the required filing fee. Peque\u00f1o responded by filing a notice of appeal to this Court on May 31, 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One week later, Peque\u00f1o timely filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion to reconsider and reinstate his case in the district court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing either that the filing fee should be paid from his estate or that he should be allowed to pay the required fee and reinstate his case. On July 15, 2005, the district court denied Pequeno\u2019s Rule 59 motion, holding that it lacked jurisdiction to reinstate his case once Peque\u00f1o docketed an appeal in this Court and that Peque\u00f1o did not qualify as a \u201cdebtor in possession,\u201d as required for fees to be paid from his estate. Peque\u00f1o timely filed a notice of appeal challenging this ruling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Peque\u00f1o first argues that the district court erred in ruling that his May 31, 2005 notice of appeal deprived the district court of jurisdiction to reinstate his bankruptcy appeal. We agree. Pequeno\u2019s timely filed Rule 59 motion suspended the effect of his previously filed notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i) (\u201cIf a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment&amp;emdash; but before it disposes of [a motion to alter or amend the judgment]&amp;emdash;the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment or order, in whole or in part, when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.\u201d); <em>Ross v. Marshall, </em>426 F.3d 745, 751-52 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cOur court has found that the timely filing of a motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A) suspends or renders dormant a notice of appeal until all such motions are disposed of by the trial court. This holds true regardless of whether the motion was filed before or after the notice of appeal.\u201d) (footnotes omitted). The district court was therefore incorrect in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to reinstate Pequeno\u2019s bankruptcy appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">Peque\u00f1o next argues that the district court erred in holding that he was not a debtor in possession and, hence, that his bankruptcy appeal filing fees could not be paid from his estate. The Judicial Conference of the United States sets filing fees for bankruptcy cases. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1930(b). \u201cIf a trustee or debtor in pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>session is the appellant, the fee should be payable only from the estate and to the extent there is any estate realized.\u201d Judicial Conference Schedule of Fees, Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule, \u00b6 15, <em>reprinted in </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1930 [hereinafter \u201cParagraph 15\u201d]. Peque\u00f1o claims that his filing fee should be paid from his estate and not from his own pocket because he is a \u201cdebtor in possession\u201d within the meaning of Paragraph 15. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The term \u201cdebtor in possession\u201d is not, as Peque\u00f1o suggests, a literal phrase describing a debtor who is in actual possession of his estate. Rather, it is a defined term in chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(1), and normally refers only to certain Chapter 11 debtors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the case law appears to recognize the concept of a Chapter 13 debtor in possession in some contexts, we need not decide whether a Chapter 13 debtor qualifies as a \u201cdebtor in possession\u201d for purposes of Paragraph 15 because at the time of his bankruptcy appeal, Peque-no\u2019s case had been converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding by the bankruptcy court, meaning that he was a Chapter 7 debtor. Because a Chapter 7 debtor never qualifies as a debtor in possession,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Peque\u00f1o was not a debtor in possession entitled to have the appellate filing fee paid from his estate. Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that Peque\u00f1o was required to pay the fee himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">Peque\u00f1o stated in his Rule 59 motion that he was ready and able to pay the filing fee personally if he did not qualify for a fee waiver, and he argues on appeal that he should be allowed to pay the prescribed fee and reinstate his bankruptcy appeal. We agree. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s jurisdictional ruling and REMAND this case to the district court with instructions to afford Pe-que\u00f1o an opportunity to pay the filing fee himself and, if paid, reinstate his bankruptcy appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1025-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

R.App. P. 42(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">. Excluding weekends and holidays, Peque\u00f1o had until June 13, 2005 to file a Rule 59 motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) (\u201cAny motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be filed no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\u201d); Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a) (explaining that when computing a ten-day period under the rules, the court may not include Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, or Texas state holidays). Therefore, Pequeno's Rule 59 motion, filed on June 6, 2005, was timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">.See Fed.
