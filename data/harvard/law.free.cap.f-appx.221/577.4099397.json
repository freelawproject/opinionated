California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Quirarte-Ramos\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that she finds no meritorious issues for review, and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We have independently reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). We affirm the conviction. Because Quirarte-Ramos knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that an appeal waiver is valid when it is entered knowingly and voluntarily); <em>see also United States v. Cardenas, </em>405 F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir.2005) (observing that changes in sentencing law imposed by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not render waiver of appeal involuntary and unknowing).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DENY all other pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">We AFFIRM the conviction and DISMISS the appeal of the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
