To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. The motion to reopen was untimely, and this court has no jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision not to re-open the case sua sponte. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). We review de novo the claim of due process violations. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss the petition for review in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">Because Ramos-Morales has failed to show that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged due process violations, he has not established that his rights were violated. <em>See Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1099, 1105 (9th Cir.2004) (petitioner must show how due process violations affected the outcome of the proceedings); <em>Gutierrez-Chavez v. INS, </em>298 F.3d 824, 830 (9th Cir.2002), <em>amended by </em>337 F.3d 1023 (9th Cir.2003) (in order to show that an incomplete translation resulted in a due process violation, the petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate that a better translation likely would have made a difference in the outcome\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b704-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
