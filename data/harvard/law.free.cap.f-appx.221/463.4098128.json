We affirmed his conviction, <em>United States v. Olson, </em>450 F.3d 655 (7th Cir.2006), and ordered a limited remand to ask whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime. <em>United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471, 483-84 (7th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1343, 164 L.Ed.2d 57 (2006). The district court has now indicated that it would likely impose a different sentence in light of the additional discretion afforded by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court therefore asks us to vacate Olson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. In their responses to the district court\u2019s statement, both Olson and the government ask us to vacate Olson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. Therefore, we VACATE Olson\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
