We grant his petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">For purposes of this appeal, we assume Hovsepyan is a Yezidi Kurd, as described in his application for asylum. The transcript from the asylum hearing consistently reflects his testimony that he is an \u201cAcetic\u201d Kurd, which is apparently a phonetic spelling of \u201cYezidi.\u201d Hovsepyan also describes his religion as worshiping fire, which is consistent with being Yezidi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ, who found Hovsepyan\u2019s testimony entirely credible and consistent with his application, apparently meant to hand-correct the transcription misspelling in her ruling, but substituted \u201cAzeri\u201d for \u201cAcetic.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It therefore seems clear that the IJ\u2019s reference to Hovsepyan as Azeri is a scrivener\u2019s error, and that Hovsepyan has consistently referred to himself as Yezidi throughout the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">With respect to the asylum claim, while substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Hovsepyan\u2019s loss of employment was discrimination, but not \u201cthe type of economic deprivation that ris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>es to the level of persecution,\u201d <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003), substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s determination that the visits to Hovsepyan\u2019s home by the \u201cFenians\u201d were not \u201con account of\u2019 Hovsepyan\u2019s race, religion or membership in a particular social group. Hovsepyan testified that the Fenians were targeting minority groups in Armenia, and an applicant\u2019s \u201cuncontroverted and credible testimony is sufficient to establish that [he] was persecuted on account of ethnicity.\u201d <em>Shoafera v. INS, </em>228 F.3d 1070, 1075 (9th Cir.2000). Moreover, the Country Conditions Report confirms that Yezidis are a minority of only 20,000 in Armenia who report frequent societal and governmental discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Similarly, substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s determination that the Fenians were not a group the government was unable or unwilling to control. Even though Hovsepyan did not report the first incident to the authorities, he testified that he reported the June incident and that the Militia took no further action about the matter, and also appears to relate another incident with a lack of police response.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Country Conditions Report clearly supports Hovsepyan\u2019s position, specifically reporting that Yezidis complain of a \u201clack of police response to serious crimes committed against Yezidis by other citizens.\u201d <em>See Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1036 (9th Cir.1999) (concluding Armenian government was unable or unwilling to control elements of society that targeted the country\u2019s religious minorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Finally, substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s determination that Hovsepyan\u2019s arrest and beatings in May 1998 were not on account of a protected ground. Again, Hovsepyan credibly testified that the police took action against him and his neighbors not only because of their involvement in the fight, but because they were Yezidi. His belief is further corroborated by circumstantial evidence, as he testified that although there were several people involved in the altercation, the police only arrested and hit the three Yezidis. The Country Conditions Report again corroborates Hovsepyan with reports of arbitrary arrest and beatings during interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">In sum, the evidence compels the conclusion that Hovsepyan suffered \u201con account of\u2019 a protected ground and at the hands of the government or a group the Armenian government is unable or unwilling to control. The IJ, however, did not determine whether these events rose to the level of \u201cpersecution,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we therefore remand for further proceedings pursuant to <em>INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We note that an asylum \u201capplicant may suffer persecution because of the cumulative impact of several incidents even where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>no single incident would constitute persecution on its own.\u201d <em>Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1076 (9th Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Finally, we note that Hovsepyan has represented to this court that his wife has been granted asylum in a separate proceeding, which is not part of the administrative record in this appeal. We therefore base no part of our decision on this information; however, on remand, for the sake of uniformity and family unity, the BIA or IJ should consider the circumstances of that grant and whether the cases can or should be consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">PETITION GRANTED; REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-12\">. According to the State Department's Country Conditions report on Armenia, Yezidis practice a religion drawing elements from \u201cZoroastrianism, Islam, and animism.\u201d Zoroastrianism is commonly referred to as \"fire-worship.\u201d Oxford English Dictionary, <em>www. oed.com.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-19\">. Azeris are distinct from Yezidis, and are not a recognized community in Armenia, as there are only a few hundred remaining in the countiy following the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Indeed, Hovsepyan's own application discusses the conflict and notes that an Armenian nationalist group \"killed the cruel and dangerous Azeries.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\">. The transcript is not clear, but when Hovsepyan was asked why he believed the government supported the Fenians or would not take action against them, he testified: \"Because when we were returning to (indiscernible) they wouldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">. The only comment the IJ made on this subject was that the incidents did not rise to the level of <em>severe </em>persecution so as to necessitate a grant of asylum without consideration of the likelihood of future persecution. <em>See Matter of Chen, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 16 (BIA 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b621-12\">. Because we remand on the asylum claim, we do not reach Hovsepyan's claim for withholding of removal, and we lack jurisdiction to review his appeal from a denial of voluntary departure. <em>Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1164, 1166 (9th Cir.2004). Hovsepyan\u2019s claim that his due process rights were violated when the BIA affirmed the IJ without an opinion is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
