Brown objected to his classification as a career offender, arguing in reliance on <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 27-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (Thomas, J. concurring), his prior convictions should not be used to enhance his sentence, despite <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (sentence-enhancing prior conviction need not be charged in indictment; due process does not require treating recidivism as element of offense). The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> overruled the objection, and sentenced Brown to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Brown appeals, arguing his sentence violates the Fifth and Eighth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">These arguments are unavailing. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>408 F.3d 535, 540 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has never overruled its decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and <em>Shepard </em>did not alter the rule that a court may consider prior criminal history as a sentencing factor.\u201d); <em>United States v. Collins, </em>340 F.3d 672, 679 (8th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe Eighth Amendment forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)). Brown\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-12\">. The Honorable Stephen N.
