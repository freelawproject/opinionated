Summers, Jr., and Roscoe Tucker brought this action against Defendants William J. Charnock, individually and in his official capacity as the Kanawha County Prosecuting Attorney, and the Kanawha County Commission alleging they were terminated from their employment with the Kanawha County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), the First Amendment, and Article X, Section 7 of the West Virginia Constitution. Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the ground they are entitled to qualified immunity for Plaintiffs\u2019 terminations. The district court denied Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground it was unable to determine whether Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity based on the record before it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Keeney v. Charnock, </em>No. 2:05-ev-00390 (S.D.W.Va. July 26, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\"> We read the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order as authorizing the Defendants to again seek dismissal on the grounds of qualified immunity following the completion of appropriate discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
