Martinez also appeals the district court\u2019s rejection of his blanket objections to the defendant\u2019s evidence as unauthenticated. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-20\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, it must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings on summary judgment are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">Martinez cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation because he cannot establish causation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He pointed to insufficient evidence of a causal link between his former co-workers\u2019 poor reviews of him when he sought a new job and his 1995 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Equal Employment Opportunity complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Even if Martinez had established a prima facie case of retaliation, Martinez would be unable to meet his burden of showing that the Secretary\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for providing negative references \u2014 Martinez\u2019s poor work performance \u2014 was pretext for a retaliatory motive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He did not point to either direct or \u201cspecific and substantial\u201d circumstantial evidence in the record establishing that the Secretary\u2019s proffered non-discriminatory explanation was mere pretext.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court did not err by granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The district court also did not err, must less abuse its discretion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by overruling Martinez\u2019s objections to the evidence. Martinez himself produced or relied on much of the evidence to which he objected.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court was well within its discretion to rule that the rest of the evidence to which Martinez objected was authentic.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-15\">. <em>Olsen v.
