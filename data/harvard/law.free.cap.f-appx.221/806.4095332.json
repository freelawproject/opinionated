McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b834-18\">In this pro se \u00a7 2254 prisoner appeal, Petitioner challenges his state court conviction on five counts of aggravated robbery, one count of criminal threat, and one count of obstruction of official duty. Petitioner claimed in his habeas petition that his conviction was unconstitutional because there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied his petition and his request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). In his COA application to this court, Petitioner only raises the ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-23\">To obtain a COA, Petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In order to meet this burden, Petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-24\">Petitioner argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise the issue of marital privilege in order to prevent the use of testimony from Petitioner\u2019s alleged common-law wife. Petitioner first raised this issue in a state collateral attack on his conviction. After reviewing portions of the trial transcript and hearing testimony from Petitioner, his mother, his alleged common-law wife, and his trial counsel, the state district court determined that trial counsel could not have succeeded in invoking the marital privilege because the evidence did not show the existence of a common-law marriage at the time of trial. This decision was affirmed by the state appellate court. Because \u201cit is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>terminations on state-law questions,\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 885 (1991), we will not reconsider the state courts\u2019 determination that there was no common-law marriage at the time of trial. Accordingly, we agree with the district court that it would have been futile for counsel to argue that the marital privilege applied and, as a result, that counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise this issue. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We have carefully reviewed Petitioner\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Petitioner\u2019s filing raises an issue which meets our standard for the grant of a COA. For substantially the reasons set forth by the district court, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS the appeal. We do, however, GRANT Petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-19\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
