For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Hendricks is an alien subject to a final order of removal from the United States. He challenged the final order of removal by filing a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Hendricks also challenged his continued detention while awaiting removal from the United States. By order entered March 15, 2006, the Second Circuit stayed Hendricks\u2019 removal pending judicial review. The Second Circuit also transferred Hendricks\u2019 challenge to his continued detention to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to be treated as a habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2241. The District Court concluded that Hendricks\u2019 continued detention is lawful and denied his habeas corpus petition. Hendricks filed a timely appeal to this Court. Meanwhile, Hendricks withdrew his petition for review of the final order of removal; the Second Circuit closed those proceedings on February 22, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">We agree with the District Court that Hendricks\u2019 continued detention is permissible under the applicable statutory scheme. Generally, the government must effectuate the removal of an alien within ninety days of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A); <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 682, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001). During the removal period, the government detains the alien. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1231(a)(2); <em>Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 683, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Aliens who are removable may be detained beyond the ninety-day period only as long as \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to effectuate their removal from the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 689, 699, 121 S.Ct. 2491. The presumptive period reasonably necessary to effectuate removal is six months. <em>Id. </em>at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491. After the six-month period expires, the alien may be eligible for conditional release if he can demonstrate that there is \u201cno significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Here, Hendricks asserts that he has been in detention continuously since February 2006, a period of time which obviously exceeds six months. Under the statutory scheme, however, \u201c[i]f the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of removal,\u201d the removal period does not begin until \u201cthe date of the court\u2019s final order.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(l)(B)(ii); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.4(g)(1)(i)(B); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 147 (2d Cir.2003). As described previously, the Second Circuit ordered a stay of removal on March 15, 2006, but did not enter a final order in Hendricks\u2019 petition for review until February 22, 2007. In other words, Hendricks\u2019 removal period has just begun; his continued detention during the removal period is permissible under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Hendricks\u2019 habeas corpus petition. In light of our disposition, Hendricks\u2019 request for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-14\">. Based on the record before us, we are unable to determine whether Hendricks is removable or inadmissible. We need not determine his precise status, however, because the governing principles apply to removable aliens and inadmissible aliens alike. <em>See Clark v. Martinez, </em>543 U.S. 371, 378, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
