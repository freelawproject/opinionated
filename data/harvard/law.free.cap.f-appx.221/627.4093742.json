Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">James David Newsome (\u201cNewsome\u201d) appeals his sentence, untouched on a limited remand pursuant to <em>United States v. Ameline </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because we conclude that: (1) Newsome had no constitutional or statutory right to allocution during the limited remand, <em>United States v. Silva, </em>472 F.3d 683, 689 (9th Cir.2007), (2) the district court did not err in its application of the career offender enhancement under United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1, as implicitly held by our prior panel, and (3) Newsome\u2019s sentence is reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Although our prior panel did not explicitly address Newsome\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s application of the career offender enhancement prior to ordering an <em>Ameline </em>remand, <em>see United States v. Newsome, </em>137 Fed.Appx. 65, 66-67 (9th Cir.2005), its imposition of a limited <em>Ameline </em>remand \u2014 as opposed to a full resentencing \u2014 implicitly affirmed the application and we agree. Newsome suggests the available record did not adequately establish that he had two qualifying career offender predicate offenses. Newsome failed to object to the district court\u2019s application at the time of sentencing, so our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Casarez-Bravo, </em>181 F.3d 1074, 1076 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">Although Newsome\u2019s uncontested presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) may be ambiguous with respect to Newsome\u2019s 1993 conviction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> insofar as it lists a qualifying offense (Bank Robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)) in the \u201cCharge/Agency\u201d column, but fails to specify the offense Newsome was convicted of in the \u201cDate Sentence Imposed/Disposition\u201d column, <em>cf. United States v. Sandoval-Venegas, </em>292 F.3d 1101, 1108-09 (9th Cir.2002), any ambiguity is resolved by Newsome\u2019s certified judgment of conviction for this offense contained in the record, which clearly establishes that Newsome pled guilty to \u201carmed robbery of a bank and unarmed robbery of a bank in violation of 18 USC 2113(a) [&amp;] (d) and 18 USC 2113(a).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) is categorically a crime of violence for career offender purposes, see <em>United States v. Selfa, </em>918 F.2d 749, 751 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(9th Cir.1990), and all other prerequisites were met, the district court did not err in applying the career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Our \u201creasonableness\u201d review of a district court\u2019s determination \u2014 on <em>Ameline </em>remand \u2014 that it would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory Guidelines system \u201c[is not] the same as the reasonableness review we conduct on post-<em>Booker </em>sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294, 1296 (9th Cir.2006). Rather, it is limited to determining \u201c[w]hether the district judge properly understood the full scope of his discretion in a <em>post-Booker </em>world.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Under this restricted scope of review, Newsome\u2019s sentence is reasonable because the district judge clearly understood the full scope of her sentencing discretion, specifically noting the advisory nature of the Guidelines and adopting the government\u2019s arguments referencing the court\u2019s \u201cauthority to depart from the pertinent range.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1297.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-12\">. Newsome does not challenge the use of his 1984 bank robbery conviction as a predicate offense for career offender purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-13\">. The record contains additional evidence concerning Newsome\u2019s 1993 conviction \u2014 in-eluding Newsome's attorney's representations in open court and/or in pretrial motions that Newsome had suffered two prior bank robbery convictions and that \u201cNewsome\u2019s prior convictions for bank robbery are the same as the instant charges [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113]\u201d \u2014 the sufficiency of which we need not, and do not, decide in light of the unambiguous certified judgment of conviction contained in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\">. Even if we were to assume the district court erred in relying on Newsome\u2019s partly ambiguous PSR to apply the career offender enhancement, in light of the abundant evidence on the record establishing that Newsome had suffered two prior qualifying convictions, the forfeited error did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings and, on plain error review, we would decline to notice it. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 469-70, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997); <em>Ameline, </em>409 F.3d at 1078.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-10\">. Even though the mandate in <em>Combs </em>has yet to issue, we find it unnecessary to postpone our decision here because even under a full <em>post-Booker </em>reasonableness review, New-some's overall sentence is reasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1280 (9th Cir.2006). As noted above, the district court did not err in applying the career offender enhancement. In addition, on remand, the court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, ultimately concluding that Newsome's sentence was warranted in light of his lengthy criminal history and the need to provide adequate deterrence, promote respect for the law, and reflect the seriousness of the offense. Finally, the court properly acknowledged Newsome's potentially mitigating circumstances, but concluded they did not warrant a materially different sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
