Dec. 28, 2005) <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 267 228 (Immigr. Ct. N.Y. City July 22, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in some respects but not others, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tiartr-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir. 2004); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339-40 (2d Cir. 2006) (agreeing with this principle, but avoiding remand, in spite of deficiencies in an adverse credibility determination, because it could be confidently predicted that the IJ would adhere to the decision were the case remanded).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Inconsistencies and other discrepancies in the evidence are often sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination, but they need not be fatal if they are minor and isolated, and the testimony is otherwise generally consistent, rational, and believable. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000). To form the basis of an adverse credibility determination, a discrepancy must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003). The agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so. <em>See, e.g., Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Here, the IJ was reasonable in relying on the inconsistencies regarding the dates, sequence, and details of Sacko\u2019s two alleged militia attacks, as they form the central elements of Sacko\u2019s claims of persecution. <em>Secaidar-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09. A reasonable adjudicator would not have been compelled to accept Sacko\u2019s explanation that someone made a mistake in preparing his application, and the IJ was thus reasonable in rejecting it. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81. Thus, these inconsistencies were an appropriate basis for the negative credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is thus supported by substantial evidence in the record, and its denial of asylum was appropriate. Because the only evidence of a threat to Sacko\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (per curiam). Because Sacko\u2019s CAT claim was predicated on the same facts as his claims for asylum and withholding of removal, the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief based on his lack of credibility was also appropriate. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having complet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
