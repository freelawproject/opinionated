The relevant facts are set forth in <em>Roberts v. City of Shreveport, </em>397 F.3d 287 (5th Cir.2005). We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">1. Plaintiff Joyce C. Roberts, the mother of Carter, contends that the district court erred by holding that she has no standing to pursue a claim under \u00a7 1983. We look to state law to determine who may recover under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Rhyne v. Henderson County, </em>973 F.2d 386, 390-91 (5th Cir.1992). The Louisiana statutes governing survival and wrongful death actions allow surviving parents to bring such an action \u201cif he [the decedent] left no spouse or child surviving.\u201d La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 2315.1 <em>&amp; </em>2315.2 (West 1997). In this case, Carter is survived by two minor children, and thus Roberts has no standing to bring suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">2. The plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Springs of Grace Baptist Church, arguing that the Church was vicariously liable for Rivet\u2019s tortious actions. Under Louisiana law, an employer is liable for the tortious acts of an employee if the employee\u2019s actions were within the course and scope of his employment. <em>LeBrane v. Lewis, </em>292 So.2d 216, 217-18 (La.1974). Vicarious liability will attach \u201conly if the employee is acting within the ambit of his assigned duties and in furtherance of his of his employer\u2019s objectives.\u201d <em>Wearrien v. Viverette, </em>35-446 (La.App. 2 Cir. 12/5/01) 803 So.2d 297, 300. \u201cThe employee\u2019s tortious conduct must be so closely connected in time, place, and causation to his employment duties as to be regarded a risk of harm fairly attributable to the employer\u2019s business, as compared with conduct motivated by purely personal considerations entirely extraneous to the employer\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To determine whether the actions were within the course and scope of employment, courts consider the following four factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-17\">(1) whether the tortious act was primarily employment rooted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>(2) whether the act was reasonably incidental to the performance of the employee\u2019s duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">(3) whether the act occurred on the employer\u2019s premises; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">(4) whether it occurred during the hours of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In this case, the act indisputably occurred within the hours of employment, on the employer\u2019s premises, and thus two of the four factors are met. However, Rivet\u2019s actions in killing Carter were not primarily related to his job as a crossing-guard, but to his own self-defense and his duties as a police officer. Furthermore, the shooting was not incidental to the duties of a crossing guard, nor in furtherance of the Church\u2019s objectives. Thus, the Church cannot be held liable for Rivet\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">3. The plaintiffs argue that the district court improperly denied summary judgment on their state law tort claims against the City of Shreveport. They contend that the jury verdict against Rivet means that Rivet was negligent. However, the jury\u2019s verdict on the plaintiffs\u2019 federal law claims does not constitute a finding that Rivet was negligent under Louisiana law, and thus the district court did not err in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">4. Finally, plaintiffs contend that they have demonstrated a pattern of unconstitutional conduct by Officer Rivet, and therefore the district court judge erred in granting summary judgment for the City of Shreveport and the former Chief of Police on plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">We have already addressed the pattern of allegedly unconstitutional conduct to which the plaintiffs refer, and held that \u201cplaintiffs fall short in attempting to demonstrate a pattern of unconstitutional conduct on the part of Officer Rivet.\u201d <em>Roberts v. City of Shreveport, </em>397 F.3d 287, 294 (5th Cir.2005). Plaintiffs have adduced no further evidence of unconstitutional behavior. Thus, plaintiffs have not shown that the City condoned any unconstitutional policy, custom, or practice that caused a violation of Carter\u2019s constitutional rights, and their argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
