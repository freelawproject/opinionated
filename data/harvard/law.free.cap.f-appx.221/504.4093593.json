Finding that McCoy qualified for the sentence enhancement provided in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 188 months in prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (defendant who violates \u00a7 922(g)(1) and has 3 prior convictions for violent felonies is subject to 15-year minimum sentence). On appeal, McCoy challenges the sentence enhancement under the ACCA, arguing that the court erred in finding that his two tampering convictions in Missouri were separate criminal episodes and violent felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">We review a district court\u2019s factual interpretations for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>431 F.3d 332, 337 (8th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2345, 164 L.Ed.2d 859 (2006). \u201cTo qualify as predicate offenses under the [ACCA], each conviction must be a separate and distinct criminal episode, rather than part of a continuous course of conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Deroo, </em>304 F.3d 824, 828 (8th Cir.2002). Although McCoy\u2019s tampering convictions involved the same victim (Springfield Auto Auction), we conclude that the underlying criminal activity \u2014 cutting a hole in a parking lot fence, stealing a car, and abandoning it, then returning the next day through the same hole in the fence and stealing a truck\u2014 amounted to two discrete criminal episodes. <em>Cf. United States v. Washington, </em>898 F.2d 439, 442 (5th Cir.1990) (two robberies committed against same convenience-store clerk within hours were separate criminal episodes, and not crime spree). We further conclude that McCoy\u2019s convictions for tampering constitute violent felonies under section 924(e). <em>See United States v. Adams, </em>442 F.3d 645, 647 (8th Cir.2006) (under controlling precedent, Missouri conviction for tampering with motor vehicle by operation qualifies as violent felony within meaning of \u00a7 924(e)), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. Sept. 13, 2006) (No. 06-6541); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>417 F.3d 990, 999 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-13\">. The Honorable Richard E.
