(\u201cECMC\u201d) and John Steiger each appeal from the district court\u2019s order granting a partial discharge of Steiger\u2019s student loans held by ECMC. In light of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>In re Frushour, </em>433 F.3d 393 (4th Cir.2005), decided after the district court\u2019s decision in this case, we reverse. Applying <em>Frushour, </em>we find that Steiger has not met the undue hardship standard for discharge of a student loan debt pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8) (2000). We grant Steiger\u2019s motion to consolidate appeals No. 05-2100 and No. 05-2107, but deny his motion to consolidate these two appeals with appeal Nos. 05-2104 and 05-2106, which were previously dismissed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
