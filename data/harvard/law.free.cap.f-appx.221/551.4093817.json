We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-18\">Wilson argues that the district judge \u201cerred in allowing the second degree murder charge to go to the jury\u201d because \u201cthe [government failed to prove ... malice aforethought,\u201d an element of second degree murder. When a defendant fails to move for acquittal during trial, review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>338 F.3d 1054, 1057 (9th Cir.2003). At trial, Wilson challenged the sufficiency of the evidence as to premeditation, an element of first degree murder, and renewed the same challenge at the close of all the evidence. He did not, however, challenge the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to malice aforethought prior to this appeal. Thus, we review for plain error. <em>Cf. Ross, </em>338 F.3d at 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-19\">Wilson argues that his motion for acquittal should have been granted because the government \u201coffered no proof that [Wilson] acted with malice aforethought.\u201d We have stated that \u201c[m]alice aforethought may be inferred from circumstances .... \u201d <em>United States v. Lesina, </em>833 F.2d 156, 159 (9th Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, \u201c[i]t is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>clear that malice aforethought may be inferred from evidence of use of a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>819 F.2d 221, 226 (9th Cir.1987). The record reflects that Wilson deliberately invaded the victim\u2019s home to \u201ctake matters into [his] own hands\u201d; that Wilson hit the victim; that the victim ran away; that Wilson grabbed a rifle; and that Wilson fired multiple shots in the direction of the fleeing victim and killed him. Under the circumstances, there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Wilson next argues that the district judge\u2019s jury instructions failed to distinguish adequately between the quantum of recklessness necessary for the jury to infer malice aforethought, an element of second degree murder, versus the recklessness needed to prove involuntary manslaughter. When there is no objection to the jury instructions at the time of trial, we review for plain error. <em>See Jones v. United States </em>527 U.S. 373, 387-88,119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">At trial, Wilson failed to object with sufficient specificity to the quantum of recklessness necessary under second degree murder versus involuntary manslaughter. <em>Cf. </em>Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 30(d) (\u201cA party who objects to ... [jury] instructions ... must inform the court of the <em>specific </em>objection and the grounds\u201d) (emphasis added). Although he raised an objection relating the amount of recklessness, he raised it only with respect to the distinction between second degree murder and <em>voluntary, </em>and not involuntary, manslaughter. Accordingly, the district judge interpreted Wilson\u2019s objection as referring to voluntary, and not involuntary manslaughter. <em>Cf. United States v. Kessi, </em>868 F.2d 1097, 1101-02 (9th Cir.1989) (applying a previous version of Rule 30). Since Wilson did not properly raise the issqe at trial, we review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The district judge instructed that malice aforethought included killing \u201crecklessly, <em>with extreme disregard </em>for human life,\u201d whereas involuntary manslaughter included acting with \u201creckless disregard for human life which might produce death.\u201d In <em>Lesina, </em>we held that the district judge erred where the instructions \u201c[made] it appear as though there is no difference between the severity of second degree murder and manslaughter....\u201d 833 F.2d at 158. In contrast, here, the trial court distinguished between mere recklessness and recklessness with extreme disregard for human life. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Finally, Lewis contends that the cumulative errors in his case affected the underlying fairness of his trial. Since there were no errors, this argument is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
