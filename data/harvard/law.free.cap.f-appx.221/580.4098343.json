The district court subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>quently sentenced Anaya to time already served for both counts (392 days), followed by two years of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As one condition of his supervised release, Anaya was ordered to \u201ccooperate as directed in the collection of a DNA sample,\u201d pursuant to the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (\u201cDNA Act\u201d). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14135a (2000). On appeal, Anaya challenges the constitutionality of the DNA Act, arguing that the statute violates the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Commerce Clause. We review challenges to the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo, see United States v. Serang, </em>156 F.3d 910, 913 (9th Cir.1998), and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Anaya\u2019s appeal is directly controlled by <em>United States v. Reynard, </em>473 F.3d 1008 (9th Cir.2007). There, we squarely rejected the same three constitutional challenges to the DNA Act that Anaya raises here.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">First, <em>Reynard </em>held that consideration of the argument that \u201cthe DNA Act violates the Fourth Amendment because it authorizes a search without requiring individualized suspicion\u201d was \u201cforeclosed\u201d by our circuit\u2019s prior decisions in <em>United States v. Hugs, </em>384 F.3d 762 (9th Cir.2004), and <em>United States v. Kincade, </em>379 F.3d 813 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 924, 125 S.Ct. 1638, 161 L.Ed.2d 483 (2005). <em>See Reynard, </em>473 F.3d at 1013. As a result, Anaya\u2019s Fourth Amendment challenge to the DNA Act fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Following <em>Reynard, </em>Anaya\u2019s Fifth Amendment challenge to the DNA Act also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1022 (rejecting the argument that \u201cextraction of DNA information violates [one\u2019s] Fifth Amendment right not to be subject to the compelled production of any incriminating evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Finally, given <em>Reynard\u2019s </em>holding that \u201cthe DNA Act constitutes a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s power pursuant to the Commerce Clause,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1024, Anaya\u2019s last constitutional challenge fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">Anaya\u2019s supplemental brief is directed at challenging whether <em>Reynard </em>was correctly decided. As a three-judge panel, we are precluded from considering that question, absent some pertinent change in the law after <em>Reynard. See Miller v. Gammie, </em>335 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc) (holding that \u201ca three-judge panel may not overrule a prior decision of the court\u201d unless the \u201cprior decision, [has] been undercut by higher authority to such an extent that it has been effectively overruled\u201d). There has been no such change.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b608-28\"> xhiS panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">. Anaya was originally sentenced to serve two eighteen-month sentences, to run concurrently, followed by two years of supervised release. The district court imposed the current sentence after the Ninth Circuit remanded the matter, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
