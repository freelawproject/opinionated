Strohmeyer was sentenced to three consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and one term of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. Strohmeyer filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Nevada state court. After holding a two-day evidentiary hearing, the state trial court denied the petition and issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. The state court determined that Strohmeyer\u2019s plea was voluntary and his counsel was effective. The Nevada Supreme Court, finding support in the record for the trial court\u2019s factual determinations, denied the petition as well. Strohmeyer then filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court. The federal district court denied the petition and certified four issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-18\">We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>\u00a7 2254. <em>Riley v. Payne, </em>352 F.3d 1313, 1317 (9th Cir.2003). The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) governs our review. We may only grant relief if the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as defined by the United States Supreme Court, or based on unreasonable factual determinations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The petitioner first contends that the district court erred by failing to separate the legal conclusions from the factual determinations made by the state court as required by <em>Lambert v. Blodgett, </em>393 F.3d 943 (9th Cir.2004), and, consequently, erred by giving deference to mixed determinations of fact and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Although the district court did not explicitly state that it was separating the state court\u2019s findings of fact from its conclusions of law, the court did just that. The district court appropriately reviewed the determinations of fact for reasonableness pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d)(2), and correctly reviewed the state court\u2019s conclusions of law \u2014 namely that Strohmeyer\u2019s plea was voluntary and that he was not denied effective assistance of counsel \u2014 pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The petitioner also argues that the district court relied on, and gave deference to, the state court\u2019s rejection of facts, rather than its factual findings. This distinction is meaningless. The state court\u2019s finding that something <em>was not </em>the case, for example, that petitioner <em>was not </em>told that his sentences had to run consecutively, is as much a factual determination as a finding by the court that something <em>was </em>the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The second issue on appeal concerns the petitioner\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing in federal court. Strohmeyer has failed to meet the requirements for an evidentiary hearing set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). Strohmeyer\u2019s request appears to be grounded solely in his dissatisfaction with the state trial court\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Next, the petitioner argues that the state trial court\u2019s findings of fact were unreasonable because they were directly contradicted by the testimony that Strohmeyer\u2019s trial counsel, Leslie Abramson and Richard Wright, gave at the hearing. The petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the evidentiary hearing testimony is unpersuasive. The state trial court made specific findings of fact, which are supported by the record, rejecting the petitioner\u2019s allegations. The state trial court\u2019s factual determinations were not objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">In contesting the reasonableness of the state court\u2019s factual findings, the petitioner also argues that it was unreasonable for the state court and the federal district court to ignore Richard Wright\u2019s alleged conflict of interest. This claim was raised neither below nor in the state court proceedings, and therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); <em>see also Jiminez v. Rice, </em>276 F.3d 478, 481 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Lastly, the petitioner argues that the state court\u2019s determinations \u2014 that Strohmeyer received constitutionally effective counsel and that his plea was voluntary \u2014 are contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland, v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The petitioner specifically contends that his trial counsel provided him with inaccurate information concerning his possible sentencing outcomes and his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">The petitioner\u2019s argument, here, rests on his allegation that his trial counsel pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>vided him with \u201cerroneous advice.\u201d The state trial court found to the contrary, concluding that the advice Strohmeyer received was \u201clegally and factually accurate and sufficiently detailed.\u201d The court further found that neither attorney told Strohmeyer that \u201cthe Court was mandated to run all sentences consecutively,\u201d or that he \u201ccould not then appeal issues raised pretrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Given that the state court\u2019s findings of fact were not objectively unreasonable, they are entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). In light of these factual determinations, the state court\u2019s decision that Strohmeyer\u2019s counsel was constitutionally effective and that his plea was voluntary does not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as defined by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b661-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
