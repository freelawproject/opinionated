We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-19\">\u201cAn order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not renewable on appeal.... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). The Supreme Court has made clear that a remand order based on untimely removal is not appealable. <em>Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, </em>516 U.S. 124, 126-28, 116 S.Ct. 494, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995); <em>see also Wilkins v. Rogers, </em>581 F.2d 399, 403 (4th Cir.1978) (a district court\u2019s order finding that the notice of removal is not timely filed is not reviewable on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-21\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
