The Government introduced this form at trial, and Defendant\u2019s counsel did not object. After Defendant\u2019s conviction, her counsel learned in a post-trial conversation that at least one juror noticed the sentencing information on the \u2018Warning to Alien\u201d form, which stated Defendant faced a maximum sentence of twenty years. Defendant moved for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Applying the \u201cplain error\u201d standard, the district court concluded that Defendant was not unfairly prejudiced by jury\u2019s exposure to sentencing information and therefore denied Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. This ruling can only be overturned if it was an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bhagat, </em>436 F.3d 1140, 1145 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion. The record does not reflect that anyone other than the one juror noticed the sentencing information in the form. Thus, there is no evidence that the jury considered Defendant\u2019s potential punishment in reaching its verdict. In fact, the juror\u2019s question of Defendant\u2019s counsel about what sentence Defendant could receive effectively negates the possibility that any conversation regarding sentencing affected the jury\u2019s deliberations. Nor is there any reason to conclude that Defendant was prejudiced as a result of the inclusion of the sentencing information, given that the one juror who did notice the sentencing information believed Defendant would receive the maximum punishment, twenty years. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that the introduction of the \u201cWarning to Alien\u201d exhibit had no prejudicial impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"Aba\">Defendant\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Defendant asserts the District Court erred when it applied a sixteen level enhancement for \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d based on her prior conviction for possession of marijuana for sale in violation of Arizona Revised Statute (\u201cA.R.S.\u201d) \u00a7 13-3405(A)(2). According to Defendant, her prior conviction under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3405(A)(2) was not a \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d offense because it prohibited a person from \u201cknowingly ... possessing] marijuana for sale.\u201d Because the sentencing guidelines define \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d as an intent offense, and \u201cknowingly\u201d is a lower standard than \u201cintent\u201d under Arizona law, Defendant asserts that her prior conviction did not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d offense under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1279 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">The Sentencing Guidelines define \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with <em>intent </em>to manufacture, import, export, <em>distribute, or dispense.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), cmt. n. l(B)(iv) (emphasis added). A sixteen level enhancement is appropriate when a defendant received a sentence exceeding thirteen months for a \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d offense. <em>Id </em>at \u00a7 2L.1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Arizona Revised Statute section 13-3405(A)(2) provides that \u201cA person shall not <em>knowingly ... </em>Possess marijuana <em>for sale.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). In the instant case, the district court determined that the preposition \u201cfor\u201d in the phrase \u201cfor sale\u201d is an express statement of intention, i.e. one cannot possess anything \u201cfor sale\u201d absent an <em>intent </em>to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The parties agree that the categorical approach recognized in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), should be used to determine whether Defendant\u2019s prior conviction is a drug trafficking offense under the Sentencing Guidelines. The <em>Taylor </em>approach \u201clook[s] only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Arizona courts define the elements of possession of a narcotic for sale under Section 13-3405 as: (1) exercise of dominion and control over the substance; (2) knowledge that the substance is present; (3) knowledge that the substance is a narcotic; and (4) possession of the substance <em>for the purpose of sale. State of Arizona v. Salinas, </em>181 Ariz. 104, 106-07, 887 P.2d 985, 987-88 (1994), <em>citing State of Arizona v. Arce, </em>107 Ariz. 156, 160, 483 P.2d 1395, 1399 (1971) (emphasis added). Because the words \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cintent\u201d are synonyms,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court correctly determined that violation of ARS 13-3405 is a drug trafficking offense as defined in the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b561-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
