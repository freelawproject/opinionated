Middlebrook, </em>141 Fed.Appx. 834 (11th Cir.2005), we affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions for armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d) (Count One), possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count Two), and conspiracy to commit a robbery that affected interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (Count Three). We vacated appellant\u2019s sentences under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), however, and remanded the case for resentencing. On remand, the district court sentenced appellant to prison terms of 235 months on Counts One and Three and a consecutive prison term of 84 months on Count Two. Appellant now appeals his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-20\">Appellant\u2019s initial challenge is to the district court\u2019s enhancement of his offense level under the Guidelines for having played a managerial role in the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\">The Guidelines provide that \u201c[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>nal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,\u201d the defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by three levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SBl.l(b). In analyzing a defendant\u2019s role, the district court should consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-4\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s adjusting appellant\u2019s offense level upward for having played a managing role considering that appellant recruited one of the robbery\u2019s participants, attended planning meetings for the robbery, and directed the activity within the bank itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Next, appellant contends that the district court clearly erred in granting him a two-level enhancement based on the injuries suffered by one of the bank\u2019s employees. He asserts that he did not strike the victim, nor did he instruct anyone else to do so. According to him, the plan did not require or call for violence; hence, he should not be held responsible for his co-conspirators\u2019 use of unnecessary force.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">One of the specific offense characteristics of armed bank robbery is a two-level enhancement if a victim sustains \u201cbodily injury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A). Moreover, \u201cin the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity ... all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, should be taken into account in calculating the defendant\u2019s appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1175-76 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). An act may be imputed from one co-conspirator to another, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), provided that the conduct was (1) \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d and (2) \u201cin furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1281 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">The government must show \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d by the preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Cover, </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2000). The government, however, need not show that the defendant expressly agreed to his codefendant\u2019s acts. <em>Id. </em>at 1275 (holding that \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d has never been limited to acts that were expressly agreed to by the coconspirators); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2 (\u201cthe criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical\u201d). Instead, \u201can act is reasonably foreseeable if it is a necessary or natural consequence of the unlawful agreement.\u201d <em>Cover, </em>199 F.3d at 1275 (internal punctuation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Here, it was reasonably foreseeable that an injury might occur due to the armed robbery planned in this case. That the robbery was apparently going smoothly and that violence was not part of the original plan did not make subsequent violence unforeseeable, especially when the perpetrators are armed. In sum, the court did not err in applying the two-level enhancement for victim injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">Appellant next argues that the district court clearly erred in failing to grant him an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. He contends that if he had pled guilty, it would have been difficult to preserve his rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He submits that he should not be precluded from receiving such reduction because he exercised his trial rights and complained about the Government\u2019s plea bargaining position.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level reduction of the offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). The commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1 provides the following considerations for determining acceptance of responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">(a) truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">(b) voluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">(c) voluntary payment of restitution pri- or to adjudication of guilt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-9\">(d) voluntary surrender to authorities promptly after commission of the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-10\">(e) voluntary assistance to authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), cmt. n. l(a-e).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">Appellant failed to come forward with any evidence to show entitlement to the reduction. At the re-sentencing hearing and now on appeal, his sole argument for receiving a reduction was that he went to trial over a Guidelines issue and not simply to make the Government prove its case. He addressed none of the considerations illustrated by the commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1; thus, it would be difficult for us to say that the court erred in denying the reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Appellant contends that he was improperly sentenced on Count Three to a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years for brandishing a weapon. He says that it is impossible to tell from the verdict whether the jury found that he brandished the weapon or merely mentioned the weapon, which would result in a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">Section 924 of Title 18 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-16\">[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-17\">(I) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-18\">(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-19\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-20\">The Supreme Court has held that increasing a defendant\u2019s minimum sentence on a judicial finding of brandishing is constitutional. Harr<em>is v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 568, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2420, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). The factor \u201cneed not be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Gray, </em>260 F.3d 1267, 1281 (11th Cir.2001) (same, but as applied to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1)(A)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-21\">At re-sentencing, the district court found that there was no doubt that the firearm was brandished based on the testimony of the employees inside the bank. Appellant does not contest the court\u2019s factual finding; rather, he contests who must make the finding. As the finding of whether or not the firearm was brandished is to be made by the court at sentencing, the court committed no error in imposing the seven-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Appellant\u2019s final argument is that his sentence is unreasonable. \u201cIn reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). In determining whether a sentence is reasonable, the district court should be guided by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). Section 3553(a) provides that district courts must consider, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the applicable guideline range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (4) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (5) the need for adequate deterrence; (6) protection of the public; and (7) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Although the district court must be guided by these factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Although a sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we would ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-88. \u201c[A] district court may determine, on a case-by-case basis, the weight to give the Guidelines, so long as that determination is made with reference to the remaining section 3553(a) factors that the court must also consider in calculating the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1185 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The district court\u2019s deliberations reflected consideration of: (1) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the seriousness of the offense; and (3) the guidelines. The imposed sentences reflected consideration of several relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the district court explicitly acknowledged utilizing those factors. And the sentences were within the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
