Liu also argues that even if the IJ found him incredible, the IJ still had to consider all the evidence he introduced regarding his wife\u2019s forced abortion and the family planning practices in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decisions as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we should \u201caffirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201c[A] denial of asylum may be reversed <em>only </em>if the evidence presented by the applicant is so powerful that a reasonable factfinder would <em>have </em>to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution exists\u201d. <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis in original) (citing <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 &amp; n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). Under \u201cthe ordinary remand rule,\u201d Circuit courts may not make factual findings in the first instance. <em>Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 1615, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">\u201cCredibility determinations likewise are reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cA credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Adverse credibility determinations must be made explicitly. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). The IJ must make \u201cclean determinations of credibility,\u201d and when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the IJ does not say that he \u201cbelieves\u201d or \u201cdisbelieves\u201d the asylum seeker, \u201cthe reviewing Court is left in the dark.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. If the IJ did not make an adverse credibility finding, we can assume any credibility determination was not dispositive and address the petitioner\u2019s eligibility for asylum. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Regardless of whether or not the IJ made an adverse credibility determination, he still had a duty to consider all the evidence Liu submitted. After stating three instances where Liu\u2019s testimony created doubt as to the veracity of his claims, the IJ immediately concluded that Liu failed to meet his burden of showing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. However, Liu submitted approximately 64 pages of documents along with his asylum application. Included in these documents was an abortion certificate issued to Liu\u2019s wife for an abortion that occurred on July 18, 2002. Liu also submitted a receipt for the fine Liu testified to that was levied against him and his wife for having an illegitimate child. Liu also submitted the 2004 country report, which noted that China\u2019s first formal law on family planning went into effect in 2002 and' that Fujian province, where Liu resided, was one of the few remaining provinces that still required birth permits, which were used to enforce targets and quotas.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">There is no record in the IJ\u2019s decision that he considered any of the documents Liu submitted to support his asylum claim. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, without opinion, and did not address the corroborating evidence Liu submitted to the court in its decision. Accordingly we vacate and remand for the BIA to consider Liu\u2019s corroborating evidence in the first instance. As such, the additional arguments in petitioner\u2019s and respondent\u2019s briefs will not be addressed here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
