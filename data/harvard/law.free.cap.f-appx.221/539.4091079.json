We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, <em>Aguiluz-Arellano v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 980, 982 (9th Cir.2006), and deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Ragueci pled guilty to a California controlled substance offense in 1997. This conviction was considered by the immigration judge in the removal order. On March 15, 2004, the BIA dismissed Ragucci\u2019s appeal. On April 2, 2004, California authorities expunged Ragucci\u2019s conviction. Ragucci\u2019s motion to reopen was not filed until March 28, 2005. The BIA\u2019s March 15, 2004 order did not violate Ragucci\u2019s equal protection or due process rights, because the BIA did not have any evidence of the expungement before it. <em>See Chavez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1284, 1291-92 (9th Cir.2004). Unlike the petitioner in <em>Cardenas-Uriarte v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir.2000), Ragucci did not file a timely motion bringing the expungement to the BIA\u2019s attention. The BIA therefore had no opportunity to apply <em>Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir.2000), a case in which the petitioner filed a motion to remand after \u201ca significant change in the applicable law occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of Ragucci\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion as time-barred. The BIA dismissed Ragucci\u2019s direct appeal on March 15, 2004. His expungement is dated April 2, 2004. The motion to reopen does not explain why it was not filed until March 28, 2005, well beyond the 90-day deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">We also reject Ragucci\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated by the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen, as he was not prevented from reasonably presenting his case. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">The respondent\u2019s motion in No. 04-71786 to strike exhibits that are not in the administrative record is granted. His motion for summary denial in No. 05-74628 is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b567-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
