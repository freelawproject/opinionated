Straus denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Besnik Lulash Pjetergjokaj, </em>No. A95 363 496 (B.I.A.Feb.14, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 363 496 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Nov. 25, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-17\">When, as here, the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). We generally will not disturb adverse credibility determinations that are based on \u201cspecific examples in the record of inconsistent statements ... about matters material to [an applicant\u2019s] claim of persecution, or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-18\">Here, where Pjetergjokaj alleges persecution on account of his political opinion, his failure to include in his original asylum application any reference to his alleged arrest, detention, and beating by Socialist police following a political demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>stration in November 2000 is a substantial omission that \u201cinvolve[s] the heart of the asylum claim.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308 (citations omitted). It is well-settled that \u201comissions that go to [the] heart of an applicant\u2019s claim can form the basis for an adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Cheng Tong Wang v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 451, 453 (2d Cir.2006). Pjetergjokaj was offered an opportunity to explain himself, but no reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to accept his explanation that he simply did not think to inform the Immigration Service of this incident. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir. 2005). The \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the IJ\u2019s other findings \u2014 e.g., that Pjetergjokaj\u2019s Democratic Party membership card did not list the correct branch \u2014 was properly \u201cdeemed consequential\u201d by the IJ. <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Because Pjetergjokaj failed to establish past persecution due to his lack of credible testimony, he was not entitled to the presumption of a well-founded fear. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). To establish asylum eligibility based on future persecution, an applicant must show that he or she subjectively fears persecution and that this fear is objectively reasonable. <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). After a lengthy analysis of the most recent reports on conditions in Albania, the IJ found that the objective evidence did not support a fear of future persecution, and Pjetergjokaj does not point to anything in the record that would compel a different conclusion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Pjetergjokaj\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case precludes success on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir. 2003). Furthermore, Pjetergjokaj has not meaningfully challenged the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim in his brief to this Court and we deem this claim abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
