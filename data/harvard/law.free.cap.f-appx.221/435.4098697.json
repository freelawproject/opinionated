In the plea agreement, Hemphill promised to provide assistance to law enforcement, and, in return, the Government promised to evaluate such assistance in good faith in determining whether to recommend an offense-level reduction based on substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Because the Government did not determine whether Hemphill provided substantial assistance and instead merely refused to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, we reverse Hemphill\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-27\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b463-28\">In January and February of 2005, Hemphill sold powder and crack cocaine to two individuals, a confidential informant and an officer of the Michigan State Police. On March 17, 2005, a grand jury returned an indictment against Hemphill, charging him with possession with intent to distrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ute and distribution of more than five grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(l)(B)(iii) (Count One) and possession with intent to distribute and distribution of more than fifty grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(b)(l)(A)(iii) (Count Two).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">On August 9, 2005, Hemphill pleaded guilty to Count Two of the indictment pursuant to a written plea agreement. In the plea agreement, Hemphill agreed to plead guilty to Count Two of the indictment and agreed \u201cto fully cooperate with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Michigan State Police, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, and any other law enforcement agency in their investigation of the changes contained in [the] indictment or any Superseding indictment as well as the investigation of crimes over which they have actual or apparent jurisdiction.\u201d JA 23 (Plea Agreement 11111, 5). The plea agreement required Hemphill \u201cto voluntarily come forward with any and all information which [he] should reasonably know will assist in the investigation of other criminal activity.\u201d JA 24 (Plea Agreement U 5). In exchange, the Government agreed to move to dismiss Count One of the indictment and \u201cto make a good faith evaluation of [Hemp-hill\u2019s] cooperation under this agreement in determining whether to file a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. 5K1.1 and/or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b).\u201d JA 25 (Plea Agreement 116A, D). The plea agreement went on to state the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">The Defendant fully understands that such a motion may be made pursuant to law if, and only if, the Defendant fully cooperates with the Government and materially and substantially assists the Government in the investigation or prosecution of others. The determination of whether the Defendant has provided substantial assistance to the United States, or to designated state or local law enforcement authorities, will be made in the sole discretion of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The Defendant fully understands that this paragraph is not a promise by the Government to file such a motion, but, rather, a promise to use good faith in evaluating the Defendant\u2019s assistance to the Government in the prosecution of others to determine whether a motion should be filed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">JA 25 (Plea Agreement If 6.D).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">On January 10, 2006, Hemphill was sentenced. At the sentencing hearing, the Government told the court that Hemphill cooperated with law enforcement officers, but that the Government would not file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for substantial assistance because officers did not take the time to verify the information that Hemphill provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">I was just going over this morning the information the defendant had given to the law enforcement officers in the form of a proffer last May. And as I\u2019m going over it, it\u2019s very rich in detail about his past involvement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">I\u2019m surprised that law enforcement didn\u2019t do a lot more with the information that he gave, and I suspect it\u2019s because it was given to local law enforcement officers. There were no DEA agents in Lansing at the time that would follow up on it, and the information dealt with drug trafficking in Chicago and some people that were caught in Nebraska. So there is no 5K motion, but I want the Court to know that defendant, I believe, was extremely candid....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">After disposing of an objection not relevant to this appeal, the district court sentenced Hemphill to 140 months of imprisonment \u2014 the bottom of the guideline range of 140 to 175 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">As an initial matter, this court may review whether the Government breached the plea agreement notwithstanding the fact that Hemphill waived his right to appeal in that agreement. For example, in <em>United States v. Swanberg, </em>370 F.3d 622, 625-29 (6th Cir.2004), this court permitted a defendant to contend on appeal that the government breached a plea agreement notwithstanding the fact that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. Thus, the fact that Hemphill waived his right to appeal is not an impediment to this court\u2019s review of whether the Government breached the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Because Hemphill failed to object at his sentencing hearing to the Government\u2019s purported breach of the plea agreement, we review the issue of whether the Government breached the plea agreement for plain error. <em>See Swanberg, </em>370 F.3d at 627. Under plain error review, this court reverses only <em>if </em>\u201c(1) there is an error; (2) that is plain; (3) which affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Where the government\u2019s breach of a plea agreement results in a defendant receiving a higher sentence than he otherwise would have had the government not breached the agreement, the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 628-29. This is true here even though had the Government exercised discretion, it might not have filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and even had the Government filed the motion the judge might not have followed the Government\u2019s recommendation. <em>See United States v. Barnes, </em>278 F.3d 644, 648-49 (6th Cir.2002). Thus, plain error review in this case collapses into an inquiry of whether the Government plainly breached the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The Government breached its duty under the plea agreement to decide whether Hemphill\u2019s cooperation and assistance constituted \u201csubstantial assistance.\u201d Even when the government retains discretion in deciding whether a defendant provided substantial assistance, the government must exercise that discretion and cannot simply decline to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. In <em>United States v. Lukse, </em>286 F.3d 906, 909 (6th Cir.2002), defendants provided information to the government that led to the prosecution of individuals previously unknown to the government. The plea agreement required the government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion if, in the government\u2019s sole discretion, the defendants provided \u201csubstantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution\u201d of others. <em>Id. </em>at 908. After the government initially concluded that defendants had provided substantial assistance, defendants were caught smoking marijuana in prison and the government decided not to file \u00a7 5K1.1 motions because defendants no longer would be credible witnesses in the trials of others. <em>Id. </em>at 911. This court remanded for resentencing because the government \u201cdid not determine whether the defendants satisfied their duties with respect to parts of the plea agreement,\u201d i.e., the parts requiring the government to file \u00a7 5K1.1 motions if the defendants provided assistance in the investigation of suspects (not merely the prosecution). <em>Id. </em>at 912-13. Importantly, the court noted that even though the government had \u201ccomplete discretion\u201d to determine whether defendants provided substantial assistance, the government still \u201chad to analyze and determine whether substantial assistance had been rendered; they could not simply leave the question unanswered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The Government here had a similar obligation to evaluate Hemphill\u2019s cooperation and assistance and determine whether Hemphill provided substantial assistance. There is no indication that the Government made such a determination, only that the Government declined to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Under <em>Lukse, </em>the government must conclude that the defendant did not offer substantial assistance before declining to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. 286 F.3d at 912; <em>see also United States v. Quack, </em>302 F.3d 1096, 1100, 1102-03 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that the government \u201cfailed to make the requisite determination of whether\u201d the defendant provided substantial assistance where the government failed to file a motion under \u00a7 5K1.1 because a co-defendant\u2019s case was ongoing and the government claimed that the defendant had therefore not completed his cooperation). Thus, because the Government here failed to evaluate Hemphill\u2019s cooperation and assistance and determine that Hemphill did not provide substantial assistance, it breached the plea agreement\u2019s requirement that it exercise discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE Hemphill\u2019s sentence and REMAND the case so that the Government can evaluate in good faith the assistance that Hemphill provided, determine whether that assistance was \u201csubstantial,\u201d and decide whether to make a motion for an offense-level reduction based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
