We treat the immigration judge\u2019s reasoning as that of the Board\u2019s in our review. <em>Haoua v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Meyet challenges the Board\u2019s finding that her testimony was not credible and that she otherwise failed to meet her burden of proving her eligibility for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and we uphold credibility determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding and the ruling that Meyet failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Meyet cannot sustain her burden on the asylum claim, she cannot establish her entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 367 (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Meyet did not present an argument concerning the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture to the Board. We lack jurisdiction over any claim that was not administratively exhausted. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 359 n. 2 (4th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">We also lack jurisdiction to review Meyet\u2019s challenge to the denial of voluntary departure. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f) (2000) (\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an appeal from denial of a request for an order of voluntary departure.... \u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (2000) (\u201c[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229c [the section governing voluntary departure].\u201d); <em>see also Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 193 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cSection 1229c specifically precludes review of a denial of a request for voluntary departure.... Likewise, the general judicial review provision precludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>review of orders granting voluntary departure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Accordingly, we deny Meyet\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
