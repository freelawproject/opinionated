Eginton, <em>Judge) </em>granting the summary judgment motions of Defendants-Appellees Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. (\u201cSikorsky\u201d) and Teamsters Local No. 1150, International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the \u201cUnion\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the procedural history, relevant facts, and specification of issues on appeal. Setting aside the issue of the complaint\u2019s timeliness, we affirm for substantially the same reasons as the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">To prevail on a hybrid section 301/duty of fair representation claim, Verrilli had the burden of demonstrating both (1) that Sikorsky breached the collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) and (2) that the Union breached its duty of fair representation. <em>See DelCostello v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 164-65, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">As the moving party, Sikorsky had the burden of \u201cshowing \u2014 that is, pointing out to the district court \u2014 that there is an absence of evidence to support\u201d Verrilli\u2019s case. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Sikorsky satisfied its burden by showing that it terminated Verrilli in compliance with the express terms of the CBA because of his two positive drug tests. <em>See </em>Sikorsky\u2019s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. A (Letter 19 to the CBA stating that \u201c[o]n the second occasion of a positive drug ... test finding, the employee shall be discharged\u201d); Ex. D 15-17 (deposition of Richard Kollet, Sikorsky\u2019s Planning and Control Manager for Parts Manufacturing, stating that workers in Verrilli\u2019s department were going to begin performing work covered by the FAA drug testing regulation); Ex. F (Affidavit of Kathleen F. Maurer, M.D., MPH, stating that Verrilli failed two drug tests). Based on this showing, the District Court was required to grant the defendants\u2019 motions unless Verrilli \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there [was] a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Verrilli argues that there was an issue of material fact regarding whether the CBA required him to be tested. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 22-23; Compl. 2 \u00b65. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Verrilli, the record does not support this claim. The CBA provided that Sikorsky would continue to conduct a random drug testing program for employees covered by Federal Aviation Administration regulations. <em>See </em>Sikorsky\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. A (Letter 19 to the CBA). The relevant FAA regulation provides that \u201c[e]ach employee ... who performs a safety-sensitive function listed in this section directly or by contract ... for an employer as defined in this appendix must be subject to drug testing.\u201d 14 C.F.R. Pt. 121, App. I \u00a7 III. Verrilli offered no evidence, other than his own unfounded assertions, that Sikorsky was not an \u201cemployer\u201d required by the FAA regulation to test employees performing \u201ca safety-sensitive function.\u201d Indeed, the only evidence in the record was to the contrary. <em>See </em>Sikorsky\u2019s Mot. For Summ. J. Ex. B (Sikorsky\u2019s answers to PL\u2019s interrogatories 7 &amp; 12); Ex. C at 13-14 (deposition of Thomas Nemec, Human Resources Manager and Sikorsky\u2019s FAA Coordinator); Ex. D 12-17 (Kollet dep.).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Nor did Verrilli produce evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that he was not an FAA-covered \u201cemployee.\u201d Under the FAA regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>an \u201c[e]mployee\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who is hired, either directly or by contract, to perform a safety-sensitive function\u201d and includes not only those \u201cactually performing\u201d a safety-sensitive function, but also those that are \u201cready to perform, or immediately available to perform such function.\u201d 14 C.F.R. Pt. 121, App. I \u00a7 II. Again, the record only supports a conclusion that Verrilli was part of a department at Sikorsky that was about to begin performing FAA-covered work. <em>See </em>Sikorsky\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. D 15-17. And, since the FAA regulation requires employers to conduct a \u201cpreemployment [drug] test\u201d before they \u201chire any individual for a safety-sensitive function ... [or] allow an individual to transfer from a nonsafety-sensitive to a safety-sensitive function,\u201d there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding Sikorsky\u2019s obligation to test Verrilli.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 14 C.F.R. Pt. 121, App. I \u00a7 V(A)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The District Court\u2019s final ground for granting the summary judgment is also sound. On the record before the District Court, the Union\u2019s decision not to arbitrate Verrilli\u2019s claim was not \u201cirrational or arbitrary,\u201d but fell within the \u201cwide range of reasonableness\u201d that we afford to unions in fulfilling their duty to represent their members. <em>Air Line Pilots Assoc. Int\u2019l v. O\u2019Neill, </em>499 U.S. 65, 78, 111 S.Ct. 1127, 113 L.Ed.2d 51 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We have considered Verrilli\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-15\">. Indeed, on a Connecticut Department of Labor unemployment form, Verrilli himself indicated that he failed a <em>preemployment </em>drug test \u201crequired by federal law,\u201d specifically the \u201cFAA.\u201d Union\u2019s Mot. for Summ.
