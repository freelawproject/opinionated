Chambers petitions for review the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d or \u201cthe Board\u201d) affirming the reconsideration decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) that Chambers was overpaid $9,660 in annuity benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d). <em>We affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">Chambers is a former custodian for the United States Postal Service who, since December 20, 2002, has been on disability retirement due to post-traumatic stress disorder arising from his service in the United States Marine Corps beginning in the summer of 1965 and ending with an honorable discharge in August of 1968. He was continuously employed by the Postal Service from May 5, 1979, until his retirement. However, during his final years of service \u2014 from March 30, 1999 until December 20, 2002 \u2014 Chambers was on leave without pay status because his disability retirement was tied up in the approval process. In January of 2003, after he had gained the requisite approval, OPM authorized retirement annuity payments dating back to April 1, 1999, as well as annuity payments going forward. On November 8, 2004, OPM notified Chambers that he had been overpaid due to an administrative error, and therefore, that his monthly annuity would be reduced by $268.33 for the following three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">Subsequent to this notification Chambers asked for reconsideration, arguing that his annuity payments had been miscalculated on account of several OPM errors. On March 16, 2005, OPM issued a reconsideration decision affirming the initial overpayment decision. Chambers subsequently appealed to the MSPB. On February 2, 2006, an MSPB Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) affirmed OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision, finding that OPM had carried its burden of \u201cestablishing] by the preponderance of the evidence that an overpayment occurred.\u201d <em>See </em>5 CFR \u00a7 831.1407(a). Chambers requested review by the Board, and the AJ\u2019s initial decision was affirmed on May 17, 2006. Chambers now petitions this court for review of the MSPB decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">In reviewing final orders of the Board, we will \u201chold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings and conclusions found to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">Chambers argues that the Board erred in holding that OPM carried its burden by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>failing to recognize several OPM errors. First, Chambers asserts that OPM wrongly calculated his average pay. An employee\u2019s average pay, also known as the employee\u2019s \u201chigh three,\u201d for CSRS annuity purposes is defined by statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-5\">\u201c[AJverage pay\u201d means the largest annual rate resulting from averaging an employee\u2019s ... rate[ ] of basic pay in effect over any 3 consecutive years of creditable service ... with each rate weighted by the time it was in effeet[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4G\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(4). \u201cBasic pay\u201d is further defined by statute to <em>exclude </em>\u201cbonuses, allowances, overtime pay, military pay, pay given in addition to the base pay of the position as fixed by law or regulation except as provided by [provisions of law not relevant here].\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(3). Thus, OPM regulations provide that an employee\u2019s basic pay is determined by looking to the employee\u2019s Individual Retirement Record (\u201cIRR\u201d), Standard Form 2806. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Pursuant to this statutory and regulatory scheme, OPM determined from Chambers\u2019 IRR that his largest three-year span of basic pay occurred in 1996, 1997, and 1998, resulting in an average of $35,478. Chambers believes this calculation was incorrect because his W-2 Forms from those years reflect that he was paid, on average, $38,140.67. The AJ rejected this argument, explaining that the pay shown in Chambers\u2019 W-2 Forms \u201cmight reflect \u2018additional\u2019 pay such as overtime, night differential pay, or some other form of pay\u201d statutorily excluded from the definition of \u201cbasic pay.\u201d Chambers challenges this conclusion as \u201cpure speculation\u201d by the AJ. Chambers further argues that even if OPM properly used the salaries listed on his IRR form, OPM should have calculated his \u201chigh three\u201d based on the years 2000-02 because he had a greater base pay then than he did in 1996-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">We disagree. As a threshold matter, we note that the record on appeal is incomplete with respect to the W-2 Forms, as it only contains Chambers\u2019 1996 W-2 Form. The record from the proceedings below is likewise incomplete, as it only contains Chambers\u2019 1996 and 1997 W-2 Forms. Based on the record we have, however, it is clear that Chambers\u2019 arguments must be rejected. For example, although Chambers\u2019 1996 W-2 Form does in fact list his total pay as $38,733.99, the record from the MSPB proceedings contains a form entitled \u201cPersonal Statement of Benefits\u201d from 1996 explaining that his total pay \u201cinelude[es] overtime, premium pay, variable pay, [territorial cost-of-living allowance], awards, pay for holidays, annual leave and sick leave.\u201d None of those categories of pay are excepted from the statutory exclusion of additional pay set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(3). The same form indicates that Chambers\u2019 \u201cannual salary\u201d for 1996 was $34,866, which exactly matches the amount listed in Chambers\u2019 IRR for that year. The record contains a similar form from 1998, having the same explanation of his total pay, and indicating his \u201cannual salary\u201d as $36,126, which also exactly matches the amount listed in Chambers\u2019 IRR for that year. As far as we are able to discern, neither our record nor the record from the proceedings below contains a \u201cPersonal Statement of Benefits\u201d from 1997. Nevertheless, we believe the forms from 1996 and 1998 adequately demonstrate that any discrepancy between the IRR and W-2 Forms is explained by the existence of precisely the categories of additional pay suggested by the AJ. Indeed, in pre-hearing submissions to the AJ, Chambers specifically contended that his average pay calculation was erroneous because OPM had failed to give him \u201ccredit for all night pay differential [sic] and mandatory holidays worked.\u201d Thus, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>apparent that the AJ\u2019s suggestion was not \u201cpure speculation,\u201d but rather was based on both substantial evidence in the record as well as the representations made in Chambers\u2019 submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">As to Chambers\u2019 further argument that his \u201chigh three\u201d should have been calculated based on the years 2000-02, Chambers\u2019 IRR lists him as having a basic pay of approximately $39,000, $40,000 and $41,000, in each of those years respectively. This argument is unavailing, however, because Chambers was on leave without pay beginning in 1999. As such, he may only receive six-months credit for each year thereafter. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8332(f). Giving Chambers credit for only six months in each of 2000, 2001 and 2002 would result in a <em>lower </em>average pay calculation of roughly $20,000. Accordingly, we find no reversible error in OPM\u2019s \u201chigh three\u201d calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">The second error perceived by Chambers relates to OPM\u2019s calculation of his creditable military service. Credit for periods of military service is statutorily limited to \u201chonorable active service.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(13). In determining the amount of \u201chonorable active service\u201d credit to which Chambers is entitled, OPM looked to his Form DD-214 on file with the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d), which reports his \u201cTotal Active Service\u201d as two years, eleven months, and twenty-eight days. Chambers argues that he is actually entitled to three years, two months, and sixteen days based on two months and eighteen days of \u201cOther Service\u201d listed on his DD-214. Chambers also points to a letter from the VA which states that he \u201cEntered on Active Duty\u201d on June 19, 1965, and that he was \u201cReleased from Active Duty\u201d on August 23, 1968, as further proof that OPM did not give him enough military service credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Again, we disagree. Pursuant to the express mandate of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(13), OPM gave Chambers credit only for his \u201cactive service,\u201d and declined to give him credit for his \u201cother service.\u201d Chambers fails to adequately explain, and we discern no reason why, OPM should have disregarded the plain language of the statute and given him credit for non-active service. And with respect to the letter from the VA, to the extent there is a conflict with his DD-214, Chambers should raise that issue with the VA and then, if his DD-214 is in error, he should request a subsequent annuity adjustment from OPM. Therefore, we find no reversible error in OPM\u2019s military service credit calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">On a related note, Chambers argues that he should be credited with an additional two years, eleven months, and twenty-eight days of service because his IRR appears to show his start date as May 7, 1976, instead of the May 5, 1979 date used by OPM. Chambers misreads the IRR. The row labeled \u201cCareer Appt\u201d shows a date of \u201c05-05-79,\u201d corresponding to the date used by OPM. The \u201c05-07-76\u201d date pointed to by Chambers is his service computation date. The additional time reflected by that date corresponds precisely with the amount of active military service OPM already credited to Chambers. Had OPM used May 7, 1976 for his start date, Chambers would have incorrectly received double credit for his military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">We have fully considered the remainder of Chambers\u2019 arguments and we do not find them persuasive. Consequently, we hold that the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">For the reasons stated above, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
