He received a sentence of thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Hernandez-Salas\u2019 counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. Califor</em>nia, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that he has concluded there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but addressing the voluntariness of Hernandez-Salas\u2019 guilty plea and propriety of his sentence. Hernandez-Salas was notified of his right to file a pro se informal brief; however, he did not file such a brief. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Therefore, we affirm Hernandez-Salas\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Hernandez-Salas, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hernandez-Salas requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hernandez-Salas. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
