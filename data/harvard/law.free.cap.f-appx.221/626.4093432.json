Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir.2003), we reject his challenge to the hardship standard because the IJ\u2019s interpretation and application fell \u201cwithin the broad range authorized by the statutory language,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b654-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
