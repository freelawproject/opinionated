Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 12, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-22\">Where (as here) the BIA affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). \u201cWhen a factual challenge pertains to a credibility finding ... we afford \u2018particular deference\u2019 in applying the substantial evidence stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>dard, mindful that the law must entrust some official with responsibility to hear an applicant\u2019s asylum claim, and the IJ has the unique advantage among all officials involved in the process of having heard directly from the applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73 <em>(quoting Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997)) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">(i) The IJ found that Gao\u2019s testimony that his mother had been detained by the police (offered for the first time on cross examination) was inconsistent with his asylum application, which indicated that none of his family members had ever been detained by the Chinese authorities. (Although the asylum application was filed prior to when Gao allegedly learned of the detention of his mother, in his subsequent testimony he affirmed the correctness and completeness of the asylum application.) Furthermore, his girlfriend\u2019s affidavit included no mention of his mother\u2019s detention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">(ii) The IJ found that Gao\u2019s submission of an abortion certif\u00edcate undermined his claim that his girlfriend underwent a forcible abortion; the IJ referred to the U.S. Department of State report which states that such certificates are normally provided pursuant to a voluntary abortion in order that the patient may request two weeks of sick leave. U.S. Department of State, China: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions 22-23 (June 2004). <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006) (observing that the U.S. Department of State country profiles are \u201cprobative ... and [that] the profile in this case constituted a basis for the IJ to have found implausible Lin\u2019s testimony that his wife\u2019s abortion\u2014as evidenced by the certificate\u2014was involuntary\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Though the IJ may have erroneously relied on certain other evidence in arriving at his adverse credibility determination, because the error-free reasons previously noted do provide sufficient support for the IJ\u2019s finding, \u201cwe can state with confidence\u201d that remand would be futile. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Gao also failed to present corroborative evidence; and at least some of the evidence he did adduce, as discussed above, was of dubious authenticity. Where \u201cit is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence ... such evidence should be provided or an explanation should be given as to why such information was not presented.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 285 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Gao\u2019s withholding of removal claim necessarily fails because he has not met the standards for asylum. <em>See Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 71. And because Gao does not challenge the denial of relief under the CAT, we deem that claim to have been waived. <em>See, e.g., Ci Pan v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>449 F.3d 408, 414 (2d Cir.2006) <em>(per curiam,); Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the petition is hereby DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
