A 97 646 323, A 97 646 324 (B.I.A. Apr. 28, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A 97 646 323, A 97 646 324 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 2, 2004). On this petition for review, petitioners contend principally that the IJ erred in failing to consider events that occurred prior to 1992. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">Where, as here, the BIA has summarily adopted or affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). While we review the IJ\u2019s rulings of law <em>de novo, see Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004), we review the factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, sustaining findings that are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole,\u201d <em>Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cUnder this standard, the IJ\u2019s factual determinations may be overturned only if \u2018any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 624, 628 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)); see, <em>e.g., Jin Hui Gao v. United States Attorney General, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Preliminarily, we note that the state of the record before us is somewhat troubling. In particular, there is a gap in the transcript following an off-the-record discussion during the government\u2019s cross-examination of Kukaj. The IJ noted that she had failed to reactivate the tape recorder; but the record is silent both as to the length of time during which the proceedings were not recorded and as to what was said during that time that should have been on the record. However, as petitioners were represented by counsel at the hearing and made no request that such information be stated or summarized on the record, and as counsel representing petitioners in this Court has not suggested that any material information was omitted from the record, we conclude that the gap in the record is harmless. We thus turn to the merits of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Kukaj contends principally that in refusing to allow her to testify to alleged incidents of mistreatment that occurred prior to 1992, the year in which she and her husband moved to Sweden, the IJ erred in assuming, without evidence, that she had received an offer of permanent resettlement in Sweden, <em>see generally </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi) (Attorney General not authorized to grant asylum if \u201cthe alien was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United States\u201d). This argument mischaracterizes the IJ\u2019s rationale for excluding Kukaj\u2019s evidence of pre-1992 incidents. The IJ, while using the term \u201csafe haven\u201d in a somewhat loose sense, did not suggest that Kukaj had resettled permanently in Sweden. Rather, the IJ considered Kukaj\u2019s statements and actions, with regard to Kukaj\u2019s return to Montenegro in 1994, to indicate that \u201cany concerns that [Kukaj] had as to persecution\u201d based on the pre-1992 incidents were diminished. The IJ stated that any claims of persecution Kukaj may have had with respect to the period prior to 1992 \u201cwere waived by her <em>when she returned to Montenegro </em>after [the] two-year safe-haven\u201d (emphasis added). The IJ\u2019s view was supported by Kukaj\u2019s statement in her asylum application that she and her husband moved back to Montenegro from Sweden in 1994 \u201cbecause it was there that we were willing to live and raise our children.\u201d The basis of the IJ\u2019s refusal to consider pre-1992 events thus was not that Kukaj had permanently resettled in Sweden in 1992, but rather that she was willing to return to Montenegro in 1994 and live there despite the pre-1992 events.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">We note that an IJ, in assessing past persecution alleged in connection with an asylum application, is required to view incidents of mistreatment in the aggregate. <em>See, e.g., Edimo-Doualla v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 276, 283 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cA series of incidents of mistreatment may together rise to the level of persecution even if each incident taken alone does not.\u201d); <em>Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 80 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[w]here no single incident stands out above the others, sometimes a small incident may be \u2018the last straw5 \u201d (quoting Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, <em>Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status Under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees </em>(Geneva 1992))). And if evidence had been presented that upon her return to Montenegro in 1994 Kukaj had been subjected to further mistreatment, we would likely find the IJ\u2019s refusal to consider the pre-1992 incidents to be error sufficient to require a remand. However, the parties had stipulated that Kukaj was collaterally estopped from claiming past persecution on the basis of incidents that occurred between 1992 and 2000, and hence Kukaj presented no evidence at her hearing as to incidents during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the six years immediately following her return to Montenegro.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Further, Kukaj not only returned to Montenegro; she remained there until she departed for the United States in 2002. We cannot conclude that any rational fact-finder would be compelled to conclude that the events prior to 1992 were significant, given Kukaj\u2019s return to Montenegro two years thereafter, her remaining in Montenegro for eight years after her return, and the absence of any evidence of incidents in the first six of those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Finally, in assessing Kukaj\u2019s claim of future persecution, the IJ properly took into account both \u201cthe particular circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case,\u201d <em>Tambadou v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 298, 302 (2d Cir.2006), and the principle that the reasonableness of an applicant\u2019s fear of future persecution is diminished when the applicant has family members who remain in the native country unharmed, <em>see In re AE-M-, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 1157, 1160 (BIA 1998). In addition to the fact that after the initial claimed persecution in 1992, largely occasioned by her husband\u2019s avoidance of the draft, Kukaj and her husband returned to Montenegro in 1994 because they wanted to live there and raise their children there, and remained there for more than half a decade, the IJ took into account the fact that a law had been passed granting amnesty to draft avoiders. Because Kukaj\u2019s husband\u2019s avoidance of the draft had been the catalyst for many of the incidents alleged in support of her asylum application, the negation of that concern, given the amnesty law, supports an inference that the threat of future persecution based on Kukaj\u2019s husband\u2019s refusal to serve in the army has been significantly diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The IJ also took into account (a) the fact that when Kukaj left Montenegro in 2002, she left two of her children in Kosovoincluding the daughter who was allegedly slapped by the police during an incident that was one of the bases of Kukaj\u2019s asylum application-and (b) the absence of any evidence that the two Kukaj children remaining in Kosovo have been persecuted or harassed by the authorities. There was no evidence that Kukaj had attempted to move those children to other countries where Kukaj has relatives lawfully residing. The IJ found that Kukaj\u2019s decision to leave her children in Kosovo when she departed for the United States indicated that she had no fear of persecution \u201cin that part of the world.\u201d We cannot conclude, given Kukaj\u2019s actions, that any rational factfinder would be compelled to find that she fears those children will be persecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">We have considered all of petitioners\u2019 contentions in support of their petition for review and, for the reasons stated above, have found no basis for a remand. The petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">We note, however, that respondents have been ordered removed to \u201cSerbia &amp; Montenegro,\u201d and that since the issuance of the order of removal, Serbia and Montenegro have become countries independent of each other, <em>see </em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, <em>Background Note: Montenegro </em>(Feb.2007), <em>available at </em>http://www.state. gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/70949.htm; U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, <em>Background Note: Serbia </em>(Oct. 2006), <em>available at </em>http://www.state.gOv/r/ pa/ei/bgn/5388.htm. <em>See also id. </em>(Kosovo, \u201c[wjhile legally still part of Serbia, ... remains an international' protectorate of the United Nations\u201d). Accordingly, we remand the matter to the BIA for clarification of the removal order to specify the country to which petitioners are to be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Petitioners\u2019 pending motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
