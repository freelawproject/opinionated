On appeal, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions for aiding and abetting, and that the district court erred by allowing a police officer to testify as an expert in drugs and drug distribution. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Harris alleges that there was insufficient evidence that he aided and abetted the distribution of crack or possessed the firearm in relationship to drug trafficking. Thus, he argues, the district court should have granted his motions for acquittal. This court reviews the denial of a motion for acquittal de novo. <em>See United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1925, 164 L.Ed.2d 667 (2006) (stating standard). Viewing the evidence as required, we find there was substantial evidence to support Harris\u2019 convictions of aiding and abetting. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">Second, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to allow the police officer to testify as an expert in drugs and drug trafficking. <em>See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) (stating review standard for expert testimony); <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 589 (4th Cir.1994) (noting we have \u201crepeatedly upheld the admission of law enforcement officers\u2019 expert opinion testimony in drug trafficking cases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">Accordingly, we affirm Harris\u2019 convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
