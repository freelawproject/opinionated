The district court sentenced Hudson to a total of 262 months of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release and imposed restitution in the amount of $21,710. Hud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>son filed his motion for clarification, claiming that the court improperly delegated the timing and amount of payments to the Bureau of Prisons in violation of <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>48 F.3d 806 (4th Cir.1995), and <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71 (4th Cir.1996). The district court denied Hudson\u2019s motion for clarification, finding that the restitution order did not violate <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court should have treated Hudson\u2019s motion as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), because he attacked the execution of the restitution order. A \u00a7 2241 petition, however, must be brought in the district of incarceration. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a); <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 332 (4th Cir.2000). Hudson is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Beckley, West Virginia, which lies in the Southern District of West Virginia. The district court in the Western District of North Carolina therefore does not have jurisdiction over this \u00a7 2241 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for the court to determine whether transferring Hudson\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition to the proper federal district court would serve the interests of justice, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (2000), or whether the action would be more appropriately dismissed without prejudice to Hudson\u2019s right to file his action in the appropriate district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
