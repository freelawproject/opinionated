The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice for failure to state a claim because the claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-22\">Gibson argues that the district court erroneously applied the Heck-bar. The thrust of Gibson\u2019s claims is that the defendants conspired and falsified documents in his state habeas proceedings because they knew his incarceration was illegal, thereby depriving him of his liberty. Gibson\u2019s claims challenged the validity of his incarceration, and the district court did not err. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-23\">Gibson has also filed a motion to compel the court reporter to produce a transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>of a hearing on his motion for discovery. That motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
