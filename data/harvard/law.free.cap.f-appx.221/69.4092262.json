Elstein denying Jiang\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jing Shou Jiang, </em>No. A 96 265 553 (B.I.A. May 25, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 96 265 553 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 22, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>As an initial matter, Title 8, Section 1158(a)(3) of the United States Code provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Notwithstanding that provision, however, this Court retains jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, </em>326-27 (2d Cir.2006). Jiang argues that the IJ and BIA violated his due process rights by pretermitting his asylum application based on an unreliable consular report. While this Court has not foreclosed such a constitutional claim, <em>see Zhen Nan Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>459 F.3d 255, 269 (2d Cir.2006), the use of the consular report in this case was neither fundamentally unfair nor unconstitutional. The report, signed by DHS Special Agent Liu and her supervisor, provided indicia of reliability, including identification of the steps used to reach its conclusion. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 270-72 (concluding that a report\u2019s reliability was undermined because it did not lay a foundation for its conclusion by reciting the factual steps taken in the investigation). Moreover, Jiang did not object to the admission of the report and had sufficient opportunity, lasting more than one year, to rebut its claims. Indeed, Jiang apparently conceded the report\u2019s conclusion that there were problems with the disease certificate that he had submitted to the immigration court. Because the report satisfies our requirements for \u201creliability and trustworthiness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 268, Jiang\u2019s due process challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Jiang also challenges the denial of his withholding of removal and CAT claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Where, as here, the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Overall, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations. The BIA and IJ reasonably relied on the consular report in finding that the credibility of Jiang\u2019s \u201centire claim\u201d was undermined, when the report indicated that Jiang\u2019s disease certificate, which he attempted to use to prove that he was in China prior to the expiration of his one-year period for filing his asylum claim, was fabricated. The IJ reasonably relied upon the consular report because it was issued based on investigations with Chinese officials who had no motive to conceal their or the government\u2019s dealing with the petitioner, <em>see Zhen Nan Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>459 F.3d 255, 269-72 (2d Cir.2006), Jiang did not object to the admission of the consular report, and his wife conceded in her letter that there might be something \u201cwrong\u201d with the disease certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The IJ also reasonably rejected Jiang\u2019s rebuttal evidence, including Jiang\u2019s testimony, his wife\u2019s May 2004 letter, and the July 2002 disease certificate. The record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Jiang\u2019s testimony regarding the treatment he received at a hospital in August 2002 was confusing and \u201cless than credible.\u201d <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73-74 (indicating that a fact-finder who assesses testimony together with demeanor is in the best position to evaluate the witness). Additionally, while Jiang\u2019s wife explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>a friend had obtained the reissued disease certificate when the original certificate could not be found \u2014 and therefore she and Jiang had no intention or awareness of any deception that might have occurred concerning it \u2014 neither the IJ nor the BIA was required to credit this explanation. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The record also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the letter from Jiang\u2019s pastor did not corroborate that Jiang had attended an underground church. Such a failure to corroborate Jiang\u2019s testimony bears on his credibility because the absence of corroboration in general makes him unable to rehabilitate the testimony that had already been called into question by his submission of a false document. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 78. Finally, the IJ accurately identified an inconsistency between Jiang\u2019s wife\u2019s indication that she was present when government officials attempted to apprehend Jiang in July 2002, and Jiang\u2019s testimony that his wife was not present. The IJ was not obliged to accept Jiang\u2019s explanation that the discrepancy was caused by his wife\u2019s lack of education. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Jiang\u2019s life or freedom, or that he was likely to be tortured, depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
