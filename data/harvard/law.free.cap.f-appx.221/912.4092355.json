Kostina argues that the denial of her motion to reopen by the BIA was arbitrary and capricious because she demonstrated meaningful change in the country conditions of Ukraine that support a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because Kostina makes no argument with regard to her appeal of the denial of her motion to reconsider, that issue is waived. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">\u2018We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. Our review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The BIA may grant a motion to reopen if the movant presents new evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the removal hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). A petitioner is ordinarily permitted to file one motion to reopen within 90 days of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>date of the final order of removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), but the time and numerical limitations do not apply to the filing of a motion to reopen based on changed country conditions if supported by evidence that is \u201cmaterial and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Kostina argues that the country conditions in Ukraine have changed and that there is increased persecution of ethnic minorities in Ukraine, but her evidence failed to prove materially changed country conditions. Although more detailed, Kostina\u2019s evidence was substantially the same as the evidence presented to the Immigration Judge during the asylum hearing. The discrimination alleged in the evidence, while harassing, also did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
