We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-22\">Lake contends that the district court erred in finding that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not violated when the trial court refused to appoint substitute counsel. Specifically, Lake contends that the trial court forced him to represent himself when his attorney moved to withdraw due to an alleged conflict of interest, and therefore, that his waiver of counsel was not voluntary. Assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that this claim is properly before us, it is without merit. Upon review of the record, we conclude that Lake was not forced to waive his right to representation by counsel, but rather, he did so \u201cknowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). Accordingly, the district court properly denied this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-23\">We construe Lake\u2019s uncertified contentions as a motion to expand the Certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>of Appealability and deny the motion. <em>See </em>9th Cir.
