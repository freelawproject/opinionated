Benter sued several states and state entities, and the district court concluded that many of his claims were barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity, and that Benter otherwise failed to state a claim. Upon de novo review, <em>see Moore v. Sims, </em>200 F.3d 1170, 1171 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (standard of review), we agree with the district court\u2019s analysis, <em>see P.R. Aqueduct and Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 145-46, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993) (Eleventh Amendment bars suits for injunctive relief against states and their agencies); <em>Alabama v. Pugh, </em>438 U.S. 781, 782, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978) (Eleventh Amendment bars suits against states unless they have consented to suit or Congress has validly abrogated their immunity); <em>Dixon v. Love, </em>431 U.S. 105, 112-13, 97 S.Ct. 1723, 52 L.Ed.2d 172 (1977) (no pre-termination hearing required when driver\u2019s license denied based on objective facts in record, such as traffic violations). As to Benter\u2019s contention that the district court should have granted him a default judgment because defendants never answered his complaint, we note that the action was dismissed prior to service, so defendants were not in default. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (authorizing dismissal \u201cat any time\u201d for one of specified grounds); Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(a)(1)(A) (answer shall be filed within 20 days of service of complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
