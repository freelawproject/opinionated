Tatroe claims that Wheeler retaliated against her for constitutionally protected speech made while she worked as a Cobb County 9-1-1 emergency operator. The district court denied Wheeler\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that he was not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage of the litigation. On appeal, Wheeler contends that the adverse employment actions alleged by Tatroe were motivated at least in part by lawful considerations and that, therefore, he is entitled to qualified immunity under <em>Stanley v. City of Dalton, </em>219 F.3d 1280, 1294-97 (11th Cir.2000), and <em>Foy v. Holston, </em>94 F.3d 1528, 1534-35 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">After thorough review of the record and having considered oral argument, we affirm. The district court correctly concluded that Wheeler is not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage of the litigation because the record does not <em>indisputably </em>indicate that the alleged adverse employment actions taken by Wheeler were motivated, at least in part, by lawful considerations. <em>See Stanley, </em>219 F.3d at 1296 (\u201cA defendant is entitled to qualified immunity under the <em>Foy </em>rationale only where, among other things, the record indisputably establishes that the defendant in fact was motivated, at least in part, by lawful considerations.\u201d); <em>Johnson v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>126 F.3d 1372, 1379 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe holding in <em>Foy </em>rested primarily on the existence of an indisputable and adequate lawful motive.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
