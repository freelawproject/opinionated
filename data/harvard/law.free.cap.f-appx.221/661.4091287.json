We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>see Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Cir.2002), and review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>see Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence Silva-Ventura submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See Singh, </em>295 F.3d at 1039 (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d). Silva-Ventura\u2019s contention that the BIA abused its discretion by not addressing in its decision all the evidence presented is unavailing. <em>See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Silva-Ventura\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen violated due process fails. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (to prevail on a due process challenge, a petitioner must show error).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Silva-Ventura\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
