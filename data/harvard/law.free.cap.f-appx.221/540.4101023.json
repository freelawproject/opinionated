Covello, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Sally Papin (Papin) appeals the denial of her motion for summary judgment challenging denial of her claim for Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">1. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) did not fail to consider all of Papin\u2019s claimed impairments, and the resulting effects from them. He sufficiently explained how medical examinations in the record contradicted Papin\u2019s claims. Although he did not mention insomnia specifically, he addressed Papin\u2019s \u201cnonexertional limitations,\u201d and, in the hearing, considered the impact of any probable symptoms likely to result from those limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">2. The ALJ properly credited the opinions of Papin\u2019s treating physician. The ALJ summarized and specifically referenced the treating physician\u2019s records. Additionally, although the treating physician completed a disabled person placard statement in support of Papin\u2019s request for disabled parking privileges, the ALJ was not required to consider it, both because it was conclusory and because it conflicted with the physician\u2019s <em>later </em>evaluation. <em>See Batson v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">3. The ALJ properly considered Pa-pin\u2019s testimony, and \u201cprovide[d] specific, cogent reasons for [his] disbelief,\u201d <em>Greger v. Barnhart, </em>464 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), including the lack of support in the objective medical record.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">4. The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical was legally sufficient. \u201c[I]n hypotheticals posed to a vocational expert, the ALJ must only include those limitations supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Robbins v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>466 F.3d 880, 886 (9th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Papin\u2019s conclusory assertion that the vocational expert\u2019s (VE) testimony \u201cwas not grounded in any scientific principles or methodology\u201d in violation of <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>509 U.S. 579, 593-94, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), fails because it is unsupported by any specific contention as to how the methodology was invalid. <em>See Milne v. Hillblom, </em>165 F.3d 733, 737 n. 6 (9th Cir.1999). Additionally, Pa-pin stipulated to the vocational expert\u2019s qualifications. <em>See Marbled Murrelet v. Babbitt, </em>83 F.3d 1060, 1067 (9th Cir.1996), <em>as amended </em>(discussing waiver of <em>Daubert </em>objections). Papin\u2019s remaining challenges to the hypothetical are based on misstatements of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b569-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
