We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-25\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Danyal did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his Christian faith. <em>See id. </em>at 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Danyal presented insufficient evidence that the mistreatment he suffered rose to the level of persecution, <em>see Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995), or that his assailants belonged to groups the Syrian government was unable or unwilling to control. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995). Because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision to deny asylum on the merits, we need not address the issue of Danyal\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Because Danyal did not establish that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Because Danyal failed to raise his CAT claim before the BIA, this claim is unexhausted and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
