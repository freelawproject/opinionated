Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b651-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Annevia Ruffin Thompson (\u201cThompson\u201d) challenges her mail fraud and possession of stolen mail convictions on the grounds that damaging evidence was unlawfully-seized, improperly admitted, or both. Thompson also challenges her sentence on the grounds that the district court improperly imposed a twelve-point Guidelines enhancement under section 2B1.1(b)(1) and made an improper delegation to the Probation Office in imposing a particular condition of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Assuming, without deciding, that the seizure of evidence from Thompson\u2019s hotel room was unlawful under <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 164 L.Ed.2d 208 (2006), the admission of this evidence to impeach Thompson on cross-examination was proper. <em>James v. Illinois, </em>493 U.S. 307, 308-09, 110 S.Ct. 648, 107 L.Ed.2d 676 (1990). To the extent that a brief mention of this evidence was made during the government\u2019s case-in-chief, the court is \u201cconvinced ... beyond a reasonable doubt ... that the improperly admitted evidence\u201d \u2014 if, indeed, improperly admitted \u2014 \u201cdid not contribute to the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>264 F.3d 919, 927 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence tending to show that Thompson was engaged in fraudulent activities beyond the scope of the charged scheme. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Robles, </em>386 F.3d 1234, 1240 (9th Cir.2004). The evidence was properly admitted under Rule 404(b) because: (1) Thompson\u2019s knowledge and intent were material issues in the case;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) Thompson\u2019s other identity-theft-related activities were similar to the charged bank fraud and possession of stolen mail offenses;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Thompson indeed engaged in these other activities; and (4) the charged offenses and the other activities were taking place simultaneously, <em>see United States v. Blitz, </em>151 F.3d 1002, 1008 (9th Cir.1998), and the district court did not abuse its discretion under Rule 403 when it found that the probative value of the disputed evidence was not \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\u201d it might cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">or did the district court clearly err when it calculated Thompson\u2019s intended loss, for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l), as being between $200,000 and $400,000. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>219 F.3d 863, 866 (9th Cir.2000). When calculating intended loss, \u201c[t]he court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,\u201d and can \u201ctak[e] into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>account, as appropriate and practicable under the circumstances, factors such as ... [t]he approximate number of victims multiplied by the average loss to each victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. 3(C). This is precisely what the district court did here. Accordingly, there was no error in imposing a twelve-point enhancement under section 2B1.1(b)(1) of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Finally, there was no plain error in the supervised release condition requiring Thompson to \u201csubmit to drug and alcohol testing, as instructed by the Probation Officer.\u201d <em>United States v. Maciel-Vasquez, </em>458 F.3d 994, 996 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">. Thompson put both her <em>knowledge </em>of the stolen nature of the mail and her <em>intent </em>to commit fraud at issue when she testified that she was holding the stolen mail for a friend and was unaware she was participating in a fraudulent scheme. Moreover, knowledge is an essential element of possession of stolen mail under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708, and intent is an essential element of bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-15\">. Similarity must be shown when both knowledge and intent are at issue, as is the case here. <em>United States v. Vo, </em>413 F.3d 1010, 1018 (9th Cir.2005). Thompson\u2019s other fraudulent activities were similar to her charged offenses not because they dealt with the same basic topic (fraud), but because they involved forging documents, capitalizing on other people's credit, and assuming other people\u2019s identities, all of which Thompson had done in the course of carrying out the charged scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b652-15\">. The district court's use of the word \"reasonable\u201d in connection with calculating intended loss does not evidence a premature use of the court\u2019s sentencing discretion under <em>Booker, </em>rather, it evidences the district court\u2019s use of the Sentencing Guidelines' application notes, which require district courts to \"make a <em>reasonable </em>estimate\u201d of the intended loss. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. 3(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
