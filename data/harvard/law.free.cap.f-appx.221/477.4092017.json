The court ordered Simms\u2019s sentence to run concurrently with a state sentence for drug-trafficking convictions. On appeal, Simms\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel in his <em>Anders </em>brief and Simms in a pro se supplemental brief argue the district court violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by using judge-found facts at sentencing, which were neither admitted by Simms nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, to support the enhancements to Simms\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-24\">We hold there was no <em>Booker </em>error because the district court did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 311-14, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hines, </em>472 F.3d 1038, 1040 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (concluding after <em>Booker </em>judges can make factual findings as long as the United States Sentencing Guidelines are treated as advisory).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-25\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-20\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
