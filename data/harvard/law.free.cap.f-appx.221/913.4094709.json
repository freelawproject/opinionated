He argues that \u00a7 1326 is facially unconstitutional because it allows judicial fact-finding into the nature and quantity of prior convictions \u2014 facts not charged in the indictment, admitted by the defendant, or found beyond a reasonable doubt by the fact-finder \u2014 to support a higher statutory maximum punishment. He also asserts that \u00a7 1326 violates the Double Jeopardy Clause because the increased statutory maximum results in multiple punishments for the same offense (his prior aggravated felony). Ortiz-Williams preserved his constitutional claims below. Accordingly, we engage in a <em>de novo </em>review of those claims. <em>United States v. </em>Paz, 405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">The Immigration and Nationality Act, as codified, in pertinent part, at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, delineates criminal penalties for an alien who, after being removed, re-enters the United States without receiving the prior approval of the Attorney General or his successor, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. If such an alien was removed subsequent to conviction for an aggravated felony, the statutory maximum term of imprisonment increases from two years to twenty years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">First, Ortiz-Williams argues his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court sentenced him above the unenhanced two-year statutory maximum based on facts not charged in the indictment or admitted by Ortiz-Williams. Although he recognizes that the Supreme Court has explicitly approved such enhancements, he suggests that whether prior convictions should be treated as elements of an offense under recidivism statutes, such as \u00a7 1326(b)(2), remains a \u201csignificant question.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">The Supreme Court has held that the government need not allege in the indictment nor prove beyond a reasonable doubt the fact that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a district court to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence based on those convictions. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> More recently, in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Court reiterated its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres: </em>\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">We have observed that the <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>decision \u201cwas left undisturbed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number><em>Apprendi, Blakely [v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) ], and <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) . And we have consistently rejected the argument that district courts err by basing a sentence enhancement on a prior conviction that is neither proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury nor admitted by the defendant. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir.2006) (collecting cases); <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005); <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir.), <em>cert.denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005) . We reject Ortiz-Williams\u2019s invitation to revisit this issue yet again. Pursuant to <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and our uniform line of cases applying it, the district court did not err in sentencing Ortiz-Williams based on his prior conviction for an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">We likewise are unpersuaded by Ortiz-Williams\u2019s double-jeopardy challenge to \u00a7 1326(b)(2). It is well-established that sentencing enhancements for prior criminal conduct do not constitute multiple punishment for the prior offenses, <em>and </em>the consideration of prior convictions in sentencing does not implicate or violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>United States v. Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d 1515, 1522 (11th Cir. 1997). In short, the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence did not implicate, or violate, the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\">. Notably, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>involved a challenge to the <em>exact </em>penalty provision at issue in the instant case \u2014 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
