O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b739-28\">Plaintiff David Lee appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his request for reconsideration with respect to its ear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>lier order dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"AC-\">A. Lee\u2019s Termination</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">This case arises out of the termination of Lee\u2019s employment with the Los Alamos National Lab (\u201cLab\u201d). According to Lee\u2019s complaint, he began working at the Lab in 1993 as a technical staff member and team leader of the Radiological Engineering Team (\u201cRET\u201d) within the department known as HSR-12. In April 2002, Sandra Gogol, a probationary employee under Lee\u2019s supervision, complained to James Bland, another staff member, that Lee had been treating her unfairly. Lee maintains that these complaints were false. He also contends, however, that Bland \u201charbored considerable resentment\u201d towards him because he had replaced Bland as the RET team leader. Aplt.App. at 10. He claims that because of this animosity, Bland encouraged Gogol to take her complaints directly to Lee McAtee, a high-level manager who also harbored \u201cone or more personal grudges\u201d against Lee. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Gogol followed Bland\u2019s advice and told McAtee that Lee had been mistreating her and that she wanted a job transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Based on Gogol\u2019s accusations, McAtee and Bland, acting in concert with Victoria McCabe of the human relations office and William Eisele, the HSR-12 group leader, \u201cset in motion a chain of retaliatory events that was eventually to culminate in [Lee\u2019s] termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. First, Eisele told Lee that he was to have no further contact with Gogol. Then, McCabe opened an investigation into Gogol\u2019s complaints. According to Lee, the investigation \u201cwas unfair, inadequate, biased, and not calculated to yield reliable results,\u201d and was instead \u201cdesigned to gather sufficient adverse material concerning [Lee] to provide a pretextual basis for disciplining him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. He concedes, however, that McCabe interviewed him twice as part of her investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">In August 2002, after a meeting between McCabe, Eisele, and McAtee, Lee was suspended, demoted, and formally reprimanded for various infractions that he claims he did not commit. The Lab ultimately terminated his employment in November 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">B. The District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">On September 29, 2004, Lee sued Gogol, Bland, McAtee, McCabe, Eisele, and the Regents of the University of California<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that he was deprived of a property interest in his job without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. His complaint, however, does not describe any inadequacies in the process used to fire him. Instead, Count I, which is his \u00a7 1983 claim, states only that the defendants \u201cdeprived [him] of rights protected by \u00a7 1983, specifically, the right to be suspended or terminated only for just cause.\u201d ApltApp. at 17. The defendants moved to dismiss the \u00a7 1983 claim based on Lee\u2019s failure to challenge the termination process. They argued that the Due Process Clause only protects against governmental depriva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tions without due process of law, and since Lee alleged only that he was terminated without cause, his complaint failed to state a \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, dated May 17, 2005, the district court considered whether the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the \u00a7 1983 claim. The court explained that first it had to determine whether Lee had alleged a violation of his procedural due process rights. <em>See id. </em>at 58; <em>Tonkovich v. Kan. Bd. of Regents, </em>159 F.3d 504, 516 (10th Cir.1998). If so, it would have to reach the next question of \u201cwhether the right allegedly implicated was clearly established at the time of the events in question.\u201d <em>Tonkovich, </em>159 F.3d at 516 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Properly limiting its review to the allegations in Lee\u2019s complaint, <em>see Issa v. Comp USA </em>354 F.3d 1174, 1179 (10th Cir.2003) (explaining that a plaintiff cannot rely on briefing to supplement complaint), the district court concluded that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, because the complaint did not state a due process violation. Thus, the court did not have to decide whether the constitutional right at issue was clearly established. <em>As </em>the court explained, Lee\u2019s allegation that he was fired without cause was insufficient to invoke the protections of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cIn procedural due process claims, the deprivation by state action of a constitutionally protected interest in \u2018life, liberty, or property\u2019 is not in itself unconstitutional; what is unconstitutional is the deprivation of such an interest <em>without due process of law.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Aplt.App. at 59 (quoting <em>Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 125, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990)). Since the complaint challenged only the propriety of the deprivation and not the adequacy of the termination process, the district court concluded that the complaint failed to state a procedural due process claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">The court went further, however, and found that even if Lee had challenged the adequacy of the termination process, his \u00a7 1983 claim would still have failed because it was evident <em>from </em>the complaint that Lee was accorded adequate process. Citing <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 545, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985), the court explained that \u201c[a] pretermination hearing \u2018need not be elaborate\u2019 nor does it need to be a full-blown evidentiary hearing. ... All that due process requires is \u2018notice and an opportunity to respond.\u2019\u201d Aplt.App. at 59-60. Here, the court determined that McCabe\u2019s pre-termination interviews of Lee showed that he was provided with notice and an opportunity to respond, which was all that due process required. It went on to hold that Lee\u2019s failure to allege that he had requested and been denied a post-termination hearing waived any arguments based on the lack of such a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 92; <em>see Pitts v. Bd. of Educ. of U.S.D. 305, </em>869 F.2d 555, 557 (10th Cir.1989) (holding that plaintiffs failure to request pre-termination hearing waived right to challenge hearing in court); <em>Alvin v. Suzuki </em>227 F.3d 107, 116-19 (3rd Cir.2000) (rejecting plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim because plaintiff failed to use formal grievance process).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">On May 27, 2005, Lee filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 claim. He argued that since a \u00a7 1983 claim carries no exhaustion requirement, he was not required to request a post-termination hearing before filing suit. The district court interpreted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>motion as \u201cessentially questioning] the correctness of [its] prior Order\u201d and therefore \u201cevaluate[d][the] motion under Rule 59(e) for manifest error.\u201d ApltApp. at 91. It rejected Lee\u2019s exhaustion argument, explaining that the issue was not one of exhaustion but whether Lee had a \u00a7 1983 claim to begin with. \u201cA due process violation does not occur until a state fails to provide due process, and \u2018exhaustion <em>simpliciter </em>is analytically distinct from the requirement that the harm alleged ... has occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92 <em>(quoting Alvin, </em>227 F.3d at 116). Lee, the court explained, lacked a constitutional claim to begin with because the complaint itself described a process sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment. And again, the court held that Lee had waived any challenge to the fairness of a post-termination hearing by failing to request such a hearing. Consequently, the court determined that its earlier order was not manifestly erroneous and denied the Rule 59(e) motion. Lee then filed this appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">It is well-settled that a Rule 59(e) motion should only be granted \u201cto correct manifest errors of law or to present newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Jennings v. Rivers, </em>394 F.3d 850, 854 (10th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). When a district court denies such a motion, we review its decision for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>This includes a \u201creview to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Lee argues on appeal that the procedures in place for Lab employees subject to termination are so biased in favor of the Lab that a fired employee should not be required to partake of them in order to raise a procedural due process claim. Specifically, he argues that section 111.34 of the Lab\u2019s Administrative Manual, which precludes the hearing officer from issuing subpoenas, is hopelessly unfair, because although the Lab can compel current employees to testify on its behalf, the claimant has no means to compel unwilling witnesses to give testimony on the claimant\u2019s behalf. He concludes by arguing that \u201ca fired public employee may not be required to take advantage of a state grievance or hearing procedure that does not provide the due process to which the plaintiff is entitled.\u201d Opening Br. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">This argument, although based on a more specific challenge to the Lab\u2019s post-termination procedures, is simply another take on the exhaustion argument that Lee asserted vigorously before the district court. We agree with the district court, however, that exhaustion is not the issue. Lee\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim fails not because he refused to jump through the requisite hoops, but because he affirmatively pled that he was afforded notice and an opportunity to respond before he was terminated. We also agree with the district court that Lee waived any challenge to the fairness of the Lab\u2019s post-termination hearing procedures because he never requested a post-termination hearing. And as the district court stated, he cannot make a futility argument with respect to the post-termination process based on alleged unfairness in the pre-termination process. <em>See Alvin, </em>227 F.3d at 119 (explaining that bias in early stages of termination process does not prove bias in later stages). In short, for the same reasons stated by the district court in its December 12, 2005, order denying Lee\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, we conclude that Lee failed to show that the court\u2019s finding with respect to qualified immunity was manifestly erroneous. Therefore, the court clearly acted within its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>denying Lee\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, and its judgment must be, and is, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b739-17\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal.

This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
