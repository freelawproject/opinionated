Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b645-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">Marvin Butler (\u201cButler\u201d) appeals his sentence following remand for a full resentencing under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">Under the 1995 version of the Sentencing Guidelines applicable to Butler, the district court erred in concluding it could not consider Butler\u2019s post-sentence rehabilitation as a basis for downward departure. <em>United States v. Green, </em>152 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir.1998). Although in many instances such an error would be immaterial in a <em>post-Booker </em>world,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we cannot conclude the error was harmless in this case. While indicating a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>awareness it could sentence outside the Guidelines after <em>Booker, </em>the district court expressly indicated that it did not take into consideration Butler\u2019s successful participation in various Bureau of Prisons programs, and that if consideration of those post-sentencing factors was appropriate, \u201cthis Court would find defendant should be given credit for that under the guideline structure and would be a basis for departure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The district court did not err by refusing to group the fraud and money laundering counts. This was a correct interpretation of the 1995 Guidelines under this circuit\u2019s precedent in <em>United States v. Hanley, </em>190 F.3d 1017, 1033 (9th Cir.1999), and <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>984 F.2d 298, 303 (9th Cir.1993). When the addition of Application Note 6 regarding grouping is considered in the context of the entire 2001 amendments to the money laundering guidelines, these changes were substantive, not clarifying, and thus do not apply retroactively. <em>United States v. Aptt, </em>354 F.3d 1269, 1276 (10th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Descent, </em>292 F.3d 703, 707-09 (11th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Sabbeth, </em>277 F.3d 94 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The district court did not plainly err by imposing restitution of over two million dollars. The record sufficiently indicates that the court considered Butler\u2019s ability to pay. <em>See United States v. English, </em>92 F.3d 909, 917 (9th Cir.1996). Although Butler was experiencing financial difficulty while incarcerated, there was at least \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record that Butler \u2014 who possessed a bachelor of science in business management and had previously been employed as CEO of a company that created educational programs for children \u2014 may be able to pay the restitution amount in the future. <em>United States v. Bachsian, 4 </em>F.3d 796, 800 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see also English, </em>92 F.3d at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR RE-SENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-12\">. <em>United States v. Mohamed, </em>459 F.3d 979 (9th Cir.2006), is applicable when the district court actually departs from the Guidelines, because even if the court had erred in calculating a \"departure\u201d under the Guidelines, it could have imposed the same sentence in its discretion after <em>Booker. </em>We conclude, however, that <em>Mohamed </em>has little application in this case, where the district court <em>did not </em>deviate from the applicable Guidelines range, perhaps misunderstood its ability to do so, and actually indicates it would have sentenced differently.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
