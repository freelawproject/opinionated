Torres argues for the first time on appeal that the government breached the plea agreement by recommending an enhancement based on Torres\u2019s role as captain of a go-fast boat. We disagree. The plea agreement states that the government would recommend that \u201cthe defendant should not receive an adjustment for role in the offense pursuant to Section 3B1.1 or 3B1.2\u201d of the Guidelines, but the government never recommended an enhancement under either sections 3B1.1 or 3B1.2, and Torres\u2019s sentence was not enhanced under either of these sections. The district court increased Torres\u2019s base offense level under section 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B), which requires a 2-level increase for one who \u201cacted as a pilot, copilot, captain, navigator, flight officer, or any other operation officer aboard any craft or vessel carrying a controlled substance.\u201d Torres admitted that he was captain of the go-fast boat. Torres\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
