McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">A jury convicted Carmelo Callejas in 2001 on five counts of criminal conduct. He was sentenced to 248 months in prison. This Court has twice affirmed that sentence \u2014 once on direct appeal, <em>United States v. Callejas, </em>66 Fed.Appx. 826 (10th Cir.2003) (unpublished), and again in dismissing Mr. Callejas\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <em>United States v. Callejas, </em>137 Fed. Appx. 175 (10th Cir.2005) (unpublished). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Mr. Callejas brought a third challenge to his sentence, which he styled as a \u201cMotion to Eliminate Enhancements and Reduce Sentence.\u201d The district court dismissed his motion, holding that Mr. Callejas could collaterally challenge his sentence only via \u00a7 2255. Mem. &amp; Order, 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The district court is correct. Section 2255 provides the exclusive means for collateral attack of a federal criminal sentence. <em>Baker v. Sheriff of Santa Fe County, </em>477 F.2d 118, 119 (10th Cir.1973). We note, however, that even were Mr. Callejas to petition this Court to authorize a second \u00a7 2255 application, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(3), his petition would fail. Defendants may not raise a <em>Booker </em>claim in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, as <em>Booker </em>did not announce a new, retroactive rule of constitutional law. <em>Bey v. United States, </em>399 F.3d 1266, 1268-69 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico is AFFIRMED. The government\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b801-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
