Sutton appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging his conviction for sexual abuse and sodomy. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">Sutton contends that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel because counsel failed to interview potential witnesses who would have testified at trial and because counsel failed to maintain adequate contact with him prior to trial. A review of the record reveals that Sutton has not shown \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Furthermore, Sutton has not shown that trial counsel was inadequately prepared for trial as a result of not maintaining adequate contact with him prior to trial. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the state court\u2019s conclusion that Sutton was not prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 24-25, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam) (state court decision not contrary to federal law when <em>Strickland </em>standard was correctly articulated, notwithstanding subsequent incomplete statement of the <em>Strickland </em>standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b639-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
