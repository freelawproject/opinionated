Hernandez argues that the district court erred by denying an offense-level reduction for his minimal role in the offense. The government asserts that Hernandez\u2019s appeal is barred by a waiver-of-appeal provision in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">At rearraignment, Hernandez acknowledged the existence of the plea agreement and that he was waiving his right to appeal his sentence. He also stated that counsel had read the plea agreement to him in Spanish, that he understood its terms, and that he was entering into the plea voluntarily. The district court also advised Hernandez that he was waiving his right to appeal. Hernandez reserved only the right to appeal a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum or a sentence that represented an upward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines, which had not been requested by the United States. As the government urges, Hernandez knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal, and as neither of the waiver\u2019s exceptions applies to the sole claim made in the instant appeal, Hernandez\u2019s appeal is barred by the waiver contained in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994). Appellant presents no argument to the contrary.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> In any event, we also agree with the government's alternative argument, that Hernandez\u2019s sole claim on appeal, that the district court \"abused its discretion, when it refused to make a downward departure, based on appellant\u2019s minimal participation,\u201d is wholly without merit. That was a matter on which appellant bore the burden of proof. We cannot say that the district court\u2019s denial of appellant's claim of minimal participation was either clearly erroneous, or an abuse of discretion, or unreasonable (or resulted in an unreasonable sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
