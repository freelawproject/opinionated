Amend (\u201cAmend\u201d) appeals a Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) decision in AT315H050799-I-1 dismissing his petition for lack of jurisdiction. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-28\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-29\">From 1996 until March 1, 2003, Amend was employed as an Immigration Inspector with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d), which was part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d). Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, the INS was abolished effective March 1, 2003, and its functions transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d). Amend continued his employment as an Immigration Inspector with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a subdivision of DHS. On August 22, 2004, Amend was appointed to the excepted service as an Inspector for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\u201cATF\u201d), a subdivision of DOJ. On July 15, 2005, Amend was terminated from federal service. He appealed his termination to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Jurisdiction of the Board is granted under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a) (2006), which provides that \u201c[a]n employee ... may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d Removal from employment is an appealable action where the individual is as an \u201cemployee\u201d at the time of removal by the agency. <em>Van Wersch v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>197 F.3d 1144, 1147 (Fed.Cir.1999). The term \u201cemployee\u201d is defined by statute under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B) to include \u201ca preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions ... in an Executive agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Without ruling on the merits of Amend\u2019s petition, an Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) ordered the parties to submit arguments and evidence on whether the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal. Although the AJ found that Amend was \u201cpreference eligible,\u201d the AJ held that Amend was not an \u201cemployee\u201d under \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B) because he had not been employed by \u201can Executive agency\u201d for \u201c1 year of current continuous service\u201d before he was terminated. The AJ interpreted \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B) to require the \u201c1 year of current continuous service\u201d to \u201ctake place in a single agency.\u201d Because Amend had only worked for DOJ as an ATF Inspector for eleven months before he was terminated, the AJ concluded that \u201cthe appellant did not have 1 year of current continuous service in the Department of Justice when he was terminated.\u201d Therefore, the AJ dismissed Amend\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Amend appealed the AJ\u2019s dismissal to the full Board. The Board affirmed the AJ\u2019s decision on different grounds. The Board noted that the AJ\u2019s decision was issued before the Board decided <em>Greene v. Defense Intelligence Agency, </em>100 M.S.P.R. 447, K12 (M.S.P.B.2005), which held that \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B) does not require that the continuous year of service be completed within a single agency. Thus, the Board held that to satisfy the 1 year requirement Amend\u2019s prior service at DHS may be \u201ctacked\u201d onto his service at DOJ. Nonetheless, the Board held that the Immigration Inspector and the ATF Inspector (officially titled \u201cIndustry Operations Investigator\u201d) positions are not \u201cthe same or similar\u201d under \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B). The Board reasoned that the two positions held different grades and classification series, the ATF position required top secret clearance, the ATF position required substantial additional training, and the positions required different knowledge and skills. Accordingly, the Board affirmed the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">A timely appeal to this Court followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">We review decisions of the Board regarding its own jurisdiction without deference. <em>McCormick v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, </em>307 F.3d 1339, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2002). The petitioner bears the burden of establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>Board jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2)(i); <em>McCormick, </em>307 F.3d at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Section 7701(a) provides that \u201c[a]n employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a). At issue is whether Amend is \u201can employee\u201d within \u00a7 7701. Section 7511(a)(1)(B) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201ca preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions \u2014 (i) in an Executive agency; or (ii) in the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission.\u201d Because the parties agree that Amend is \u201cpreference eligible,\u201d we need only determine whether Amend has otherwise demonstrated that he is an \u201cemployee\u201d under \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Although on appeal the Board does not address whether service in more than one agency satisfies the one year requirement, DOJ as Intervenor does dispute the Board\u2019s interpretation. DOJ Br. 11. We recognize that the Board\u2019s interpretation that a petitioner need not complete the \u201c1 year of current continuous service\u201d within a single agency is an open question. <em>Compare Illich v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>104 Fed.Appx. 171, 173 (Fed.Cir.2004), <em>with Greene, </em>100 M.S.P.R. at 451. However, we decline to reach that issue because we agree with the Board that Immigration Inspector and ATF Inspector are not \u201csimilar positions\u201d under \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Amend argues that when he was hired for the ATF position, which was three grade levels lower than the Immigration Inspector position, \u201cATF effectively eliminated any doubt as to whether or not the petitioner\u2019s prior experience as an Immigration Inspector was \u2018similar.\u2019 \u201d Pet\u2019r Rep. Br. 2. We disagree. This court has explained that in \u201cthe same or similar positions\u201d is akin to \u201cin the same line of work.\u201d <em>Mathis v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed.Cir.1988). In other words, the positions must \u201cinvolve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the implementing regulations define \u201csimilar positions\u201d to mean \u201cpositions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the work.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.402(g). We see no error in the Board\u2019s determination that the two positions are not the \u201csame or similar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">First, the two positions require different qualifications. ATF Inspectors are expected to have knowledge of federal, state, and local alcohol, tobacco, firearm, and explosive laws and regulations. Immigration Inspectors are required to understand \u201cU.S. immigration, customs, public health, and agriculture laws, regulations, and related precedent decisions and court injunctions.\u201d To become an ATF Inspector, applicants must complete a seven week training course. In addition to the seven week training course, once accepted as an ATF Inspector, the first two years of employment are considered an \u201cinternship\u201d before the employee \u201cmay be non-eompetitively converted to a career or career-conditional position.\u201d During these two years, employees must engage in \u201cvarious training and developmental programs.\u201d Moreover, the ATF position requires top secret clearance, which is not apparently required for Immigration Inspectors. Although not dispositive, the positions were also listed at different pay grades and classifications. The ATF Inspector was GS-9, Classification 1854, and the Immigration Inspector was GS-11, Classifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>tion 1816. <em>See Coradeschi v. Dep\u2019t Homeland Sec., </em>439 F.3d 1329, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Second, the actual work performed by an ATF Inspector is not similar to that performed by an Immigration Inspector. According to the official job description,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the primary task of an ATF Inspector is to determine whether people \u201cdesiring to enter business in the regulated industries [of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives] meet established legal requirements for obtaining a federal permit or license.\u201d To complete the duties, an ATF Inspector must interview people, inspect buildings, and conduct background investigations. The work environment of an ATF Inspector includes onsite investigations of explosive manufacturers, explosive storage magazines, and firearms dealers. In contrast, an Immigration Inspector \u201c[c]onducts primary inspection or examination of all classes of applicants for admission to the United States.\u201d This includes inspecting and examining arriving persons, baggage, and merchandise for the United States Customs Service. Immigration Inspectors primarily work at seaports, airports, and land border entry points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Finally, Amend relies on <em>McCormick, </em>307 F.3d 1339, in support of his position. However, <em>McCormick </em>only involved \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A), whereas this case involves \u00a7 7511(a)(l)(S). (emphasis added). As \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A) does not contain the \u201csame or similar position\u201d language, <em>McCormick </em>does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Accordingly, we agree with the Board that the ATF Inspector and Immigration Inspector positions are not \u201cthe same or similar\u201d under \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B), and therefore Amend was not an \u201cemployee\u201d when his position was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">. Amend does not appear to argue that his actual duties differ from the official job description.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
