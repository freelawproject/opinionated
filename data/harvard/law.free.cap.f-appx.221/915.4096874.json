The government argues that the district court erred by (1) considering factors unrelated to Madden\u2019s substantial assistance in determining how much to depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1; (2) not using the applicable guidelines range, as modified by the statutory minimum sentence, as its starting point from which to depart under \u00a7 5K1.1; and (3) imposing an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">\n<em>Consideration of Factors Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">The government first argues that the district court erred by considering factors unrelated to Madden\u2019s substantial assistance in determining how much to depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">We review \u201carguments raised for the first time on appeal for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>274 F.3d 1325, 1326 (11th Cir.2001) (reviewing arguments the government raised for the first time on appeal). In order to object sufficiently before the district court to preserve an issue for appeal, a litigant\u2019s objection must be \u201cin such clear and simple language that the trial court may not misunderstand it, and if his point is so obscurely hinted at that the trial court quite excusably may fail to grasp it, it will avail naught to disturb the judgment on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087-88 (11th Cir.2003). We</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-15\">will find plain error only where (1) there is an error in the district court\u2019s determination; (2) the error is plain or obvious; (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-16\"><em>Clark, </em>274 F.3d at 1326. The government may show plain error where the error \u201cdramatically impacted the sentence, and thereby affected the substantial rights of the government and the people of the United States that the defendant be sentenced correctly in accordance with the legal principles of the sentencing guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>lines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329 (quotation and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">\u201c[District courts are prohibited from considering sentencing factors unrelated to the nature and extent of a defendant\u2019s assistance in making \u00a7 5K1.1 departures.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). In ruling on a government motion for departure based upon substantial assistance, district courts may consider the following factors, set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1: (1) \u201cthe court\u2019s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance, taking into consideration the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered\u201d; (2) \u201cthe truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant\u201d; (3) \u201cthe nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance\u201d; (4) \u201cany injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance\u201d; and (5) \u201cthe timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Kl.l(a) (quoted in <em>Martin, </em>455 F.3d at 1235). \u201c[I]n meting out a substantial assistance departure the court may consider factors outside the \u00a7 5Kl.l(a) list, but only if they are related to the assistance rendered.\u201d <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1289 (11th Cir.2006) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, comment, (backg\u2019d.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The government failed to object before the district court on the ground that the district court was considering impermissible factors. Instead, the government\u2019s only objections concerned the extent of the district court\u2019s departure. The government\u2019s objection to the extent of the departure did nothing to alert the district court that the government believed that the district court was considering impermissible factors. Therefore, because the government failed clearly to articulate its objection to the district court\u2019s consideration of allegedly impermissible factors, we review for plain error. <em>See Zinn, 321 </em>F.3d at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">In this case, the district court repeatedly considered factors that were unrelated to Madden\u2019s assistance. In particular, the district judge stated that she was looking at \u201cdeterrence and what a person can do when they get out\u201d and \u201cwhat is a just sentence,\u201d in addition to asking \u201cis he going to go back and start dealing drugs again?\u201d The district judge also stated that she was \u201ckind of changing [her] view a little more favorably towards [Madden]\u201d after she learned that he had not been involved with drugs after he got out of prison in 2004. Such considerations are impermissible factors for a departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 because they are unrelated to Madden\u2019s assistance to authorities. <em>See Martin, </em>455 F.3d at 1236. Therefore, the district court committed error that was plain. Furthermore, the error was prejudicial to the government\u2019s interest in Madden receiving a just sentence in light of the extreme departure the district court granted after it considered the impermissible factors. In addition, granting such an extreme departure on impermissible grounds affects the \u201cfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>274 F.3d at 1326. Accordingly, the district court committed plain error, and we remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"Atz\">\n<em>Starting Point for U.S.S. G. \u00a7 5K1.1 Departure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">The government argues that the district court erred by not using the applicable guidelines range, as modified by the statutory minimum sentence, as its starting point from which to depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is subject to de novo review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Although <em>Booker </em>has rendered the guidelines range advisory, the correct application of individual guideline provisions is obligatory. <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 457, 166 L.Ed.2d 325 (2006). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d at 1288. We have stated that \u201cthe Guidelines do not contemplate a downward departure for substantial assistance until <em>after </em>the court applies section 5Gl.l(b), which establishes that the applicable guideline sentence <em>shall be </em>the mandatory minimum sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Head, </em>178 F.3d 1205, 1208 (11th Cir.1999). Therefore, the mandatory minimum sentence is the appropriate starting point for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. <em>Id. </em>at 1206-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The district judge stated that she had \u201cbeen looking more at departing from what the Guideline level would have been absent the statutory minimum sentence.\u201d This is error because we have held that the proper departure point is the guideline range after the statutory minimum has been applied. <em>See Head, </em>178 F.3d at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">\n<em>Reasonableness of Madden\u2019s Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">We review the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">We need not decide the reasonableness of Madden\u2019s current sentence because we are remanding the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
