R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b553-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-16\">Javier Gomez-Moreno appeals his conviction for being a deported alien found in the United States without permission in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), arguing that (1) the evidence was insufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not a United States citizen, and (2) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by relying on facts not in evidence and vouching. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-17\">I. Sufficiency Of The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b553-18\">The government presented evidence that Gomez-Moreno had admitted to being born in Mexico several times during prior immigration proceedings. Government employees testified that Gomez-Moreno had voluntarily made those admissions to them. The government introduced evidence that there was no birth certificate for Gomez-Moreno in New Mexico, the state in which he claimed he was born. \u201c[Vjiewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d a rational jury could disbelieve Gomez-Moreno\u2019s testimony and find that the government\u2019s evidence proved his alienage beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>States v. Norris, </em>428 F.3d 907, 914 (9th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Gomez-Moreno argues that his admissions were insufficient to sustain the verdict, because of the rule that \u201ca defendant\u2019s confession requires some independent corroborating evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Alvarez, </em>970 F.2d 583, 589 (9th Cir.1992) (emphasis removed). However, the corroboration rule only applies to confessions that occur <em>after </em>a crime is committed. <em>Warszower v. United States, </em>312 U.S. 342, 347, 61 S.Ct. 603, 85 L.Ed. 876 (1941). Even if Gomez-Moreno\u2019s admissions were the government\u2019s only evidence of his alienage, Gomez-Moreno made them before the crime at issue occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">II. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Gomez-Moreno\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly relied on facts not in evidence is without merit. The prosecutor\u2019s statement that Gomez-Moreno had admitted to his citizenship in front of immigration judges was a \u201creasonable inference\u201d from the orders of deportation and Agent Webster\u2019s testimony about the deportation process. <em>See United States v. Sayetsitty, </em>107 F.3d 1405, 1409 (9th Cir.1997). The prosecutor\u2019s statement that Gomez-Moreno had never applied for a delayed birth certificate was based on Gomez-Moreno\u2019s admission, on cross-examination, that he had not done so. The general statement that immigration judges make decisions based on their experience and their judgment of a situation was a reasonable inference. All of these statements were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">It was not a reasonable inference from the record to state that Gomez-Moreno had not raised his claim to United States citizenship before any immigration judge. The defense objected to this statement at trial, so we review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Weatherspoon, </em>410 F.3d 1142, 1150 (9th Cir.2005). The district court immediately admonished the jury that it could not consider the prosecutor\u2019s statements to be evidence. In addition, the case against Gomez-Moreno was strong, pitting evidence of Gomez-Moreno\u2019s numerous admissions to being born in Mexico against his testimony that government officials had forced him admit to being born in Mexico on each occasion. The prosecutor\u2019s statement did not prejudice Gomez-Moreno, <em>cf. id., </em>at 1151, and does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Gomez-Moreno\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the immigration judges and the government\u2019s witnesses is also without merit. Here, the immigration judges were not witnesses, so the more appropriate argument is that the prosecutor\u2019s statements about them relied on facts not in the record. Stating that the immigration judges would face various repercussions for lying was not a reasonable inference from Agent Webster\u2019s testimony. Since defense counsel did not object to these statements, we review for plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 1151. The district court did not instruct the jury to disregard them, and the court\u2019s instruction to the jury that the prosecutor\u2019s arguments did not constitute evidence did not alone \u201cneutralize the harm of the improper statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the strength of the government\u2019s case prevents us from finding that the prosecutor\u2019s statements require reversal under the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">The prosecutor\u2019s statements about the possible repercussions for lying were not vouching as to Agent Webster, because Agent Webster testified about those repercussions. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1146 (statements about possible repercussions were vouching because they were based on facts not in evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The statements about repercussions were vouching as to the other government employees, because they were not supported by evidence in the record and were almost identical to statements found improper in <em>Weatherspoon. See id. </em>Since defense counsel did not object to these statements, we review for plain error. The district court did not give any curative instructions immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s vouching, and again, the later general jury instruction did not suffice to render the vouching harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 1151. However, unlike in <em>Weatherspoon, </em>this was not a close case and did not turn on the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses. See id. The prosecutor\u2019s vouching does not require reversal under the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The prosecutor engaged in some misconduct during Gomez-Moreno\u2019s trial. However, in light of the strength of the government\u2019s case against Gomez-Moreno, these instances of misconduct do not require reversal.
