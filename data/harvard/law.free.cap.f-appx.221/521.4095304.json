Duarte contends that the factual basis in his plea agreement, that he sent heroin to Guam via U.S. mail and traveled over international waters on a direct flight from California to Guam to receive payment for previous shipments, does not constitute conspiracy to import heroin under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a). He explains that <em>United States v. Cabaccang, </em>332 F.3d 622, 626-27 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc), which was decided after Duarte was sentenced, held that traveling over international waters was insufficient for the \u201cplace outside\u201d the United States requirement of importation. The district court denied Duarte\u2019s motion on two independent grounds: (1) Duarte\u2019s \u201cplea agreement expressly waived his right to collaterally attack his sentence,\u201d and (2) Duarte \u201cprocedurally defaulted his claim\u201d by failing to prove either cause and prejudice or actual innocence. We have jurisdiction to review his motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a), and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The district court raised sua sponte the argument that Duarte waived his right to collaterally attack his conviction after the government failed to raise that affirmative defense in its response to Duarte\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Whether a court may raise a waiver defense sua sponte or the government waives its waiver defense when it fails to assert it properly will be considered in <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>464 F.3d 988 (9th Cir.2006), scheduled for rehearing en banc on March 21, 2007. Therefore, we decline to consider that question now.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Duarte\u2019s plea agreement, however, expressly waived only the right to collaterally attack his conviction. Duarte preserved the right to collaterally attack his sentence. <em>See United States v. Pruitt, </em>32 F.3d 431, 433 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cA plea agreement does not waive the right to bring a \u00a7 2255 motion unless it does so expressly.\u201d). A sentence may be challenged independent of the conviction. <em>United States v. Barron, </em>172 F.3d 1153, 1158 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc) (\u201cAs a practical matter, the guilty plea to criminal acts can remain in force even as the sentence imposed upon an innocent act is set aside.\u201d). When the prisoner \u201cshould not have been convicted of th[e] crime,\u201d then neither the conviction nor the sentence is \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1159. Duarte\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument that while Duarte may be eligible for release from incarceration, his conviction would remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We agree with the district court that Duarte, who did not appeal his conviction or sentence, fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice. <em>See Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (When a defendant fails to appeal a claim, he may collaterally attack that claim if he first demonstrates either cause and prejudice or actual innocence). Instead Duarte argues that because of the change in the interpretation of his statute of conviction he is actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The district court erred by concluding that Duarte did not prove actual innocence. The record is inconclusive on this point. The only evidence of importation from another country was Duarte\u2019s admission in his plea agreement that he conspired to import heroin \u201cfrom California and elsewhere.\u201d The district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing to elucidate the meaning of \u201celsewhere.\u201d <em>United States v. Benboe, </em>157 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Bousley, </em>523 U.S. at 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604) (\u201cActual innocence can be established if the petitioner demonstrates that \u2018it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Latorre v. United States, </em>193 F.3d 1035, 1037, 1041 (8th Cir.1999) (remanding for an evidentiary hearing on petitioner\u2019s claim of actual innocence under <em>Bousley, </em>even though petitioner had explicitly waived his collateral-attack rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The district court also erred by requiring Duarte to show actual innocence of other charges the government could have brought. Requiring Duarte to show actual innocence of all possible crimes that the government might have been able to include in an indictment is more than the law requires. <em>See Benboe, </em>157 F.3d at 1184 (Petitioner must \u201cshow that he is actually innocent not only of the [ ] charge [of conviction], but also of any more serious charges dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">For the above reasons, we reverse and remand Duarte\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to the district court. Because Duarte has already served four years based on conduct that may not fall within the scope of \u00a7 952, an evidentiary hearing should be held as soon as practicable. If Duarte proves his actual innocence of conspiracy to import heroin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>under \u00a7 952, then the district court shall order his immediate release from prison. After the mandate in <em>Castillo </em>issues, the district court should also decide whether Duarte may challenge his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">REVERSED in part.
