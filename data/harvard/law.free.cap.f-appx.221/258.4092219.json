Cunningham now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-22\">On appeal, Cunningham asserts that the district court engaged in impermissible double counting by adding a two point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(5) to Cunningham\u2019s base offense level because the offense involved carjacking. Whether impermissible double counting occurred is a legal issue that is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Rohwedder, </em>243 F.3d 423, 426-27 (8th Cir.2001). Double counting is permissible under the sentencing guidelines except where it is expressly prohibited. <em>United States v. Reevey, </em>364 F.3d 151, 158 (4th Cir.2004)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-23\">In determining the offense level, the district court committed no double counting error by adding two levels pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1 (b)(5) (2004). <em>See United States v. Naves, </em>252 F.3d 1166 (11th Cir.2001). Cunningham has not otherwise shown that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-24\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>tions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
