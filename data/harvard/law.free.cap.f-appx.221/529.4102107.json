We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) (Nov. 1, 2004) for an \u201caltered or obliterated\u201d serial number, where the serial number was painted over, but the paint was removable by applying acetone. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>421 F.3d 909, 911 (9th Cir.2005). Shabazz concedes that the multiple layers of thick, black paint completely obscured the shotgun\u2019s serial number, making it unobservable to the naked eye. Shabazz contends, however, that he painted the shotgun not to render it untraceable, but rather to make it resemble another gun that he was unable to buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">The district court correctly applied the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) (Nov. 1 2004) two-level enhancement in accordance with our past decisions in <em>United States v. Romero-Martinez, </em>443 F.3d 1185 (9th Cir.2006), and <em>Carter, </em>421 F.3d 909, as well as the First Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Adams, </em>305 F.3d 30 (1st Cir.2002) (discussed and cited with approval in <em>Carter, </em>421 F.3d at 915-16). That the serial number was traceable after the police lab scrubbed the paint off with acetone is of no moment because, as we explained in <em>Carter, </em>\u201cthe ordinary meaning of the phrase \u2018altered or obliterated\u2019 cannot support the contention that a serial number must be rendered scientifically untraceable for \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) to apply.\u201d 421 F.3d at 911. Furthermore, it is inconsequential that the scientific process of applying the chemical solvent acetone is less complex and less difficult to undertake than the microscopy required in <em>Carter. </em>Whether the serial number was defaced through grinding, application of a copper patina, or painting, the result is the same \u2014 the serial number was rendered indiscernible to the naked eye and thus \u201c[wa]s materially changed in a way that makes accurate information less accessible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 916; <em>see also Adams, </em>305 F.3d at 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">Although Shabazz\u2019s actions may have been motivated purely by aesthetics, application of the enhancement remains appropriate. The commentary to the Guideline indicates that the enhancement applies without regard to a defendant\u2019s mental state. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) cmt. n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>16 (Nov. 1, 2004) (now U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) cmt. n. 8(B) (Nov. 1, 2006)); <em>Carter, </em>421 F.3d at 915 n. 2. Shabazz\u2019s actions materially changed the serial number \u201cin a way that makes accurate information less accessible.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>421 F.3d at 910. Thus, the district court correctly applied the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) two-level enhancement for an \u201caltered or obliterated\u201d serial number.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b558-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
