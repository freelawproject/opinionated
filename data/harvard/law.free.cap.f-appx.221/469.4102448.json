He alleged that, as permitted under state law, he submitted to the circuit court a document detailing criminal conduct by St. Louis County police officers, <em>see </em>Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 545.250 (private citizen with knowledge of commission of crime may file sworn affidavit \u201cwith the clerk of the court having jurisdiction of the offense, for the use of the prosecuting attorney, or deposit it with the prosecuting attorney\u201d); that the clerk (acting in concert with the prosecutor) refused to \u201cprocess\u201d the document; and that this refusal violated his right of access to the courts. We conclude Chambers did not state a section 1983 claim, because the alleged actions did not violate his constitutional rights. <em>See West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988) (to state \u00a7 1983 claim, plaintiff must allege violation of right secured by Constitution or federal law). Specifically with regard to his aecess-tocourts claim, defendants\u2019 alleged actions did not prevent Chambers from asserting his rights in a lawsuit against the police officers who allegedly mistreated him, and Chambers did not allege the requisite actual injury from defendants\u2019 actions to state such a claim in any event. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-354, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (plaintiff must allege actual injury in access-to-courts claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\">. The Honorable Charles A.
