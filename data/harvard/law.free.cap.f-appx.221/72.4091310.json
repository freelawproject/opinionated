Vomacka denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>holding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Muan Li, </em>No. A75 Oil 438 (B.I.A. Apr. 27, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A75 Oil 438 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 17, 1999). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">When, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">As an initial matter, the record as a whole contradicts Li\u2019s assertion that the IJ made an ambiguous credibility determination. <em>Cf. Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 290 (2d Cir.2000). Furthermore, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by \u201cspecific examples in the record of [omissions or] inconsistent statements ... about matters material to [the applicant\u2019s] claim of persecution.\u201d Li\u2019s failure to include in his original asylum application any reference to his arrest and detention following a Catholic church service six months before he fled China is a substantial omission that \u201cinvolve[s] the heart of the asylum claim.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003) (citation omitted). It is well-settled that \u201comissions that go to [the] heart of an applicant\u2019s claim can form the basis for an adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Cheng Tong Wang v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 451, 453 (2d Cir.2006). Li offered two different explanations for this omission, but the IJ was not compelled to credit either of them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In addition, the IJ noted other inconsistencies between Li\u2019s testimony and the record, including Li\u2019s confusing testimony about his family\u2019s household registration booklet. Because the registration booklet was the major piece of evidence that Li was born in violation of China\u2019s planned birth policy and therefore lacked any legal status in China, the problems surrounding this document similarly \u201cinvolve[d] the heart of [his] asylum claim.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308 (citation omitted). Because the IJ properly considered the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of these and other inconsistencies in the record, the adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Li failed to establish past persecution due to his lack of credible testimony and was not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). Furthermore, as Li did not provide credible evidence of his religious beliefs or his membership in a particular social group, he has failed to show a subjective basis for a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). Moreover, because the only evidence of a threat to Li\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). In addition, the adverse credibility finding also undermines Li\u2019s CAT claim because he has not offered any legitimate factual basis to show a likelihood of torture apart from his asylum claim. <em>See Paul, </em>444 F.3d at 156; <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Finally, we find no error with respect to the BIA\u2019s treatment of the supplemental claim for CAT relief based on an illegal departure from China that Li filed in November 2004. The BIA properly construed this submission as a motion to remand as it presented new evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), (c)(4); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand is held to the substantive standard of review for motions to reopen and reconsider, i.e., abuse of discretion. <em>Li Yong Cao v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 151 (2d Cir.2005). Although Li asserts that the evidence he submitted made out a <em>prima facie </em>case for CAT relief based on his illegal departure, the BIA has discretion to deny a motion to remand \u201ceven if the party moving has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case for relief.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Furthermore, the BIA has not \u201cacted in an arbitrary or capricious manner,\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted), in denying Li\u2019s motion where: (1) Li offered no explanation as to why evidence of his illegal departure could not have been presented to the IJ during the merits hearing in 1999, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); (2) Li\u2019s only evidence that he departed China without authorization is his own assertion in a statement included with the November 2004 submission; and (3) Li did not demonstrate that someone in his \u201cparticular alleged circumstances\u201d is more likely than not to be tortured in China. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[I]mprisonment alone does not inherently constitute torture.\u201d); <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
