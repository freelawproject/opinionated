We vacate in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">I. <em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Severin pleaded guilty to two counts of a multi-count, multi-defendant indictment: (count one) conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute MDMA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, MDA, and marijuana, and (count seven) using a communications facility in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Severin also signed a lengthy factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">The probation officer prepared a presentence report (PSR) assigning Severin a base offense level of 28 based on the finding that his offense involved 500 tablets of MDMA and MDA \u2014 the equivalent of 625 kilograms of marijuana. The PSR recommended increasing Severin\u2019s offense level two levels based on his possession of a firearm during the commission of the offense, and decreasing it three levels for his acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 27. Combined with his criminal history category of III, that offense level produced a recommended sentencing guidelines range of 87 to 108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>months of imprisonment as to count one, and a 48-month term as to count seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">II. <em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We do not afford deference to the district court in the review of mathematical error in a sentencing guideline calculation. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Therefore, we would ordinarily review Severin\u2019s first claim of guideline application error <em>de novo. United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). Because Severin failed to object to the guideline application in the district court, however, we review his claim for plain error only. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, 15 </em>F.3d 408, 414-15 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Severin\u2019s other claims concern factual findings during sentencing. We normally review a court\u2019s factual findings during sentencing for clear error, unless the defendant fails to object, in which case the standard of review is plain error. <em>See United States v. Salado, </em>339 F.3d 285, 294 (5th Cir.2003)(citing <em>United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 189 (5th Cir.1994)); <em>Rodriguez, 15 </em>F.3d at 414-15; <em>see also United States v. Castillo, </em>430 F.3d 230, 242 (5th Cir.2005) (stating that if party fails to timely raise issue in district court, we generally \u201cwill review it for plain error unless the party made its position clear to the district court and to have objected would have been futile\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Severin contends that he objected to the firearm enhancement during sentencing when he personally testified that he used the rifle only for squirrel hunting, thereby making the district court aware of the issue. However, an imprecise objection such as Severin\u2019s, which offered no legal basis as to why the clarification was relevant, is insufficient to preserve the claimed error for review. <em>See United States v. Krout, </em>66 F.3d 1420, 1434 (5th Cir.1995). Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires a party opposing district court action to preserve a claim of error by informing the court of \u201cthe party\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s action and the grounds for that objection.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 51(b). Severin\u2019s statements to the court merely sought to clarify what sort of gun the rifle was.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Similarly, Severin did not object to the district court\u2019s criminal history calculation. The district court acknowledged that Severin\u2019s probation was not being revoked because the state probation officer believed that his participation in the conspiracy occurred prior to the commencement of his state probation. It does not follow, however, that the court was therefore on notice of any objection by Severin to the enhancement. Severin objected to neither the weapon enhancement nor the criminal history calculation, and there is no indication that an objection would have been futile. We therefore review both issues for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Under plain error review, Severin must show (1) that an error occurred, (2) that the error was plain, which means \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious,\u201d and (3) that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631-32, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if ... the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">A. The Drug Quantity Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Severin admitted in the factual basis that his offense involved 500 pills of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>MDA and MDMA, which according to the drug equivalency table is the equivalent of 62.5 kilograms of marijuana, and produces a base offense level of 22. The PSR erroneously indicated, however, that Severin\u2019s 500 pills were the equivalent of 625 kilograms of marijuana, resulting in a base level of 28. After considering the other sentencing adjustments, the sentencing range for Severin should have been 46 to 57 months of imprisonment as to count one, and 46 to 48 months imprisonment as to count seven. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A., Sentencing Table. Instead, because of the calculation error, Severin\u2019s sentencing range was 87-108 months as to count one, and 48 months as to count seven. He was sentenced, within that range, to 90 months and 48 months respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The government concedes that Severin\u2019s sentence should be remanded to correct the mathematical error. Indeed, the error occurred, was obvious, and affected both Severin\u2019s substantial rights as well as the fairness of the judicial proceedings. We therefore exercise our discretion and vacate and remand as to the calculation error.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">B. The Firearm Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The sentencing guidelines provide that a defendant\u2019s sentence should be increased by two levels whenever, in a crime involving the manufacture, import, export, trafficking, or possession of drugs, the defendant possessed a dangerous weapon. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); <em>United States v. Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d 545, 559 (5th Cir.1996). In order to apply this enhancement, \u201c[t]he government has the burden of proof ... of showing by a preponderance of the evidence \u2018that a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 245 (5th Cir.2001)(quoting <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>161 F.3d 909, 912 (5th Cir.1998)). \u201cUnder this standard, the government must show that \u2018the weapon was found in the same location where drugs or drug paraphernalia are stored or where part of the transaction occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 770 (5th Cir.1993)). A defendant\u2019s simple possession of a firearm at a point in time during which a conspiracy is in progress is not sufficient to apply the enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The PSR adopted by the district court indicated that federal agents seized a total of five firearms from three individuals, including the seizure of a .22 caliber rifle from Severin. The district court properly adopted the facts contained in the PSR without further review, given that there was an adequate evidentiary basis and the defendant failed to present rebuttal evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 239. Nevertheless, the facts in the PSR do not establish that Severin possessed a firearm within the contemplation of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Severin\u2019s attorney acknowledged during the sentencing hearing that the rifle was found in Severin\u2019s home, but nothing in the PSR, factual basis, indictment, or hearing testimony suggested that drugs were stored in the home or that drug transactions took place there. Rather than establishing the requisite temporal and spatial relation between Severin\u2019s rifle and the drug activity, the district court relied on Severin\u2019s admission that the rifle was \u201cavailable\u201d to him during the conspiracy had he needed it. Availability, however, does not constitute both temporal and spatial relation. A gun may be \u201cavailable\u201d because of temporal proximity, even in the absence of spatial proximity, but temporal proximity alone is not sufficient for the application of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). <em>See Cooper, </em>274 F.3d at 246 (reversing for lack of spatial proximity). While additional facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>might exist that would establish temporal and spatial relation, those facts were not made available to the district court. Rather, given Severin\u2019s claims that the rifle was for hunting squirrels, the established facts of this case are more similar to the guidelines\u2019 example of firearm possession that would not support an enhancement: \u201can unloaded hunting rifle in the closet.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The government argues that even if no temporal or spatial relation existed between Severin\u2019s rifle and the drug conspiracy, Severin can be held accountable for the firearms that were seized from his co-conspirators. The government is correct that \u201cone co-conspirator may ordinarily be assessed a \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) increase in view of another co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a firearm during the drug conspiracy so long as use of the weapon was reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>United States v. Mergerson, 4 </em>F.3d 337, 350 (5th Cir.1993) (citation omitted). The district court did not apply the enhancement on the basis of the co-conspirators, however, and thus made no findings as to foreseeability. Furthermore, without additional evidence, an enhancement based on the co-conspirators\u2019 firearm possession succumbs to the same lack of temporal and spatial relation as the enhancement based on Severin\u2019s rifle. The record does not indicate where the co-conspirators\u2019 weapons were found and does not establish that they were found in the same location where drugs or drug paraphernalia was stored, or where part of the transaction occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Severin satisfies the first two elements of plain error review \u2014 error occurred, and it was obvious under this Court\u2019s precedent. As a result of the two-level enhancement, the district court sentenced Severin to a 90-month term of imprisonment, exceeding the 70-87 month guideline range for Severin\u2019s sentence in the absence of the enhancement. By virtue of that sentencing disparity, the error affected Severin\u2019s substantial rights and also affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. The district court plainly erred. However, inasmuch as no objection was made, upon resentencing, the district court may consider any additional evidence adduced by the parties bearing on the firearm issue. We therefore vacate and remand as to the firearm enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">C. The Criminal History Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Section 4Al.l(d) of the sentencing guidelines provides that the district court shall add two points to a defendant\u2019s criminal history score \u201cif the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation .... \u201d We have previously held that the \u00a7 4Al.l(d) enhancement \u201cis appropriate where a continuing offense begins before the offense for which the defendant is under a criminal justice sentence because a continuing offense, by its very nature, does not terminate until the date of the indictment or the voluntary termination of the illegal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Santana-Castellano, </em>74 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Conspiracy is a continuing offense. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1577 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Severin pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to possess with intent to distribute MDA and MDMA from prior to January 2003 until the indictment was issued on August 6, 2004. Furthermore, there is no evidence suggesting that Sevexin withdrew from the conspiracy at any time before the indictment was issued. Severin\u2019s state probation began on March 11, 2004, and he thus committed the conspiracy offense while on probation. The district court did not err by adding two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(d), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Severiris sentence as to the drug quantity calculation and firearm enhancement, AFFIRM as to the criminal history enhancement, and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
