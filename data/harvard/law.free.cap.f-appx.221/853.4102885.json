Petitioners argue that they are entitled to asylum because substantial evidence establishes that Lopez suffered past persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d), and has a well-founded fear of future persecution, based on her association with and membership in various political groups. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cexcept to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). To the extent the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we also review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision and expounded on its reasons for doing so, and, thus, this Court reviews both decisions. <em>Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 956. To the extent that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions were based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, meaning that we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s [and the IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, [this Court] must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (addressing withholding of removal under the INA).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to her home country or to avail herself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number><em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). \u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution, that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">With respect to political opinion, \u201c[t]he [immigration] statute protects against persecution not only by government forces but also by nongovernmental groups that the government cannot control.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). Thus, an applicant seeking asylum on account of persecution by a guerilla group must establish that the guerillas persecuted her, or will persecute her, on account of her actual or imputed political opinion, not the guerilla group\u2019s political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 437-38. Moreover, an asylum applicant may not show merely that she has a political opinion, but must show that she was persecuted because of that opinion or other protected status. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">\u201c[P]ersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation[.]\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citation omitted). There must be \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [the petitioner] will be singled out for persecution on account of [his political] opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247 1257-58 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision, as well as the IJ\u2019s finding, that Lopez did not establish past persecution based on her political opinion. First, the IJ made an adverse credibility determination as to Lopez\u2019s testimony based on inconsistencies between her asylum application, her addendum, and the supporting documentation. The IJ specified and explained the inconsistencies in his order. The IJ also found that Lopez\u2019s testimony was, in part, implausible and could have been supported by readily available corroborating evidence which Lopez did not present.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An adverse credibility determination <em>alone </em>can support the denial of asylum. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005); <em>D</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004). Moreover, the IJ found that Lopez\u2019s conduct, which included traveling to Spain and to the United States on numerous occasions but then returning to Colombia, was inconsistent with her claim of past persecution. <em>Cf. Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816-817 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn applicant's claim of persecution upon return is weakened, even undercut, when ... the applicant has returned to the country without incident.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Although Lopez testified that she received threats from 1996 until she left the country in 2002, the IJ found it to be \u201codd and implausible that the respondent would continue to receive threats over such an extended period of time and that they [alleged FARC members] basically always asked her for the same thing. They wanted her to participate with them and collaborate with them and speak for them and their philosophy.\u201d We have held that a petitioner does not satisfy her burden to show persecution, under the first prong of the test for past persecution, through evidence of harassment by the FARC based solely on a petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with the guerillas or to join their forces. <em>See Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438 (finding that petitioner\u2019s claim, based on harassment by FARC guerillas and petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with the guerrillas or to join them forces, did not establish persecution for purposes of withholding of removal under INA). The IJ described the instant case as \u201ca classic recruitment case.\u201d In short, the record does not compel a contrary conclusion as to past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Because Lopez did not establish past persecution, she was not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Substantial evidence supports the I J\u2019s conclusion that Lopez did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because she did not present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [s]he ... will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution,\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted), we are not compelled to conclude that she established a case for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution by the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">In sum, Petitioners have failed to establish that the record compels a finding that the FARC persecuted Lopez, or that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution by the FARC, because of her political opinion, rather than solely on account of her refusal to cooperate or join forces with the guerillas. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">. Because Petitioners did not appeal the denial of withholding of relief under the CAT, those claims are unexhausted and we lack jurisdiction to consider them and DISMISS the petition as to those claims. <em>See Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 n. 5 (11th Cir.2003). As for Petitioners\u2019 assertions of error based on the denial of withholding of removal, because we find that Petitioners have not established a case for asylum under the INA, we do not consider whether they satisfied the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-6\">. An IJ may require a petitioner to present corroborating evidence. The REAL ID Act of 2005 provides the following: \"No court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence ... unless the court finds ... that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.\u201d Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, \u00a7 101(e), 119 Stat. 231, 305 (2005). This provision is retroactively applicable to all cases in which the final administrative order was issued before, on, or after May 11, 2005, the effective date of the REAL ID Act, and thus, it applies to the instant petition. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 101(h)(3), 119 Stat. at 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
