The administrative law judge found that although Conner has hypertension, elevated liver enzymes and hypercholesterolmia, she has no impairment, or combination of impairments, that results in more than a minimal effect on her ability to perform basic work-related activities. The ALJ noted that no medical evidence supported her complaints of pain in her back, neck and shoulders. The ALJ concluded that she does not have a severe impairment, and is not disabled. The Appeals Council denied review. Having carefully reviewed the record, this court finds that the Commissioner\u2019s final decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See Harris v. Barnhart, </em>356 F.3d 926, 928 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review); <em>Kelley v. Barnhart, </em>372 F.3d 958, 960 (8th Cir.2004) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-18\">Accordingly, as an opinion would have no precedential value, the judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-29\">. The Honorable William R.
