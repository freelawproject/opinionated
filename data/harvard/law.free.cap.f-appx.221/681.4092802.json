We review the denial of motions to reopen for abuse of discretion and we review due process claims de novo. <em>See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We grant in part, and deny in part, the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>The BIA erred by denying as untimely Tran\u2019s special motion to seek relief under former section \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(h) (establishing an April 26, 2005 deadline for such motions). The BIA\u2019s failure to address the motion to reopen as a special motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44 was an abuse of discretion and we remand for further proceedings. <em>See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Tran had not established ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir.2003) (no claim for ineffective assistance where an alien was unable to demonstrate both a deprivation of due process and resulting prejudice). Nothing in the record demonstrates that Tran was actually deprived of due process. <em>See Lopez v. INS, </em>775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1985) (ineffective assistance of counsel is a denial of due process \u201cif the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part and DENIED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b709-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
