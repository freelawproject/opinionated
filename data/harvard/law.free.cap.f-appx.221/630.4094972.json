We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Ibarra contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for a downward adjustment for minor role pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The record supports the district court\u2019s determination that Ibarra had not met his burden of showing that he was entitled to this adjustment. <em>See United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1282-83 (9th Cir.2006). Furthermore, we reject Ibarra\u2019s contention that the district court violated his right to due process by imposing a higher burden of proof because nothing in the record demonstrates that the district court held Ibarra to a higher burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Because we conclude that the district court took into account the appropriate sentencing factors, we reject Ibarra\u2019s contention that the sentence is unreasonable and that the district court unduly emphasized certain sentencing factors over others. We conclude that the ultimate sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2314, 164 L.Ed.2d 832 (2006). Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b658-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
