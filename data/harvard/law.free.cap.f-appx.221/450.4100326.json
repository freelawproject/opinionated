He alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>they violated the Eighth Amendment for years when they responded to his bunions with only \u201cconservative treatment\u201d rather than alternative treatments, like surgery, which he finally received in 2005. The medical directors at Dixon Correctional Center and Piekneyville Correctional Center, two institutions where Jones claims he received the inadequate treatment, and Health Professionals, Ltd., a corporation that contracted with the IDOC to provide healthcare services at IDOC facilities, settled with Jones. The district court granted summary judgment for the remaining defendants and Jones appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">According to the record evidence, along with all the reasonable inferences construed in Jones\u2019s favor, Jones suffered for ten years with bunions, a painful deformity of the bones and joint between the foot and the big toe. In 1998, while incarcerated at the Graham Correctional Center, an orthopedic surgeon evaluated his bunions and recommended surgery on his left foot. This doctor, an outside consultant to Graham, explained that standard orthopedic practice first treats bunions conservatively with shoe modification, bunion pads, or warm soaks. He added that \u201cthere\u2019s no hard and fast rule\u201d for when such conservative treatment should be abandoned for surgery. Consistent with this judgment, the medical director at Graham, who ultimately decided whether to order surgery, considered the consultant\u2019s recommendation but continued to treat Jones conservatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Over three years later, Jones was transferred to Dixon where defendant Jerry Sternes was the warden. Within a few months of his transfer, the medical director at Dixon examined his bunions and ordered special wide shoes to treat them. Jones, unsatisfied with this treatment, wrote to defendant Dr. Willard Elyea, who is the medical director of the IDOC, complaining about this medical care. Dr. Elyea never personally learned of Jones\u2019s condition because his staff screens the voluminous correspondence addressed to him, and they did not forward him any complaints regarding Jones. But in this litigation, Dr. Elyea described the treatments that Jones received for his bunions as \u201cstandard and acceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Jones then filed a grievance with the prison regarding his medical care. Defendant Doug Hoyle reviewed that grievance and denied it after examining Jones\u2019s medical records, which confirmed that he received special shoes and that several doctors had examined his bunions. Warden Sternes concurred with Hoyle, but he did not personally review the grievance because he delegated that task to others within his office. Jones appealed the decision, but defendant Terri Anderson of the Administrative Review Board denied the appeal. Jones also complained about his treatment to Donna Drew, who was the Health Care Administrator at Dixon and a registered nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">While Jones was receiving conservative treatment for his bunions, the Dixon medical director referred him to an orthopedic specialist in 2002, defendant Dr. Xaman Tulyasathien (an independent contractor who provided orthopedic services at Dixon). Dr. Tulyasathien examined Jones and recommended to the medical director at Dixon that he receive firm arch supports \u201cto correct the pronation of both feet\u201d and noted that \u201c[sjurgical correction may be considered.\u201d According to Jones, Dr. Tulyasathien informed him that \u201cif he was a patient of his on the street he would not hesitate to surgically correct\u201d his bunions but that the medical director and Dixon probably would avoid surgery to save money. Jones received the recommended arch supports to help alleviate the pain assoeiat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ed with his bunions but again remained dissatisfied with his medical care and attempted to notify Warden Sternes, Dr. Elyea, and Nurse Drew of this in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In February 2004 Jones was transferred from Dixon to Pickneyville and in June 2004 the medical director there examined his bunions and advised Jones to continue to wear his wide-toed shoes. That day Jones filed a grievance again alleging that his treatment was inadequate and ineffective. Dean Blades, a Grievance Officer at Pickneyville and a defendant in this case, denied Jones\u2019s grievance after determining that the medical director had examined him and recommended continued use of the wide-toed shoes. Defendant Melody Ford, a member of the Administrative Review Board, concurred and denied Jones\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Subsequently, Jones filed this suit. After successfully surviving motions to dismiss, Jones moved for appointment of counsel. The court denied this request, noting that based on Jones\u2019s filings, previous litigation experience, and the nature of this case, he was \u201cmore than competent\u201d to try his case without representation. While this litigation was pending, the medical director at the Illinois River Correctional Center (where Jones had been transferred in August 2004) referred Jones to a specialist who \u201csuggest[ed]\u201d surgery on both of his feet. The medical director followed the suggestion and in January 2005 Jones\u2019s bunions were surgically corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">After Jones received this surgery, all the defendants and Jones moved for summary judgment. The district court concluded that Jones presented sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the bunions were a serious medical need but that the defendants had not been deliberately indifferent to that need. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants and denied Jones\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Jones first argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to appoint counsel. An indigent civil litigant has no right to appointed counsel, but he can request that an attorney handle his case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). We review a district court\u2019s denial of such a request for an abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. Doughty, </em>433 F.3d 1001, 1006 (7th Cir.2006). The court does not abuse its discretion if it reasonably concludes that, given the nature of the case, the plaintiff appeared competent to try the case himself. <em>Id. </em>at 1006-07. At the time the court ruled on the motion for counsel, Jones had filed a coherent complaint that survived 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A screening and motions to dismiss, he evinced great familiarity with his medical condition, and he also had ably pursued earlier litigation. Because the district court reasonably concluded that Jones could competently present his case, the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied his request for appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">Jones also challenges the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the defendants. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Green v. Butler, </em>420 F.3d 689, 694 (7th Cir.2005). To succeed on an Eighth Amendment claim, the prisoner must demonstrate that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to a serious medical condition. <em>Forbes v. Edgar, </em>112 F.3d 262, 266 (7th Cir.1997). The defendants do not dispute that Jones\u2019s bunions constituted a serious medical condition. They maintain, however, that Jones failed to bring forward evidence from which a jury could determine that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his bunions. To establish deliberate indifference Jones must demonstrate that the prison official \u201c \u2018knows that inmates face a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants Hoyle, Blade, Anderson and Ford, the non-medical officers who considered his grievances or denied the appeals. We have previously emphasized that if \u201c \u2018a prisoner is under the care of medical experts ... a non-medical prison official will generally be justified in believing that the prisoner is in capable hands.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greeno v. Daley, </em>414 F.3d 645, 656 (7th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 236 (3d Cir.2004)) (granting summary judgment for grievance officer who reviewed complaint and verified that plaintiff was receiving treatment); <em>see also Perkins v. Lawson, </em>312 F.3d 872, 875-76 (7th Cir.2002). All four of these defendants, who lacked medical training, undisputably relied on the expertise of the medical directors when they concluded that Jones\u2019s grievance should be denied. Accordingly, they were not deliberately indifferent to Jones\u2019s bunions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment for Sternes, the warden at Dixon who had delegated medical and grievance functions to subordinates. As a non-medical defendant, Sternes too is not hable for reasonably relying on the medical judgment of professionals. In addition, we have repeatedly noted that liability under \u00a7 1983 arises only when a defendant is personally responsible for the deprivation of which the plaintiff complains. <em>See e.g., Johnson v. Snyder, </em>444 F.3d 579, 583 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Vance v. Peters, </em>97 F.3d 987, 991 (7th Cir.1996); <em>Gentry v. Duckworth, </em>65 F.3d 555, 561 (7th Cir.1995). To be personally liable for a subordinate\u2019s acts, a supervising official \u201c \u2018must know about the conduct and facilitate it, approve it, condone it, or turn a blind eye.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>444 F.3d at 583-84 (quoting <em>Gentry, </em>65 F.3d at 561). Although Jones mailed a complaint to Sternes and filed a grievance at Dixon describing his frustration with his treatment, there is no evidence that Sternes personally received or read these communications since he delegated the review of prisoner complaints to others within his office. For this reason too, summary judgment for Sternes was warranted. <em>Johnson, </em>444 F.3d at 584 (granting summary judgment since official presented evidence that he did not receive, review or decide plaintiffs grievance).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The court also properly granted Dr. Tulyasathien\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Dr. Tulyasathien told Jones that he would \u201cnot hesitate\u201d to recommend surgery if Jones were not in prison. But because the Dixon medical director would not likely approve surgery for economic reasons, Dr. Tulyasathien recommended only that Jones receive arch supports and that surgery should merely \u201cbe considered.\u201d From this, one could infer that Dr. Tulyasathien recommended conservative treatment not for medical reasons, but for economic ones. But the Eighth Amendment does not provide a right to a specific treatment. <em>Forbes, </em>112 F.3d at 267 (\u201c[The plaintiff] is not entitled to demand specific care. She is not entitled to the best care possible. She is entitled to reasonable measures to meet a substantial risk of serious harm to her.\u201d). Dr. Tulyasathien\u2019s preference for a less costly treatment is not deliberate indifference unless Jones has evidence that the recommendation for arch supports plus a suggestion to consider surgery \u201cwas so inadequate that it demonstrated an absence of professional judgment, that is, that no minimally competent professional would have so responded un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>der those circumstances.\u201d <em>Collignon v. Milwaukee County, </em>163 F.3d 982, 989 (7th Cir.1998). Jones\u2019s own evidence prevents him from showing this. The doctor who recommended surgery for Jones\u2019s left foot in 1998 explained that conservative treatment \u2014 like arch supports \u2014 is a medically recognized response to bunions and that there is no \u201chard and fast rule\u201d to determine when conservative treatment should be abandoned for surgical correction. Dr. Tulyasathien followed this conventional orthopedic practice; he recommended arch supports, and told the medical director at Dixon to consider surgery. Jones\u2019s contention that this treatment was ineffective and that Dr. Tulyasathien should have unequivocally recommended surgery might make out a negligence cause of action, but it does not make out an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>Id. </em>at 990; <em>Forbes, </em>112 F.3d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">Because Jones received constitutionally adequate care for his bunions, the court also properly entered summary judgment for Drew, the Health Care Unit Administrator at Dixon, and Dr. Elyea, the medical director of the IDOC. Even if, as Jones contends, Dr. Elyea and Drew knew about Jones\u2019s complaints about his bunions, there is no evidence that they regarded the medical care Jones was receiving to be devoid of professional judgment, as is required to establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Johnson, </em>444 F.3d at 583-84. To the contrary, Dr. Elyea regarded the conservative treatment as standard. Furthermore, both Drew and Elyea monitored the health care provided to inmates including Jones, and according to the medical records available to them, concluded that Jones received adequate, albeit conservative, treatment throughout his time at Dixon and Pickneyville.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
