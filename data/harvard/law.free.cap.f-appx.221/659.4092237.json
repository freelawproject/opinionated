See Fed.

Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 over the remaining claims. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1199 (9th Cir.2004). We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because it relied upon the omission of minor details, and upon minor inconsistencies in Zhang\u2019s testimony which he explained and which do not go to the heart of his claim. <em>See Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 911 (9th Cir.1996); <em>see also Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir.2003) (rejecting inconsistencies that were not material to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim); <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (concluding that there was no actual inconsistency between allegedly discrepant statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for further proceedings regarding Zhang\u2019s eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; and GRANTED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b687-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
