The BIA found that the motion was not timely filed pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-24\">Petitioner contends that the BIA should have exercised its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen the case, and the BIA\u2019s failure to do so violated petitioner\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-25\">Petitioner concedes that his motion to reopen was untimely. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen proceedings, and therefore do not consider petitioner\u2019s contention that the motion should have been granted despite its untimeliness. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>(9th Cir.2002). To the extent that petitioner contends that the BIA violated his constitutional rights by denying his motion to reopen, the contention is unavailing. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (explaining that the petitioner must show error to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
