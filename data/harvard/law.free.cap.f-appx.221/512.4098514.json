On appeal from summary judgment, she argues that (1) her right to due process was violated when one of the officers, Officer Nash, did not verify the existence of the restraining order she had taken out against a neighbor after police were called to investigate a physical altercation between Mathis, her neighbor, and her neighbor\u2019s daughters, and (2) the magistrate judge erred in concluding that Officer Nash had probable cause to arrest her.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Mathis did not raise a due process claim before the district court. As a general rule, we \u201cdo[] not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d <em>Dodd v. Hood River County, </em>59 F.3d 852, 863 (9th Cir.1995). We \u201cmay exercise discretion to review newly presented issues\u201d under certain circumstances, <em>Allen v. Ornoski, </em>435 F.3d 946, 960 (9th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Flores-Montano, </em>424 F.3d 1044, 1047 (9th Cir.2005)), but Mathis has not shown that any such circumstances exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">We reject Mathis\u2019s second contention as well. At the time Nash placed Mathis under arrest, he knew the following: (1) the radio dispatch reported that during an altercation, Mathis had stabbed her neighbor\u2019s daughter; (2) when Nash arrived at the scene, he saw that alleged victim had a puncture wound above her eye and was crying; (3) the alleged victim and her mother told Nash that the alleged victim\u2019s wound had been caused by Mathis;(4) when Nash approached Mathis, he heard her say that she didn\u2019t mean to stab anyone and hoped \u201cthe giri\u201d was okay; and (5) Mathis claimed to have a restraining order against the neighbor and her daughters. These facts, viewed together, are more than sufficient to lead a reasonably prudent person to believe that Mathis assaulted the alleged victim. Thus, Nash had probable cause to arrest Mathis. Even if Nash had confirmed that Mathis had a restraining order against the alleged victim\u2019s mother, or the alleged victim herself, he nonetheless would have had probable cause, as the restraining order would not have given Mathis the right to stab the alleged victim with impunity. Accordingly, the magistrate judge properly granted partial summary judgment to defendants with respect to Mathis\u2019s unlawful arrest claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b540-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
