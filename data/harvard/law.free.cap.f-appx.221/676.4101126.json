The IJ did not clearly err in finding that the agent did not stop petitioner solely because of his race and that two legitimate, non-racial factors motivated the agent\u2019s stop \u2014 petitioner appeared lost and was walking toward the Canadian border on a road frequented by undocumented aliens. <em>See United States v. Manzo-Jurado, </em>457 F.3d 928, 936 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Dias Juarez, </em>299 F.3d 1138, 1142 (9th Cir.2002). It is a close question whether these legitimate factors suffice to support reasonable suspicion, but, where such a question is close, there is no egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment warranting exclusion of the evidence in a civil deportation proceeding. <em>See Adamson v. Comm\u2019r, </em>745 F.2d 541, 546 (9th Cir.1984) (concluding that \u201cthe constitutional questions are close enough that a reasonably competent police officer could have believed that the search was legal\u201d and thus refusing to exclude evidence from a civil tax proceeding); <em>cf.
