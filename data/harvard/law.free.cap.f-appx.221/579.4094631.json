We deny the petition for review in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The record establishes that notice of Umana-Arevalo\u2019s November 1988 hearing was sent to her. Umana-Arevalo attended that hearing and, according to the IJ, received oral notice of her next hearing date. <em>See Matter of M-D-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 540, 542 (BIA 2002) (\u201cPrior to 1992, the Act provided only that \u2018the alien shall be given notice, reasonable under all the circumstances, of the nature of the charges against him and of the time and place at which the proceedings will be held.\u2019 \u201d (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) (1988))). The IJ\u2019s decision was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review Umana-Arevalo\u2019s unexhausted due process claim that the record should contain a transcript of her November 1988 hearing. <em>See Zara v.
