Palmer\u2019s adjusted total offense level of 19 and his criminal history category of IV yielded a guideline range of 46 to 57 months imprisonment. At sentencing, Palmer\u2019s attorney argued for a sentence below the advisory guidelines range<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> based on: (1) the age of Palmer\u2019s prior felony convictions (both of which occurred when he was 18-19 years old); (2) Palmer\u2019s poor health (diabetes and kidney failure); and (3) his interest in maintaining a relationship with his three children and the mother of his two youngest children. The district court sentenced Palmer to 46 months imprisonment\u2014the bottom of the guidelines range\u2014without any comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>on his arguments for a below-guidelines sentence or any mention of, or reference to, the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). Palmer\u2019s only argument on appeal is that the district court failed to adequately articulate its reasons for his sentence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cConsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in <em>[United States v.] Booker </em>[543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ] a district court shall first calculate (after making the appropriate findings of fact) the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. Next, the district court must consider this range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a) and impose a sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47 (citations omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">A <em>post-Booker </em>sentence may be unreasonable for procedural or substantive reasons. \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable, for example, if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons or fails to make a necessary factual finding.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.) (citations omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). While a district court must consider the various factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and explain its sentence, it need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. \u201cThis is particularly the case when the district court imposes a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">However, \u201ca district court\u2019s explanation should provide some indication (1) that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with respect to the particular defendant; and (2) that it has also considered the potentially meritorious arguments raised by both parties about sentencing.\u201d <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 380 (citations omitted). \u201c[I]n determining whether there has been an adequate explanation, [the court does] not evaluate a court\u2019s sentencing statements in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381. Rather, \u201c[t]he context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation may imbue it with enough content for [the court] to evaluate both whether the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether it did so properly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">On the record before us, we are unable to discern whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or whether it did so properly. Accordingly, we vacate Palmer\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in order to allow the district court to articulate its reasons in imposing sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-19\">. Palmer was sentenced after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\">. We note that the district court sentenced Palmer prior to our decisions in <em>Moreland, Johnson, </em>and <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>and thus did not have the benefit of the guidance provided by those cases. We further note that the district court is free on remand to impose the same sentence or a different one; nothing in this opinion should be read to suggest that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>have formed any view regarding the appropriate outcome of Palmer\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
