No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">At Hernandez\u2019s trial, the parties stipulated that 123 kilograms of marijuana had been seized in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Still, Hernandez requested that, if the jury found him guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, the jury should \u201cwrite in\u201d the drug quantity attributable to him on its verdict form. The parties ultimately agreed that the verdict form presented to the jury would first ask the jury to determine whether Hernandez was guilty or not guilty of the marijuana conspiracy charge. If the jury found Hernandez guilty of this charge, the verdict form then asked the jury to consider whether Hernandez conspired to distribute at least 100 kilograms of marijuana and, if he did, to place an \u201cX\u201d in the box next to that drug quantity on the verdict form. When the jury returned the verdict form to the district court, the jury checked \u201cguilty\u201d for the charge of marijuana conspiracy but left blank the box next to the listed drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The district court judge indicated that the jury might not have completed its verdict form. Hernandez objected to asking the jury members to reconsider the verdict form. The district court judge then asked the jury members to read through the verdict form and to let him know whether they answered all of the questions that were posed to them. After going back to the jury room, the jury returned with a verdict form that indicated Hernandez was guilty of the marijuana conspiracy charge and that contained an \u201cX\u201d next to the drug quantity \u2014 at least 100 kilograms of marijuana \u2014 listed on the verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">On appeal, Hernandez argues that the district court violated the Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy by returning the verdict form to the jury to review for completeness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review a possible double jeopardy violation <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> United States v. Thurston, </em>362 F.3d 1319, 1322 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment states that no person shall \u201cbe subject to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb,\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V; and it \u201cprotects a defendant in a criminal proceeding against multiple punishments or repeated prosecutions for the same offense.\u201d <em>Thurston, </em>362 F.3d at 1322 (internal quotation omitted). Therefore, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against (1) \u201ca second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal\u201d; (2) \u201ca second prosecution for the same offense after conviction\u201d; and (3) \u201cmultiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>U.S. 161, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Here, Hernandez was prosecuted only once for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana as charged in the indictment in this case. And he received only one punishment \u2014 a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 for that offense. We are not persuaded by Hernandez\u2019s argument that the district court judge violated the protection against double jeopardy when the judge asked the jury to consider if its verdict form was complete.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">. This stipulation was read to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">. In making this argument, Hernandez asserts that jeopardy attached when the jury first returned its verdict form to the judge. But in the context of a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when the jury is impaneled and sworn. <em>See United States v. Berroa, </em>374 F.3d 1053, 1057 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that \"jeopardy attaches before a jury returns its verdict\u201d); <em>United States v. Isom, </em>88 F.3d 920, 923 n. 8 (11th Cir.1996) (\"Jeopardy attaches when a jury is impaneled and sworn, or, in the case of a bench trial, when the court begins to receive evidence.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b900-11\">. Although Hernandez did not use the words \"double jeopardy\u201d when he objected to the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury about checking the completeness of its verdict form, Hernandez did object that it was improper to ask the jury to reconsider the verdict form after the jury had reached a verdict. We construe this argument as sufficient to preserve Hernandez's claim on appeal. And we note that the government has not asserted that Hernandez failed to preserve his double jeopardy claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b901-17\">. To the extent that Hernandez argues that the district court issued a directed verdict on the drug quantity attributable to him, we reject this claim as without merit. And we decline to order that Hernandez be resentenced because the district court calculated his Guidelines imprisonment range by using the base offense level for offenses involving at least 100 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
