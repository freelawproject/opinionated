For the reasons stated below, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-29\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-30\">Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties, we recite only those facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>necessary to our analysis. Petitioner is a native and citizen of Indonesia, of Chinese ethnicity, admitted to the United States on or about February 4, 2001, as a non-immigrant with authorization to remain until August 3, 2001. He remained beyond that date without permission from the U.S. On April 21, 2003, he was served with a Notice to Appear charging him with removability under Section 237(a)(1)(B) of the INA for remaining in the U.S. longer than permitted. Petitioner requested a grant of asylum, withholding of removal, and in the alternative, voluntary departure. Though protection under the CAT was not discussed by the Immigration Judge, the BIA noted its inapplicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Petitioner claims he was persecuted in Indonesia on account of his Christian Chinese identity and that he suffered harm in Indonesia in the form of three robberies by natives. One incident occurred in 1994, while he was in junior high school, when he was punched and his bike was stolen. The second incident occurred in 1998 when several Islamic school students tried to seize his motorbike and demanded money. The third incident occurred in 1999 when he was robbed at knife point, while on his motorbike. He also described being threatened at one point by a knife-wielding native Indonesian who seized his watch and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Petitioner recounted knowledge of rioting in Indonesia when ethnic Chinese were victimized. There were also reports of church bombings, which Petitioner contended instilled fear in him. Petitioner admitted that when he left Indonesia, he had no intention of returning to his native country. However, he failed to timely file for asylum and overstayed his visa by a year before filing. The IJ found that the country conditions in Indonesia had shown improvement in Chinese-Indonesian relations. Furthermore, Petitioner\u2019s fears of harm were discredited by the fact that his family members (mother and two brothers) remain in Indonesia unharmed. Thus, the IJ concluded that Petitioner failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he would be harmed if he returned to Indonesia on the basis of his ethnicity or his religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, finding Petitioner subject to removal as charged and denying his application for asylum as not timely filed. The BIA concluded that Petitioner\u2019s fear of returning to Indonesia lacked a nexus to any of the five bases for refugee status enumerated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). That opinion stated \u201c[t]he evidence does not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the respondent would be persecuted if he returns to Indonesia thereby making him ineligible for withholding of removal.\u201d The BIA\u2019s opinion also noted that Petitioner\u2019s fears were linked to mistreatment from criminals, not from any government or public official, hence protection under the CAT was not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Petitioner was granted the privilege of voluntary departure if he departed within the time period specified or any extensions granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The Court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of Petitioner\u2019s asylum application because the IJ determined it was not filed within the one-year limitations period. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir.2003). The Court does have jurisdiction to review the denial of Petitioner\u2019s claim for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. We review the BIA\u2019s decision and the IJ\u2019s decision, to the extent it was adopted by the BIA, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 150, 155 (3d Cir.2005). Factual determinations under the withholding of removal statute and the CAT should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>upheld if supported by \u201creasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d and should be overturned where the evidence \u201cis so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude\u201d as the IJ had. <em>Mulanga v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 123, 131 (3d Cir.2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">For withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), an alien must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability\u201d of persecution to avoid deportation. <em>Chang v. INS, </em>119 F.3d 1055, 1066 (3d Cir.1997). In other words, an alien must show it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that because of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), he will be subjected to \u201cthreats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u201d <em>Li Wu Lin v. INS, </em>238 F.3d 239, 244 (3d Cir.2001); <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993). For relief under the CAT, an alien must show that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Auguste v. Ridge, </em>395 F.3d 123, 151 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Petitioner contends that the IJ erred when she characterized the attacks against him and the police\u2019s failure to act as only \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d We have often stated that random incidents of violence are not persecution warranting withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See, e.g., Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 534, 536 (3d Cir.2005). Though Petitioner contends that the violent attacks against him, without protection or response from the police, were persecutory, he presented only verbal argument that failed to establish the acts were \u201con account of\u2019 his ethnicity. <em>Id. </em>at 535. Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Petitioner\u2019s assailants were petty thieves, motivated by money and not by one of the enumerated grounds. <em>Id. </em>Further, the record lacks any evidence that demonstrates that \u201cthe violence or <em>harm </em>perpetrated by civilians\u201d was \u201ccommitted by the government or forces that the government is either unable or unwilling to control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner had not sufficiently established that his life or freedom would be threatened upon removal to Indonesia. Accordingly, we will affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Further, Petitioner\u2019s claim under the CAT also must fail as there is no evidence in the record to compel the conclusion that it is more likely than not that Petitioner will be tortured if returned to Indonesia. Petitioner presented no evidence of government involvement in the assaults he suffered. There was no evidence to show that an Indonesian official knew or acquiesced in the attacks. Accordingly, we will deny the Petition for relief under the CAT as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
