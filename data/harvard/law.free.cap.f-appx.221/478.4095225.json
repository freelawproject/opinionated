Thompson appeals the 24-month prison sentence that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed after revoking his probation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-19\">Specifically, because the revocation sentence was within authorized limits and the district court considered appropriate factors in imposing it, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3565(a), we conclude that Thompson\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable, <em>see United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (revocation sentences are reviewed for unreasonableness in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)); <em>cf. United States v. Franklin, </em>397 F.3d 604, 606-07 (8th Cir.2005) (24-month revocation sentence, where Guidelines recommended 8-14 months, was not abuse of discretion where transcript showed court was aware of defendant\u2019s multiple violations of supervised-release conditions and of Guidelines range and statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-23\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-20\">.
