Burr terminating his status as a lawful permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d) and denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Claude Joseph, </em>No. A46 662 955 (B.I.A. July 17, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A46 662 955 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 22, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-18\">When the BIA adopts and affirms the decision of the IJ, then modifies and supplements that decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified and supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Questions of law, and application of law to fact, are reviewed <em>de novo. See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); see, <em>e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">A. <em>Abandonment of LPR Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1181(a), an immigrant must present a valid, unexpired visa and passport or other travel document in order to be admitted to the United States. If he fails to produce such documents, he is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). However, an LPR who is returning from a \u201ctemporary visit abroad,\u201d see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(A), may be readmitted without entry documents. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1181(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that the time Joseph spent in Haiti could not be considered a mere \u201ctemporary visit abroad,\u201d and that he therefore abandoned his LPR status and was inadmissible to the United States in February 2004. <em>See Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>286 F.3d 611, 612-13 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam). The relevant inquiry is whether, while he was abroad, Joseph intended to return to the United States within a relatively short period, \u201cnot whether he actually intended to abandon his status.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 613. Given Joseph\u2019s repeated statements that he had spent most of each year since acquiring LPR status in 1998 in Haiti, owned property and a bank account in Haiti but not in the United States, and earned his living as a doctor in Haiti, the IJ reasonably found that he did not have the requisite intent to return. Although most of Joseph\u2019s family lived in the United States, he stated at the airport interview and at his November 2004 hearing that when he arrived in February 2002, he intended to \u201cvisit\u201d them for only \u201cone week.\u201d Accordingly, Joseph could not be considered a \u201creturning resident,\u201d and we affirm the agency\u2019s determination that Joseph had abandoned his LPR status.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">B. <em>Asylum, Withholding, and CAT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Substantial evidence likewise supports the agency\u2019s denial of Joseph\u2019s asylum application. The IJ found Joseph not credible based on major discrepancies between his testimony at his April 2005 asylum hearing and his asylum application and airport interview. Specifically, Joseph stated for the first time at his hearing that (1) he had never intended to return to Haiti; (2) he had been working as a doctor for the police force since 1993 and not 2002, as he had previously claimed; and (3) \u201ca group\u201d tried to kidnap him from his car in January 2004. None of Joseph\u2019s explanations for these discrepancies were such that \u201ca reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony.\u201d <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003); <em>see also Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 396-97 (2d Cir. 2005) (noting that an IJ\u2019s reliance on an airport interview is appropriate so long as sufficient indicia of reliability are present).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Joseph also argues that his work for the former government\u2019s police force places him at risk of future violence. However, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that, under the circumstances here, there is not a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that Joseph will be targeted for violence. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Having failed to meet his burden of proof for asylum, Joseph necessarily failed to meet his burden of proof for withholding of removal. See <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155-56 (2d Cir.2006). Likewise, he failed to demonstrate that someone in his \u201cparticular alleged circumstances\u201d was more likely than not to be tortured. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\">. Although the IJ inaccurately described one aspect of the petitioner's testimony, <em>compare </em>JA-76 (IJ stating that the petitioner \"testified ... that he purchased a roundtrip ticket to come to the United States ... because it is the practice in Haiti ... if you do not belong to the place where you were going\u201d), <em>with </em>JA-134 (petitioner testifying that \u201cThey don\u2019t sell you a one-way ticket if you don\u2019t belong to a certain political (indiscernable)\u201d), the petitioner does not challenge this aspect of the IJ\u2019s decision and, in any event, it would not require remand because \u201cwe can confidently predict that the IJ would necessarily reach the same result absent [the] error[].\u201d <em>Cao He Lin, </em>428 F.3d at 394.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
