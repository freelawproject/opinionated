(CSXT), alleging violations of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51 <em>et seq. </em>(West 1986 &amp; Supp.2006). CSXT filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the district court. Finding no error in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-21\">CSXT is a class one railroad engaged in interstate commerce. Mettle was employed in CSXT\u2019s signal department for approximately thirty-six years. Mettle alleged that he was injured on December 28, 2004, while working as a signal maintainer in North East, Maryland. His job required him to inspect and repair the railroad signal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-22\">On the day in question, which was characterized as rainy and wet, a CSXT dispatcher called Mettle to report a problem at the Harbison Walker Intermediate Signal. Mettle was informed that a \u201ctrack circuit pumping\u201d problem existed, which meant that the track was indicating it was occupied even though there was no train in the area. (J.A. at 56-57.) At approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>mately 11:00 a.m., Mettle went to the problem location and determined that a number of \u201crail slivers\u201d were shorting the track. Mettle explained that \u201crail slivers\u201d are caused \u201c[tjhrough train movement and the shifting, especially in curves.\u201d (J.A. at 59.) The train \u201capplies a lot of friction on [the] rail and will actually wear the rail down, the size on the head, so metal slivers come off in all different sizes and widths, but most of them are kind of thin.\u201d (J.A. at 59-60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Mettle was able to successfully remove the problematic slivers. He then decided to test the track to determine if he had fixed the problem. To test the track, he squatted down and leaned forward to take a track reading with a volt meter. At that point, Mettle\u2019s right foot slipped off the railroad tie. He was able to regain his balance, but in doing so, Mettle alleged that he was forced to awkwardly twist his body. Mettle worked the remainder of his shift, but was forced to seek medical attention a few days later because of back pains. He believes that it was the above-described twisting motion that injured his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On April 21, 2005, Mettle filed suit against CSXT in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The case was later transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Mettle\u2019s theory of the case was that CSXT\u2019s negligence caused, at least in part, his injuries, in violation of FELA. Specifically, he claimed that CSXT was negligent in allowing mud and rail slivers to accumulate between the rails, and that this negligence proximately caused his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">On May 18, 2006, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of CSXT. The district court found that Mettle had made \u201cnothing more than conclusory assertions as to [CSXT\u2019s] alleged negligence.\u201d (J.A. at 229.) The district court noted that in support of his negligence claim, Mettle had offered only his unsupported opinions that an unacceptable amount of mud and slivers were at the accident site, and Mettle failed to offer any evidence showing that the conditions at the track were unsafe. Thus, even accepting his statements as true, the district court found that Mettle failed to put forth evidence explaining that CSXT had a duty to remove mud and slivers from the tracks for safety reasons and had failed in exercising such a duty. Relying on <em>Hurley v. Patapsco &amp; Back Rivers R.R. Co., </em>888 F.2d 327 (4th Cir.1989) (per curiam), the court found that Mettle\u2019s assertions were insufficient to meet his burden of proving CSXT\u2019s negligence and that \u201cabsent speculation, a jury could not conclude that [Mettle] slipped because of the mud and not because of the rain, which [Mettle] described as a \u2018heavy downpour.\u2019 \u201d (J.A. at 231); <em>see Hurley, </em>888 F.2d at 329 (affirming directed verdict in favor of railroad because the plaintiffs evidence was such that \u201cthe jury could have reached a verdict in his favor only by speculating\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Moreover, the court found that even assuming Mettle could show negligence on the part of CSXT, he could not show the existence of a \u201ccausal connection between the presence of either the mud or slivers and [Mettle\u2019s] misfortune of injuring his back,\u201d (J.A. at 231), in part because Mettle had admitted that CSXT \u201cwould not have wanted him to do anything unsafe, that he had the freedom to stay in his truck if he believed the conditions outside were unsafe, he did not need anyone\u2019s approval to temporarily refrain from working, and ... he thought it was safe to perform the track reading,\u201d (J.A. at 233.) In other words, the court found that Mettle\u2019s actions were the sole proximate cause of his injury. <em>See Hurley, </em>888 F.2d at 330 (\u201cGiven the evidence presented, the district court properly concluded that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>... was the sole proximate cause of the accident.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On June 6, 2006, Mettle timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 (West 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to CSXT. <em>See, e.g., Laber v. Harvey, </em>438 F.3d 404, 415 (4th Cir.2006) (en banc). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We must construe the facts in the light most favorable to Mettle, and we may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Edell &amp; Assoc., P.C. v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, </em>264 F.3d 424, 435 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">We have reviewed the record, briefs, and applicable case law on this matter. Our careful review persuades us that the district court\u2019s ruling was correct. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Mettle v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>CM No. WMN-05-1285, 2006 WL 1881569 (D.Md. May 18, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
