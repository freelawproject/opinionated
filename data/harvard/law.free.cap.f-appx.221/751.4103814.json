R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">Appellant Nabor Martinez-Villa pled guilty to one count of reentry of a deported alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). He now appeals his sentence, contending it is unreasonable when viewed under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors because of his medical problems and advanced age. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">I. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">After Mr. Martinez-Villa pled guilty, the probation officer prepared a presentence report calculating Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s sentence under the applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). The probation officer set his base offense level at eight pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), increased his base level sixteen levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) due to a prior felony conviction for a drug trafficking offense, and reduced his offense level by three levels for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of twenty-one. The presentence report also set Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s criminal history category at III, which, together with an offense level of twenty-one, resulted in a Guidelines sentencing range of forty-six to fifty-seven months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"Asg\">Mr. Martinez-Villa filed a formal written objection to the presentence report requesting a \u201cdeparture\u201d from the forty-six-to fifty-seven-month Guidelines range based on his advanced age and poor health. In support, Mr. Martinez-Villa pointed out he is sixty-seven years old and his health is deteriorating, given he: 1) suffers from diabetes which is not under control; 2) is blind in his right eye, has diminished vision in his left eye, and experiences tearing and sensitivity to light in both eyes; 3) suffers from severe head<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>aches requiring him to he down; 4) has a chronic, significant and uncontrollable cough which causes a choking sensation and may be related to tuberculosis; 5) previously had surgery for varicose veins; and 6) has very little mobility due to these combined health issues. He further claimed a forty-six- to fifty-seven-month sentence would be inappropriate because of: 1) his medical problems, which would prevent him from committing future crimes; 2) his unemployability; and 8) the mitigating circumstance under which he illegally returned to the United States, which involved repairing his home in Kansas after its burglary. While he acknowledged one factor alone might not warrant a below-Guidelines-range sentence, he suggested the combination of these factors did warrant a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The government responded, explaining no compelling grounds for a downward departure existed, given Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s thirty-year history of making the arduous trip back and forth between the United States and Mexico despite his claim of medical problems and that his alleged medical problems are common and do not take him outside the heartland of criminal defendants. The probation officer responded by pointing out that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.1 states age is not ordinarily relevant unless the defendant is infirm and home confinement might be equally efficient and less costly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also explained that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4, physical condition is not ordinarily relevant for a departure unless an extraordinary physical impairment exists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The probation officer then concluded he did not believe Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s described medical conditions or age rose to the level of an \u201cextraordinary physical impairment,\u201d made him a \u201cseriously infirm defendant,\u201d or would exclude him from the heartland of other cases. To illustrate his point, the probation officer noted Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s age and alleged medical impairments did not keep him from operating a motor vehicle when he was stopped in connection with the instant offense or otherwise prevent him from maintaining his mobility in the community of Liberal, Kansas, where his house is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">At sentencing, Mr. Martinez-Villa renewed the same departure request and the district court judge responded by first expressly restating Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s arguments in support of such a request, noting his claims of poor health, including his allegations of diabetes; blindness in the right eye; difficulty seeing with the left eye; light sensitivity; bad headaches; chronic cough; and a lack of mobility, causing him not to be a re-offend threat. The district court then orally recited the policy statements in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.1 and \u00a7 5H1.4 and found Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s medical conditions did not rise to the level of \u201cextraordinary\u201d for the purpose of granting a departure. The district court also determined Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s claim of limited mobility was incredible and inconsistent because he recently operated a motor vehicle and was able to return to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>United States after his deportation two years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">After Mr. Martinezr-Villa stated he had no other objections to the presentence report, the district court applied the relevant Guidelines range of forty-six to fifty-seven months and sentenced Mr. Martinez-Villa to forty-six months imprisonment followed by two years supervised release. In so doing, it stated it considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the advisory Guidelines range and that a sentence at the low end of that range would serve the purpose of incapacitating and punishing Mr. Martinez-Villa for a period of time, and the supervised release would allow his reintegration into the community as well as a deterrence from subsequent criminal behavior if he is ever lawfully released in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">On appeal, Mr. Martinez-Villa argues the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward below the applicable Guidelines range due to his combined serious medical problems and advanced age was \u201cunreasonable\u201d under the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). While Mr. Martinez-Villa acknowledges the Guidelines range was correctly calculated, he contends the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors warrant a below-Guidelines sentence and that the forty-six-month sentence is unreasonable. In support, Mr. Martinez-Villa outlines the various medical ailments previously raised and addressed by the district court, and contends it did not consider them \u201cin combination with each other, but rather, independently from each other.\u201d In addition, he suggests the district court erroneously failed to consider his age as a factor, given it did not explicitly mention his age in its decision. Finally, Mr. Martinez-Villa does not reference either U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.1 or \u00a7 5H1.4, which' he previously raised in support of his request for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">The government opposes the appeal. It points out Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s medical problems are undocumented and the district court found his immobility claims incredible, given the uncontested facts he was able to drive a car and could travel from Mexico to the United States, which the record shows he did for the purpose of making repairs to his house. As to the age issue, the government points out the district court judge sentencing Mr. Martinez-Villa was ninety-nine years old, or thirty-two years older than Mr. Martinez-Villa, which implies he considered Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s age and alleged infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">We begin our discussion by clarifying that a sentence above or below the recommended Guidelines range based on an application of Chapters Four or Five of the Guidelines is referred to as a \u201cdeparture,\u201d while a sentence above or below the recommended Guidelines range through application of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is called a \u201cvariance.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>United States v. Atencio, </em>476 F.3d 1099, 1101 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007) (en banc request denied). Thus, on appeal, it is evident Mr. Martinez-Villa is now claiming his sentence is unreasonable under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and a variance should be applied for a below-Guidelines-range sentence. He bases his claim on the same health and age issues he previously raised to support his downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.1 and 5H1.4. While Mr. Martinez-Villa did not previously frame his objections expressly in the context of a variance under \u00a7 3553(a), we do not require a defendant to make such an objection in order to preserve a claim his sentence is unreasonably long under those factors. <em>See United States v. Torres-Duenas, </em>461 F.3d 1178, 1183 (10th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert filed </em>(Nov. 22, 2006) (No. 06-7990). Instead, we review for reasonableness the sentence\u2019s length, as guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">We have determined a presumption of reasonableness attaches to a sentence, like here, which is within the correctly-calculated Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1053-54 (10th Cir.2006) <em>(per curiam). </em>We require reasonableness in two respects \u2014 \u201cthe length of the sentence, as well as the method by which the sentence was calculated,\u201d the latter of which Mr. Martinez-Villa does not contest. <em>Id. </em>at 1055 (emphasis omitted). If the district court \u201cproperly considers the relevant Guidelines range and sentences the defendant within that range, the sentence is presumptively reasonable,\u201d but \u201c[t]he defendant may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the other sentencing factors laid out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether the district court properly considered the applicable Guidelines range, we review its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">We have held \u201c[tjhere is no question that, in addition to guiding our reasonableness review on appeal, the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) must be considered by the district court itself when imposing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d 1109, 1115 (10th Cir.2006). Where, as here, the district court allows a defendant to make an argument that any of these factors warrant a below-Guidelines-range sentence and then imposes a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range, we have said this \u201cmay fairly be read as a functional rejection of [his] arguments and a denial of his request for a below-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When addressing a district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201c[w]e do not require a ritualistic incantation to establish consideration of a legal issue, nor do we demand that the district court recite any magic words to show us that it fulfilled its responsibility to be mindful of the factors that Congress has instructed it to consider.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Flores, </em>444 F.3d 1218, 1222 (10th Cir.2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jul. 7, 2006) (No. 06-5217). While \u201cwe will not demand that the district court recite any magic words\u201d to support its conclusions, neither will we \u201cpresume the district court weighed a party\u2019s arguments in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors where the record provides no indication that it did so and no clear explanation of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d at 1115-16 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">[W]here a defendant has raised a non-frivolous argument that the \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>factors warrant a below-Guidelines sentence and has expressly requested such a sentence, we must be able to discern from the record that the sentencing judge did not rest on the guidelines alone, but considered whether the guidelines sentence actually conforms, in the circumstances, to the statutory factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acz\"><em>Id. </em>at 1117 (quotation marks, alterations and citation omitted). However, \u201c[w]hen the defendant has not raised any substantial contentions concerning non-Guidelines \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the district court imposes a sentence within the Guidelines range, our post <em>-Booker </em>precedents do not require the court to explain on the record how the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the sentence.\u201d <em>Lopez-Flores, </em>444 F.3d at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">With these principles in mind, we note the district court in this case explicitly considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and did so in conjunction with the mitigating age and health circumstances described by Mr. Martinez-Villa. Thus, the record provides a clear \u201cindication\u201d it considered the requisite factors, together with Mr. Martinez-Villa\u2019s health and age arguments, for a below-Guidelines-range sentence. <em>See Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d at 1115-16. In addition, when the district court imposed a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range, it was \u201ca functional rejection of [his] arguments,\u201d including his advanced age and poor health, and therefore, it constituted a \u201cdenial of his request for a below-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1115. Moreover, as previously stated, \u201c[w]hen the defendant has not raised any substantial contentions concerning non-Guidelines \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the district court imposes a sentence within the Guidelines range, our post <em>-Booker </em>precedents do not require the court to explain on the record how the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the sentence.\u201d <em>Lopez-Flores, </em>444 F.3d at 1222. Finally, because the district court properly considered the relevant Guidelines range and sentenced Mr. Martinez-Villa within that range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable and he clearly has not rebutted this presumption by demonstrating the sentence is unreasonable in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Kristl, </em>437 F.3d at 1055. In other words, he has not shown his age and health, when viewed in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, are sufficiently compelling to transform his presumptively reasonable sentence into an unreasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">III.
