We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">Because Rivera did not file his section 2255 motion until almost three years after the date his conviction became final, the district court properly denied the motion as untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see also United States v. Schwartz, </em>274 F.3d 1220, 1222-23 (9th Cir.2001). Although Rivera contends that the limitations period should be equitably tolled due to his limited knowledge of English and the lack of Spanish-language materials in the prison law library, this contention is waived because Rivera did not raise it in district court. <em>See Allen v. Ornoski, </em>435 F.3d 946, 960 (9th Cir.2006). The district court properly rejected his contention that the limitations period began on the date the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>423 F.3d 1119, 1120 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1181, 163 L.Ed.2d 1138 (2006) (concluding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-20\">Because we conclude Rivera\u2019s section 2255 motion was untimely, we decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>reach his ineffective assistance of counsel contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">To the extent Rivera raises uncertified issues, we construe such argument as a motion to expand the Certificate of Appealability, and we deny the motion. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22 \u2014 1(e); <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
