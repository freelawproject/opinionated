Cuellar argues that the IJ and BIA erred by finding her testimony not to be credible. We deny her petition. When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the decision of the IJ. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201c[We] must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cA credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">To qualify for asylum, an alien must establish by a preponderance of the evidence either (1) past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must establish that if returned to her country, she more likely than not would be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). An alien applying for relief under the Convention Against Torture must prove \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">Cuellar admits that the BIA and IJ expressly found her testimony incredible but argues that this finding was not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree. \u201c[T]he [BIA] must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding ... [but] the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. The BIA found several inconsistencies between Cuellar\u2019s asylum application, her interview with the asylum officer, and her testimony before the IJ. Cuellar admitted, for example, that, in her interview with an asylum officer, she had falsely testified that the FARC harassed her family because they would not give the FARC a percentage of their harvest. Cuellar did not mention these demands in her asylum application, and Cuellar later expressly denied that the FARC ever wanted to tax her farm. This and other inconsistencies provide substantial evidence in support of an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">Cuellar argues that, regardless of the adverse credibility determination, her oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>er evidence establishes her eligibility for asylum or withholding or removal. Again, we disagree. Aside from her incredible testimony, Cuellar submitted no evidence that she suffered persecution based on a protected ground. Cuellar also introduced no evidence that she would be targeted for having participated in political activities upon her return to Colombia. Because Cuellar did not meet the standard for establishing a well-founded fear of future persecution for asylum eligibility, she failed to satisfy the more difficult standard for withholding of removal under the INA or CAT. <em>See Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Cuellar\u2019s petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
