Casablanca pled guilty to aiding and abetting the distribution of 1.07 grams of cocaine and was sentenced to four months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. After being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>released from incarceration, Casablanca began his supervised release in community confinement. After a hearing on the matter, the district court revoked Casablanca\u2019s supervised release because he failed to follow the rules of his community confinement center, which was a condition of his supervised release. The court sentenced Casablanca to ten months of incarceration to be followed by twenty-six months of supervised release. Casablanca appeals, arguing that the district court erred by revoking his supervised release. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to revoke Casablanca\u2019s supervised release. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992) (stating review standard). The record reveals that Casablanca had adequate notice that a condition of his supervised release was to abide by the community confinement center\u2019s rules and that he violated those rules, resulting in a violation of his supervised release. Accordingly, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
