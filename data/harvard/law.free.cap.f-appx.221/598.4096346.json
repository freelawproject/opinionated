We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Zentmyer contends that the judgment against him is invalid because the underlying indictment failed to establish jurisdiction. A review of the record establishes that the indictment properly alleged violations of federal law over which the district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231; <em>United States v. Studley, </em>783 F.2d 934, 937 (9th Cir.1986). We reject Zentmyer\u2019s contention that because his motion was not \u201csufficiently answered\u201d by the government with \u201cproof at the constitutional level,\u201d the district court erred by denying his \u201cparol challenge\u201d to jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Zentmyer further contends that the indictment was insufficient regarding the tax evasion and structuring charges. We conclude that the indictment sufficiently plead the elements of each offense. <em>See United States v. Lindberg, </em>220 F.3d 1120, 1122 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Boone, </em>951 F.2d 1526, 1542 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Finally, Zentmyer contends that he was prejudiced because the counts in the indictment were improperly joined. We conclude that the counts were properly joined because they involved overlapping evidence and were related to a common scheme. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a); <em>United States v. Portac, </em>869 F.2d 1288, 1294 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b627-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
