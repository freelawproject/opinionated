See <em>United States v. Pe\u00f1a-Hernandez, </em>146 Fed.Appx. 499 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (unpublished). In his present appeal, defendant\u2019s sole argument is that the government\u2019s refusal to give him another opportunity for a safety-valve debriefing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before his resentencing requires that the case be remanded for such a debriefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-16\">That argument is barred by the law of the case doctrine, under which \u201cavailable claims of error not raised in an initial appeal may not be raised during subsequent appeals in the same case.\u201d <em>United States v. Moran, </em>393 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2004) (emphasis omitted). Although that doctrine is subject to exceptions, <em>see United States v. Bell, </em>988 F.2d 247, 250-51 (1st Cir.1993), none of those exceptions applies here. Having not argued in the district court or in his first appeal that the government had a duty to offer him a third debriefing opportunity before his original sentencing \u2014 although he clearly had an incentive to do so at those times \u2014 the law of the case doctrine precludes him from making this argument in the present appeal. <em>Moran, </em>393 F.3d at 11; <em>see also United States v. Ticchiarelli, </em>171 F.3d 24, 28-29 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-17\">Even on resentencing, while defendant repeatedly stated his willingness to undergo another debriefing, he never argued that the government was obligated to accept his offer. Accordingly, even if that argument was not waived under the law of the case doctrine, it was forfeited and is therefore renewable only for plain error. <em>See generally United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-18\">It is hardly \u201cplain\u201d that the government has a duty to give a defendant multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>opportunities for a safety-valve debriefing. To the contrary, \u201cthe government has a right to expect that a defendant who seeks the boon of the safety valve will make a clean breast of things; it has no obligation to interview him repeatedly in an effort to pry loose additional nuggets of information.\u201d <em>United States v. Matos, </em>328 F.3d 34, 41-42 (1st Cir.2003). Even assuming\u2014 without deciding \u2014 that a defendant may satisfy his disclosure obligations after his original sentencing but before his resentencing, <em>but cf. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5) (requiring that such disclosures be made \u201cnot later than the time of the <em>sentencing </em>hearing\u201d (emphasis added)), defendant certainly had no right to a debriefing once the resentencing hearing had begun, <em>Matos, </em>328 F.3d at 39. Nor is this a case where a defendant\u2019s entitlement to a further debriefing opportunity can be derived from a plea agreement; there was no such agreement here. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 42 (stating that this court would not allow the government to \u201cplay cat and mouse with defendants\u201d with respect to the government\u2019s obligations under plea agreements).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Moreover, even if the district court had plainly erred in failing to require the government to give defendant a further debriefing opportunity and defendant was prejudiced thereby, its failure to do so would not satisfy the remaining prong of plain error review. Under the circumstances of this case, the lack of such an opportunity did not constitute a miscarriage of justice. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Accordingly, the sentence is <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.0(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-14\">. Before his original sentencing hearing, defendant was given two opportunities for a safety-valve debriefing, but, on both occasions, he refused to provide any information or to clarify the statements made at his post-arrest interview. The government made clear at that time that it did not intend to offer defendant a third such opportunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
