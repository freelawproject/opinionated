Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005). We also lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that the evidence that petitioner submitted with her motion to reopen would not alter its prior discretionary determination that petitioner failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 600 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Although we retain jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s constitutional claim, <em>Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir.2003), we reject her challenge to the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedures because that claim is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v.
