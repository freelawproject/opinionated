Tennant and Charles R. Richards (\u201cAppellants\u201d) seek to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, granting Southeastern Publishing Company, Inc., summary judgment and dismissing it from Appellants\u2019 civil action. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Appellants seek to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. In the absence of an \u201cexpress determination\u201d by the district court that there is no just reason for delayed appellate review of the award of summary judgment in Southeastern\u2019s favor, review of the district court\u2019s order must await the disposition of all claims against all parties. Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
