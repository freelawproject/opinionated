Despite this determination, the IJ discussed the merits of Hassan\u2019s application, finding that he had not suffered past persecution and did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-24\">The REAL ID Act of 2005, codified in relevant part at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) and (D), permits judicial review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2) where there is a claim of a constitutional violation or question of law. Absent such a claim, however, we lack jurisdiction to review the determination that an asylum application was barred as untimely filed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (\u201c[n]o court shall have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>diction to review any determination of the Attorney General under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2) ]\u201d); <em>Ibarra-Terrazas v. Gonzales, </em>461 F.3d 1046, 1048 (8th Cir.2006) (finding jurisdiction to review questions of law); <em>Ming Ming Wijono v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 868, 871 (8th Cir.2006) (recognizing that jurisdiction does exist to address constitutional claims); <em>Talego v. Gonzales, </em>452 F.3d 763, 766 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201cthis court lacks jurisdiction to review either the IJ\u2019s determination that the asylum application was not timely filed or the Attorney General\u2019s decision rejecting the applicant\u2019s complaint of changed circumstances\u201d). Here, Hassan contends that the IJ erred in determining that he had not established changed circumstances because Hassan mistakenly believed that he had a longer employment visa than had been granted. Such is a discretionary decision, and we lack jurisdiction to review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">With respect to Hassan\u2019s request for withholding of removal and CAT relief, Hassan faded to present evidence of past persecution and no reasonable factfinder would be bound to find that Hassan had a well-founded fear of future persecution or that Hassan would be more likely than not intentionally subjected to torture. Hassan argues on appeal that in 1994 he was threatened with death if he refused to join the Ba\u2019ath Party, however the IJ found that the only credible threat Hassan received was loss of his lecturing job at the University. A thorough review of Hassan\u2019s testimony before the IJ supports this finding, and there is no substantial evidence in the record that would support a reasonable fear of future persecution or torture. <em>See Ming Ming Wijono, </em>439 F.3d at 872, 874 (8th Cir.2006) (applicant seeking withholding of removal had burden to show clear probability of persecution; to overcome substantial-evidence review standard, applicant must show that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find requisite probability of persecution; independent analysis of CAT claim is not required if it was based upon same factual basis as withholding-of-removal claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Hassan\u2019s remaining claim, that the IJ failed to consider whether it was impractical or inadvisable to remove Hassan due to the lack of a central functioning government, was not raised before the BIA and is unreviewable by this court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies ____\u201d); <em>Frango v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 726, 728 (8th Cir.2006) (\u00a7 1252(d)(1) requires that alien not only pursue all stages of administrative review, but also raise all issues before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The petition for review is denied. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
