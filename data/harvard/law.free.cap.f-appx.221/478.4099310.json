Pursuant to a plea agreement, Plooster pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine within 1,000 feet of a school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, 860, possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine within 1,000 feet of a school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 860, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The plea agreement specifically acknowledged that Plooster was subject to enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Nearly nine months after entering his guilty plea but before he was sentenced, Plooster filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(d), based on the following reasons: (1) his attorney ineffectively represented him in a number of respects; (2) the attorney-client relationship between Plooster and his attorney had broken down prior to his guilty plea; and (3) he was not aware that a notice of an enhanced sentence, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, had been filed against him until after he had pled guilty. The district court held a hearing and denied the motion in a 21-page order. Plooster argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">We review the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. </em>Ramirez-<em>Hernandez, </em>449 F.3d 824, 826 (8th Cir. 2006). Pursuant to Rule 11(d), a guilty plea may be withdrawn before sentencing if the defendant can show a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for doing so. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Mugan, </em>441 F.3d 622, 630-31 (8th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 191, 166 L.Ed.2d 157 (2006). \u201cWhile the standard is liberal, the defendant has no automatic right to withdraw a plea.\u201d <em>Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>449 F.3d at 826. Having carefully reviewed the record, the applicable legal authorities and the thorough and well-reasoned order of the district court, we agree with the district court that Plooster did not establish a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawing his guilty plea. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision and affirm its judgment. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-11\">.
