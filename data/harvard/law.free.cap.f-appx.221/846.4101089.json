Also, he alleges that he demonstrated a well founded fear of persecution should he return to Burkina Faso, because (1) the military was searching for him and came to his home; (2) the government has a poor human rights record; (3) individuals with whom Kabore claims a connection were murdered; and (4) that Kabore is a member of an opposition party.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">Where the BIA affirms and adopts the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, as in this case, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final agency action subject to review. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the IJ\u2019s findings of fact under the \u201csubstantial evidence test,\u201d and must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). As is the case with all factual determinations, assessments of credibility are also reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Id. </em>Under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, we \u201cconsider only whether there is substantial evidence for the findings made by the [IJ], <em>not </em>whether there is substantial evidence for some <em>other </em>finding that could have been ... made.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1029 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]e review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision,\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286 (internal quotation marks omitted), and may not overturn findings of fact unless the record compels it, <em>id. </em>at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">To establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, an applicant must offer \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (internal quotation marks omitted). If found to be credible, the testimony of an applicant is alone sufficient to establish the required burden of proof; however, a specific and cogent adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application. <em>Id.; see also Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (requiring that the IJ make an explicit finding that petitioner was not credible). The applicant may rebut an adverse credibility finding on appeal with proof that \u201cthe IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. If an applicant supplies evidence other than his testimony, the IJ may not rely solely on an adverse credibility determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">Upon review of the record, it is apparent that the decision rendered by the IJ and adopted in full by the BIA contained an adverse credibility finding that was supported by specific, cogent reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>and based on substantial evidence. The IJ explicitly determined that Kabore was not credible regarding the identity of his best Mend, the name of the political party to which he belonged, the date when the military came to his home, and the date he arrived in the United States. Substantial evidence confirms that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">On both direct and cross examination Kabore provided inconsistent testimony about his best Mend who was killed by the president\u2019s brother. Kabore initially testified that his best Mend, Norbert Zongo (\u201cZongo\u201d), was a chauffeur, but when asked whether Zongo was really the journalist investigating the murder of the chauffeur, Kabore changed his testimony and stated that Zongo was a journalist and his best Mend, the chauffeur, was named Ouangaua. He repeated the same mistake during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Kabore also mistook the name of the political party to which he claimed membership, testifying that the party\u2019s acronym, ADF, stood for Democratic Association of Popular Funds or, depending on the translation, Democratic Association of Popular Fronts. According to the State Department\u2019s Background Notes, the name of the party is the Alliance for Democracy Federation. Considering that Kabore based his petition on the death of his Mend and his membership in the opposition political party, these inconsistencies are material to his credibility. Kabore also repeatedly mistook the years in which the military came to his house, he left his country, and arrived in the United States. These omissions constitute substantial evidence in support of the adverse credibility finding of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Kabore argues that because the IJ found that his inconsistent testimony regarding dates was without malice, such misstatements should not impact his credibility. However, Kabore overstates the significance of the IJ\u2019s statements. First, we do not require a finding that the applicant maliciously testified inconsistently to support an adverse credibility finding. Second, the IJ\u2019s statements regarded only the inconsistent dates that Kabore provided, not the other inconsistencies in his testimony. Thus, the IJ\u2019s statements do not undermine the adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Kabore concedes that he failed to demonstrate past persecution, but argues that he presented sufficient evidence to support a well-founded fear of future persecution. However, Kabore did not provide any evidence that he would be singled out on account of his political opinion or any other protected grounds if he returned to Burkina Faso. Kabore argued that he was afraid to return to his native country because of the death of his Mend, the chauffeur; but, the chauffeur was killed because the president\u2019s brother believed that he stole a suitcase full of money, and not because of any political opinion or other protected ground. Thus, substantial evidence corroborates the IJ\u2019s decision to deny asylum to Kabore.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">Because an adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence, and because Kabore did not provide corroborating evidence that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground, we will not disturb the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision denying Kabore asylum, withholding of remov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>al, and protection under the CAT. Accordingly, we deny Kabore\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-6\">. Since Kabore has not satisfied his burden to prove that he is entitled to asylum, \"we also deny his petition for review of his claims for withholding of removal under the INA and for CAT relief.\u201d <em>Zheng </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
