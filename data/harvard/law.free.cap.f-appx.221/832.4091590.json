Rasheed, a <em>pro se </em>Georgia prisoner convicted of armed robbery, aggravated assault, and false imprisonment and serving a 25-year term of imprisonment, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus. In his petition, Rasheed asserted, among other things, the following claims: (1) that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for armed robbery; and (2) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the indictment, to investigate the backgrounds of a state witness and the victims, and to move for a mistrial or renew Rasheed\u2019s motion for a severance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>court denied habeas relief. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo, </em>and the district court\u2019s underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). In reviewing a state court\u2019s decision denying habeas relief, a federal court is <em>prohibited </em>from granting habeas relief unless the state decision was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the United States Supreme Court,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Moreover, factual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct, and a habeas petitioner can rebut them only by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if either \u201c(1) the state court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by Supreme Court case law, or (2) when faced with materially indistinguishable facts, the state court arrived at a result different from that reached in a Supreme Court case.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001). An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law may occur if the state court \u201cidentifies the correct legal rule from Supreme Court case law but unreasonably applies that rule to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn unreasonable application may also occur if a state court unreasonably extends, or unreasonably declines to extend, a legal principle from Supreme Court case law to a new context.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">First, Rasheed argues that there was inadequate evidence to support his conviction for armed robbery. The Supreme</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Court has held, in the context of a state prisoner\u2019s habeas challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, that the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original), <em>overruled on other grounds by Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). The Court noted that it is the duty of the trier of fact \u201cto resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d and stressed that a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment as to whether it believes the evidence to be sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>Id. </em>In weighing the sufficiency of the evidence, the evidence need not rule out <em>every </em>hypothesis except that of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Martin v. Alabama, </em>730 F.2d 721, 724 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">In Georgia, the elements of armed robbery are (1) intent to commit a theft; (2) taking property of another from a person or the immediate presence of another; and (3) the use of an offensive weapon to accomplish the taking. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-8-41. At Rasheed\u2019s trial, the state presented testimony that co-defendant Vetena Garr took property from the immediate presence of the victims by the use of an offensive weapon, within the meaning of \u00a7 16-8-41. There was also testimony that Garr acted with Rasheed\u2019s encouragement and went along with the robbery because she (Garr) feared that Rasheed would kill or hurt her if she did not comply. Moreover, Rasheed testified that he was present during the robbery, and admitted in a state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>merit that he shared in the proceeds of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence was not contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. The state court specifically cited to the controlling Supreme Court precedent on such a claim and applied the standard in reaching its decision. The evidence in this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, demonstrates that a rational juror could have found Rasheed guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of armed robbery, under Georgia law. Accordingly, the state courts\u2019 analysis was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, the principles of <em>Jackson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Turning to Rasheed\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we review <em>de novo </em>a determination that a habeas claim was procedurally defaulted. <em>Brownlee v. Haley, </em>306 F.3d 1043, 1058 (11th Cir.2002). We also review mixed questions of law and fact, including ineffective-assistanee-ofcounsel claims, <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The clearly established law on ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims is set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in which the Supreme Court established a two-prong test for adjudicating such claims. First, a petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The proper measure of performance is \u201creasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel is \u201cstrongly presumed\u201d to have rendered adequate assistance and to have exercised reasonable professional judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel\u2019s performanee is deficient if counsel made errors so egregious that he was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Second, a movant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>To prove prejudice, a movant must show that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">Here, the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis of Rasheed\u2019s ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel claim based on trial counsel\u2019s alleged failure to investigate was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, the well-established law of <em>Strickland. </em>The state court identified the correct standard and applied it to the factual findings, which were not clearly erroneous and, indeed, <em>were fully </em>supported by the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing on Rasheed\u2019s motion for a new trial. The Georgia court found that Rasheed\u2019s trial counsel had made a tactical decision concerning the scope of his investigation into whether the scene of the armed robbery \u2014 a food mart \u2014 was, in actuality, a drug dealing establishment. Counsel testified that such a theory was inconsistent with Rasheed\u2019s theory of defense, which was that Rasheed had no connection to the robbery other than merely being present. Thus, the Georgia court concluded Rasheed had not satisfied his burden on the performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>ineffective-assistance test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>This conclusion was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Likewise, the denial of Rasheed\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to move for a mistrial or renew a motion for a severance was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland. </em>During the hearing on Rasheed\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court specifically stated that had counsel moved for a mistrial, it would not have granted the motion. Moreover, the Georgia Court of Appeals noted that if such a motion had been filed, and denied, such a ruling would not have been disturbed on appeal. Thus, trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient under <em>Strickland </em>\u2014 the filing of a mistrial motion, or a motion for severance, would have been futile and thus, counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue this course of action was not deficient under <em>Strickland. </em>For the same reasons, Rasheed has failed to show prejudice as to this claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. We discern no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the state courts\u2019 analysis of Rasheed's ineffective-assistance-of-appeZZaiecounsel claims was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. To the extent Rasheed raises claims that he did not assert in the district court \u2014 including the assertion that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to quash the original indictment, and that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise an ineffective-assistance claim against his trial counsel for not challenging the indictment \u2014 we will not consider them for the first time here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">. Given Rasheed\u2019s failure to satisfy the first prong, the state court was not required to consider the second prong. <em>See Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000). We observe, however, that the court concluded that Rasheed\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim based on trial counsel\u2019s investigation also failed on the prejudice prong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-8\">. With respect to Rasheed\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim for failure to file a renewed motion for a severance, the Georgia Court of Appeals concluded that Rasheed had waived this claim by not raising it on direct appeal. The existence of an adequate and independent state ground for denial of the claim procedurally bars this Court's review. <em>See Upshaw </em>v. <em>Singletary, </em>70 F.3d 576, 579 (11th Cir.1995). Moreover, Rasheed has not shown cause for the default and actual prejudice, nor has he established a fundamental miscarriage of justice sufficient to excuse the default.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
