Appellee alleges that said words constitute a predominant and distinguishing feature of said mark. Registration of this mark is also alleged, the registration being No. 80,703. It is further alleged that the descriptive significance, if any, of the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d became lost, due to long use by appellee, whereby a secondary meaning arose indicating origin of the goods to which the mark is applied in appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-24\">Appellant\u2019s answer to the petition for cancellation denies all of its allegations except as to the issuance of said registration No 80,703, and as to said registration denies that it was duly registered, and alleges that it is invalid and ineffective in so far as it may purport to be a registration of the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-25\">Both parties took testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-26\">It appears that said registration No. 80,-703 was granted to appellee on January 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>1911, under the ten-year clause of the TradeMark Act of February 20,1905 (15 USCA \u00a7 <em>85). </em>The mark, as shown in said registration, consists of the words \u201cW. H. Bull\u2019s\u201d at the top, beneath which are the words \u201cHerbs and,\u201d and between these words and the word \u201cIron\u201d is a faneif\u00fcl picture containing many features:</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">The goods to which the respective marks are applied are clearly of the same descriptive properties and are so conceded to be by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d are descriptive in a primary sense, but that, since appellee\u2019s registration was granted under the ten-year clause of section 5 of said Trade-Mark Act (15 USCA \u00a7 85), its mark must be given the effect, both for the purpose of registration and in determining the. question of the likelihood of confusion, of a valid trade-mark. The Commissioner expressly found that appellee\u2019s registration was duly made and was valid, and held that the two marks were confusingly similar, thus affirming the decision of the Examiner of Interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">It is apparent from the decision of the Commissioner that he regarded the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d as the essential feature of appellee\u2019s mark, and for that reason held that the marks were confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">We think the Commissioner erred in holding that the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d are the essential or dominant feature of appellee\u2019s mark. In appellee\u2019s application, upon which the registration was issued, it is stated that it adopted the mark \u201cfor a medicinal preparation made from herbs and iron.\u201d We think it apparent that these words were used in the mark solely to describe t\u2018he goods, and that the essential and dominant features of the mark were the name \u201cW. H. Bull\u2019s\u201d and the pictorial representation. We may say, in passing, that the words \u201cTrade Mark\u201d are found in the oval containing the picture and above the word \u201cIron.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">The testimony shows that appellee manufactures a number of medicines in addition to \u201cW. H. Bull\u2019s Herbs and Iron,\u201d among them \u201cBull\u2019s Liver Pills\u201d and \u201cBull\u2019s Oil Liniment.\u201d If the contention of appellee is well founded, as held by the tribunals of the Patent Office, if appellee could establish ten years\u2019 exclusive use of \u201cBull\u2019s Liver Pills\u201d and \u201cBull\u2019s Oil Liniment\u201d prior to February 20, 1905, it could Secure a monopoly of the words \u201cLiver Pills\u201d as a mark for medicine in pill form for liver diseases, and of the words \u201cOil Liniment\u201d for any liniment containing oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">We have carefully examined the voluminous testimony in the ease, and it is clearly established that appellee never made a trademark use of the words \u201cHerbs and Iron,\u201d standing alone, but its trade-mark use was always the words \u201cW. H. Bull\u2019s Herbs and Iron,\u201d either with or without the pictorial representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">Furthermore, we think the evidence clearly shows that purchasers did not rely upon the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d as indicating origin of the goods. The testimony fairly establishes that retail customers ordinarily called for either \u201cBull\u2019s Herbs and Iron\u201d or \u201cSpicer\u2019s <em>Nux </em>Herbs and Iron.\u201d The testimony shows that appellee\u2019s representative went to a number of drug stores and called for \u201cHerbs and Iron.\u201d In some instances he Avas sold \u201cSpicer\u2019s Nux Herbs and Iron,\u201d in others he was asked if he wanted \u201cSpicer\u2019s Herbs and Iron,\u201d and in one instance he was asked whether he desired \u201cSpicer\u2019s\u201d or \u201cBull\u2019s\u201d Herbs and Iron. It is the contention of appellee that this testimony shows confusion, and that, because there was a greater profit to the druggist in selling \u201cSpic-er\u2019s Nux Herbs and Iron\u201d than in selling \u201cW. H. Bull\u2019s Herbs and Iron,\u201d druggists would palm off appellant\u2019s goods for those of appellee. We think, hoAvever, that this does not constitute any proof of palming off or of deception. When a customer asked for a medicine as \u201cHerbs and Iron,\u201d the druggist would understand him to make the inquiry in a descriptive sense, and the natural inquiry, where the druggist handled more than one such preparation, would he whether the customer desired \u201cBull\u2019s\u201d or \u201cSpicer\u2019s\u201d or some \u2019other preparation of herbs and iron, of which there were a number on the market when the testimony herein was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">We are of the opinion that appellee\u2019s mark must be considered as a whole, and, so regarding it, there is no confusing similarity between it and the mark of appellant, and that the Commissioner of Patents erred in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">Appellee further contends that, regardless of any statutory right it may have by virtue of its registration, the testimony shows that it has established a secondary meaning of the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d entitling it to the exclusive use of those words, and that appellant has not the right to use them in a descriptive sense or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">It should be noted that appellant claims no exclusive right to the words \u201cHerbs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Iron\u201d apart from its mark, and has expressly disclaimed such words in its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">It is clear that appellant uses the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d in their primary and not in any secondary sense, and that, whether or not appellee has established a secondary meaning of said words, appellant can not be deprived of their use in a primary sense, provided he uses them in a way that is not deceptive to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The Commissioner, in his decision, quoted at length from the opinion in the ease of Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids, 233 U. S. 461, 34 S. Ct. 648, 651, 58 L. Ed. 1046, to the point that a registration under said ten-year elause is a valid trade-mark, which point we do not controvert. That ease involved the registration under said ten-year elause by Thaddeus Davids Company of the name \u201cDavids\u201d used upon ink. The defendants used the name \u201cC. I. Davids\u201d in a similar manner upon the same kind of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">The court there did not hold that such registration of the word \u201cDavids\u201d under said ten-year clause gave the complainant the exclusive right to that word. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-7\">\u201c * * * It is not to be supposed that Congress intended to prevent one from using his own name in trade, or from making appropriate reference to the town or city in which his place of business is located; and we do not find it necessary to consider the question of the validity of such an attempt if one were made. Congress has admitted to registration the names or terms belonging to the class under consideration simply because of their prior use as trademarks, although they had not been such in law. Their exclusive use as trademarks for the stated period was deemed, in the judgment of Congress, asuffieient assurance that they had acquired a secondary meaning as the designation of the origin or ownership of the merchandise to which they were affixed. And it was manifestly in this limited character only that they received statutory recognition, and, on registration, became entitled to protection under the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-8\">\u201cIn the ease, therefore, of marks consisting of names or terms having a double significance, and being susceptible' of legitimate uses with respect to their primary sense, the reproduction, copy, or imitation which constitutes infringement must be such as is calculated to mislead th:e public with respect to the origin or ownership of the goods, and thus to invade the right of the registrant to the use of the name or term as a designation of Ms merchandise. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">In this case, the court did not prevent the defendant from using the word \u201cDavids\u201d as applied to ink, but enjoined it from so using the name as to simulate complainant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"AP7\">We think it is well established by the above and other cases that\u00a1 even where a secondary meaning of a word is established, others have the right to use such word in its primary sense, provided it is so used as not to lead the public to believe that it is purchasing the goods of one who has established such secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">In the ease of Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co., 179 U. S. 665, 21 S. Ct. 270, 275, 45 L. Ed. 365, the court, after reviewing a number of cases upon the subject of secondary meaning of a descriptive mark, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-11\">\u201cThese and like cases do not sustain the proposition that words wMeh in their primary signification give notice of a general fact, and may be used for that purpose by every one, can lawfully be withdrawn from common use in that sense; but they illustrate the adequacy of the protection from imposition and fraud in respect of a secondary signification afforded by the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-12\">\u201cIn the instance of a lawfully registered trade-mark, the fact of its use by another creates a cause of action. In the instance of the use in bad faith of a sign not in itself susceptible of being a valid trademark, but so employed as to have acquired a secondary meaning, the whole matter lies in pais.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">The ease of Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Co. v. Quaker Oats Co., 235 F. 657, decided by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, is similar in many respects to the case at bar. It involved the right of the Kellogg Company to the exclusive use of the words \u201cToasted Com Flakes.\u201d There, as here, the descriptive words alone had never been used as a trade-mark, and the court held that the word \u201cKellogg\u2019s\u201d could not be dissociated from the words \u201cToasted Corn Flakes,\u201d and a meaning given to said words which had never been relied'upon by .the Kellogg Company. The law as to secondary meaning of marks was also fully discussed, and it was held that, where a manufacturer establishes in a descriptive word a secondary meaning, as indicating his goods, he is entitled as against another to only such protection as will prevent such oth\u00e9r from using that term to pass off his goods as those of the original appropriator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">The case of Maatschappij Tot Exploitatie Van Rademaker\u2019s Koninklijke Cacao <em>&amp; </em>Chocoladefadrieken v. Kosloff et al., 45 F.(2d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>94, 96, 6 U. S. Pat. Quart. 133, decided by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, involved the marks \u201cRademaker\u2019s Hopjes\u201d and \u201cFrank Rademaker\u2019s Hopjes,\u201d \u201chopjes\u201d being the Dutch word for a species of candy. Plaintiff had registered under the ten-year clause of said Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, the words \u201cRademaker\u2019s Hopjes,\u201d which registration was sustained by this court in the case of Maatschappij, etc., v. Rademaker, 41 F.(2d) 406, 17 C. C. P. A. 1260. The Circuit Court of Appeals expressly concurred with said conclusion of this court, and further held that a secondary meaning had been established of the words \u201cRademaker\u2019s Hopjes.\u201d The court said: \u201cClearly plaintiff had and has no exclusive right to the Dutch word \u2018Hopjes.\u2019 It has not used that word alone, to indicate the origin of a speeies of candy; it has always coupled it with \u2018Rademaker.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">It further held that Frank Rademaker, for whom the defendant was the agent, had the right to call his product \u201cFrank Rademaker\u2019s Hopjes,\u201d provided, in so doing, he made it clear that they were his own and not plaintiff\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">It is unnecessary to cite further authority upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Appellant\u2019s use of the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d is in their primary sense. The reeord clearly shows that it relies upon the word \u201cSpicer\u2019s\u201d to indicate origin of its goods and not the words \u201cHerbs and Iron,\u201d and that in its advertising and labels it emphasizes the word \u201cSpicer\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Therefore, while we do not believe that the evidence establishes a secondary meaning of the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d as indicating origin of appellee\u2019s product, even were it otherwise, appellant is using the words in their primary and not their secondary sense, in a proper way. We may say, in passing, that much of appellee\u2019s testimony as to a secondary meaning of the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d is to the effect that customers often ordered from appellee its product under the words \u201cHerbs and Iron.\u201d We do not think such testimony tends to establish a secondary meaning, because, when orders were given to appellee for \u201cHerbs and Iron,\u201d it was naturally understood that \u201cW. H. Bull\u2019s Herbs and Iron\u201d was meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">In view of the conclusion we have reached, it is unnecessary to consider the contention by appellant that appellee\u2019s registration is invalid, or whether such question could properly be considered by us in this proceeding. We hold that the petition of appellee should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1007-12\">BLAND, Associate Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A34\">(specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">I agree with the conclusion of the majority that confusion is not likely to result between the trade-mark \u201cW. H. Bull\u2019s Herbs and Iron,\u201d associated with an elaborate pictorial representation and appellant\u2019s registration \u201cSpicer\u2019s Nux Herbs and Iron,\u201d the word \u201cSpicer\u2019s\u201d appearing as a facsimile signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">I am not'convinced that the phrase \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d is not the \u201cdominant feature\u201d of appellant\u2019s mark, and, in my view, this consideration is not important to the decision of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">Although appellee registered, under the ten-year clause, its mark containing the words \u201cHerbs and Iron,\u201d and although the term is presumed to have acquired a secondary meaning, it is not the exclusive property of the registrant to the extent that registrant can prevent any one else from using the term if the other, in using same, so uses it as to avoid confusion of origin. Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids, 233 U. S. 461, 34 S. Ct. 648, 58 L. Ed. 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-16\">Irrespective of which is the dominating part of appellee\u2019s mark, appellant, under the circumstances of this case, has no right to use this part of appellee\u2019s valid trade-mark, which is presumed to acquire a secondary meaning, without including in its mark other matters which are sufficient, to make confusion in origin improbable. This, I think, appellant has done, and I therefore specially concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
