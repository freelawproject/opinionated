Commissioner of Patents affirmed that of the Examiner of TradeMarks, denying the registration sought, because of the trade-mark \u201cJack Frost,\u201d registered to F. B. Chamberlain Company September 18, 1928, for \u201cconcentrated extracts and syrups for making nonalcoholic, malt-less beverages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Appeal was then taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">It appears from the record in the case that at one time appellant sought to register the words \u201cOrang\u00e9 Frost\u201d for use on some of its products, and this was opposed by Chamberlain &amp; Co. on account of its ownership of \u201cJack Frost.\u201d The Commissioner of Patents sustained the opposition, and after his decision the Commissioner remanded the \u201cLe:gion Frost\u201d application to the Examiner, after the latter named mark had been ordered to publication, for reconsideration in the light of the \u201cOrange Frost\u201d decision, and, upon this reconsideration, the Examiner refused the registration, largely or wholly upon the \u201cOrange Frost\u201d holding, and the Assistant Commissioner, who passed upon this ease on appeal, did the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">The issue before us is, first, whether the goods are of the same descriptive properties; and, if so, second, whether the marks are so similar as to be likely to cause confusion. It is also proper to consider whether the mark, or any portion thereof, is descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">The extracts and syrups upon which the \u201cJack Frost\u201d mark is applied are used for flavoring drinks which are dispensed at fountains, commonly referred to as soda fountains. As we understand from the record, applicant uses the mark \u201cLemon Frost\u201d for drinks which have been prepared and probably bottled. These drinks are largely sold at the same places of business and at the same fountains. There can be no question but that, under the doctrine of numerous decisions of this court, the goods must be held to be of the same descriptive properties. Revere Sugar Refinery v. Joseph G. Salvato, 48 F.(2d) 400, 18 C. C. P. A.-, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">The flavoring extract is an ingredient of the finished beverage, and, in the sense of the trade-mark registration statute, is, the nature of the respective products being considered, of the same descriptive properties as the beverage into which it enters.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-18\">We take it that the use of the word \u201cLemon\u201d in connection with \u201cFrost\u201d is for the purpose of indicating the flavor of the drink contained in the bottle to which \u201cLemon Frost\u201d is applied. If so, and it be lemon flavor, that part of the mark is descriptive. If it be not lemon flavored, then that part of the mark would be misdeseriptive. It is evident that \u201cLemon\u201d alone would not be registerable as a trade-mark for use on applicant\u2019s goods, because of its descriptive character, but it is urged that the mark must be taken as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-19\">It seems clear that the words \u201cJack Frost\u201d having been registered for use on goods of the same descriptive properties, it would not be permissible for applicant to register \u201cFrost\u201d alone for such use as is proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-20\">\u201cJack Frost\u201d is defined by Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary as \u201cthe personification of wintry weather.\u201d One definition of \u201cFrost\u201d is \u201cminute crystals of ice formed directly from atmospheric water-vapor.\u201d In common parlance, \u201cFrost\u201d and \u201cJack Frost\u201d are not infrequently used interchangeably. Either word, applied to the products of applicant, or to those for which the registration which led to the rejection of the application was secured, is suggestive, and doubtless is intended to be suggestive, of coldness in the drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-21\">Since \u201cLemon\u201d is descriptive and \u201cFrost\u201d would be prohibited to -applicant on account of the registration of \u201cJack Frost,\u201d the matter, under the facts of this ease, resolves itself into a question of whether, by combining a descriptive word with a prohibitive word, applicant can be held to have created a noneonflieting arbitrary mark, not descriptive, and unlikely to cause confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-22\">We do not think it may be properly so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-23\">It is assumed from the certificate of registration that \u201cJack Frost\u201d is now being used, or could be used, on lemon flavoring for soda fountain beverages. If applicant be permitted to register \u201cLemon Frost\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>a lemon-flavored beverage the form of which differs from the fountain product only in the fact that it is contained in a bottle rather than being concocted at the fountain, the result, it seems to us, would likely confuse purchasers as to the products, particularly as to their origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The decision of the Commissioner is without error, and same is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
