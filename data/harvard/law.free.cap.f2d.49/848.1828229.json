The method of separating adherent p articles from an article which comprises subjecting said article to a series of percussive impulses in rapid succession and in one direction only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-25\">\u201c3. The method of separating sand from castings which comprises imparting to said casting in rapid succession a series of substantially identical vibratory impulses tending to cause the sand to be dislodged from the surface thereof and preventing the transmission of interfering impulses to the easting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-26\">The alleged invention relates to the method of separating adherent particles from objects, as, for example, cleaning or freeing a metal easting of the adherent particles of sand that cling to the casting when the same is removed from the sand mold.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-27\">The references relied upon are: Michitisch, 1,085,928, February 3, 1914; Schuyler et al., 1,454,490, May 8, 1923; Reck et al., 1,574,693, February 23, 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-28\">We have carefully examined the references cited and they clearly anticipate appellant\u2019s alleged invention. No useful purpose would be served in discussing in detail the applicability of the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-29\">We find no error in the decision of the Board of Appeals, and the same is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-30\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
