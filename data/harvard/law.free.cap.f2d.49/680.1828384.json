D. C. Code, Title 14, \u00a7 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-21\">As a bill for maintenance and other relief, we agree with the trial justice that it cannot be amended into a bill for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-22\">As was said of a similar bill under a similar statute in New York: \u201cIf an amendment of this kind can be allowed, then an action for specific performance can be amended into an action for absolute divorce.\u201d Robertson v.
