S. President Cleveland, owned and operated by Dollar Steamship Lines, Inc., Ltd., and operated during all times mentioned in the libel herein by the respondent, on the 21st day of November, 1929, at San Francisco, California, for a voyage from said port to Manila, P. I., and return to the United States, said voyage consuming a period of approximately two months. The libellant worked at his usual duties until November 27th, 1929, the day before the arrival of the President Cleveland, at the port of Honolulu. At about 3:30 p. m. on said date, said libellant was on the after-port deck with a few of his shipmates, and entered into a good-natured scuffle with a fellow shipmate, in the course of which the libellant received a severe and painful injury to his leg. At said time libellant was off watch, and had not been drinking. Libellant was employed at wages of $72.50 per month, and his wages for the voyage totalled $130.50. The amount of wages due libellant up until the time he was left in Honolulu on November 28th, 1929, was $19.-33. On said 28th day of November, 1929, libellant was, by order of the officers in charge of said vessel removed therefrom and entered at the hospital at Honolulu, which was necessitated by said injuries received as above mentioned. Said sum of $19.33 was tendered to Meyer as being the amount due him for this-voyage, but said libellant refused this tender. Said libellant, before instituting the above proceeding demanded of respondent his wages for the voyage which to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>tailed $130.50, which said demand was refused by the respondent. Said libellant did not earn any wages from the time of his' said leaving said vessel at Honolulu until the end of said voyage, by virtue of any other employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-6\">\u201cIt is further agreed' that said libellant has received at said hospital at Honolulu all maintenance to which he is entitled. That the only question in this case is whether said libellant is entitled to his wages to the end of said voyage; and, if so, is he entitled to the penalty of two days\u2019 pay for eaeh day said wages have been withheld?\u201d-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">On July 14, 1930, the lower court made and entered its final decree in said cause and allowed the appellant recovery of his wages from November 21, 1929, to November 28, 1929, and from January 2, 1930, the date on which appellant was released from the hospital in Honolulu, to January 13, 1930, a total sum of $43.44; the court denied appellant recovery of his wages for the time that he was in the hospital; and denied judgment for the penalty of double pay for withholding wages as provided for by U. S. Revised Statutes, \u00a7 4529 (46 USCA \u00a7 596).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">The rule applicable in such eases was stated in the ease of The A. Heaton (C. C.) 43 F. 592: \u201cA seaman, taken sick or injured or disabled in the service of the ship, has the right to receive his wages to the end of the voyage, and to be cured at the ship\u2019s expense.\u201d,, Quoted with approval by the Supreme Court of the State of Washington in Peterson v. Pacific S. S. Co. (The Admiral Dewey) 145 Wash. 460, 261 P. 115, 118, 1928 A. M. C. 545, 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">Later, this rule was given its final form by the Supreme Court when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-10\">\u201cUpon a full review, however, of English and American authorities upon these questions, we think the law may be considered as settled upon the following propositions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-11\">\u201c1. That the vessel and her owners are liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is wounded, in the service of the ship, to the extent of his- maintenance' and cure, and to his wages, at least, so long as the voyage is continued.\u201d The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, 23 S. Ct. 483, 487, 47 L. Ed. 760; see, also, Pacific Steamship Co. v. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 49 S. Ct. 75, 73 L. Ed. 220.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">The point of importance in these statements of the rule is in the meaning to be attached to the\u2018phrase \u201cin the service of the ship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AaFh\">The peculiar nature of a sailor\u2019s oecupation necessarily calls for a liberal interpretation of this phrase. A sailor cannot, like other workmen, divest himself of all his responsibilities to the company for which he works when his work for the day is, done. For that reason, when the courts have been called upon to determine the bearing of the phrase \u201cin the service of the ship\u201d they have given it a wide range. \u201cCourts of admiralty have always considered seamen as peculiarly entitled to their protection.\u201d The Heaton, supra. And more definitely: \u201cWe may state our opinion that a seaman \u2018falls sick, or is wounded, in the service of the ship,\u2019 if such misfortune attacks him while he is attached to the ship as part of her erew. It is not necessary that the wound or illness should be directly caused by some proven act of labor; it is enough that he was, when incapacitated, subject to the call of duty as a seaman, and earning wages as such.\u201d The Bouker No. 2. 241 F. 831, 833 (C. C. A. 2nd).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-14\">One exception is consistently made to-a too wide extension of the phrase, namely,, the person injured \u201cin the service of the-ship\u201d must have acted \u201cwithout gross negligence or gross misconduct on his part.\u201d Olsen v. Whitney (D. C.) 109 F. 80. No such allegation is made here, but the particular facts of the way in which the accident occurred must be considered.\u2019 Appellant was off duty and was taking recreation; he was, as all sailors are, subject to call to duty in an emergency and was at the time \u201cin the service of the ship.\u201d However, when he commenced his good-natured scuffling with his fellow shipmates the situation was changed. Appellant by his own volition created an extraneous circumstance; he brought about an intervening cause that directly affected his relation to his employers and to the ship. If the appellant had been sitting on a deck reading and something had accidentally fallen on his knee, thus causing an injury similar in type to that which actually occurred, it might be properly held that the accident had occurred \u201cin the service of the ship.\u201d But the instant ease must be differentiated there: from. \u2019 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-15\">The phrase \u201cin the service of the ship,\u201d as applied \u25a0 to ordinary seamen, is closely analogous to the phrase \u201cin the line of duty,\u2019\u2019 as applied to soldiers or sailors in the service of the United States. The differences in the status of an ordinary seaman, for example, and that of a sailor are obvious at once, but there is a similarity in the narrow employer-employee relationship in both cases,.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>\u201cLine of duty\u201d is defined as follows: \u201cA person in the active service and submitting to its rules and regulations is, in general, in the line of duty.\u201d Naval Courts and Boards^ chapter XII, \u00a7 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">An injury suffered or a disease contracted by a sailor is considered to have been \u201cin the line of duty\u201d \u201cunless it is actually caused by something for whieh he is responsible which intervenes between his service or performance of duty and the injury 'or disease. He will be responsible for an intervening cause if (1) it consists of his own wilful miscon- . duct, or (2) it is something whieh he is doing in pursuance of some private avocation or business, or (3) it is something which grows out of relations unconnected with the service or is not the logical incident of provable effect of duty in the service.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">In an opinion of the Attorney General concerning the phrase \u201cin line of duty\u201d as interpreted under the provisions of the War Risk Insurance- Act, 32 Ops. Atty. Gen. 12, 20, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-6\">\u201cWas that cause appertaining to, dependent upon, or otherwise necessarily and essentially connected with, duty within the line, or was it unappurtenant, independent, and not of necessary and essential connection ? That, in my judgment, is the true test-criterion of the class of * * * eases under consideration. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-7\">\u201cThis seems to mean that if he has stepped aside from the discharge of his duty as a' soldier to exercise some private right or perform some private duty, though still in the service and violating none of a soldier\u2019s duties, and what he thus does causes injury or disease, there will have intervened an adequate and sufficient cause for whieh he is responsible and the injury can not be said to have been suffered in the line of duty. On the other hand, although at the time of receiving an injury he is actually exercising some private right or performing some private duty, it does not necessarily follow that he is precluded. If he is subject to military rules and regulations and, in general, performing his duty as a soldier and what he does, outside of this duty, does not contribute as a cause to bring about the injury, there has been no intervening cause and the injury is suffered in the line of duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-8\">\u201cTo illustrate, a soldier in camp may, during a rest hour, be employing his time by working on an invention wholly disconnected with the military service. He is, in general, in the line of duty, but at the moment is exercising a private right for private purposes. An explosion is produced by chemicals which he is using. There has intervened a cause for whieh he is responsible and the injury is not suffered in the line of duty. But while so employed he is struck by lightning, or becomes ill, or is suddenly stricken with appendicitis, clearly there has been no intervening cause for whieh he is responsible and the injury is suffered in the line of duty. In either ease, what he was doing was in no way inconsistent with the performance of his military duty. While he was doing it the duties of a soldier still rested on him. He was not free of their obligations, nor was he necessarily deprived of the rights which grow out of their performance. This would result only in the event the thing he was doing, outside of his duty, in fact, caused the injury he received.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">We think this reasoning and the example given are directly applicable to the instant case, and here as there the question of importance is whether or not there was an intervening cause for whieh appellant was solely responsible. If appellant, as we have said before, had been sitting quietly on the deck and something had fallen on his leg through circumstances entirely beyond his control, the injury might have been held \u201cin the line of duty\u201d or \u201cin the service of the ship.\u201d Even if he had been scuffling and the same weight had fallen on his leg, the injury might have been held as incurred \u201cin the service of the ship.\u201d But the actual case was quite different, for here the injury flowed directly from an intervening cause for whieh the appellant alone was responsible. Consequently, the injury cannot be held to have been incurred \u201cin the service of the ship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">Appellant contends that the withholding of his wages was in the nature of a penalty, but this does not appeal to us. Clearly, the seaman\u2019s act was not in the line of his duty and he was the author of his own misfortune.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">WILBUR, Circuit Judge, concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
