The examiner of interferences denied registration on the ground that the mark was descriptive, and this decision, on appeal to the Commissioner of the United States Patent Office, was affirmed upon the same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-22\">The argument is .made here that the mark \u201cOff the Cob\u201d is not descriptive but only suggestive, and that it should therefore be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-23\">The Supreme Court of the United States, in Warner <em>&amp; Co. v. </em>Eli Lilly <em>&amp; Co., </em>265 U. S. 526, 528, 44 S. Ct. 615, 616, 68 L. Ed. 1161, said: \u201cA name which is merely descriptive of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of an article of trade cannot be appropriated as a trade-mark and the exclusive use of it afforded legal protection.\u201d Applying this rule to the ease at bar, we have no doubt that the designation \u201cOff the Cob,\u201d as applied to canned com, is merely descriptive of the qualities or characteristics of the corn. If one were to apply the mark \u201cOn the Cob\u201d to canned com which had been cut from the cob before canning, it would plainly be misdescriptive. It is also true that to apply to it the designation \u201cOff the Cob\u201d is descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-24\">Reference is had to the following cases decided by this court: Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., 39 F.(2d) 684, 17 C. C. P. A. 962, where we held the word \u201cHyeycle,\u201d applied to electrical tools, to be descriptive; and In re Autographic Register Co., 39 F.(2d) 718, 17 C. C. P. A. 1044, where we held the word \u201cAutographic,\u201d applied to manifold registers and similar articles, to be descriptive; California Cyanide Co. v. American Cyanamid Co., 40 F.(2d) 1003, 17 C. C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>P. A. 1198, where we held the term \u201cCal-cyanide,\u201d as a trade-mark for fumigants, to be descriptive. Other similar eases where words have been held descriptive are: L. P. Larson, Jr., Co. v. Wm. Wrigley, Jr., Co. (C. C. A.) 253 F. 914, involving \u201cSpearmint\u201d; Grinter v. Kinney Tobacco Co. (C. C. ) 12 F. 782, involving \u201cStraight Cut\u201d; Sears &amp; Nichols Co. v. Brakeley, 38 App. D. C. 530, involving \u201cEvergreen\u201d; Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Co. v. Quaker Oats Co. (C. C. A.) 235 F. 657, involving \u201cToasted Com Flakes\u201d; Chapin-Sacks Co. v. Hendler Creamery Co. (D. C.) 231 F. 550, involving \u201cThe Velvet Kind.\u201d In these eases the subject of deseriptiveness was thoroughly gone into and no necessity arises for a further discussion of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
