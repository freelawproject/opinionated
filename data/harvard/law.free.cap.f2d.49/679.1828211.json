The lower court granted the motion non obstante, and entered judgment for the defendant. This we think was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-22\">While it is quite true that in many of the states there are now to be found statutes as a result of which the trial court, when convinced that the verdict is without evidence to support it, or is clearly contrary to the evidence, may end the action at once \u201cand put the losing party to his writ of error, thus avoiding the temptation to perjury and in many eases the unnecessary expense of a second trial\u201d (note of revisors, Code of Va. \u00a7 6251), nevertheless the Constitution of the United States denies such power to a judge of a federal court. \u201cThe terms of the Seventh Amendment and the circumstances of its adoption show that one of its purposes was to require adherence to the rule of the common law that a verdict cannot be disturbed for an error of law occurring on the trial without awarding a new trial.\u201d Sloeum v. New York Life Ins. Co., 228 U. S. 364, 33 S. Ct. 523, 57 L. Ed. 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-23\">The judgment of the lower court must therefore be and is reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-24\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
