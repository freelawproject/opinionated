The points argued do not require discussion, since the persons deputed to carry the liquors testified to the facts upon their own defense and proved the case against Rubin beyond question.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-19\">It was, however, erroneous to convict upon both counts, because the possession was of the same liquors transported and was laid as being in the motor which did the transporting.
