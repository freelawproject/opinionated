They held, however, that, with the exception of the suffix \u201ctex,\u201d the marks were wholly dissimilar in appearance, sound, and meaning; that the suffix was a minor portion of the involved marks and had been registered by others for use on similar goods, prior to appellant\u2019s registration; that the concurrent use of the involved marks would not be likely to cause confusion; and that, therefore, appellee was entitled to have its mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">Preliminary to a discussion of the involved issues, we may say that counsel for appellee has not appeared in this court to present any reasons, orally or otherwise, why the decision of the Commissioner of Patents should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">Appellee set out in its answer several registrations of trade-marks including the syllable \u201ctex.\u201d However, those registrations do not appear in the record and there is nothing to indicate that any of them were used on goods possessing the same descriptive properties as those involved in this proceeding. Furthermore, it is not contended here that appellee was the first to adopt and use t a trade-mark ending in the suffix \u201ctex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Accordingly, it will be presumed, for the purposes of this decision, that appellant\u2019s registration is valid. Van Camp Sea Food Co., Inc., v. Westgate Sea Products, 48 F. (2d) 950, 18 C. C. P. A. \u2014, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">It appears from the record that appellant has expended large sums of money in advertising its products and its trade-mark in magazines read by millions of people, and through other advertising mediums. Nevertheless, appellee, in its answer, stated that it had no knowledge, except as alleged in the notice of opposition, that appellant had built up an extensive business, there was any pub-lie demand for its products, or that the trademark \u201cCelotex\u201d had been extensively advertised, and denied that the registration of the mark \u201cOpal-Tex\u201d for use on its goods would enable unscrupulous dealers to pass off the goods of appellee for those of appellant. No evidence was offered by appellee to substantiate any of these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">That ihe goods of the respective parties possess the same descriptive properties and are used, or intended to be used, for the same purposes, and that they are sold, or intended to be sold, through the same mediums to the general publie, is obvious. Accordingly, the sole question for our consideration is: Would the concurrent use of the marks \u201cOpal-Tex\u201d and \u201cCelotex\u201d by the respective parties be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the publie and deceive purchasers?</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">The trade-marks are not identical in appearance, meaning, or sound. However, we are unable to agree with tbe conclusion reached by the Patent Office tribunals that the suffix \u201ctex\u201d is a minor feature of appellant\u2019s trade-mark. On the contrary, we are of opinion that the suffix \u201ctex\u201d is an important and distinctive, if not the dominant, feature of the mark \u201cCelotex\u201d; and that the public would observe and remember that particular feature of the mark. . Of course, appellant is not entitled to the exclusive use of every trade-mark formed by the use of the syllable \u201ctex,\u201d but, when, as in the ease at bar, a newcomer in the field uses the syllable \u201ctex\u201d as a suffix, with a prefix not sufficiently dissimilar from the prefix of the registered mark to prevent confusing similarity of the marks as a whole, the registrant must be given the full measure of protection intended to be conferred by the statute, \u201cthe general purpose of which [nothing appearing therein to the contrary] is to prevent one person from passing off his goods or his business as the goods or business of another.\u201d American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, Commissioner, et al., 269 U. S. 372, 46 S. Ct. 160, 162, 70 L. Ed. 317, and eases therein cited; B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Clive E. Hockmeyer et al., 40 F.(2d) 99, 17 C. C. P. A. 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">Considering the marks as a whole, therefore, as should be done in eases of this character, we are of opinion that the use by appellee of the mark \u201cOpal-Tex\u201d on its goods, concurrently with the use by appellant of its widely advertised and well-known trade-mark \u201cCelotex\u201d for use on its goods, would be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the publie and would tend to cause, as claimed by counsel for appellant, unscrupulous dealers to pass off the goods of appellee for those of appellant; and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>public would be confused, not only as to the goods, but as to their origin. Whether this is an instance of trade-mark piracy, as argued by counsel for appellant, need not be considered by us. However, the observation, many times reiterated in eases of this character that, except in widely separated fields of activity, which is not the case here, there can be no reasonable excuse for a newcomer to adopt and use a trade-mark confusingly similar to the established mark of another on goods of the same descriptive properties, has particular application to the facts in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
