Therefore the sole question before us is, Are the marks confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>The tribunals of the Patent Office held that the marks did not look alike, sound alike, nor convey the same thought. They referred, in their opinions, to the registered trade-mark \u201cKyanize\u201d for use on paints and painters\u2019 materials, registered February <em>5, 1907, </em>and held that there was closer similarity between the marks \u201cSimoniz\u201d and \u201cKyanize\u201d than existed between the marks \u201cSimoniz\u201d and \u201cPermanize.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">It may be that the trade-marks \u201cKyanize\u201d and \u201cSimoniz\u201d are confusingly similar, and that appellant was not entitled to the registration of its mark. However, that question is not before us and will not be considered by this court in this proceeding. Van Camp Sea Food Company, Inc., v. Westgate Sea Products, 48 F.(2d) 950,18 C. C. P. A. -, and eases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">It appears from the record that appellee was familiar with the trade-mark \u201cSimoniz\u201d at the time it adopted and began the use of the word \u201cPermanize\u201d as its trade-mark. Nevertheless, it selected a trade-mark closely simulating appellant\u2019s trade-mark which had been advertised throughout the United States and abroad, and which, due to the popularity of appellant\u2019s goods, was a valuable asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The marks are not identical, but the only material difference is in the first syllables\u2014 \u201cSi\u201d and \u201cPer.\u201d However, this court has repeatedly held that the public ought not to be required to dissect and analyze trademarks in order that confusion and deception might be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">We are of opinion that the involved marks are confusingly similar, and that appellee is not entitled to have its mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
