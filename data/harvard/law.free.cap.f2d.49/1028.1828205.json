Upon its request for refund being refused, it brought this action, the trial of which resulted in a judgment for appellee, collector of internal revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-21\">Appellant bases its claim to an allowance for depletion upon section 204 (e) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 16, 26 US CA \u00a7 935 (e) (2), which provides: \u201cIn the ease of oil and gas wells the allowance for depletion shall be 27% per centum of the gross income from the property during the taxable year.\u201d This court has held, in construing section 214 (a) (10) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 241), which provides that in computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions in ease of oil and gas wells \u201ca reasonable allowance for depletion,\u201d that the deduction is for the benefit of the lessor, lessee, or other person having an interest in the lease, but that no deduction was intended or authorized in favor of a taxpayer after he had sold his lease and m&gt; longer had an interest in it. Waller v. Commissioner (C. C. A.) 40 F.(2d) 892; Herald v. Commissioner (C. C. A.) 42 F.(2d) 942. See, also, Pugh v. Commissioner (C. C. A.) 49 F.(2d) 76. We still adhere to those decisions; for one who has ceased to have any interest in property suffers no loss by reason of its depletion or depreciation in value. The principle of these decisions applies equally to the provision for depletion contained in the Revenue Act of 1926, which only substitutes a definite percentage of gross income for the \u201creasonable\u201d allowance for depletion prescribed by the earlier revenue act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
