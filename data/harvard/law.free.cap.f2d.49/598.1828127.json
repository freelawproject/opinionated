From a decision favoring complainant, the defendant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-21\">We place our decision upon unfair competition and notice the matter of trade-mark only so far as it sheds light upon the other issue. The registered trade-mark here involved was \u201cYe Olde Tyme\u201d in a particular arrangement of old English type and was applicable to leather boots and shoes. The registration was made January 9,1912. The evidence shows that there is a class of shoes manufactured for women which is known in the trade as \u201cComfort\u201d shoes. In connection with this class of shoe, appellee has, for many years, used this trade-mark in combination with the word \u201ccomfort\u201d and has long designated that class of its products as \u201cYe Olde Tyme Comfort\u201d shoes. Under this arrangement and designation, that class of its shoes has become known to the retail trade and customers and has been extensively advertised for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-22\">For some time, appellant, which is a retail department store, had handled these shoes of the appellee in its shoe department and sold them to the public under the above .designation. In the course of its business, appellant ceased purchasing these shoes from appellee replacing them with another \u201ccomfort\u201d shoe made for it by another manufacturer and upon which it stamped the name \u201cAll Time Comfort\u201d and which were desig-. nated by that name. These shoes were to meet the same character of custom and were sold in the same place where it had shortly ceased selling the shoes of- appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The evidence seems to show that appellant adopted its mark or trade-name on an occasion and under circumstances when confusion would likely arise and, also, that the choice of such a brand was, in part, to satisfy an existing demand for shoes of the appellee formerly sold there by appellant. It seems clear that customers, who had formerly bought appellee\u2019s shoes from appellant, would naturally and could easily be misled into thinking that they were buying the same kind of shoes (made by appellee) which they had formerly bought. It is hardly to be supposed that customers buying this sort of article would be very much impressed by the particular form or arrangement of type in the expression <em>\u201cYe </em>Olde Tyme,\u201d or any spelling or any designation or mark on the shoes themselves. Shoes would be called for by the name \u201cYe Olde Tyme\u201d or \u201cOld Tyme,\u201d and \u201cAll Time Comfort\u201d is easily confusible in sound with \u201cYe Olde Tyme Comfort.\u201d The probable result under the circumstances here leads strongly to the conclusion that appellant adopted these particular words in its new name for the purpose of holding the trade it had established on the former brand. At any rate, the result, intentional or unintentional, is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Instances of similar sounding trade-names which have been deemed unfair competition axe Ceresota and Certosa (Northwestern C.
