The construction of section 2546 given by the Appellate Division deprives the surrogate of the right to call witnesses before him and deprives the adverse party of the right of cross-examination.

Hyde from the transfer tax on the ground that the decendent was at the time of his death a non-resident of this State, the executors named in his will presented to the Surrogate\u2019s Court affidavits setting forth facts tending to establish that he was a resident of Connecticut. The attorney for the comptroller of the State of Hew York filed an affidavit in opposition to the motion in which he set forth that he \u201c is informed and verily believes that said decedent was in fact a resident of the State of Hew York at the time of his death and accordingly deponent is desirous of having the residence of this decedent determined by this court, and respectfully requests that this court deny the present motion * * * and- refer the matter of the residence of this decedent to some proper person.\u201d The surrogate thereupon denied the -motion to exempt and made an order of reference \u201c to take testimony and to hear -and determine the-question of the residence of \u25a0 said decedent and to make report,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">It is conceded that this order, except so far as it directs the referee \u201c to take and report to the surrogate the evidence upon the facts\u201d (Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 2536), is unauthorized. The Appellate Division reversed the order and granted the motion to exempt the estate from taxation on the ground that the allegations of the executors\u2019 affidavits were not controverted by the affidavit read in opposition thereto and that they, therefore, must be taken as true and as due and sufficient proof of non-residence. In the -recent revision of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to Surrogates\u2019 Courts (L. 1914, ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>443) a new section appears, which, reads as follows: \u201c \u00a7 2546. Uhcontroverted allegations constitute due proof.\u2014 Except as otherwise provided by law, a petition, affidavit 'or account filed in a special proceeding shall be due proof of the facts therein stated, unless controverted by answer, objection or other proof.\u201d The court below gives the same force to this section as if it read, \u201c every material allegation of an affidavit, not controverted by the answering affidavit must, for the purpose of the proceeding be taken as true.\u201d Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 522.) We think that this construction is unnecessarily strict. The entire proceeding was informal. Duly verified petition and answer should have been filed. (Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7\u00a7 2519-20.) A denial of any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the allegations of the petition would then have sufficiently and properly controverted the same and put the moving parties to their proof. Doubtless systematic and orderly methods of procedure should commend themselves to the legal profession and to the courts nor should laxity and informality be encouraged. At the same time, the ends of justice do not require that the strict rule applicable to pleadings in actions in courts of record should be so harshly applied to , this proceeding. The revisers say in their note that the purpose of section 2546 was <em>\u201c </em>to obviate the supposed necessity of offering oral proof to substantiate uncontroverted allegations, due probably to the fact that in former years petitions were sometimes made orally.\u201d (Supplement to Bliss\u2019s and Stover\u2019s Annotated Code Civ. Pro. 1913-1915.) The words \u201c due proof,\u201d therefore, as used in the section would seem to have the meaning merely of \u201cproper or legal proof.\u201d The moving affidavits are in the nature of testamony rather than pleadings. Wigmore (Vol. 2, p. 1697) points out that no statement unless by special exception \u2022should be used as testimony until it has been probed and submitted to the test of cross-examination, \u201c the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d <em>Ex parte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>affidavits, although truth'may often be found therein, are weak evidence, to be received with caution in any case. The executors here claim exemption from taxation of an estate said to be more than $2,000,000 in value, and the right of the State to cross-examine their witnesses ought not to be defeated by technical defects or insufficiencies in answering affidavits. (Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 768.) The latter sufficiently controvert by objection the moving affidavits and empower \u25a0 the surrogate in his discretion to appoint a referee to take evidence of the facts, nor should we go so far as to hold the surrogate powerless to require the production of witnesses on his own motion where such affidavits although uncontroverted are, in his judgment, unsatisfactory proof of the facts alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court modified by striking out all but that part thereof which appoints a referee to take the testimony and report, and as thus modified affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Willard Bartlett, Ch. J., Hiscock, Collin, Cuddeback, Hogan and Seabury, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
