Shortly after the will was made the legatee said to a witness that testator had remembered her in his will, \u201c and that she had a notion to get her money now.\u201d A few days afterwards she presented testator\u2019s check at bank for an amount double the amount of the legacy. The legatee did not deny or explain this testimony although she had permission to do so. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that the legacy had been paid and satisfied by testator during his lifetime.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b631-10\"><em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Attorney <em>and client </em>\u2014 Confidential <em>communication.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b631-11\">In the above case one of the witnesses against the legatee was an attorney at law who had been counsel for testator for many years, and had written his will. He had also been counsel for the legatee in small matters. He testified that he went to testator\u2019s house to see him about some business, and met the legatee at the door, who requested him to use his influence with testator to assist her in getting the amount of her legacy paid to her during testator\u2019s lifetime, which the witness declined to do. <em>Held, </em>that the legatee\u2019s communication to the witness was not a confidential communication, and that his evidence was admissible.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b631-12\">Argued April 15, 1895.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9aJ\">Appeal, No. 142, Jan.

It was claimed that this legacy which was for services had been paid and satisfied by testator in his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-4\">The auditing judge, whose name was not stated in the paper-books, reported as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-5\">\u201c The payment of the legacies to Virginia Preston, now Mrs. Virginia Whitney, and to Mrs. Preston are objected to on the ground that said legacies had been adeemed or satisfied by the decedent during his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-6\">\u201c [We find as a matter of fact that the legacy to Mrs. Virginia Whitney was paid by check of the decedent during his lifetime, dated Dec. 15,1891.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-7\">\u201cThis fact is established by the testimony' of the executor and of Mr. Creveling. The executor, Mr. DeWitt, says \u2018that after the will was made Virgy Preston said to him that Mr. Turner had remembered her in his will, and that she had a notion to get her money now.\u2019 A few days afterwards she presented that check (this referring to the five thousand dollar check) at the bank. Mr. Creveling\u2019s testimony is that she said to him that she was to have some money under Mr. Turner\u2019s will, and she wanted him to help her get it at that time; she said she thought if she didn\u2019t get the money now she never would get it, giving her reason for thinking so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-8\">\u201c [From the testimony of other witnesses it appears that the legacy named in the will was by way of compensation for services rendered by Miss Preston, and not by way of a gift or by reason of kinship.] [3] Miss Preston didn\u2019t explain or deny this testimony, although she was permitted to do so. She got five thousand dollars very soon after the making of the will and at a time when Mr. Turner\u2019s bank account was very low, and when the bulk of his estate was in litigation. We cannot presume it was a mere gift in addition to the legacy so recently named in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-9\">\u201c We think Mr. Creveling was a competent witness, although, as she said, he had previously been her counsel in small matters. It appears from the testimony that Mr. Creveling had been counsel for Mr. Turner for many years, and had written his will. He says he went to Mr. Turner\u2019s home to see him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>about some business and met Miss Preston at the front door ; that is, he was not sent for by Miss Preston, was not employed by her, and was not then engaged by her, and all that she wanted of him was that he should use his influence with Mr. Turner as his confidential legal adviser to assist her in getting the money, which he then promptly declined to do. These facts do not make her communications to him confidential: Hector v. Findley, 2 Jones, 304; Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, \u2018Confidential Communications.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-4\">\u201c We further conclude that the fact of payment of the legacy is sufficiently established without Mr. Creveling\u2019s testimony. This payment was the satisfaction of an obligation which Mr. Turner seems to have recognized, and not a technical ademption of a legacy as between parent and child.\u201d Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b633-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b633-6\">6r. <em>L. </em>Halsey, for appellant, cited on the question of ademption and payment of legacy:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGcI\">2 Story\u2019s Eq.
