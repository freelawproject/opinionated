L. bought one of the lots, but nothing was ever entered of record to show that the lien of the judgment on the lot had been released. On a scire facias to revive the judgment L. claimed that his lot had been released from the lien of the judgment. On conflicting evidence the referee found as a fact that \u201c as to the lot sold to and in possession of L., the lien of said judgment was either actually released by a paper not filed, and now lost or mislaid, or there was an agreement that said lien should be released,\u201d and, as a conclusion of law, that judgment should be entered in favor of L. The referee\u2019s report was confirmed, and judgment entered for L.
