L. 333. On March 12, 1894, he gave bond, with surety, duly approved by the court and filed. Thereupon he applied to the respondents, the commissioners of the county of Berks, for the tax duplicate for the state and county taxes collectible in said township, but was refused, upon the ground that, under the act of March 18, 1852, P. L. 153, a local law applicable to said township, the collection of said taxes is to be intrusted to the lowest bidder. Thereupon the petition was filed, upon which this rule was granted. The respondents, in their answer, aver that the relator\u2019s election was invalid, the act of 1852 not being repealed by the act of 1893. ... In principle that identical question has, since the argument, been decided by the court of C. P. of Dauphin Co., in Com. v. Middleton, 3 Dist. Rep. 639. The conclusion reached by it, to wit, that the act of 1893 repeals the numerous local laws inconsistent with it, is irresistible, perhaps even more obviously so in the case of townships than in that of boroughs. I know of nothing, however, that could be profitably added to what was said in the above case by the learned judge who delivered the opinion in it. I accept it as conclusive of'this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-7\">\u201c The rule to show cause is made absolute.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-8\"><em>JUrror assigned </em>was above order.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-9\"><em>William J.

The constitution requires this, and we have felt constrained to interpret statutes relating to these subjects in the light of the constitutional requirements. This case is fairly ruled by Commonwealth v. Macferron, 152 Pa. 244; and by Quinn v. Cumberland County, 162 Pa. 55. We have no intention to depart from the rule laid down in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
