Before Ikeler, P.

Plaintiff alleged that he was tripped by a loose board or plank in the sidewalk, and after stumbling forward a few steps, caught his foot in a hole and fell, and severely injured his back.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-8\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-9\">\u201c It is proved by a large number of witnesses on behalf of the plaintiff that the pavement was in bad condition \u2014 dilapidated, decayed; that the plank and the cross boards were rotten in places and worn and decayed, and raised up or upheaved around the trees from the growth of the roots \u2014 of the shade-trees, as we take it, planted upon the edge of the pavement. Necessarity, a pavement proved to be in that condition must have been built, laid, several years before. You, as men of skill and experience, must from the general testimony as to the character of this pavement, judge of its age. The testimony is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that it was a wooden pavement when it was made, constructed with three stringers lengthwise upon the street or pavement, with four-foot pieces going over, two-by-fours, laid crosswise and spiked, with the stringers sunk in the earth even with its top at the time of laying the pavement \u2014 you must judge, we say, how long that pavement must have lain there before it would become in the rotten, decayed, bad condition which the witnesses testify that it was in on the 12th day of April, 1892.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-4\">\u201c W. W. Meyers testified that its condition was plainly observable by daylight \u2014 could tell by feeling in the feet in the night-time that it was rough and uneven. Theodore Smith spoke upon that subject. He testified that all passers-by, persons going over the walk in the da}rtime, could see its bad condition. Thomas Moyer testifies as follows: <em>\u2018Question: </em>You may state whether or not it was plainly observable to all passers-by, whether or not it was plain to be seen. <em>Answer: </em>Yes, sir. P. S. Moyer testified in answer to the same question : Well, I don\u2019t know but what it would be if you looked from the other side of the road. <em>Question: </em>How about persons passing over it, as to its being observable? <em>Answer: </em>Could not help but see it. <em>Question: </em>At what time of day or night? <em>Answer: </em>Could not see much at night, I would not think.\u2019 George B. Kitchen said : \u2018You could see it when you got up pretty well to the sehoolhouse, then you could see it.\u2019 You will recollect that George B. Kitchen lived at the foot of the hill, as we understand it, down by Railroad street. He was janitor of the public sehoolhouse on Third street; and, in speaking of how this pavement might be seen by passers-by, he said you could observe this pavement upon the Robinson lot \u2018 when you got up pretty well to the sehoolhouse, then you could see it.\u2019 B. F. Taylor said: \u2018 A person standing at the corner of my house, on the opposite side of the alley \u2019 (he lived at that time in the old McReynolds house on the north side of the alley, the house that has since been removed) \u2018 could see that pavement if he stood there and made a business to look down that street, down over them board walks; he could have seen that it was in bad condition in the daylight.\u2019 Dr. McReynolds testifies as follows: \u2018 <em>Question : </em>From what point could you see that it was in bad condition ? <em>Answer: </em>In passing down the other side of the street, going up or down.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>\u201c We have now called your attention to the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses (as nearly as we remember it) who testify upon that point \u2014 that it was in bad condition, and that its com dition was easily observable to all persons passing by. The condition spoken of, as described by the witnesses particularly, (and nearly all of them agree on that point,) is that it was decayed, rotten; some of the cross boards broken, some of them out, and that there were depressions or holes where they were out, the depth of which holes was described by some of the witnesses as being of the thickness of the next plank or cross board and what additional depth had been worn in the ground by the passers-by. It was in one of these holes that, as the plaintiff testifies, he caught his foot. He testifies that, first, in walking along that pavement, he caught his left foot on a plank or something sticking up \u2014 a piece of plank or board or two-by-four or something, he would not undertake to say what, he could not say what; but something loose in the pavement tripped him and pitched him forward, and his,feet caught, or one foot, his left foot then went into a hole; and, as he was pitched forward with his right foot he fell in or was caught in another hole \u2014 with his right foot or his left foot; at any rate he fell, and it threw him forwards and a little sidewise, and he fell backwards or a little toward his left side 'and caught his left foot fast in this hole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-3\">\u201c Under the plain and well-established rules of law (as we understand them) applicable to this case, there are four well-defined rules, the facts under any one of which being found against the plaintiff, will prevent his recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-4\">\u201cThe first rule is that the negligence of the defendant must be the proximate cause of the accident, else the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-5\">\u201c The second rule is that if the plaintiff knew of the bad condition of the pavement at that locality where he was injured, and yet entered upon the pavement that night in the darkness, such as the witnesses describe it, then he took the risk, and he cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-6\">\u201c The third rule is that if the plaintiff knew of another and safe way direct and convenient for him, and did not know that the way he took was safe, then, in taking the unknown way, he would be guilty of contributory negligence and cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u201c The fourth rule is that, although he may be injured, yet, if his injuries are not the result of this fall \u2014 if the accident here alleged as the cause of his present disabilities (whatever they may be) is not the cause of them, then he cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-4\">\u201cWe will take up these four propositions in their order. A proximate cause is one which in actual sequence, undisturbed by any other cause, produces the result complained of. If the tripping over a loose object upon the sidewalk was the proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff, and if that object was something else and not a part of the pavement and was there at the time without fault on the part of the town of Blooms-burg, and if the plaintiff\u2019s fall into the place (hole) where he was hurt, as it is alleged, resulted from tripping over that loose substance (whatever it was) upon the pavement or walk; then it is not shown that the bad condition of the pavement itself was the proximate cause of the accident to the plaintiff, and therefore he cannot recover \u2014 that is, if you find the fact to be as we have just stated it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-5\">\u201c Involved in the second proposition is the important question : Did Ringrose know of the bad condition of this pavement. What is the testimony upon that subject ? For you must be guided and governed solely by the testimony in coming to your verdict. In ascertaining whether he knew or did not know the bad condition of this walk, you may consider the proximity of his place of residence to the place where he was injured, his habit of moving about, and whether this pavement had been and was so notoriously in a dilapidated state that the fact was patent or plainly observable to all passers-by; because if it was so notoriously in bad condition, then if he had opportunity to know its condition, he was bound to know it. As we have said, this pavement must have been laid at least several years before the accident. There is no evidence that at this particular point it was ever repaired from the time it was laid up to the time of the accident. Indeed, it is admitted by the defense that its condition was so bad and so well known to be bad that the town authorities had constructive notice of its condition; and the plaintiff has not only proved the fact of its notoriously bad condition, such as to constitute constructive notice, but he has also proved actual and express notice to the town council of the town of Bloomsburg, and a resolution to repair. But it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>is likewise shown that the plaintiff lived for seventeen or eighteen years (except two years and a half or a year and a half that he resided in Milton) within a hundred feet of this point in the pavement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-3\">\u201c As nearly as we can ascertain or recollect the testimony of the plaintiff upon the subject of his knowledge of the condition of this pavement, he says: \u2018 On this, the north side of the street, I did walk, but not very often.\u2019 He says he did walk on the north side of the street. You will recollect that the pavement complained of is on the south side. He says: \u2018 I did walk on the north side, but not very often. Was familiar with it that way, the east end; had been that way to the Methodist church; the other way I was not familiar with it; don\u2019t think I worked twenty days in my life below Railroad street. If I have I don\u2019t remember it. Very seldom I went down there; for the last year or two, probably three, I never went down only during fair time. In October, 1891, I went down there then from the back end of my lot, then through the alley; sometimes before daylight, once in a while it was light; did not go that side \u2019 (speaking of the north side) \u2018 because it was better, but because it was nearer bj- the way of the alley; once in a great while, but very seldom, went around by the pavement; did not go that side because it was better, knew nothing at all about it; never went over it by daylight \u2019 (speaking of the south side) ; \u2018never went down that street except by the way of my barn; I mind walking down once with Al. Herbine, on the Cohen side; never examined the pavement, had no occasion for it; in going to the Methodist church, I come out from my house to the corner of Third street and come to the crossing, to the corner of the Cohen property, and turn to the left and out Third street; I do not go across Third street there; I did walk on the north side of Third street on other days than Sundays, once in awhile during all the time I lived there up to the time of the accident; knew the condition of the pavement on that side towards Judge Elwell\u2019s; if there were any bad places, could tell you about where they were. <em>Question: </em>You knew, as you traveled the route that you .took that night, that the Cohen side of the street was reasonably safe, did you not ? <em>Answer: </em>As far as I knew at the time. <em>Question: </em>Why did you go out of what jou knew to be a safe street and venture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>on the other side ? <em>Ansiver : </em>I came up that side of the street, supposed it was all right. I have come up on the other side of the street; did not know anj'thing about the Third street pavement from the West street 'corner down to the railroad ; very seldom that I traveled that way ; do not think that I came that way once in a year \u2014 that is, to the best of my knowledge. <em>Question: </em>When you went down that day on the north side of Third street, you had no trouble, experienced no inconvenience, in getting down on that side, did you ? <em>Answer: </em>No, sir. <em>Question: </em>Whether or not you did not know that the pavements from your house to Main street were perfectly safe, reasonably safe? <em>Answer: </em>Yes, sir; pretty good. <em>Question: </em>Main street, at the time of the accident, was in a safe .condition, so far as you knew, Mr. Ringrose ? <em>Answer: </em>I was not down it, I could not say;. so far as I know, I do not know but what it was. <em>Question: </em>You attend the Methodist church ? <em>Answer: </em>I do, sir, every Sunday in my life if I am well. <em>Question: </em>In going to the Methodist church, you come out from your house to the corner of West and Third streets ? <em>Answer: </em>I do. <em>Question: </em>You went there in the morning? <em>Answer: </em>Yes, sir. <em>Question: </em>To Sunday school? <em>Answer: </em>Yes, sir; backward and forward, to and from church; always went on the north side.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-4\">\u201cYou must determine and settle these questions under the rules of law that we have stated \u2014 whether Ringrose had notice of this defective pavement; whether under all the circumstances and surroundings, considering his habits of life and that he testifies that he helped build a barn on the rear end of the same lot where this pavement existed, and that he traveled back and forth four times a day for a period of six or eight days within a few feet of the western end of this pavement, and the fact of his going to the Methodist church and Sunday school, and to his work around town \u2014 going and coming as all good citizens do \u2014 whether he was bound to know; applying the same rule to him as to others, passers-by. Was the condition of this pavement patent, plainly observable ? Did he pass by it, or near to it, in such proximity to it that he was bound to observe its condition ? If you find that he was so bound, then, we say to you as matter of law, he is not entitled to recover. For he admits (and it is not disputed) that he went down that side, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the north side, of this pavement, that night, on his way to Mrs. Powell\u2019s house; that it was a dark night; that 'he reached her house without any difficulty; that, on his return, he undertook at Railroad street to travel a different route, and that he stumbled in the darkness in getting on and off Railroad street, and across there to the depot, and that when he came to Third street he took this south side of Third street, either as known or that he should have known \u2014 immediately left his known safe way (if he knew the other to be safe). If he did so he took the risk of traveling upon a bad pavement, and -he cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-3\">Defendant\u2019s point was among others as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-4\">\u201c 8.
