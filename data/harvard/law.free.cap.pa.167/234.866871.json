Before Reeder,, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AtI\">At the trial it appeared that the note was for eight hundred and eighteen dollars and was dated April 1, 1885. Benjamin Shoemaker died March 23, 1891, and Thomas Beck died on August 22, 1892. The note was not entered of record in the prothonotary\u2019s office during the lifetime of Benjamin Shoemaker, but was found among the papers of Thomas Beck after his death. Upon the back of the note were indorsed two payments, dated April 1, 1887; one of one hundred dollars, and another of ninety-eight dollars, as interest. Thomas Beck and Benjamin Shoemaker were for a number of years the owners of a farm as tenants in common. , Two daughters and two sons-in-law of Benjamin Shoemaker testified that, after his death, Beck called at the house of Mrs. Shoemaker in reference to the note, and that Mrs. Shoemaker then claimed that she had paid various bills for taxes, insurance, and repairs on account of the farm. They testified that Beck claimed that there was still sixty-seven cents due on the note which Mrs. Shoemaker then paid, and that Beck, not having the note with him, agreed to burn or destroy it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">\u201c The two sons-in-law of Benjamin Shoemaker testify that this note, subsequent to Benjamin Shoemaker\u2019s death and before Thomas Beck\u2019s death, was settled in Mrs. Shoemaker\u2019s house by the presentation of certain bills, by the admission of Thomas Beck of the receipt of certain cash, and that he then said that there was a balance of sixty-seven cents due, and with that paid the note. If this testimony is true, then this note was then and there settled and the plaintiffs would not be entitled to recover in this action. If you do not believe this to be true, and you believe there was no such conversation \u2014 no such settlement, or that the note that they then and there referred to was not this note, but some other note, and that the settlement that was then and there made was not the settlement of this indebtedness, but was a settlement of some other matter, then your verdict will be for the plaintiff for whatever you consider is due upon the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201c [If you believe the testimony of Mr. Snyder and Mrs. Snyder and Mr. Edelman and Mrs. Edelman as to what took place in Mrs. Shoemaker\u2019s kitchen between Thomas Beck and Mrs. Shoemaker, that will end your consideration of the case, if you believe this note was the note that was then and there settled and paid for. It does not make any difference for the purposes of this case where any other money was paid. If you believe that he then and there admitted that it was paid, or if he then and there agreed to take the outstanding bills that Mrs. Shoemaker held against him on her husband\u2019s account in payment of this note, although it might not have been the full amount of the note, and he said that by the payment of sixty-seven cents balance, he would settle the note, and it was this note that they were talking about, then it was a settlement of this note, whether with the money he had received prior to that time, it made the full amount of the note or not.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">\u201c [A man who has a note for $1,000 has a right to settle it for $500. A man who has a note for $1,000 has a right to settle it for $300, and, if he settles, and receives the money at that time, and agrees to destroy the paper, it is just as good as a settlement as if he were paid the amount in full.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">\u201cIf you believe that at that time and in that conversation, as was testified to by the two sons-in-law and the two daughters of Mrs. Shoemaker, there was any such agreement of settlement upon the payment of the balance of sixty-seven cents, which was then and there paid, and that Thomas Beck agreed to destroy the note, and this was the note that was referred to, that will end your consideration of this case and your verdict will be for the defendant. If you believe that no such conversation took place, or, if you believe that this note was not the note \u25a0that was there settled, if you believe that there was no such conversation and the conversation referred to was the settlement of something else, then you will proceed to consider how \u2022much these plaintiffs are entitled to receive by your verdict. \u25a0It is in that aspect of the case and only that aspect of the case that you will consider the bills and the testimony that have been introduced in relation to those bills by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">\u201c They have proven that a number of bills were paid by Mr. Shoemaker on account of improvements and work upon the farm, that it was for the joint benefit of Thomas Beck and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Benjamin Shoemaker; that they were so furnished, and that Thomas Beck was liable to reimburse Benjamin Shoemaker for half of such payments; if you believe that these moneys were paid by Benjamin Shoemaker for materials purchased by him for the benefit of the property owned by him jointly with Mr. Beck, by the authority of Mr. Beck, and that Mr. Beck agreed to pay his proportion of them, then they were entitled to receive as a set-off against the amount due upon this note, whatever you believe to have been so paid by Mr. Shoemaker and which are not barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-3\">Verdict and judgment for defendants.

The defendants\u2019 sole contention was that by allowance of said credits, some of which were for payments made by Mrs. Shoemaker after her husband\u2019s death, and by payment of the small balance claimed, the note was fully settled and paid; and, in support of that position, they relied on the testimony referred to. It presented a question of fact which was for the exclusive consideration of the jury, and they doubtless understood it correctly. There was no allegation, nor was there any attempt to prove payment and acceptance, from the maker of the note or his administrator, of any smaller sum than the amount actually due, in satisfaction of the note. Referring to the testimony as to what took place at the interview between Mrs. Shoemaker and defendants\u2019 intestate, the learned judge rightly said to the jury: \u201cIf this testimony is true, then this note was then and there settled and plaintiffs would not be entitled to recover in this action. If you do not believe this to be true, and you believe there was no such conversation \u2014 no such settlement, or that the note then and there referred to was not this note, but some other note, and that the settlement then and there made was not the settlement of this indebtedness, but a settlement of some other matter, then your verdict will be for the plaintiffs for whatever you find due on the note.\u201d This was substantially the only question submitted to the jury. There was no other question in the case. In view therefore of the testimony on which defendants relied, the charge cannot be regarded as misleading. In saying, by way of illustration, what is complained of in the second specification, the learned judge doubtless had in mind the facts of the case, as indicated by the defendants\u2019 testimony, and meant a settlement, not with the maker of a note, but with a third party \u2014 such a settlement as that shown to have taken place between plaintiffs\u2019 intestate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>and Mrs. Shoemaker after her husband\u2019s death. There is nothing else in the ease to which the language complained of could possibly apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">Considered as a whole, there is no substantial error in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
