Before Edwards, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-13\">At the trial it appeared that plaintiff\u2019s land was injured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>water thrown upon it from the Lackawanna river by reason of the defective construction of a railroad bridge. It appeared that the bridge in question was built by the Wilkes-Barre &amp; Scranton Railway Company, and that after it had been fully completed and constructed it had been leased to the defendant, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey. There was no evidence to show that the injury to plaintiff\u2019s land was in any way connected with the operation of defendant\u2019s railroad over the bridge. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-3\"><em>Error </em>assigned, among others, was (4) in discharging rule to take off nonsuit.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-4\"><em>Aaron A. </em>Chase, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyO\">The question of constructive notice to defendant, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, to remove the obstructions from the river, should have been submitted to the jury: Jones v. Bland, 9 Atl. 275; Bradford City v. Downs, 126 Pa. 627; Springer v. City, 12 Atl. 491; Chilton v. Carbondale, 160 Pa. 463; Barnes v. McClinton, 3 P. &amp; W. 67; Weeks v. Haas, 3 W. &amp; S. 525; R.

Willard, Everett Warren </em>and <em>Henry A. Knapp </em>with him, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqDa\">The lessee was not liable: Taylor on Landlord and Tenant, vol. 1, p. 193; Knauss v. Brua, 107 Pa. 88; Somers\u2019s App., 6 W. N. C. 441; Fow v. Roberts, 108 Pa. 489; Todd v. Flight, 9 C. B. (N. S.) 390; Johnson v. Lewis, 13 Conn. 303; Woodman v. Tufts, 9 N. H. 88.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AZg\">April 8, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b385-6\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">It is very clear that the injury complained of by plaintiff did not result from the operation of the road by the defendant who was merely the lessee thereof. If he sustained any actionable injury it must have resulted from the construction of the bridge, etc., and not from the operation of the railroad merely. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>bridge was not built by defendant company, but by another railroad company. The learned trial judge rightly held that there could be no recovery against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AFc9\">There is nothing in either of the specifications that calls for discussion. They are all dismissed and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
