Before Archbald, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-13\">At the trial, it appeared that the defendant on April 2,1888, sold a large quantity of personal property as the property of Joseph R. Kyte. The property in question was on a farm belonging to the estate of Hannah Kyte, deceased, mother of Joseph R. Kyte. After the levy, and prior to the sale, H. D. Kyte, administrator c. t. a. of Hannah Kyte, deceased, claimed the property as belonging to the estate of the decedent. The plaintiff in the execution gave the sheriff an indemnifying bond with T. W. Kyte as surety. The sheriff then sold the goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-14\">The evidence showed that Joseph R. Kyte lived on the farm owned by his mother, but the evidence was conflicting as to whether he carried it on for his own benefit, or for hers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Witnesses testified to declarations made by Joseph to the effect that the property belonged to his mother. Opposed to this, witnesses were produced who testified to the declarations of Mrs. Kyte, that the property was not hers and belonged to Joseph.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">When T. W. Kyte, a witness for defendant was on the stand, defendant\u2019s counsel made the following offer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">\u201c We offer to prove by the witness on the stand the conversations of Hannah D. Kyte in which she has admitted that the title to the personal property on the farm was in Joseph R. Kyte.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">Mr. McCollum: We object that the witness is incompetent to testify to anything that occurred during the lifetime of Hannah D. Kyte.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-9\">Mr. Ainey: And in which the source of title was described by her and admitted to be in Joseph R Kyte. Objected to, same as before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-11\">The Court: It seems to me that the interest of the witness on the bond given to indemnify the sheriff would be adverse to Mrs. Kyte and therefore the case would fall within the exclusions of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-13\">Objection sustained. Defendant excepts. Bill sealed for defendant. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-14\">The court under objection and exception admitted evidence of the declarations of Joseph R. Kyte. [4-7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-15\">The court submitted the whole case to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-16\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $400.

The witness referred to in the first specification was incompetent to testify to what occurred in the lifetime of plaintiff\u2019s testatrix, and hence the offer to prove conversations, in which it was alleged she admitted that title to the personal property on the farm was in Joseph R. Kyte, was rightly rejected. The case depended on questions of fact which were fairly submitted to the jury with instructions which appear to have been substantially correct and adequate. There is nothing in any of the specifications of error that requires further notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
