J., which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-13\">\u201clb is but natural the contestants feel disappointed with the disposition made by their father of his estate, and are convinced it is most inequitable. But they fail to recognize his right to do as he deemed best with his own property, to prefer one child above another, or disinherit one or more at his discretion. This dominion and power conferred by statute and protected by the law is not to be interfered with for slight cause. And it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>for the courts to produce an equality where a testator has seen fit to make an inequality, merely to relieve the disappointment and chagrin of legatees whose equal or superior claims, in their opinion, have been unjustly disregarded. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">\u201c Here it is attempted to set aside the clearly expressed will of testator by alleging that he was of unsound mind and wanting in testamentary capacity at the date of its execution, and that he was induced to execute the testamentary paper through undue influence, exerted mainly by one of his daughters, a sister of the contestants, whereby she became the principal legatee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\">\u201cThe will was executed on June 22, 1892, in the office of testator\u2019s conveyancer, by whom it had been prepared according to instructions received from him, in the presence \u2022 of a well .known member of the bar, and one of the most prominent builders in this city, an old and intimate friend of testator, both of whom became subscribing witnesses, and not only credible, but wholly disinterested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-7\">\u201c Although testator was approaching his eighty-third year, it is abundantly shown he was able to visit his conveyancer alone, consult with him, and, after the execution of his will, return to his home unattended, retaining the will in his possession. He lived until Jan. 11, 1894, almost two years thereafter, and, after his death, his will was found in the fire-proof safe in his dwelling, where he had placed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-8\">\u201c After careful examination of the entire testimony, we fail to discover the slightest proof of want of testamentary capacity. It is very satisfactorily shown by the subscribing witnesses, the attending physician, and even by the contestants, that testator, although eighty-five years \u2022 old at the date of his death, possessed remarkable mental vigor, business ability and knowledge of all his affairs. This so clearly appeared that the main force of the attack upon the validity of the will was confined to the allegation of undue influence and improper solicitation, charged to have been exercised by the favored daughter of testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-9\">\u201c But here, too, the contestants fall far short of the proof required to entitle them to submit the question to trial by jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-10\">\u201c In the first place, the will now attacked is practically a counterpart of a will executed by testator in 1886, prepared by the same conveyance^ and after the execution of the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>will, destroyed, by testator, by tearing and burning, in the office of his conveyancer; and it is not alleged that testator was then of unsound mind, or that any undue or improper influence was used by his daughter in her own' behalf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-4\">' \u201c In the next place, there is not the slightest evidence that the will in contest was prepared through the interference or suggestion of testator\u2019s daughter, either directly or indirectly. She gave no instructions to the conveyancers, nor was she present at its execution, nor was it in her possession at any time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">\u201c And, finally, there is no proof of any request or solicitation from her to her father that she should be preferred to her sisters or brothers, or that she ever used any deception, artifice or undue influence' to prejudice him against them, and thus secure a larger share in his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">\u201c In view of these facts, we have reached the conclusion that under the testimony here produced, such a case has arisen as falls within the well-settled rule that, unless the testimony be sufficient to sustain a verdict against the will, an issue should not be awarded ; and it will be unjust to impose upon the parties the delay, expense and trouble of a trial, when such a verdict ought not to be sustained.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">' \u201c The exceptions to the refusal to grant the issue are therefore dismissed, and the issue refused, at the costs of the contestants.\u2019,\u2019</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above decree.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-9\"><em>Hector T. </em>Fenton, <em>Avery D.
