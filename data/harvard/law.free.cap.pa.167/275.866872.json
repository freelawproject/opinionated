Kane, My Dear Sir: \u2014 I am under such an expense that I find it necessary to reduce my expenses this fall, should I do so I may not want you after September. In doing so it is not that I am displeased but I find that Mr. S. and yourself cannot both be kept busy with what stock I have. I am paying out so much that I feel I should try and save some. So long as you are with me Mr. S. does not have enough to do, and I thought it might be good to have him look constantly after the stock hereafter. I will see you later about the matter. If you can get another place by September, I could spare you at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-16\">\u201c Truly, A. H. Moore.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-17\">On October 15th Mr. Moore wrote as follows: \u201c Your note to hand this P. M. I notified you some little time ago that Mr. Saunders would be at farm shortly and would train his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>material and that I could not possibly employ you longer than Oct. 15.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">\u201c You are <em>mistaken </em>in thinking you have any specified contract with me for any length of time. I engaged your services by the month and you have been <em>paid </em>at the expiration of <em>each month. </em>Mr Sheppard will settle-with you to Oct. 15. If you do not feel like taking the <em>amountdue you </em>and think you have a contract and can do better you have my free consent to use the law for your rights when jmu feel disposed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-6\">\u201c After October 15th, you will be off the <em>pay roll.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-7\">\u201c I think I\u2019ve done my duty <em>toivards you </em>and if you think not, try and collect on your contract if you are so fortunate as to have one. I am sorry we cannot close our matter cordially.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-8\">Defendant claimed that the contract was a contract of hiring by the month. He also introduced evidence that plaintiff had spoiled several colts in training them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-9\">The court after commenting on the evidence as to plaintiff\u2019s alleged incompetency further charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-10\">\u201c [You will take all this testimony and if you find the plaintiff was incompetent, then the defendant had a perfect right to discharge him, because, as I said, when he entered into the employ' of the defendant there was an implied agreement or covenant that he was competent and had proper qualifications to do the work that was assigned to him, that he had reasonable skill to do the work that was assigned to him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-11\">Mr. Hunsicker: \u201cYour honor omitted one important matter. The plaintiff said he had no experience whatever in training youngsters. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-12\">The Court: \u201cYou will remember, of course, not only the testimony to which I have called your attention but any other testimony in the case. You have heard what was said by the plaintiff as to his experience with young stock colts. You will take that into consideration. You have also heard the testimony as to what kind of judgment, training and skill are necessary to prepare a man to take charge of such stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-13\">\u201c The defendant says that the plaintiff was incompetent. You have, however, a right to say that his testimony is contradicted by the written evidence that was given in this case, because he did give a letter to the plaintiff in which he said he was not displeased, (I think is the word he uses,) with him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>You will say whether a man would write that kind of a letter if two or three of his valuable colts had been injured to the extent that he says they had been injured, and if he believed the plaintiff was the cause of such injury. Would he say when he gave him his letter indicating that he had no further service for him, that he was not displeased with him ? You have, however, the explanation that the defendant gives of this letter. He says, \u2018 It is true I wrote this letter but I did it out of kindness to the plaintiff. I knew that if I put the truth into the letter that he could not get employment elsewhere.\u2019 You will say whether that explanation is reasonable and whether you will believe it. The whole testimony is for you.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $357.85. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-5\"><em>Errors </em>assigned,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aue\">among others, were (1) in holding that the contract was a contract of hiring by the year; (7) portion of charge as above, quoting it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-6\"><em>Charles </em>HunsicJcer, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af1\">The learned court gave no effect to the words, \u201c on January 1,1893, if in my employ I am to pay you \u201d etc. This we contend meant the right to discharge at any time prior to January 1, 1893. The employment was conditional, and if the employee remained in the service of the defendant, either of his own volition, or because not sooner discharged, then of course the pay was to be $15.00 per month more : Haney v. Caldwell, 35 Ark. 156; Daveny v. Shattuck, 9 Daly (N. Y.), 66; Wood on Master and Servant, 157.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">Defendant had a right to discharge plaintiff: Allentown Iron Co. v. McLaughlin, 24 W. N. C. 343.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-8\">W. <em>H. </em>Larzelere, <em>M. M.

Coal Co., 143 Pa. 408; Matthews v. Park Bros., 146 Pa. 392.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Afd\">April 1, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b300-10\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">This contention depends on the contract of hiring, evidenced by letters, which passed between the parties on the subject, copies of which are recited in the first specification. The construction of these letters was, of course, for the court. Taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>into consideration all the correspondence bearing on the subject, we think the learned trial judge correctly concluded that the hiring was by the year, as claimed by the plaintiff, and. hence he was entitled to recover unless the defendant could: show a good and valid reason for sooner terminating the.con-, tract. There is nothing in either of the specifications of error that requires a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
