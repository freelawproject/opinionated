Livingood, secured by the said bond and mortgage of $5,000, and the judgment for $750 entered in the court of common pleas of Berks county, to No. 81 September Term, 1889; and that from February 19, 1890, or very soon thereafter, until after the death of the decedent, the securities for the said debt were in possession of the said William H. Livingood, by direction from the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-17\">\u201c The decedent was a very wealthy man, as fortunes are esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>mated in our community. He had no children. According to Mr. Fugleman's testimony he had a strong affection for his brother William, and sympathized keenly with him in his distressing financial embarrassment which harassed him toward the close of decedent\u2019s life. It is quite natural therefore that he should have felt disposed to forgive his indebtedness. The evidence shows that there were other lien creditors of William H. Livingood to a large amount, and that is probably the reason why the mortgage and judgment were not satisfied. The policy of keeping them open, I conjecture, was William H. Livingood\u2019s and not the decedent\u2019s. It is the intention and conduct of the latter that I have to do with, and not that of William H. Livingood, beyond the fact of his willingness to accept the forgiveness of the debt. Of his intention to accept the benefit there can be no doubt; and the purpose of the decedent to confer it is clear beyond fair dispute. The estate of the decedent was his to do with what he pleased, so far as the exceptants are concerned; and if what he did in relation to the indebtedness of William, amounted to a valid gift of it to him, he is entitled to the benefit of it. In Zeigler v. Eckart, 6 Pa. 13, the facts were very similar to those of this case, and I think it a clear authority here, requiring me to hold that these debts were in law effectually forgiven to William by the decedent. It was there decided that the law presumes every legacy to be a clear gratuity, but that that presumption, like every other, may be rebutted by parol proof, and that for that reason a legacy to the testator\u2019s debtor is not per se a discharge of the debt; that as the presumption may be removed by extrinsic evidence, so majr it be restored, and that the testator\u2019s declaraations before, at, and after, the making of his will, that he did not intend the debt should be demanded, constitute a defense to an action for it by the executor. I have found as facts, the intention of this testator to forgive these debts, and his actual delivery to the accountant of the securities for them, and that the securities were in the possession of the accountant at the decease of the testator. The accountant is a legatee under the will of the decedent, and has the benefit of the presumption, that the testator intended his legacjr should be a pure gratuity. While that presumption was temporarily overthrown by the fact that the securities were found in the box of the decedent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>with his other securities, I think it has been fully restored by the evidence showing the forgiveness of the debts and the delivery of the securities to the accountant. Upon the facts as I have found them, Zeigler v. Eckert requires me to dismiss the exceptions, and they are accordingly dismissed, and the account is confirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-4\">Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by. the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-5\">\n<em>Frrors assigned</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmZd\">were (1) in findingthat the decedent intended to forgive the debts of William H.
