The present bill falls clearly within the category of bills quia timet, \u2018 a well settled branch of equity j urisdiction:\u2019 Wheeler v. Philadelphia, 77 Pa. 338, 348 ; Wells v. Bain, 75 Pa. 39 ; Baird v. Rice, 63 Pa. 489 ; Page v. Allen, 58 Pa. 338. Nor can the standing of a citizen and a taxpayer, when money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>is to be raised by taxation or expended by the municipal treasury to proceed in equity to test the validity of the proposed action claimed by him to be illegal, be questioned at this day : Wheeler v. Philadelphia, supra; Sharpless v. Mayor, 21 Pa. 147; Moers v. Reading, 21 Pa. 188 ; Mott v. R. R. Co., 30 Pa. 9; Page v. Allen, supra; Mazet v. Pittsburg, 137 Pa. 548; the recognized grounds of such standing being special injury to his interests as a taxpayer and want of a common law remedy; see Bispham Eq., sec. 424 ; 1 Spelling, Extraord. Relief, secs. 614, 717; Mott v. R. R. Co., supra. It is therefore unnecessary for him to show any injury likely to result to him from the alleged illegal action, different in kind from that common to all other citizens and taxpayers and inferable, as a matter of law, from the illegality of the proposed expenditure of the public money. The fact of a threatened injury entitling him to a relief is necessarily involved in the establishment of the illegality of the intended municipal action. Hence I have deemed it needless to make any special finding, as a finding of fact, that the contract here in question, if executed, will do irreparable injury to plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">\u201c 2. It was decided in Reading v. Shepp, 2 Distr. R. 137, upon careful consideration of all the pertinent statutes, that the special act of 1865, creating and governing the water department of the city of Reading, is nob repealed by the provisions of the act of 1874, providing a system by which cities of the third class may purchase the franchises, etc., of existing water companies, nor by those of the act of 1889, empowering such cities having become the owners of waterworks, to establish water departments.; and that, therefore, the water department of the city of Reading is governed by the act of 1865 and its supplements, and not by the general laws of 1874 and 1889. The question then arises, whether in inviting proposals and awarding contracts, the board is required to conform to the provisions of art. IV, sec. 6, of the last named enactment, which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">\u201c All work and materials required by the city shall be furnished, and the printing, advertising and all other kinds of work to be done for the city, shall be performed under contract, to be given to the lowest responsible bidder, under such regulations as shall be prescribed by ordinance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201cIt was decided in Bork v. Buffalo, 127 N. Y. 64, that a provision in the charter of the city of Buffalo, prohibiting the same from entering into a contract for any work or improvement (exceeding certain prices, and with certain exceptions) \u2018 until the assessment therefor has been confirmed,\u2019 did not apply to the board of park commissioners of said city, or to the contracts made by them; but that the provisions mentioned had reference to contracts made by the regular officers of the municipal government, and not those made by a separate department possessing independent corporate powers. It appears from the opinion of Mr. Justice Vann in that case that the park commission was organized by a special statute passed 1869, subsequently to the enactment of the charter of the city, forming no part of it and in no way dependent upon it, \u2014 creating an independent department of the city government and clothing it with power to locate parks, lay out approaches thereto, appropriate and condemn lands for these purposes, make rules for the regulation, government and protection of the parks, etc.; all powers, which were to be exercised by the commission independently and without the consent or approval of any other body or officers. In 1885 the provisions of the statute of 1869 were incorporated in a revision of the city charter as one of the titles of the same with the apparent object of having all the laws relating to the city government in its various departments embraced in a single statute for the sake of convenience. The park commissioners were not, however, in terms, made city officers, but were still given \u2018sole and exclusive power by contract or otherwise to open, grade, construct, repair and maintain the roadways,\u2019 etc., without leave or license from the council or other agencjr of the city. Of the most of improvements determined upon by the commission (not exceeding the limitation of the statute as to amount), it was made the duty of the city council to raise one half by local assessment. The contract in question was executed in form by \u2018the city of Buffalo by the park commissioners.\u2019 Between the relation of the statute creating the Buffalo Park Commission to the charter of the city of Buffalo, and that of the act of 1865 to the previously enacted charter of the city of Beading and the act of 1889, which is its present charter, as well as between the relittion of the park commissioners to the city government of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u2022Buffalo and that of the Reading water board to the city government of Reading, there are certain points of resemblance so obvious that they need not be pointed out. But the points of distinction are no less striking though created by special statutes, separate from and forming no part of the charter of the city of Reading, with certain powers and duties defined by the \u25a0legislature beyond the control of the city'- councils, and unaffected (as far as its composition, lights, methods and privileges, and the resulting liabilities of property holders are concerned). By subsequent general legislation, the Reading water board is nevertheless not a separate body possessing powers independent of the city councils in the management of the water department or the construction of or contracting for new work within the same. By section 4, act 1865, it is required to perform all such duties relating to the management of the department as the city councils may, consistently with the act, impose upon it; to submit, whenever called upon, estimates of the expense of new works, alterations, etc., contemplated by councils in the waterworks; to carry out, with the aid of the city police, the regulations of councils as to the use of water by the residents of the cits-; and while permitted to purchase such materials as may be requisite for keeping the works in repair, it is denied the right to do so for the construction of new works without the consent and direction of councils, and forbidden to undertake any such new work except with their consent. Without going any further, therefore, it seems very clear that the water board, existing and acting under the statute of 1865 and its supplements, is nevertheless, at least in all matters in which it is made subject to the direction of councils, but a department of the city government, an established agency of the city for canying on one branch of the municipal affairs. If it were needful, this conclusion might be fortified by a comparison between the relations of the Reading water board under the statutes here governing, and the relation of the Sewiekley water commissioners to that borough under the enaotments applicable to it, passed upon in Commissioners v. Sewickley, 159 Pa. 194, where it is said by Mr. Justice Green at page 198: They are mere officers through whose agency the works were constructed, maintained and operated.\u2019 If, however, the Reading water board is not a separate body possessing independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>corporate powers, but a mere department or agency of the city government, in the construction of new waterworks, then it is too plain for argument that the inviting and awarding of a contract for that purpose by the board at the direction of councils is the act of the city through the agency of the board, and so are the execution of the contract and the work of construction. But the city being required to do all such work by contract to be given to the lowest responsible bidder, it cannot be pretended that it may evade that requirement by acting indirectly through the agency of the water board. It was held in Re Emigrant Industr. Sav. Bank, 75 N. Y. 388, that the city of New York, being required to do all public work exceeding a certain amount by contract to be awarded to the lowest bidder, could not escape that requirement as to a particular part of such work by delegating the doing of it to the park commissioners in such manner as they might \u2018 deem expedient and for the best interests of the city and property owners.\u2019 It follows that when the city councils, by the ordinance of March 23, 1894, authorized the water board to engage in the work of constructing a new inlet at the Maidencreek pumping station, and for that purpose to advertise for proposals and award contracts, it must be conclusively held to have intended a compliance on the part of the water, board with act of 1889, art. 4, sec. 6; and what is implied in a law or ordinance is just as much a part of it as what is expressed: United States v. Babbit, 1 Black, 61; Hanchett v. Weber, 17 Ill. App. 114; Slegel v. Lauer, 148 Pa. 236. In a word, in inviting proposals and awarding a contract in this case, the water board was bound by the requirement that municipal work is to be given to and done by the lowest responsible bidder, and to make its specifications accordingly. Has it complied with that requirement ? If not, then, as was said by Denio, J., in Brady v. Mayor, 20 N. Y. 312, a case arising under a similar enactment, it does not require any argument to show that the proceeding was null and void and conferred no rights upon the person to whom the contract was awarded. . . .\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">The court granted a preliminary injunction, which it subsequently refused to vacate on hearing and entered the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u201c And now, February 4,1895, this cause came on to be heard at this term and was argued by counsel and thereupon, upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows, viz: The inviting of proposals and the awarding of the contract for work by the commissioners of the water department of the city of Reading to Howard E.

These specifications require the contractor to employ no one not a citizen of the United States and to pay no man a less sum for his labor than one dollar anc] a half per day. The point made by the plaintiff is that such specifications are not consistent with the provisions of the act of May 23, 1889, art. 4, sec. 6, which require that such work shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder. The learned judge of the court below in his findings of law marked a, b, c and d, has sustained the contention of the plaintiff and fully vindicated his decree. We affirm it for the reasons so clearly stated in these findings.
