D. 1894, which was several days after the writ in this case issued. The deponent is advised, and, therefore, suggests to the court that this action was brought prematurely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">\u201c The said deponent further says that the decree was had in favor of the wards of the plaintiff on June 9, 1892, and distribution of the fund in the hands of the administrator was duly ordered, but that deponent was informed neither by the administrator, nor any one in behalf of the minors, that said fund had not been paid over to their representatives until the twenty-fifth day of April, 1894, when he received a note from plaintiff\u2019s counsel, calling his attention to the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">\u201c That said administrator was solvent and able to have paid the amount found to have been in his hands for nearly two years afterwards, but that no steps were taken on behalf of the representatives of the minors to compel payment.
