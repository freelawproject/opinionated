Young. Before Peck, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-10\">At the trial it appeared that on December 14, 1875, Isaac L. Young gave to his father Reuben Young a judgment bond for twenty-one hundred dollars. The bond was for the unconditional payment of the twenty-one hundred dollars on or before December 14, 1895. Defendant claimed that the bond was given under an agreement that it should be used only as security for the support of Reuben Young and wife, and that it should be used for no other purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-11\">Benjamin F. Young, a son of defendant, being on the stand, counsel for defendant made the following offer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-12\">\u201cWe propose to prove by the witness on the stand that after the bond in this case was prepared and before the same was executed that he was present at a conversation, was present when there was a talk between his father and his mother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Reuben Young in regard to wliat Reuben Young would do in case his son would execute that bond. That the mother of the witness objected to her husband signing this bond, and that Reuben Young then said to Isaac L. Young, the defendant, that if he would sign that bond that it should only be held against him for the support of Reuben Young and his wife. That Isaac Young and his wife then said that with that agreement the bond would be executed. That within three or four days thereafter the witness heard another conversation between his mother and his grandfather in which his grandfather said that they had taken this bond just as he had agreed before its execution. That, he took it to secure his support in case he should come to want and that no part of it was ever to be collected unless it was necessary for the support of the parents of the defendant; that he thought he had enough property to give him a comfortable support without ever requiring his son to pay any part of this bond, but he wanted to make it sure he wmuld have enough to live on in his old age, or that in substance. That he had taken this bond under that agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\">\u201cTo be followed by other witnesses who will testify that Reuben Young told them that this bond had been given to him by Isaac to secure his support in case he should come to want. That\u2018it was the understanding between them that no part of it was ever to be collected unless it was needed for that purpose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">The objection was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">\u201c 1. Counsel for plaintiff object to the offer as incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">\u201c 2. That it does not propose to show any parol agreement between Reuben Young and Isaac Young at the time of signing or the execution of the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">\u201c 3. That the conversations or declarations of Reuben Young and Isaac Young before the bond was signed are incompetent, because it is presumed that every agreement or every conversation that they had before the signing of the bond was merged in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-9\">\u201c4. That the subsequent declarations of Reuben Young are incompetent as evidence, unless the verbal contract alleged was made at the time of the execution or signing of the bond.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-10\">By the Court: \u201c Objection overruled and bill-sealed for plaintiff.\u201d [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Other offers of evidence of a similar character were admitted under objection and exception. [2-6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-4\">The court charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">\u201c [The evidence offered upon the part of the defendant for the purpose of showing what took place at the time of the execution of the bond is by the evidence of witnesses, the first of which was that of Benjamin F. Young, who testifies as follows : \u2018We were at the breakfast table when grandfather came in, and he sat down and said that he had that fixed now where he could let father have that forty acres of land, and that he was going to deed it to him as he had agreed to do, and they talked awhile and finally he said he would have to ask a favor of him to give him a bond for his support, and he proposed to do the business that day; they said they would hitch up and go to Towanda, and they went. My mother said she would rather that he should keep it in his own hands than to give a bond, if he wanted to let them have the use of it to do so, and she did not think it advisable to give a bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">\u201c \u2018Q. What did your grandfather say to that, if anything? A. Why, he said it was all right; that there would be no harm in giving the bond. He said you will never have to pay anything on it unless I come to want and need it for my support and wife\u2019s, and then he said I shall ask you to pay something on it whenever we need it.\u2019'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-7\">\u201cNow then, gentlemen, that conversation standing by itself, being before the execution of the bond, would not be sufficient to set aside the obligation, because when parties enter into a written instrument and execute it, in the contemplation of the law, they merge all former conversations and agreements into the written agreement; but there is something further in connection with this conversation. In a few days afterwards, from three days to a week, the grandfather of the witness (Reuben Young) came to Isaac Young\u2019s house and there had a conversation with Mrs. Young, Isaac Young being away at the time ; as the reporter has it, \u2018 Grandfather came over there and father was not there, and mother and him got to talking about it, and he said that they had made the arrangement just as they had talked, and mother did not really seem to fall in sympathy with it then, and he went on to explain to her that all he took that bond for was in case he should use up all the other prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>erty that he had, and then he would want something to take care of himself with, so as not to be dependent on other people, and he told her she need not worry, that it would be all right just as he had said.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-4\">\u25a0 \u201c Now then, gentlemen, it is for you to determine what Reuben Young meant when he said they had made the arrangement just as they had talked. Does that refer to the conversation that they had had in the presence of Mrs. Young in which she had taken a part the morning of the execution of this bond ? If it does mean that, then it would mean that the bond had been executed upon the conditions and terms which they had talked the morning before starting to Towanda, at Isaac Young\u2019s.] [9] . . . [But if you find from the evidence and declarations of Reuben Young that at the time that that bond was executed that it rvas agreed that he should hold it for his support, and that Isaac Young should not be called upon to pay anything upon it unless he came to want, and you are satisfied that this evidence upon which you find your verdict is of such character that it is clear, precise and satisfactory, then we say that you should find for the defendant.] [14]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s points were, among others, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">\u201c 1. That inasmuch as no witness in this case has testified to having been present at the time of the signing or delivery of the bond in question, nor that he heard anything that was said, nor saw anything that was done at such time between or by either of the parties thereto, your verdict must be for the plaintiff. <em>Answer: We </em>refuse this point; we are \u25a0 of the opinion that the Supreme Court have never yet gone that far, unless we are mistaken, and if we are the Supreme Court will correct us and we shall be very glad to follow any indications that they shall give us.\u201d [17].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">\u201c 8. The bond in this case is presumed to contain the whole contract between Reuben Young and his son, Isaac L. Young, and that all previous conversations and talks between the parties are presumed to have entered into and merged in the bond, and the jury must so find unless satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that another part of the agreement was in fact made at the time the bond was executed, but bjr fraud, accident or mistake was omitted from the writing. . <em>Answer: We </em>refuse to charge you as requested here. If the parties entered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>that arrangement although there was no fraud, accident or mistake, if Reuben Young or his executor afterward undertook to use the bond for a purpose that was not contemplated and contrary to the agreement of the parties at the time the bond was executed, then we say that the defendant would be entitled to recover, for that would be a fraud.\u201d [18]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-3\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.
