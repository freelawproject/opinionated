On the morning of Nov. 26, 1892, plaintiff worked at taking plates off the rails, and. then was ordered to assist in carrying iron rails from the outer or Market street side of the trestle to the inner or central portion of the structure and deposit them there. In order to carry the iron rails to the place where they were being piled, it was necessary for the plaintiff to hold his end of a grabber clasped to a rail, and step from joist to joist across a space from which the flooring had been removed. On returning from one of these trips, shortly after he began to carry rails, he stepped upon a timber apparently solid and fixed, but, in reality, insecure, which tilted up and threw him to the ground beneath, a distance of about twenty-five feet, inflicting upon him permanent external and internal injuries. There was no evidence to show that the company knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care, could have discovered the insecurity of the timber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-7\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit' which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-9\"><em>Charles B. </em>McMiehael, for appellant, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah7\">P. &amp; R.

It does not appear that it knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered the insecurity of the \u201c timber, apparently solid and fixed but in reality insecure,\u201d upon which plaintiff stepped and was thrown \u201c to the ground beneath, a distance of twenty or twenty-five feet.\u201d In brief, there is not a <em>scintilla </em>of evidence tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s serious injury was the result of any negligence of the defendant company or its agents. On the contrary, it is quite clear that it was due solely to risk incident to the work in which plaintiff and his colaborers were engaged, viz: in dismantling. the company\u2019s elevated structures or trestlework at Seventeenth and Filbert streets, preparatory to the extension of its depot. This work involved the taking up of the flooring on the trestles, the removal of the plates by which the rails were secured, and the taking up of the rails themselves. In thus demolishing the structure and removing the material, it was necessary for the men engaged therein to pass to and fro over the partially dismantled structure. The risk of such an employment must have been obvious to any one. It was an ordinary and apparent risk necessarily incident to the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">There was therefore no error in refusing to take off the judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
