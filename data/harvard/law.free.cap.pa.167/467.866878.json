To take the demand out of the statute certain declarations of the decedent were given in evidence by which, according to one witness, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>decedent said, sometime in 1893, that he intended to set the claimant up in business and to pay for his license, because he owed the claimant about $2,000. Two other witnesses deposed to the same declaration, except that the acknowledgment of the indebtedness was for $3,000 or $4,000. The undisputed testimony was that the decedent had taken care of the claimant when the latter was a mere child; had sent him to school, and had afterwards employed him to do odd chores about the tavern, and had finally placed him behind the bar as bartender. During the five years which intervened between the date at which the claimant left the service of the decedent, and the date of the decedent\u2019s death, the claimant, so far as was shown, made no claim for wages and no demand for payment. The reported declarations of the decedent, varying as they did with the different recollections of the witnesses, will not avail to overcome the presumption which custom has raised, that the claimant received periodical wages \u2014 a presumption which his own conduct unquestionably strengthened. The claim is rejected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-4\">Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by the court without an opinion filed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in rejecting claim of Samuel Ferguson.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-6\"><em>Thomas R. </em>Elcoclc, for appellant, cited,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJc\">Swires v.

The bar of the statute had therefore closed on the claim before it was presented for participation in the fund for distribution. Aside from the circumstances attending the alleged indebtedness, the fact that for several years the testator stood in loco parentis to appellant, the staleness of the claim, etc., \u2014 all of which were calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>to render its original validity at least doubtful, \u2014 the testimony relied on by appellant was too vague and uncertain to remove the bar of the statute. The court was therefore right in concluding that if appellant ever had a valid unpaid claim against his benefactor it was barred by the statute. For reasons given by the learned auditing judge the claim was rightly excluded from participation in the fund for distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
