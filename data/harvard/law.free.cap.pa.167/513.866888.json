H. Richardson &amp; Co.\u201d He drew a draft on Richardson and Co., which a bank discounted, taking the bill of lading as collateral security for the payment of the draft. The draft was sent to Richardson &amp; Co. at Pitts-burg, who refused to pay it, and it was returned to Chicago, with the bill of lading. The indorsement on the bill of lading was canceled, and a blank indorsement made. Subsequently Richardson &amp; Co. attached the goods in Pittsburg under a foreign attachment. The bank obtained leave to intervene as garnishee, and gave bond as provided by the act of June 13, 1874, P. <em>L. </em>285. The bank having obtained the goods by dissolution of the attachment, sold them without an order of court, at public auction, after having given due notice to Richardson &amp; Co. of the time and place of sale. The goods brought less than their actual value. In an action by Richardson &amp; Co. against the bank to recover the difference between the actual value of the goods and the price obtained at the sale, <em>Held </em>(1) that the indorsements on the bill of lading did not affect the rights of the bank; (2) that as the intention of the parties was to make the goods a pledge for the repayment of the sum advanced on the draft, delivery without indorsement was sufficient to accomplish the purpose intended; (3) that the effect of the delivery was to invest the bank with the rights of a purchaser of the property, so far as it might be necessary -to exercise such rights for the bank\u2019s protection; (4) that under the circumstances an order of court was not neee'ssary to authorize and validate the sale.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>After the seizure and prior to the dissolution of the attachment, the property was in custodia legis and could not be lawfully sold without an order of the court, but after the attachment was dissolved the rights and powers of the appellant to and over it were the same as before the seizure, subject only to the duty of retention imposed by its bond.

From this it had a right to have deducted the amount of its lien and proper charges, which, by this finding of the jury, leaves defendant liable for $375.05, for which sum it is now ordered that judgment be entered upon the question of law reserved in favor of plaintiff, with costs on payment of the verdict fee.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above order.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-7\"><em>Charles P. </em>Orr, <em>Thomas C.

The attaching creditor received notice of the public sale of the goods. His rights are no higher or greater than the pledgor\u2019s: Good v. Grant, 76 Pa. 52; Baugh v. Kirkpatrick, 54 Pa. 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-8\">Having paid for the draft the bank became the owner of the rails until it was reimbursed its advancement: Dows v.

Leo </em>Weil, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axnj\">The proceedings under the act of 1874 by the defendant in the court below were unauthorized. Appellant had no right or authority to sell the \u201c scrap steel rails and ends \u201d unless authorized to do so by an order of court. The act makes the transferee the owner for some purpose, not for all; he is only owner so as to give validity and security to his lien. Appellant was not the transferee of said bills of lading at the time the goods were attached: Holmes v. Bailey, 92 Pa. 57; Holmes v. Bank, 87 Pa. 525.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-5\">The right to proceeds of goods consigned to another or to a lien on the price, gives no lien on the goods : Chilton v. Barrington, 15 C. B. 95; Holland v. Humble, 1 Starkie, 143; Bryans v. Nix, 4 M. &amp; W. 775.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-6\">Under the plea of nulla bona, appellant proved a lien, and therefore the judgment for plaintiff entered by the court below was right: Bissell v. Steel, 67 Pa. 443; Allen v. Bank, 57 Pa. 139; Reed v. Penrose\u2019s Exrs., 36 Pa. 214; 1 Troubat &amp; Haly, 700, sec. 1202.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_Gb\">April 29, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"At5\">Mr. Justice McCollum,</author>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">We think the indorsements on the bills of lading cannot, under the circumstances shown by the special verdict, be justly considered as injuriously affecting the rights of the appellant to the property specified in the bills. The delivery of them was obviously made, accepted and intended as a pledge of the property as security for the sum advanced or paid on the draft to which they were attached, The purpose of the parties being evident, delivery without indorsement was sufficient to accomplish it: Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co. v. The German Security Bank, 87 Pa. 525. The indorsements which are thought by the appellee\u2019s counsel to afford his clients some advantages and to abridge the rights of the appellant in this contest, were in the following words, to wit: \u201c Deliver to the order of J. H. Richardson &amp; Co.\u201d These indorsements were probably regarded by the consignor as nothing more than a direction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the pledgee to deliver the property specified in the bills, to the appellees on their acceptance and pa3^ment of the draft, together with charges for transportation, storage, etc. His cancellation of the indorsements on their refusal to honor his draft is in accord with this view and with what we have seen was his purpose in delivering the bills. The indorsements were not intended to qualify the rights of the pledgee and we cannot assent to a construction of them which would defeat the common purpose of the parties to the transaction, which, we think, should be considered in the determination of this issue as if the indorsements had not been made. Thus considered, the effect of it was to invest the appellant with the rights of a purchaser of the property, so far as it might be necessary to exercise such rights for its protection: 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 243, and cases there cited. In other words, the appellant, after the delivery of the bills, must be deemed and taken to have been the owner of the property for the accomplishment of the purpose for which it was pledged: Act of Sept. 24, 1867, P. L. 1363, Purd. Dig. p. 145. Having acquired this position by virtue of the delivery to it of the bills of lading it was made a garnishee of the property under the act of June 13,1874, P. L. 285, Purd. Dig. p. 146, and as such applied for and obtained, in conformity with its provisions, a dissolution of the attachment. . The dissolution thus effected released the property from the grasp of the attachment, and the garnishee sold it at public auction after having given due notice to the appellees of the time and place of sale. The latter alleging that the property was worth more than it was sold for were allowed to recover in this proceeding a judgment for the difference between the sum obtained for it and its actual value, on the ground that the sale was made without an order of court. Was such an order necessary to authorize and validate the sale ? We think it was not. A sale of the property or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy liens for advances and for freight and storage charges is evidently contemplated by the act under which the appellant became a party to the suit. The bond required on the dissolution of the attachment is in accord with this view. It provides for the retention by the garnishee for the purpose stated in it, of so much of the property or its proceeds as shall remain after the sale of the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>or part of it and the payment of such liens. After seizure and prior to the dissolution of the attachment, the property was in custodia legis and could not be lawfully sold without an order of court, but after the attachment was dissolved the rights and powers of the appellant to and over it were the same as before the seizure, subject only to the duty of retention imposed by its bond. It follows from what has been said, that we regard the sale made as valid, and that the appellees cannot recover from the appellant the difference between the value of the property, and what it sold for. Ample opportunity was afforded them to become bidders at the sale, and if they had availed themselves of it, they would have acquired the property for less than its value or compelled the successful bidder to pay a fair price for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
