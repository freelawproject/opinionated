This team had come into Seventeenth street from Filbert street which was about two hundred feet north of Market street. The testimony of plaintiff and one other witness, was that when plaintiff was struck, the horse pulling the wagon rvas galloping. The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">\u201c The city of Philadelphia, the defendant in this case, sets up as the first proposition of its defense the point that it is not liable for the negligent acts of the employees and officers of the Electrical Bureau, upon the ground that that bureau was not a department of the municipal government, but was constituted solely for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of the citizens, and in this respect was in the performance of a voluntary duty; and hence, if injur}' occurred through the negligence of any one employed by that department, the city could not be held liable; but the evidence introduced by the ordinances of councils, and the evidence of the assistant manager or superintendent of that department shows that that department derives a revenue Avhich is paid into the city treasury, by reason of certain grants or privileges to private citizens and private corporations, and that, therefore, its management and conduct contributes to the income of the city; and hence, for that reason, I, in the first instance, and for the purpose of this case, rule that the city is responsible for the acts of the employees of this department.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">\u201c Its employees are the servants of the city in the performance of municipal duty, for the benefit of the city, and hence Ave must come to the real merits of the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Defendant presented this point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">\u201c Under all the evidence in this case, your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Ansiuer : </em>Refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,000.

In the performance of municipal duties, for the benefit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>city, the employees of the bureau are in fact the servants of the city, in like manner as are the employees of its gas and water departments. \u201c When a municipal corporation transacts business as a vendor and distributor of water, the relation of her employees is that of servants to her, and the maxim \u2018 respondeat superior\u2019 applies to their acts and negligences in conducting this business: \u201d Philadelphia v. Gilmartin, 71 Pa. 140, 158, and cases cited. In Kibele v. Philadelphia, 105 Pa. 41, 45, it was said: \u201c The city, as a manufacturer and vendor of gas, was bound to know all about its character and to take care that through the default of its officers or agents the article which it manufactured and sold was the occasion of harm to no one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In no proper sense, can the Electrical Bureau be regarded as \u201c a branch of the police power of the municipality.\u201d The learned trial judge was therefore clearly right in holding that it was a revenue producing department of the municipal government, and consequently the citj'- is liable for the negligent acts of its employees therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The only other specification is the refusal of the court to withdraw the case from the jury by directing a verdict for the defendant. To have done so, would have been plain error. In view of the testimony, tending to prove that the careless and reckless driving of the employee of the Electrical Bureau was the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury, the case was necessarily for the exclusive consideration of the jury; and to them it was fairly submitted with instructions to which no exception was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
