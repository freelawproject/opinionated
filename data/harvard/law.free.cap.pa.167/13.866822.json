T., 1894, by Alice Hart, from order of C. P. Berks Co., Nov. T., 1893, Nos. 16 and 17, in William Hart v. Eli Hart, allowing a debtor\u2019s exemption.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Az\">Before Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A1C\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-9\">Exceptions to claim of exemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-10\">From the record it appeared that execution was issued on November 3, 1893, and a return of nulla bona was indorsed on the writ. Alice Hart, the appellant, was a lien creditor of defendant. On November 6, 1893, defendant\u2019s real estate was levied upon, and on the same day the sheriff gave notice of inquisition to the defendant. The court below found as a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>that on November 11, 1893, defendant\u2019s agent made a verbal demand on the sheriff for the benefit of the exemption law, a few minutes after the property had been condemned. On December 8, 1893, defendant\u2019s attorneys gave written notice to the sheriff, that defendant claimed the benefit of the exemption law. Appraisers were appointed who reported that the property could not be divided. On December 16,1893, the property was sold by the sheriff. Exceptions were filed to defendant\u2019s claim for the benefit of the exemption law, filed December 8, 1893, the same having been claimed and filed after the real estate sold under the above execution had been condemned; also to the appraisement in accordance with the provisions of the act of April 9, 1849, made and filed December 15, 1893.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">The court in an opinion by Ermentrout, P. J., dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the appraisement.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, among others, (2) in confirming the appraisement; (3) in dismissing the exceptions, as above, quoting them.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-7\"><em>II. P. Reiser, J. II. Jacobs </em>with him, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayk\">Where real estate is levied upon the exemption should be claimed before inquisition: Bowyer\u2019s App., 21 Pa. 210; Com. v. Boyd, 56 Pa. 402; Miller\u2019s App., 16 Pa. 300; Weaver\u2019s App., 18 Pa. 307; Brant\u2019s App., 20 Pa. 141.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-8\"><em>Ermentrout Ruhl, </em>for appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq5\">were not heard, but in their printed brief said: The debtor\u2019s exemption allowed by the act of 1849, is favored in the law and is always allowed by the courts, unless the claimant has been so neglectful in asserting his claim that creditors are prejudiced thereby: Hallman v. Hallman, 124 Pa. 357 ; Shelly\u2019s App., 36 Pa. 380.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-9\">There must be a demand or notice; but any words which are sufficient to apprise the officer that the statutory exemption is the thing claimed, are sufficient.: Diehl v. Holden, 39 Pa. 217 ; Keller v. Bricker, 64 Pa. 379; Bowman v. Smiley, 31 Pa. 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-10\">The demand made on November 11, 1893, was in time: Com. v. Boyd, 56 Pa. 402; Yost v. Heffner, 69 Pa. 68; Cornman\u2019s App., 90 Pa. 254; Williamson v. Krumbhaar, 132 Pa. 455; Seibert\u2019s App., 73 Pa. 359.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ax9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>March 18, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b37-4\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">This case was rightly decided in the court below. A claim for the benefit of the exemption law need not be in writing: Keller v. Bricker, 64 Pa. 379. It may be made within a reasonable time after the defendant has notice of the writ provided it does not delay the sale of the goods or the land levied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
