L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (a), requiring that a trial be held within sixty days of the district attorney\u2019s petition to the court for a trial to commit a prisoner as a sexually dangerous person, is to be interpreted as an absolute time limitation, requiring dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>of the case if the trial is not held or formally continued for good cause within that period. General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (a), states in pertinent part: \u201cThe district attorney or the attorney general at the request of the district attorney may petition the court for a trial which shall be by jury unless affirmatively waived by the person named in the petition. Such petition shall be made within 14 days of the filing of the report of the two qualified examiners. If such petition is timely filed within the allowed time, the court shall notify the person named in the petition and his attorney, the district attorney and the attorney general that a trial by jury will be held within 60 days to determine whether such person is a sexually dangerous person. The trial may be continued upon motion of either party for good cause shown or by the court on its own motion if the interests of justice so require, unless the person named in the petition will be substantially prejudiced thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute. The defendant was convicted of rape in 1984. The Commonwealth received notice on April 12, 2000, that the defendant would be released from his sentence on October 7, 2000. On August 1, 2000, the Commonwealth filed a petition for commitment of DeBella as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(e), </em>the Superior Court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for temporary detention on September 12, 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 10 and 11, 2000, a Superior Court judge held an adversary hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>to determine whether probable cause existed to believe the defendant was a sexually dangerous person, as required by G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge determined that there was probable cause to find that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person, and ordered him committed to the treatment center for the sixty-day evaluation period mandated by G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reports of two qualified examiners were filed on November 24, 2000, and on December 4, 2000, the district attorney petitioned the Superior Court for a trial to commit the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 14 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The sixty-day period for holding the trial expired on February 2, 2001, and there is no record of a motion to continue the trial beyond that date. The only other entries on the docket during this period were the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for discovery, filed on March 2, 2001, and defendant\u2019s motion, filed on April 6, 2001, to dismiss the case for exceeding the statutory time limit of \u00a7 14 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The Commonwealth has presented unrebutted evidence, in the form of an affidavit of the assistant district attorney handling the case, that the Commonwealth \u201cspoke to [defense] counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>regarding setting a date for discovery motions and pretrial conference [and] a trial date.\u201d The Commonwealth believed that defense counsel had \u201climited . . . availability\u201d to appear in court during December, 2000, and January, 2001. Defense counsel asked the assistant district attorney to put the case on the list for a status hearing on February 28, 2001, a date beyond the sixty-day time frame of \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>which the assistant district attorney apparently did. The affidavit also states that defense counsel did not appear in court at the status hearing on February 28, 2001, and could not be located. On March 2, 2001, the Commonwealth sent a letter to defense counsel seeking his participation in scheduling a \u201cnew date.\u201d The Commonwealth followed up by contacting defense counsel on March 15, 2001, and the attorney stated that he would call back \u201cwith a date\u201d but \u201cwould probably be\u201d unavailable until \u201cthe week of March 26, 2001.\u201d The next action by defense counsel was the filing of a motion to dismiss on April 6, 2001. At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, defense counsel did not dispute any of the averments of the assistant district attorney and nothing in the record indicates that the defendant now contests any of these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">On May 3, 2001, a Superior Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, continuing the matter for the setting of a trial date. On May 14, 2001, the defendant filed his first motion for funds for a defense expert\u2019s examination. He filed a second motion for funds on June 6, 2001. Both motions were allowed. On January 31, 2002, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the motion to dismiss, which was denied on February 14, 2002. The defendant waived his right to a trial by jury; a judge found the defendant to be a sexually dangerous person as defined in G. L. c. 123A; and he was committed for treatment under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(d).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The denials of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>motion to dismiss and the motion for reconsideration form the basis of the appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In interpreting the requirements of \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>we look first to the language of the statute. \u201c[Statutory language is the principal source of insight into legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 392 </em>Mass. 407, 415 (1984), quoting <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984). The words of a statute are to be given their ordinary and natural meanings. <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., supra, </em>citing <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 610 (1983). When the ordinary meanings of words yield \u201ca workable and logical result, there is no need to resort to extrinsic aids in interpreting the statute.\u201d <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>requires that, if a petition for trial is filed, \u201cthe court shall notify the person named in the petition and his attorney, the district attorney and the attorney general that a trial by jury will be held within 60 days to determine whether such person is a sexually dangerous person.\u201d Although articulated as a requirement of notice to the parties, the language of the statute leaves no doubt as to the Legislature\u2019s intent that such trials commence within the sixty-day time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">We construe the provision \u201cwill be held within 60 days\u201d as requiring that trial be commenced, albeit not necessarily completed, within that period. The phrase could be interpreted as requiring that trial must begin and end within this time, reflecting the Legislature\u2019s concern with the defendant\u2019s liberty interest. Given the innumerable variables that influence the \u2022length of a trial, we think it unlikely that the Legislature intended to impose a strict requirement on when a trial must end. Therefore, we conclude that \u00a7 14 (a) requires that trial be begun within sixty days of the filing of the petition for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>However, the statute also contains explicit exceptions: \u201c[t]he trial may be continued upon motion of either party for good cause shown or by the court on its own motion if the interests of justice so require, unless the person named in the petition will be substantially prejudiced thereby.\u201d These exceptions to the statutory sixty-day requirement must be construed strictly as they are exceptions to a general provision. See <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Executive Office of Communities &amp; Dev., </em>411 Mass. 599, 604-605 (1992), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>254 Mass. 617, 620 (1926) (when general provision of statute is followed by proviso or exception, exception is to be interpreted narrowly as carving out specific area in which general provision does not apply). Close adherence to the language of a statute and its express exclusions is even more important where a defendant\u2019s freedom is involved and there are due process considerations. \u201cWhile commitment proceedings under c. 123A are civil proceedings, the potential deprivation of liberty to those persons subjected to these proceedings \u2018mandates that due process protections apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 502 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>372 Mass. 238, 250 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Although the exceptions to the time limit in \u00a7 14 (a) must be strictly construed, those exceptions permit more flexibility than do the time requirements of other civil commitment provisions. General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 7 (c), states that hearings on petitions for commitment to a mental health facility of certain persons \u201cshall be commenced within 14 days of the filing of the petition, unless a delay is requested by the person or his counsel.\u201d This provision permits delay in more limited circumstances (only when the delay is requested by the person or his counsel) than does \u00a7 14 (a). See <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, supra </em>at 609-610. The <em>Hashimi </em>case, which considered the language of G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 7 <em>(c), </em>thus does not control here.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Similarly, the defendant\u2019s contention that our ruling in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>435 Mass. 527 (2001), dictates the outcome of the present case is incorrect. The <em>Kennedy </em>case interpreted the schedule set forth in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>which states that, once the court has made a finding of probable cause that a prisoner is a sexually dangerous person, \u201cthe prisoner or youth shall be committed to the treatment center for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>a period not exceeding 60 days for the purpose of examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners who shall, no later than 15 days prior to the expiration of said period, file with the court a written report of the examination and diagnosis.\u201d That case concluded that a violation of the sixty-day time limit for evaluation required dismissal when the defendant had been in \u201ctemporary\u201d commitment for more than fifteen months. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 530-531. However, \u00a7 13 (a) makes no allowance for relaxation of its time periods. Thus, it would be inappropriate to import the constraints of \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>which allows no extension of its sixty-day limit, into \u00a7 14 (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In view of the language of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (a), and in light of the significance of an individual\u2019s freedom, the Commonwealth must ensure that trial is commenced within sixty days<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> unless the judge makes a finding, based on supporting evidence, that there is good cause to continue the trial or that it is otherwise in the interests of justice to do so. Any request to continue the case beyond the sixty-day period must appear on the record, supported by \u201cgood cause,\u201d with record made of the judicial action taken, and the reasons therefor. If the court determines on its own motion that the interests of justice require a continuance, the record must so reflect, again with adequate findings. The findings must not simply repeat the wording of the statute; they must reflect the specific grounds presented to the judge. Any continuance must take into consideration prejudice to the person named in the petition. Our holding that findings with respect to continuances must be on the record is not an additional demand beyond the language of the statute, but merely an affirmation of the requirements of \u00a7 14 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The concept in \u00a7 14 <em>(a) </em>that certain procedures must occur within a particular time frame unless delayed for good cause or in the interests of justice, is a familiar one. We have dealt in the past with similar requirements. Rule 36 (b) (2) (F) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 909 (1979), allows continuances of criminal trials if a judge makes findings that the interests of justice outweigh the public interest in a speedy trial. This serves the goals of letting parties protect themselves from the rigors of the rule while encouraging cases to be tried swiftly. See <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 285, 297-298 (1983).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The same can be said of \u00a7 14 <em>(a). </em>The court and the parties have applied the provisions of rule 36 for many years now, and should have little difficulty dealing with similar considerations here.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In the peculiar circumstances of this case, as the judge found, where there is uncontradicted evidence that the defendant acquiesced in the delay, the Commonwealth has shown \u201cgood cause\u201d for exceeding the sixty-day limit. The Commonwealth communicated with defense counsel about setting a trial date and defense counsel requested that the case be put \u201con the first session [not the trial] list\u201d for a date beyond the sixty-day limit. Defense counsel then failed to appear on the status date he had requested, and later sought another delay of the status hearing until late March, almost two months beyond the end of the sixty-day period. Finally, counsel, despite the impoverishment of his client, did not file his two motions for funds to pay for necessary expert testimony until after losing the motion to dismiss. This timing indicates that counsel was not prepared to go to trial within the sixty-day period. In contrast, nothing in the record suggests that the Commonwealth contributed to the delay of the trial. Furthermore, there has been no showing of prejudice to the defendant, and the defendant makes no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>claim. Thus, there is nothing to suggest that the delay at issue here \u201csubstantially prejudiced\u201d the defendant, or that any prejudice would have prevented the allowance of a continuance. See \u00a7 14 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We do not pass on whether a continuance should have been granted had the scheduling of this case proceeded in a more formal manner, i.e., by a defense motion for a continuance beyond the sixty days due to counsel\u2019s unavailability. The purpose of the statute is to have cases brought to trial rapidly, but not to deny justice in the interest of expediency. While obviously the focus of the statute is on the defendant\u2019s right to have his status adjudicated as rapidly as possible, there is also a public interest in having these proceedings terminate as quickly as possible. Thus, we do not endorse the granting of continuances merely for the convenience of counsel. However, it would be unfair, on the facts here, to attribute the delay to the Commonwealth, and \u00a7 14 <em>(a) </em>does not require a dismissal of the petition on this record. The order denying the motion to dismiss is affirmed as is the motion denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The text of G.
