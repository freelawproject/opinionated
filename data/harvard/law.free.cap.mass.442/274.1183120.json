L. c. 93A? That is the central issue in this case commenced by Georgia Darviris and her husband against James G. Petros, a surgeon, who performed an excisional hemorrhoidectomy on Darviris without her consent, she alleges, and in violation of what has been termed the \u201cpatients\u2019 bill of rights,\u201d G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E. Resolution of the question determines the outcome of the case because, as we shall explain, the remaining claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Petros moved for summary judgment, arguing that the G. L. c. 93A claim failed to state a cause of action, and the remaining claims were barred by the statute of limitations. A judge in the Superior Court agreed, and allowed his motion. The Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Darviris </em>v. <em>Petros, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 323 (2003). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for further appellate review, and now affirm the judgment of the Superior Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">1. <em>Background. </em>We relate the record facts in their light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the nonmoving parties on the motion for summary judgment. See <em>Remy </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>440 Mass. 675, 676 (2004). On December 14, 1995, Darviris sought treatment from James Petros for rectal bleeding and pain. According to Darviris, Petros recommended a simple surgical procedure, a fissurectomy, which involves cauterizing the anal fissures. Petros informed Darviris of possible side effects of that procedure, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>said such effects were unlikely and could, in any event, be corrected by a procedure that could be performed in his office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Before her surgery, scheduled for January 10, 1996, the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms abated, and she inquired of Petros whether she should cancel the surgery. He assured her that the surgery was necessary because her symptoms were \u201cchronic,\u201d and she agreed to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">A few days before the surgery, the plaintiff went for a preoperative evaluation to the hospital where Petros was to perform the surgery. There she signed, but did not read, a consent form; the form authorized Petros to perform a fissurectomy. Darviris also consented \u201cto the performance of operations, procedures, and treatment in addition to or different from those now contemplated,\u201d which Petros in his judgment may \u201cconsider necessary or advisable in my present illness.\u201d Although the consent form stated to the contrary,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Darviris also testified at her deposition that no one discussed a fissurectomy, a hemorrhoidectomy, or any other procedure with her at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">On January 10, 1996, the plaintiff underwent surgery, as scheduled. At her request, and after discussion with an anesthesiologist, she received a spinal anesthesia, and remained awake throughout the procedure. She testified that, during the surgery, neither Petros nor any assistant discussed the procedure being performed on her. It was only after surgery that Petros told Darviris in the recovery room that he had performed a hemorrhoidectomy, and not a fissurectomy. Darviris became very upset, and informed Petros that she had not consented to a hemorrhoidectomy and would not have given any such consent because her godfather had suffered greatly as a consequence of undergoing the same procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Beginning the following day, and for the following two months, Darviris experienced terrible pain, which she attributed to the hemorrhoidectomy. Petros saw her weekly for follow-up visits, repeatedly assuring her that she was improving. Because Darviris continued to experience extreme pain, on Petros\u2019s advice, she underwent a second surgery conducted by Petros on March 10, 1996, during which Petros noted that one of the hemorrhoidectomy wounds had not healed. Sometime thereafter Darviris sought treatment from a different physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The plaintiffs filed their complaint on March 8, 1999, more than three years after the first surgery, but less than three years after the second surgery. An amended six-count complaint, filed on June 7, 1999, alleged three different theories for the defendant\u2019s failure to obtain his patient\u2019s consent for a hemorrhoidectomy \u2014 simple battery, failure of informed consent, and violation of G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 and claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress, violation of G. L. c. 93A, and loss of consortium, the husband\u2019s only claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">2. <em>Chapter 93A claim. </em>In ruling against the claim that Petros\u2019s alleged unauthorized surgery constituted an unfair or deceptive act in violation of G. L. c. 93A, the judge in the Superior Court concluded that \u201can unfair or deceptive act requires more than a finding of negligence.\u201d Because she found no such showing, the judge granted summary judgment on the G. L. c. 93A claim. Relying primarily on <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 243 (1991), and <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 577 (1978), Darviris argues that G. L. c. 93A applies to all unfair or deceptive practices, including those that arise \u201cin the context of a patient-physician relationship.\u201d The defendant\u2019s failure to obtain her informed consent to perform a hemorrhoidectomy, she says, constituted either a negligent omission of fact or a misrepresentation of fact, claims that are encompassed, she asserts, by G. L. c. 93A. In addition, she argues that the claimed violation of G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E, constitutes a per se violation of G. L. c. 93A, because the \u201cpatients\u2019 bill of rights\u201d statute was promulgated \u201cfor the protection of the public\u2019s health, safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>and welfare.\u201d See 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3) (1993).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We reject each argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u201cThe purpose of G. L. c. 93A is to improve the commercial relationship between consumers and business persons and to encourage more equitable behavior in the marketplace.\u201d <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>417 Mass. 48, 53 (1994). While G. L. c. 93A is a statute of \u201cbroad impact,\u201d <em>Greenfield Country Estates Tenants Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Deep, </em>423 Mass. 81, 88 (1996), and cases cited, the limits of which are not precisely defined, <em>Mechanics Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Killeen, </em>377 Mass. 100, 109 (1979), a violation of G. L. c. 93A requires, at the very least, more than a finding of mere negligence, as the Superior Court judge correctly noted. See <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>429 Mass. 410, 424 (1999) (concluding that a client\u2019s G. L. c. 93A, claims against her attorney did not suggest any unfair or deceptive acts, \u201cbut instead sound[ed] in negligence\u201d); <em>Poly </em>v. <em>Moylan, </em>423 Mass. 141, 151 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1114 (1997) (negligent representation by attorney did not violate G. L. c. 93A, where attorney \u201cdid not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u201d); <em>Squeri </em>v. <em>McCarrick, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 203, 207 (1992) (\u201cA negligent act standing by itself does not give rise to a claim under [G. L.] c. 93A. There must in addition be evidence that the negligence was or resulted in an unfair or deceptive act or practice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">No less than a claim of legal malpractice, a claim for the negligent delivery of medical care, without more, does not qualify for redress under our consumer protection statute, G. L. c. 93A. As the Appeals Court noted, Petros may have been negligent \u201cin attending to his patient\u2019s preferences,\u201d but the record does not evidence that his conduct was unfair or deceptive, \u201cparticularly where the plaintiff admits she signed a consent form, without reading it, six days before the surgery.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Darviris </em>v. <em>Petros, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 323, 329 (2003), citing <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Nepomuceno, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 683, 685 (1998).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">While we have no hesitancy in concluding that the negligent provision of medical care, without more, does not give rise to a claim under G. L. c. 93A, this does not mean that all conduct of medical care providers is beyond the reach of that statute. As appellate courts in other jurisdictions have concluded, consumer protection statutes may be applied to the entrepreneurial and business aspects of providing medical services, for example, advertising and billing, even though those statutes do not reach medical malpractice claims. See, e.g., <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hosp., </em>243 Conn. 17, 37-38 (1997) (claim under consumer protection statute against health care provider must concern entrepreneurial or business aspect of provision of medical services); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Stephenson, </em>84 S.W.3d 926, 928 (Ky. Ct. App. 2002) (consumer protection statute applies only to entrepreneurial, commercial, or business aspect of the practice of medicine); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Ho, </em>222 Mich. App. 74, 82-84 (1997) (only allegations that concern entrepreneurial, commercial, or business aspect of physician\u2019s practice may be brought under consumer protection statute); <em>Karlin </em>v. <em>IVF Am., Inc., </em>93 N.Y.2d 282, 293-294 (1999) (dissemination of deceptive and misleading advertisements and promotional materials is consumer-oriented conduct that is targeted by consumer protection statute); <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>45 Wash. App. 175, 179-180 (1986) (lack of informed consent claim against healthcare provider may fall within scope of consumer protection statute if it concerns entrepreneurial aspect of medical practice). See also <em>Dorn </em>v. <em>McTigue, </em>121 F. Supp. 2d 17, 19-20 (D.D.C. 2000) (interpreting District of Columbia consumer protection statute); <em>Gadson </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>807 F. Supp. 1412, 1422 (C.D. Ill. 1992) (interpreting Illinois consumer protection statute); <em>Keyser </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hosp., Inc., </em>662 F. Supp. 191, 194 (D. Idaho 1987) (interpreting Idaho consumer protection statute). As the Supreme Court of Connecticut aptly noted, \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would transform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>every claim for medical malpractice into a [consumer protection act] claim.\u201d <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hosp., supra </em>at 38. Cf. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, supra </em>at 577 (\u201c[W]e distinguish those c. 93A actions which allege unfair trade practices in medical treatment from those which merely raise such questions as fraudulent or deceptive billing practices by a health care provider . . . In the latter case . . . there would be no issue of medical \u2018malpractice, error or mistake\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We therefore consider whether Darviris\u2019s allegations against Petros concern any entrepreneurial or business aspect of his medical practice, to which G. L. c. 93A could apply, or whether they state merely a claim for the negligent delivery of medical care. To do so we consider the underlying nature of the claim. See <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Wagner, supra </em>at 424. Darviris alleges that she consented to a fissurectomy but not a hemorrhoidectomy, from which she suffered painful and unanticipated side effects. If Petros intended to perform a hemorrhoidectomy and did not advise Darviris of that possible treatment nor inform her of the risks attendant to that surgery, he may indeed be faulted for negligent failure to obtain informed consent. See, e.g., <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>387 Mass. 152, 155 (1982) (\u201ca physician owes to his patient the duty to disclose in a reasonable manner all significant medical information that the physician possesses or reasonably should possess that is material to an intelligent decision by the patient whether to undergo a proposed procedure\u201d). But there is nothing in the record to suggest that any negligence by Petros, even if proved, concerns any entrepreneurial or business aspect of his medical practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Darviris argues, for the first time here, that Petros\u2019s failure to obtain her informed consent to perform a hemorrhoidectomy constitutes a violation of G. L. c. 93A, because the surgery may have resulted in his financial gain, and therefore \u201crelates\u201d to the entrepreneurial aspect of his medical practice. Assuming the argument is not waived, there is nothing to suggest that Petros performed a hemorrhoidectomy as opposed to a fissurectomy for his own financial gain. There are doubtless numerous circumstances in which a physician selects to perform one, rather than a different and less expensive, procedure \u2014 or no treatment at all. The selection may constitute medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>malpractice. But unless a patient can demonstrate that the physician selected the treatment solely for his or her financial benefit \u2014 and there is nothing to suggest any such motivation on the part of Petros \u2014 evidence that the treatment was more costly than another or no treatment at all is insufficient to establish an unfair or deceptive practice claim. Cf. <em>Karlin </em>v. <em>IVF Am., Inc., supra </em>at 293-294 (consumer protection claims viable where health care provider undertook misleading advertising campaign to promote medical procedure to prospective patients). The facts established by Darviris, viewed in their light most favorable to her, indicate no more than the possible negligent delivery of medical care to a particular patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The plaintiff points to 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3) to argue that even if her surgeon were merely negligent in failing to obtain her consent to perform a hemorrhoidectomy, a G. L. c. 93A claim is still viable. That regulation, promulgated by the Attorney General pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (c), states, in relevant part, that \u201can act or practice <em>is </em>a violation of [G. L. c. 93A] if . . . [i]t fails to comply with existing statutes, rules, regulations or laws, meant for the protection of the public\u2019s health, safety, or welfare . . .\u201d (emphasis added). General Laws c. Ill, \u00a7 70E, which requires physicians to provide their patients with the right \u201cto informed consent to the extent provided by law,\u201d is such a statute, Darviris argues, and every violation of that statute constitutes a violation of G. L. c. 93A. See 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3). This argument is also unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">As we noted in <em>American Shooting Sports Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>429 Mass. 871, 875 (1999), G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (c), \u201climits the Attorney General\u2019s rule-making power to be within the concepts of deception or unfairness, as guided by administrative and judicial interpretation of the [Federal Trade Commission] Act.\u201d While medical professionals are not exempt from all regulation under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(1) (2000), see <em>Gadson </em>v. <em>Newman, supra </em>at 1418, that act has been applied only to commercial aspect of medical practice. See <em>Federal Trade Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Indiana Fed\u2019n of Dentists, </em>476 U.S. 447 (1986) (action against dental association for forbidding its members to submit dental X-rays to dental insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ers); <em>American Med. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>638 F.2d 443 (1980), aff'd, 455 U.S. 676 (1982) (action against American Medical Association for enforcing restraints on advertising, solicitation, and contract practices by physicians). Further, \u201cthe Attorney General\u2019s power continues to exist unless the promulgated regulations conflict with the legislative scheme, or the area is one as to which the Legislature has expressly or implicitly covered the field in a way which precludes further remediation by regulation under G. L. c. 93A\u201d (citations omitted). <em>American Shooting Sports Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 881. See <em>Cabot Corp. </em>v. <em>Baddour, </em>394 Mass. 720, 725-726 (1985) (no G. L. c. 93A claims by defrauded purchaser of securities because Uniform Securities Act was intended to provide comprehensive regulation of securities field).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We believe that application of 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3) to the type of negligence based claims made in this case is one such circumstance, as we now explain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">General Laws c. Ill, \u00a7 70E, guarantees to patients the right to informed consent \u201cto the extent provided by law.\u201d That statute provides that any patient whose statutory right is violated \u201cmay bring, in addition to any other action allowed by law or regulation, a civil action under [G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 60B-60E].\u201d The latter enumerated sections of G. L. c. 231 comprise aspects of the medical malpractice act, St. 1986, c. 351 (act), a comprehensive statute enacted by the Legislature in 1986, to avert a growing crisis in the medical profession occasioned by the \u201cburgeoning cost of malpractice insurance.\u201d <em>McGuiggan </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>398 Mass. 152, 163 (1986) (Lynch, L, concurring). The act is an exhaustive statutory scheme governing medical malpractice claims, and requires (among other things) that actions be heard first by a tribunal, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B; prohibits plaintiffs from including claims for specific monetary amounts in their complaints, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60C; shortens the statute of limitations period for minors, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D; requires specification and itemization in damages awards, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60F; establishes a collateral benefits rule, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G; and limits recovery for pain and suffering, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60H. The act also provides that \u201c[a]ctions of contract or tort for malpractice, error or mistake against physicians . . . shall be commenced only within three years after the cause of action accrues.\u201d St. 1986, c. 351, \u00a7 30. The comprehensiveness of the statute convinces us that the Legislature \u201ccovered the field\u201d of medical malpractice litigation when it enacted St. 1986, c. 351. See <em>American Shooting Sports Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 881; <em>Cabot Corp. </em>v. <em>Baddour, supra </em>at 725-726.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u201cThe performance of a surgical procedure by a physician without the patient\u2019s consent constitutes professional misconduct, is malpractice within G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, and is subject to the procedures established by this statute.\u201d <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr., supra </em>at 154. Allowing a plaintiff to restate a claim, otherwise subject to the medical malpractice act, as a violation of G. L. c. 93A, would undermine the careful policy choices articulated by the Legislature. As expressly relevant to this case, the act has a three-year statute of limitations, St. 1986, c. 351, \u00a7 30, while actions under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, are subject to a four-year statute of limitations. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A. And while the act permits compensatory damages and does not authorize punitive damages, see <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 165, 178 (2000), G. L. c. 93A encourages multiple damages which \u201care essentially punitive in nature.\u201d <em>McEvoy Travel Bur., Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 717 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(1990). Expanding the scope of damages available to plaintiffs who are the victims of medical malpractice, and the period within which to make such claims, is contrary to the express intent of the Legislature in enacting St. 1986, c. 351. See <em>McGuiggan </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 163 (Lynch, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">While this is sufficient to resolve the plaintiff\u2019s claim with respect to the applicability of 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3), to her case, we also agree with the Appeals Court that the Legislature\u2019s specificity in drafting G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70F (which requires informed consent for HTLV-III testing and expressly allows a cause of action under G. L. c. 93A), further supports our conclusion that a violation of G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E, may in some cases constitute a violation of G. L. c. 93A, but is not a violation of G. L. c. 93A where the claim is one of negligent medical malpractice. Just as a claim for the negligent delivery of medical care cannot independently state a cause of action as an unfair or deceptive act under G. L. c. 93A, neither can such a claim state a cause of action under G. L. c. 93A by operation of 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">3. <em>Remaining claims. </em>The Superior Court judge determined that the plaintiff\u2019s remaining claims, and her husband\u2019s claim for loss of consortium, were barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The Appeals Court affirmed those rulings. <em>Darviris </em>v. <em>Petros, supra </em>at 326-327, 331.

Those cases do not stand for the proposition that medical malpractice actions may be brought under G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Darviris </em>v. Petros, 59 Mass.

Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3) is invalid as applied to the defendant\u2019s alleged violation of G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E, we need not decide whether the regulation is facially valid. We note, however, that the regulation, which states that violations of G. L. c. 93A include any failure to \u201ccomply with existing statutes, rules, regulations or laws, meant for the protection of the public\u2019s health, safety, or welfare,\u201d could be interpreted to include a violation of any statute in the Commonwealth. See <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub.
